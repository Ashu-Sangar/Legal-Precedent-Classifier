Collins and wife, Margaret E. Collins, the use plaintiff, on March 28, 1891, for the consideration of the sum of six hundred and seventy-five dollars. Six hundred dollars of the purchase money was paid in cash, and the balance by this judgment. Execution was issued on the judgment on October 28, 1892, and on January 6, 1893, on the petition of the defendant this rule was granted and the writ stayed.</p>

      <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>“ The reason alleged for the opening of the judgment is that the husband of plaintiff had warranted the title to the land to be free of liens and incumbrances, and that since the defendant has discovered that the former grantors of this property, Isaac Lebo and Amanda, his wife, had conveyed to John Hildebrand by a certain deed, of date June 27, 1884, a tract of twenty-six acres and one hundred and seventeen perches, in which the tract of five acres and ten perches was included as a part of said larger tract, and that said Hildebrand sold and reconveyed the whole tract to said Amanda Lebo on August 22, 1885, and on the same day received a certain mortgage of two thousand five hundred and thirty dollars from her and her husband, which was recorded in the recorder’s office at Lancaster, on October 13, 1885, upon which a judgment was procured, a writ of levari facias issued and the tract sold by the sheriff to Hildebrand.</p>

The only paper between them on record is the mortgage, which, however, mentions the fact of the conveyance from Lebo and wife to Hildebrand by the deed dated June 27, 1884.</p>

Collins, plaintiff, dated Dec. 3, 1890, for the same premises was also recorded and entered on Dec. 8, 1890.</p>

Morrow, therein cited, Lowkie, J., says: ‘ Purchasers ought to know that they have only a conditional title dependent on the honesty of their vendors, so long as they neglect to record their deeds. They are not safe, merely because of the neglect of a former purchaser to record within six months, and there being no subsequent deed to oppose them, but because among several deceived purchasers they are first to obey the law.’</p>

The mortgage to Hildebrand, it will be observed, is given by Amanda Lebo and not by Isaac Lebo, her husband, on the wife’s title to the land. When Aaron, the defendant, purchased the property, he was not bound, upon an examination of the title of his grantor, to look beyond Lebo’s title. Mrs. Lebo’s mortgage was undoubtedly intended to act as a lien upon the land, and would have had such force and effect had the deed of Lebo and wife been duly recorded.</p>

Morgan, 2 Binney, 502, was to protect innocent purchasers from suffering by the fraud or neglect of those who had obtained prior conveyances from the same person, and omitted to have them recorded. If unrecorded deeds of this kind were to prevail against subsequent purchasers, no human prudence would be sufficient to guard against imposition, because the title submitted to the examination of the last purchaser, independent of the unrecorded deed, would be perfect.</p>
