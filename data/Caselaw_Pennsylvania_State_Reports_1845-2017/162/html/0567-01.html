Douglass did not possess a sound and disposing mind, memory and understanding, sufficient to enable her to make a valid will.

The paper writings admitted to probate as the last will and testament of Sarah J. Douglass, deceased, by the register of wills, and by him produced and filed in this court in obedience to a citation issued therefor, have attached to them the affidavits of the subscribing witnesses, with the decree of the register admitting the papers to probate, and the memorandum of the grant of letters testamentary thereon, all bearing date and purporting to have been done on August 30,1888. The proceeding seems to have been entirely regular in form and substance. If it was not so, if the witnesses did not attend, or were not sworn, or were incompetent, or if the register was derelict in the performance of any official duty, this should have been shown by competent legal evidence; and for that purpose the register himself or his deputy or the subscribing witnesses might have been called. But none of this was done. Instead of proving, in the manner indicated, what was actually done at and about the probate, the appellants proved certain unsworn and unofficial declarations of the register to certain witnesses as to the time when he attached the probate to the will, and then, by the same witnesses, that, at periods subsequent to the date of the alleged probate, they saw the will and it had no probate attached to it, and from this and the fact that the exemplification of the will, <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>furnished by the register to Andrew A. Douglass, dated August 30, 1888, contains no copy of the probate, they ask the inference to be drawn that the papers were not legally proven. Of course this cannot be done. The unsworn declarations of the register were not evidence for any purpose, and the other testimony does not support the inference sought to be drawn from it. This branch of the case may be dismissed with the remark that there is no legal evidence to support the averment that the will was not legally proven before being admitted to probate, and of course no ground for granting an issue to try that fact.</p>

On the other hand the subscribing witnesses, two of the most capable and reputable members of our bar, men distinguished for probity, and disinterested in this controversjq except as counsel for Samuel M. Fulton who is the executor and proponent of the will and a devisee under it, testify that they were personally present and saw and heard the testatrix sign, seal, publish and declare this will and codicil as and for her last will and testament, and that they, at her request, subscribed their names thereto as witnesses. It is obvious that the overwhelming weight of this testimony is in favor of the genuineness of the signatures, and that a verdict against the will on that ground would be set aside in a moment.

Such <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>opinions are always admissible and tbeir weight depends largely on the intelligence of the witness, the opportunities of observation, the extent of the intercourse, and especially the facts and circumstances detailed in the evidence on which the opinion is based.</p>

There is in it an entire absence of proof of imbecility or delusion, or incapacity to transact business, or of anything from which the existence of brain deterioration, or mental disease, could be fairly inferred; and certainly no proof of want of testamentary capacity. And the medical testimony does not help the appellants’ case; for Dr. Meals, the only medical witness on that side who testified from actual personal observation, made in 1885, declined to express the opinion that she then had brain disease or mental infirmity; and, even under the urgency of counsel, would go no further than to say that some of her symptoms were those of paresis; but distinctly refused to say that she was then incompetent to make a will. And it is in evidence that, after that date, she administered upon and settled up two estates, and that she continued to attend to business, make contracts, pay bills, draw checks, etc., up to near the time of her death. The whole of the testimony on this subject adduced by the appellants may be true, and be entirely consistent with the possession of full testamentary capacity by this testatrix; and if any doubt existed, the evidence adduced on the other side would entirely remove it. The subscribing witnesses who were her legal counsel for three years before her death, and had exceptionally good opportunities to observe her business capability, say that she possessed unusual capacity. The testimony of Dr. Curran, the attending physician, taking it for what little it may be worth under 'the circumstances surrounding the testimony, and in view of the foolish and contradictory talk in which he admitted that he had indulged on this subject, is on the side of testamentary capacity. The other witnesses on the subject, called by proponents, were mainly those who had business dealings with testatrix, and thus had more or less <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>opportunity to observe her business methods and capacity; and some whose intercourse with her was of a social character. The former class gave her the character of a capable, close, shrewd and careful business woman, while the latter failed to discover any evidence of mental alienation. In the written argument submitted by the learned counsel for appellants, great stress is laid on the alleged fact that appellees did not call in testatrix’s friends and neighbors to prove her sane, “ fifty of whom,” says the learned counsel, “ could have proved her sanity if it be a fact.” This is in curious forgetfulness of the principle that places the burden of proof on appellants. If there be so great a cloud of witnesses with sufficient knowledge and intercourse with testatrix to qualify them to testify on this subject, their absence is much more conspicuous on appellants’ than on appellees’ side of the case.</p>

The petition does not disclose the names of the person or persons supposed to have exercised tlie influence complained of, but the evidence shows that Samuel M. Fulton was the person meant. He is the executor of the will, and one of the proponents of it, and a devisee and legatee to the extent of about $10,000. He was a near neighbor of the testatrix, and for some years before her death managed her farms and attended to other business foi' her, and was so doing at the date of the alleged will and codicil. But the evidence very clearly indicates that a large part of her business was transacted by herself, sometimes with but oftener without his aid. The relation between them is not shown to have been any more confidential than that of employer and employee usually and necessarily is, and the intercourse is <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>nofc shown to have been unusually intimate or frequent. That Mr. Fulton enjoyed her confidence is rather inferable from the continuance of the business relation between them than from anything else in the testimony, and he is not shown by anything in the evidence to have exercised any controlling influence over her in anything. But the most remarkable, the controlling and decisive circumstance in the case, is the entire absence of any evidence connecting Samuel M. Fulton in any way with the making of this will, either by agency, procurement, suggestion, persuasion, solicitation, presence at, or knowledge of its execution. While mere solicitation or persuasion, not carried to undue length, are insufficient to avoid a will, still if Fulton had been connected, in the way indicated, with the making of this will or codicil, there might have been some force in the contention that the relation existing between him and Miss Douglass was so far confidential as to shift the burden upon the beneficiary of proving full knowledge and unbiased disposition in the testatrix. But in the absence of such proof connecting the beneficiary with the act of testating, a much more confidential relation than exists in this case has been held insufficient to shift the burden of proof from those who allege undue influence: Miller v. Oestrich, <a href="/citations/?q=157%20Pa.%20265" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="157 Pa. 265">157 Pa. 265</a>; Herster v. Herster, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20Pa.%20259" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="122 Pa. 259">122 Pa. 259</a>. In the latter case, the person alleged to have exercised the influence which secured the execution of the will, was testator’s son, who lived with the testator, was intrusted with all his business, and admittedly occupied a confidential relation to him, and under the will took nearly the whole of a large estate to the exclusion of brothers and sisters. ‘It is said,’ says Mr. Justice Clark, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, ‘that Jackson Herster stood in a confidential relation to testator, that he was his son and to some extent interested in his business, but he was not present at the making of the will, nor does it appear that it was made by counsel at his procurement.

This they have entirely failed to do by any evidence on which a verdict could be supported; and hence there is no ground for granting an issue to try that fact.</p>

Permitting or procuring her to sign in ignorance of the true character and effect of the papers would have been a crime which cannot be inferred, but must be proven. The well known integrity of the subscribing witnesses, who were Miss Douglass’s counsel, affords the amplest guarantee that nothing of the sort was attempted with their knowledge. And their professional ability afforded her ample protection against any such attempts if made on the part of anybody else; of which, however, there is not the slightest evidence.</p>

A considerable part of the appellants’ evidence was certainly out of time, and much of it probably irrelevant and otherwise incompetent. It seemed best in deciding the case to treat it all as competent, and rule on the effect of it.</p>

But an examination of the cases will show that in most if not all in which such proof was made, enough had been proven by the contestants of the will to shift the burden onto the proponents. That stage of this case was never reached. The appellants’ proof never attained the point at which the burden shifted upon the proponents of making anything more than formal proof of execution.</p>
