The husbands of the women were driving in an open buggy in advance of their wives. The men crossed the track, and the horse in the other carriage was approaching very close to it, when the flagman ran out and waved his lantern in front of the horse, thereby frightening it, and causing it to overturn the carriage, and injure one of the occupants. The husbands and the two women testified that they neither saw nor heard nor had any knowledge of an approaching train. The women testified that the flagman waved for them to cross.

I have consulted with my brethren on the subject and we are of the opinion that this is a case in which the verdict ought to be for the defendant; that there is no evidence of negligence on the part of this railroad company; that the accident was one of those unforeseeable and unavoidable accidents which will sometimes occur, and that persons who suffer injury from such accidents must bear their own losses. It is not a case of injury resulting from negligence of the watchman of the railroad company, but from the fright of the horse and his running away. Taking the case of the plaintiff as it is given by her witnesses, it shows that the watchman in the performance of his duty threw up his hands to stop her at a point of danger, and if the horse took fright and ran off and hurt her in consequence thereof, the horse was frightened by the- watchman in the performance of his duty. Certainly there wa&amp; no fault of the railroad company or its employees.</p>

Therefore, in this case your verdict will be for the defendant.” Verdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.</p>

There was no negligence alleged, or proved, in the running of the train, and there was no collision on the railroad. The fright of the horse was alleged by the plaintiff to have been occasioned by the act of warning by the flagman to prevent the ladies from driving across the main line immediately in front of an approaching train, and it was founded upon the <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>negative testimony of the two husbands that they did not hear or see any train either approaching before the accident, or at rest at the station, after the accident. Charity requires that their testimony on this subject should be regarded as the result of the very high state of excitement into which they were naturally thrown by the occurrence of the accident. It was serious enough to distract the thoughts and the attention of the most self-possessed and cool-headed persons. As for the feebly pressed contention that there was no train there it is simply preposterous, because all the affirmative testimony in the case, including that of the plaintiff’s disinterested witnesses, proved in the clearest and most indubitable manner, not only that there was an approaching train, but that it arrived, and stopped, and stood still, at the station, in full view of the husbands of the ladies, instantly after the happening of the accident. Thus the plaintiff’s witness, Burgess Hoffman, testified: “I was sitting there (on the porch of the Junction House) and I saw a carriage standing on one side and a carriage standing on the other; it stood there I suppose for a minute, as near as I could tell, and I saw the flagman come over waving his light from his box, and the ladies drive over, and as they got in front of the railroad, from here to that table, he threw his lantern right up in the horse’s face, and that scared the horse and the horse shied off and ran up the Doylestown track through that branch there, and came over the Doylestown platform. That is where the accident happened. . . . Q. You say the train arrived shortly after or pretty soon after the horse ran over the platform? A. Yes, sir; I heard the signal myself. Q. What train ? A. An east train. Q. That is, you heard the whistle blown ? A. I heard a whistle blown. . . . Q. You say you heard that whistle blown? A. Yes, sir. Q. Where was the wagon when the whistle was blown ? A. The flagman then came across from his box waving his lantern and the ladies then started to come across. . . . Q. How long do you think it was before the train came that morning after the horse had run off this wuiy ? A. It might have been a minute. Q. You cannot give the time definitely ? A. No, sir; I couldn’t give the timó definitely.”</p>

On cross-examination he further testified : “ Q. While sitting there you heard the whistle of the train blown ? A. Yes, sir. Q. When you heard the whistle blown where were the two men (the husbands) ? A. They were on the opposite side of me. I mean on the opposite side of the street from where I was. Q. They did cross over on the tracks ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Where were the two women ? A. The women at that time were on the other side, when the flagman walked out. Q. When you heard the whistle blow, the men had got over the main line ; had crossed over all the tracks ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Where were the women ; had they crossed over the Doylestown track ? A. When the whistle blew I don’t think they had. I think they only started to come. Q. You were sitting on this hotel porch? A. Yes, sir. Q. The men were over ? A. Yes, sir. Q. And the whistle blew that the train was coming ? A. The whistle blew that the train was coming below Broad street. Q. The women had not yet started to cross over the Doylestown track ? A. No, sir; the flagman then came out. When the flagman came out with his lantern the women started to come on. . . . Q. When that whistle blew, they had not started to cross the track, had they? A. They had about started 1 think. The flagman came over and they about started with the flagman. When the flagman started they started. Q. All the time they were moving along this Main street the train was coming on the track, was it not ? A. The train was coming on the track ; I suppose so or it would not have blown. Q. The flagman immediately after the whistle blew came out ? . A. He was out. Q. He came out into the street ? A. Towards the street, yes, sir. Q. When they got to this point almost on the track, then it was he turned around and threw up the lantern, and then it was that the horse turned ? A. When the ladies got to the point of crossing the road, as close as Í am to you, he was right up to them, or closer a good deal, then he turned around and appeared to be surprised and threw up his hands with the lantern.

To the same effect is the testimony of Frank W. Dickinson, another witness for defendant. He was on the ground at the time of the accident. He was asked: “ Q. What did you see and what did you hear ? A. Just as I was crossing between the Doylestown track and the main north bound track I heard the whistle blow. Q. That is while you were in the bed of Main street? A. Yes, sir; on Main street between the Doylestown branch and the main line. Q. You heard a whistle blown ? A. Yes, sir; I passed over and as I looked down I saw the train very close. I had to hurry to cross. As I looked around I saw the horse rear, and by that the train cut my view.”</p>

I paid no attention to the railroad nor to the team. I heard a train coming and I looked up, and as I looked I saw the train was very near Main street, and as I looked up I saw the train, and the instant I looked up I looked where Mr. Bloom was and he was at his post giving the signal for danger. By that time he turned around and kind of raised his hands, and by that time the horse ran to his right and ran over the Doylestown platform and tore away from the carriage and threw these ladies out. Q. When the horse started to turn around where was the train? A. It might have been one hundred feet more orless from Main street. Q. It was approaching Main street ? A. Yes, sir. . . . It was all in an instant, my looking up and the train coming, and I looked where Bloom was and he was at his station and by that time the horse turned to his right and ran away.

I couldn’t say exactly where, but in the middle of the street facing the main line; and when I heard that yell I looked up and I saw the horse rear around and I saw Bloom the flagman turn around, and just at that time the train passed along. ...

Any way there was a train came along and it came so suddenly that I couldn’t be positive -what did happen. The first thing I saw the horse turned around to the right and ran up on the Doylestown platform and threw the ladies out and tore loose from the wagon and ran up Walnut street. Q.

The case had been tried before and had resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff which had been set aside as being contrary to the evidence. The trial judge consulted with his colleagues and all were of opinion that there was no proof of negligence on the part of the defendant, that the injury was caused by the fright of the horse, and that the fright of the horse resulted from the action of the flagman in his effort to keep the horse from going on the track. They were also of the opinion that upon plaintiff’s own testimony the flagman was strictly in the line of his duty in his attempt to stop the wagon, and was not responsible for the manner of his effort, even upon the theory that he was waving them to come on, and was not waving them to stop, as he alleged. Upon the whole testimony the court below was of opinion that there could be no <em>recovery </em>under the evidence, and hence if a verdict for the plaintiff should be rendered it would have been their duty to set it aside. In such cases, as we have many times held, it is the duty of the court to direct a verdict for the defendant.</p>

      <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>In considering this subject it must be observed that there was only one question in the case, and that is whether the effort of the flagman to stop the wagon was an act of negligence? If it was not there is no ground of recovery. It is perfectly manifest that, upon a just review of the testimony, the peril of the women was immediate, that it threatened their lives, that it was of sudden origin and that the most extreme measures were necessary to avert it. The testimony of the women and their husbands is of no assistance in solving the question. They all say that they heard no whistle, saw no train, and had no knowledge of the approach of a train. Their testimoity is all negative and proves nothing against the entire bulk of all the rest of the testimony, both of the plaintiff and the defendant. If they neither heard nor saw, nor had any knowledge of an immediately approaching train, they have no qualification to speak or judge of the act of the flagman. To them with only their means of knowledge his act was simply an unnecessary act and therefore indefensible. It is for this reason that their testimony is of no value in considering the flagman’s act. The entire mass of the testimony, on both sides, that was founded upon actual knowledge of the real facts of the situation, proves everything that was necessary, to not otdy justify the flagman’s act, but to demand it most imperatively, and to convict him of the grossest, indeed, criminal negligence, if he had not done just what he did do. He knew suddenly what he and the other witnesses knew by the evidence of their senses, that a train was rapidly approaching the crossing, that the wagon if not stopped would in another instant be upon the track, and that three human lives would be in the most imminent peril. Of course it was his bounden duty to stop, instantly, the further progress of the horse by any means and at all hazards. There was no time to stop and consider about methods, for the delay of a few seconds might, and probably would, prove fatal. On this subject there was no contrariety in the evidence. Two witnesses for the plaintiff and twelve witnesses for the defendant testify to all the facts which establish the reality, the imminence and the suddenness of the impending danger. And on this subject which is the vital matter in controversy there is no contradiction in the testimony of the women and their husbands. For they, concurring quite en<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>tirely in their account of the actual facts of the accident itself, to wit, the act of the flagman, the rearing of the horse, his turning and running upon the platform and throwing out the occupants of the wagon, do not contradict the other witnesses, when they say they heard no whistle, saw no train, and had no knowledge of the presence of a train on the crossing or at the station. The fact that they neither saw nor heard these things does not at all disprove the fact that others did see them. There were very good reasons why all these things might occur and yet they be inattentive and fail to hear or see them. They were the immediate persons involved in the catastrophe. The whole force of their consciousness would naturally be absorbed by the vivid and intense incidents of the perilous situation. Hence there is no real contradiction in the whole mass of the testimony upon the vital facts which affect the character of the flagman’s act. That it was essential to be done, that the occasion was one of extreme urgency, that no reflection upon methods was safe or was even eligible, are conclusions which immediately result upon a mere inspection of the testimony. They prove incontestably that the act of the flagman was in no sense a negligent act but an imperative duty. The functions of a jury are not needed to determine the rights of the parties in such a situation. The law determines them because the fundamental fact of negligence is absent from the case. Whether the act of the flagman be viewed as a matter of fact only, or whether it be regarded in its legal aspect as something done upon an emergency and therefore not a subject of criticism as to its methods, the result is the same. -For the law wisely holds that an act done upon a sudden emergency when life is apparently in peril, is not negligent, even though it is mistaken. Such is the long established rule of the law frequently enforced by this court.</p>

Said Gojrdon, J., in delivering the opinion: “Under such circumstances as these we cannot agree that a mistake in judgment is an act of care<a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>lessness.

Further reference to authorities is unnecessary. On the whole case we are clearly of opinion that it was rightly determined by the learned court below. The contention that the signal given by the flagman was an invitation to the women to come on is foreign to the vital question of the cause. The women testified that they so regarded it, but the flagman and others said it was a signal of danger. But it is immaterial which it was, since it would^ have bee.n just as much the duty of the flagman to stop them, whether he had previously signaled them to come on or not.</p>
