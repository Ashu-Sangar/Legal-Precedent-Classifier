On Dec. 5, 1892, Coslett made an application to the court of common pleas to be allowed to take an appeal in forma pauperis, and a rule was granted. Subsequently the court discharged the rule, making the following order: “ Now, Jan. 7, 1892, the rule is discharged and Geo.. W. Coslett is allowed three days from this date in which to perfect his appeal.” On Jan. 10, 1893, Coslett took an appeal from the award of arbitrators. He paid all the costs to the prothonotary, excepting $8.39, fees of D. J. Gallagher, constable, which were paid directly to the constable. The following receipt for these fees appeared upon the record: “ Jan. 10, 1893. Received from Geo. W. Coslett my fees in full for serving 1st rule and subp. D. J. Gallagher.”</p>

So, charging the costs to the attorney in the case, is not a good payment: Carr v. McGovern, <a href="/pa/66/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="66 Pa. 457" data-case-ids="432488" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0457-01">66 Pa. 457</a>; even though the prothonotary be indebted to the attorney in a greater sum: Lagen v.

In the former, the plaintiff, who was the party appealing, in lieu of part payment in cash, filed receipts of the defendant’s witnesses for their fees. The court below, Ingham, P.
