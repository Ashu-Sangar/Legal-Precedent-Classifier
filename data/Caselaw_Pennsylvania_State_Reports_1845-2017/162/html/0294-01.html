The plaintiff, on June 28,1882, while solicitor for the county of Lancaster, had been employed by resolution of its board of commissioners, to obtain from the commonwealth, in favor of said county, a credit settlement for overpaid taxes, upon a stipulated contingency of 25 per cent to cover his own compensation and all expenses. In November, 1882, the, claim was rejected, and, on the first Monday of January, 1883, the plaintiff’s term of office expired. After June 13, 1883, he, in conjunction with Mr. Hensel, again endeavored to obtain a settlement. • These efforts were successful. On May 1, 1884, a credit was allowed to the county of $2,560. The plaintiff rendered his bill to it for 25 per cent of that amount, ‘as per resolution of the board,’ and received $640. On June 18,1887. a further credit was settled in favor of the county for $20,823.50. The plaintiff demanded payment to him Of 25 per cent of this amount, but was refused. He thereupon brought suit against the county, based upon the contract evidenced by the resolution of June 28, 1882. The trial took place in Chester county, resulting in a verdict for <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>plaintiff for the full amount of his claim with interest. Judgment entered thereupon was, however, reversed by the Supreme Court, on the ground (1) that, the prosecution of the claim of the county against the state being within the sphere of the county solicitor’s duty, for the performance of which a fixed salary was appointed by law, a contract between him and the county for additional compensation for such services was void and illegal, and incapable of ratification after the expiration of his term of office; and (2) that there was no pretence of any new agreement subsequently made, on which, under the pleadings and evidence, the recovery could be sustained: Lancaster Co. v. Fulton, <a href="/pa/128/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="128 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="567105" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0048-01">128 Pa. 48</a>. Thereupon the plaintiff brought this suit to recover a reasonable .compensation for services rendered to defendant, at its instance, request and employment, subsequently to the first Monday in January, 1883, in obtaining a credit settlement of $20,823.50 from the commonwealth in favor of said county, alleging an assumption on the part of the latter to pay him for said services the sum of $5,205.87]?. This assumption he has sought to establish, at this trial, by evidence that, on June 13, 1883, the then county commissioners made a new contract with him, whereby he was to secure the services of Mr. Hensel, as eounsel for the county, in conjunction with him, to renew and push the claim rejected in November, 1882, and in the contingency of success to receive 25 per cent upon the amount of the settlement to be allowed, out of which he was to pay all expenses and compensate Mr. Hensel.</p>

As to the amount, which, in the event of that right being made out, would be a fair compensation, the evidence, all on the side of the plaintiff, indicated an allowance of 25 per cent as reasonable and proper. The ease was submitted to the jury under a charge by no means favorable to the plaintiff, a point submitted by defendant as to the existence of any evidence of a contract other than that of June 28, 1882, being reserved under the authority of Chandler v. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/88/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="88 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1061155" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0223-01">88 Pa. 223</a>; Koons v. Telegr.

The issue as to whether the contract of June 28, 1882, was terminated, abandoned, and a new contract entered into, is not one to which the equitable rules concerning evidence to vary, add to, or alter a written agreement apply: Holloway v. Frick, <a href="/pa/149/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="149 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="832612" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0178-01">149 Pa. 178</a>. The evidence adduced on the affirmative of that issue is partly circumstantial and partly direct. In so far as it is the latter, it consists of the testimony of the plaintiff himself. He affirms the fact of a meeting between himself and the.board of commissioners on June 13,1883, and narrates what took place. He says that he stated to them what he had done during the previous year, and that he had not been successful, that he had failed. This declaration, if it was made by him as testified, was capable of being regarded as a surrender of his employment under the resolution of June 28, 1882, and the commissioners were at liberty to consider their relation with the plaintiff under the contract evidenced by that resolution at an end, even supposing it to have been a legally binding one. ‘ I then told them,’ he continues, ‘ that I desired to take in associate counsel; I told them, that if they would agree to it, I would associate Mr. Hensel with me in the prosecution of the claim against the commonwealth.’ That is to say, if the former part of his statement is to be understood as a declaration that his efforts were exhausted, his employment terminated, he nevertheless desired to be re-engaged on condition that Mr. Hensel be secured to co-operate with him. ‘ They were favorable,’ he says, ‘ to the proposition, and asked upon what terms the services of Mr. Hensel could be procured. I said to them: “You pay me 25 per cent of the amount collected from the commonwealth, and I will compensate Mr. Hensel; this to be in full for all costs and expenses, as well as all fees.” They agreed to do it and authorized me to go ahead,’ etc. If this is true, and the true construction of what precedes it is as above indicated, then we have here an unequivocal assertion of the making of a new contract, upon specified terms, on June 18,1883. What was said and done, what was intended by what was said and done, are questions of fact for the jury: Forrest v. Nelson, <a href="/pa/108/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="108 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="539268" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0481-01">108 Pa. 481</a>, 488; Maynes v.

      <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>“ But there is more than this. Being asked by defendant’s counsel concerning the payment of $640 on May 1, 1884: ‘Was that paid to you in pursuance of your contract of June 28, 1882,’ the plaintiff says: ‘I suppose it was paid to me in pursuance — I know it was paid to me in pursuance of an agreement that we had, that they made with me by which I was to retain Mr. Hensel,’ etc. ‘Q. Was it obtained from them under your contract of June 28, 1882? A. I say no, it was not.’ Defendant’s counsel contend that this goes for naught, being the expression of a mere opinion. I think not. In Bank v. Kennedy, <a href="/us/84/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="17 Wall. 19" data-case-ids="62435,62444" data-case-paths="/us/84/0019-01,/us/84/0019-02">17 Wall. 19</a>, it was held competent to ask a witness who was a party to a transaction, and was present and was cognizant of the circumstances, on whose behalf a payment was made, whether it was made in consequence of a request, and what was its purpose and intent; and in Brunner v. T. &amp; T. Co., <a href="/pa/151/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="151 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="836667" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0447-01">151 Pa. 447</a>, our Supreme Court reversed because of the exclusion of an interrogatory as to the purpose with which an act was done by the deponent, and whether it was done in pursuance and in the line of his employment, which was ‘ the precise point to be settled.’ But, no matter whether this testimony would have been competent in chief or not, the questions which elicited it and which were so framed as to invite it, to be incapable of any other style of answer, were put upon cross-examination by defendant’s counsel. An objection like this, therefore, comes with ill grace and is erntitled to no consideration. Further on in his cross-examination; the plaintiff, in answer to a question whether there was a new agreement in May, 1883, says: ‘No, sir; June 13, 1883, there was an agreement made, by which I was to employ Mr. Hensel.’ Again, referring to a period subsequent to the trial in Chester county, during which plaintiff explains he did not happen to think of the transaction of June 13, 1883, he says: ‘I then recollected that we did really have a new agreement, that of June 13, 1883;’ and, in answer to the question, ‘What else had you in your mind as the basis of your claim ’— ‘. . . . the fact that on June 13, 1883, they entered into an additional agreement, another agreement, by which,’ etc., concerning the transaction of the same day: ‘ The county commissioners agreed with me that I should retain Mf. Hensel and they would pay me 25 per cent.’ It is needless to multiply extracts <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>from his testimony, more or less pointedly asserting the conclusion of a new contract on June 13, 1883.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b323-3" data-blocks='[["BL_323.5",323,[148,476,1177,1638]]]'>“Among the circumstances which corroborate him, one, at least, is worthy of special mention. The plaintiff, it is very clear, had no idea that the contract of June 28, 1882, was invalid, either as a contract for extra compensation or as a contract for a percentage. Apart from its invalidity, he had, under it, a perfect right to employ in his aid any lawyer or set of lawyers in Lancaster or elsewhere. He was assured a commission of 25 per cent in full of his services and all expenses. It was a matter of no concern to the county of Lancaster whether he should alone do the work and alone enjoy the reward, or whether, out of the commission secured him, he should pay any one else to do the work for him. Why, then, if that contract continued in force, is he found to go before the board and ask authority to employ Mr. Hensel, without asking for any increase of compensation ? It is said that mere policy and courtesy towards his clients would have prompted him to inform the latter of his intention to associate other counsel with himself. But that is not what he did, if his testimony is to be believed. He asked them for a distinct agreement, binding upon himself as well as upon them, and obtained it. It is certainly not permissible to resist an obvious natural inference from the act of a party to the point of treating the same as a silly, unnatural work of supererogation. Viewed in connection with his previous statement to the commissioners that his efforts had failed, the claim been rejected, the natural inference from the act of the plaintiff now under discussion is, that he intended to be done with the old employment, and to start upon a new one in conjunction with Mr. Hensel. The natural inference from the fact that the commissioners inquired into the matter of compensation is that they so understood the situation; otherwise, if the old contract was to continue, they were not concerned upon that subject.</p>

The question is, Does it, as a whole, consist with or oppose the presumption ? — not, Does this or that portion of it, omitting the rest, do the one or the other? Applying this test, it is idle to say that the testimony adverted to, taken, as it must be, for true, does not tend to refute the presumption mentioned. True, there was <em>(a) </em>direct testimony to the contrary; there were <em>(b) </em>circumstances developed whose apparent tendency was, in my opinion at the time, very strongly adverse to the plaintiff’s theory; and there was <em>(e) </em>evidence of previous statements and affidavits of the plaintiff himself, which, to say the least, required explanation.</p>

That there cannot, as a matter of law, be a new, independent contract between the same parties, touching the same subject, having in view the accomplishment of the same ultimate object, and stipulating for the same compensation, is a proposition for which no warrant has been shown in judicial decisions or in common sense. Moreover, whilst I was of a different opinion at the trial, I think it would be difficult to establish such an identity between the contract of June 28, 1882, and that testified to as having been made on June 13, 1883. Two contracts cannot be identical in terms where the consideration is different, where the parties contract in different capacities, and where the stipulated payment is different. The consideration for the compensation in the contract of June 28,1882, was a service to be rendered by the plaintiff which he was bound to render without compensation, and therefore no consideration. The consideration in the contract of June 13, 1883, was (a) the rendition of services which he was under no duty to render, and (6) the procuring, at his expense, for the benefit of the county, of the services of another gentleman who was not bound to render them gratuitously. The capacity in which the plaintiff became a party to the contract of June 28, 1882, of which he could not divest himself in dealing with the county, and which, therefore, rendered the relation attempted to be assumed by him by virtue of the contract illegal and the basis of no valid claim, was that of county solic<a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>itor. The capacity in which he became a partjr to the contract of June 13, 1883, was that simply of an attorney at law, an employment of whom by the county, with the incident of liability to compensation, was altogether lawful: Chester Co. v.

The reward stipulated in the contract of June 28, 1882, was 25 per cent payable to the plaintiff. He might, it is true, have employed assistance. But the county knew him only in the matter. Under the contract of June 13, 1883, he was obliged to procure the services of Mr. Hensel. The county virtually engaged both of these gentlemen, merely leaving the details of the arrangement with Mr. Hensel to the plaintiff. A reward of 25 per cent was agreed upon as compensation for both of them, to be paid, in the first instance, to the plaintiff. No one will doubt that, in the practical result to the plaintiff, the terms of this arrangement will be found to differ from what was contemplated by the contract of 1882. But, apart from that, a promise to pay a certain sum to one person is not the same thing as a promise to pay the same sum to two persons. Thus, as the case is now presented, there is not that analogy between its appearance and Hunter v. Nolf, <a href="/pa/71/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="71 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1031274" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0282-01">supra,</a> which was pointed out by Mr. Justice Sterrett in Lancaster Co. v. Fulton, <a href="/pa/128/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="128 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="567105" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0048-01">supra,</a> under the facts then developed. In Hunter v. Nolf, not only were the parties literally the same,’ and the terms identical, in the original illegal and in the alleged new contracts, but the consideration upon which both were based, and which gave rise to the illegality, continued the same. I cannot, therefore, look upon that case as applicable to the present one to the extent of forbidding, as a matter of law, tire treatment of the contract of June 13, 1883, as something new, different from and independent of that of June 28, 1882, and untainted by its weakness. The question whether or not it was such was one of fact for the jury.</p>

It is a mistake to treat those statements as part of his testimony at the trial of the latter, or as rendering that testimony inconsistent or contradictory. If there were any such confusions pointed out in what he swore to at this trial, it would have been the province of the jury to settle the doubt arising therefrom: Kohler v. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/135/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="135 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="817455" data-case-paths="/pa/135/0346-01">135 Pa. 346</a>, 357. A <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>fortiori must this be so where the doubt arises from contradictory statements made upon previous occasions, not repeated at this trial, but admitted as having been made, and attempted to be explained. It was decided in Callan v. Lukens, <a href="/pa/89/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="89 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1063233" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0134-01">89 Pa. 134</a>, that a supplemental affidavit of defence is not insufficient simply because it sets up a new and different defence from that made in the original affidavit, however suspicious such a performance may be. Now, it is an elementary rule concerning affidavits of defence, that, in order to be sufficient, they must show a defence which is permissible and which a jury may consider : Hendel v. R. F. A. Ass’n, 2 Dist. R. 116, and cases there cited. It follows that testimony in support of an allegation inconsistent with one previously made is nevertheless proper for submission to the jury, the discrediting effect of the former version being a matter for its determination.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b327-3" data-blocks='[["BL_327.4",327,[167,1138,1169,604]]]'>“ I am thus led to the conclusion that the principal question submitted to the jury was in the case, and that it could not have been withdrawn from the jury by the court without invading the province of the former. There was, therefore, a basis for an inference favorable to the plaintiff’s contention. It may have been a pretty narrow one. I am disposed, on a review of the testimony, to think it was ample. But, whether it was a sufficient basis was for the jury, and its conclusion being eonscionable, the verdict cannot be ignored or disturbed upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence upon the question under discussion: Brunner v. T. &amp; T. Co., per Williams, J.</p>

The time has gone by, in this state, when a charge might be convicted of error by selecting detached phrases or sentences and subjecting them to a subtle criticism: Smith v. Meldren, <a href="/pa/107/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="107 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="8857700" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0348-01">107 Pa. 348</a>, 352; Nevling v.

Taking this charge as.a whole, it may well be that, had the result been unfavorable to the plaintiff, he would have had good cause of complaint. But no error has been pointed out prejudicial to the defendant. There is nothing in the allegation that the charge authorized the jury to compensate the plaintiff for services rendered before June 13, 1883; that they must be supposed to have done so; that those services having been rendered under the contract of J une 28, 1882, <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>and incapable of compensation, the claim for them was illegal; that this, claim being part and parcel of the entire demand, its illegality, under Spaulding v.

It is sufficient to say that the jury, having been told that the claim was for services rendered subsequently to the expiration of plaintiff’s term of office, which ended on.the second Monday of January, 1883, was distinctly instructed that all services were to be taken to have been rendered under the contract of June 28, 1882, and irrecoverable, unless and until' a new contract was shown, and that there was no evidence of such except what was alleged to have occurred on June 13, 1883. Moreover, it was testified that all the valuable services were rendered and all the effective work done after that date.”</p>

The plaintiff alleges, and positively testifies, that on June 13, 1883, and several months after his relation as county solicitor had ceased, he made a new contract with the county commissioners for the rendition of his services in the prosecution of the claim of the defendant for the collection of overpaid taxes. He describes in his testimony what took place at that time. He said: “I stated to the board of county commissioners, — there was a full board in session, Myers, Summy and Hildebrand, Myers was president of the board, — I stated to them that my efforts before the board of revenue commissioners of the commonwealth, and before the board of public accounts had not been successful; I stated that I had endeavored to <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>have a law passed authorizing suits against the commonwealth by counties to recover this money, and endeavored to have another bill passed authorizing the board of public accounts to give credit settlements in cases like ours, but I had failed. I then told them that I desired to take in associate counsel; I told them that, if they would agree to it, I would associate Mr. Henselwith me in the prosecution of the claim against the commonwealth. They were favorable to the proposition and asked ' upon what terms the services of Mr. Hensel could be procured. I said to them : ‘You paj&gt;- me 25 per cent of the amount collected from the commonwealth and I will compensate Mr. Hensel; this is to be in full for all costs and expenses as well as all fees ; this if we recovered, and we would make no charge if nothing was recovered.’ Q. What, if anything, did they or any of them say to you in response to that proposition? A. They agreed to do it and authorized me to go ahead and engage Mr. Hensel, and that I should have 25 per cent of the amount collected, and I should compensate Mr. Hensel and pay all costs and expenses.”</p>

The learned judge of the court below very carefully instructed the jury that there could be no recovery upon the contract made on June 28, 1882, because of the plaintiff’s relation as county solicitor at that time. And he also most cautiously and clearly instructed them that there could be no recovery except upon a contract made after January, 1883, and only for services rendered in pursuance of such contract. He called the attention of the jury to the conflict of testimony upon this important subject and correctly instructed them as to their duties in such a state of the evidence. It is impossible for us to say that there was any error in all this. The testimony of the plaintiff was direct, positive, explicit, minute and emphatic. The court could not possiMy withdraw it from the jury, but was bound to submit it to them. This was done in a perfectly fail' and impartial manner of which no complaint has been, or could be, made. The jury has found for the plaintiff and has thereby declared their belief in his testimony, as they had a perfect right to do. They are the sole judges of the credibility of witnesses as we have said very many times, and it is not in our <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>power to defeat their verdict upon any theory that they should have believed differently. The very elaborate and exhaustive opinion of the learned court below, on the rules for a new trial and to enter judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto, is a perfect vindication of the action of the court on the trial and is a satisfactory exposition of the case on its merits of law and fact. We discover no error in any of the assignments and must therefore affirm the judgment.</p>
