There is no question for the jury to determine, whether this contract is under the laws of Pennsylvania or not. The court say to you, and the jury will take the law from the court, that this is a Maryland contract under the law placed here in evidence, concerning which there is no dispute. We say further to you that the place of sale is the point at which goods ordered or purchased are set apart; and delivered to the purchaser, or to a common carrier, who, for the purpose of delivery, represents him. For example, a merchant in New York orders goods from a Boston house and they are consigned thence to him either by a carrier of his own selection, or in the usual course of trade, the transaction is an executed Boston contract. So that if a letter is sent from Reading to Baltimore ordering tobacco, as in this case, as appears by the letters in evidence, that would be a contract in Baltimore to be determined and settled by the laws of Maryland.” [1]</p>

Kent says (vol. 2. p. 505, 12th ed.) : ‘ If no place be designated by the contract the general rule is that the articles sold are to be delivered at the place where they are at the time of the sale. The store of the merchant, the shop of the manufacturer or mechanic, and the farm or granary of the farmer at which the commodities sold are deposited or kept, must be the place where the demand and delivery are to be made, when the contract is to pay upon demand and is silent as to the place.’ ” In the footnote (10) to the foregoing text the writer says: “ The place of delivery is that place where the goods are at the time of sale,” and in support of this proposition a number of authorities are cited and commented upon.</p>

In such circumstances it cannot be said that the parties were both in Pennsylvania at the time the contract was made. As the goods sold were physically in the state of Maryland, and the sellers lived there, and furnished the goods there, and completed the sale there by a delivery to a common carrier there, consigned to the purchaser in Reading, the contract was a Maryland contract and must be governed by the law of that state so far as the question at issue here is concerned.'</p>
    <p id="b349-3" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[145,1100,1169,608]]]'>Proof was made on the trial as to what the law of Maryland is on the subject in controversy here, and we do not understand there is any dispute as to that matter. It was found by the jury upon the testimony and under the charge, and is therefore settled so far as the contention here is concerned. It is different from the law of Pennsylvania in that if the purchaser buys goods knowing his insolvency, and having no reasonable expectation of paying for the goods purchased, the purchase is void and does not pass the title. This feature would not be sufficient to avoid the sale in Pennsylvania unless there was also some trick, artifice or deception used to accomplish the purchase.</p>
    <p id="b349-4" data-blocks='[["BL_349.5",349,[145,1717,1169,452]]]'>The question whether Frame was insolvent, and knew that he was insolvent, and had no reasonable expectation of being able to pay for the goods at the time they were ordered, was of course a question for the jury, which was carefully and correctly submitted to them by the learned court below. There was ample testimony in the case to support the plaintiffs’ allegations in this respect, and it does not require any mention from us. We think the case was correctly tried and we dismiss all the assignments of error.</p>
