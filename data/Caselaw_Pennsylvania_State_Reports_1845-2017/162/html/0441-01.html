Smith, payee, one of the firm of Smith &amp; Russel, upon the understanding that the money was to be used in paying wages due by the firm. The note was signed “Smith &amp; Russel” and indorsed “William B. Smith.” John J. Ridgway, president of plaintiff company, testified as follows: “William B. Smith, of the firm of Russel &amp; Smith, <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>brought a note and asked whether the company would loan him $1,000 and he would see that it was returned. I think it was in the early part of the week and that they were not able to pay wages.” He also testified on cross-examination: “Q, Why did you take it drawn to William B. Smith? I don’t know, but he wanted the loan and we made it.”</p>

Ridgway, the president of the company. Wm. B. Smith requested the loan for the purpose of paying Avages due by the firm of which he was a member. While the loan ivas doubtless made as a favor to him, it was for the business of the firm, and to the firm, and the firm note Avas taken. The note was not brought to Mr. Ridgway for discount, but Avritten by him after the needs of the firm had been made known, and in carrying out his intention to loan to it. There was nothing connected with the negotiation to suggest an improper use of the firm name, or to put the plaintiff upon inquiry.</p>
