The Supreme Court decided that the accounting should be as of December 31,1880. The plaintiff received none of the profits since that date, and should not be charged with any of the losses.’</p>

There was no evidence that they ever agreed to guarantee the amount; the only obligation they were under was to liquidate these assets to the best advantage. That in doing this the loss occurred subsequent to December 31,1880, does not invalidate their right to have the advantage of it. The learned master seems to base his refusal to recognize the loss incurred in the liquidation, because the accounting was to be of December 31, 1880; But as the loss which had occurred did not arise from any transaction subsequent to that date, it seems to us it should havei been considered and allowed. The deficiency in the item Of bridge contract appears to have amounted to $35,305.70, which should be deducted from the surcharge. So also the loss on the book accounts, $5,019.58. So that the defendants would appear to have been surcharged with $40,325.28 for assets which they could not realize.</p>

The mortgage under which this property was sold was a mortgage upon a factory in full operation, and, as the master has found, expressly covered real estate, steam engine, boilers, machinery, appurtenances, and all its franchises. That all things used in the factory which are part of the machinery necessary in the process of manufacture are fixtures, and covered by a mortgage of this character, and transferred to a purchaser by a sale under it, cannot be doubted. The question whether an article claimed under the sale is a fixture is not to be determined by the mode of bookkeeping of the person who is sold out, but by expert testimony. In the present case, after the purchase of everj^thing covered by the mortgage, the defendants purchased the tools, which were appraised and valued at $80,000. Subsequent examination, it is alleged, however, made it appear that of this $80,000, $60,119.05 were not ‘ tools,’ but really ‘ fixtures.’ Of course, if that were so, the defendants would really have paid twice for the same thing. They therefore transferred to themselves that amount as having come to them under the sale.</p>

The defendants’ witness produced a list of articles, being tools, which he stated might or might not have formed this $60,119.05; but he was unable to prove that the articles mentioned in that list were the articles appropriated by defendants, and, in fact, stated it was only a theory or mere supposition on his part, and that he could ascertain nothing in reference thereto at the works.’</p>

He was subjected to an examination of great length, in which he elaborately stated what was contained in the machinery account, and why they were all properly applicable to that account to an amount exceeding $60,119.05. As there appears to have been no contradiction of his statement, we think it cannot be said that it does notappear of what the items consisted, or that they were not appropriated by defendants. The master may well have overlooked this testimony in the great mass of matter presented to him ; but a careful reading of it, we think, shows conclusively that it covers all the objections made by him to its allowance as a credit.</p>

In an elaborate opinion by our brother Mitchell, fully considering and disposing of the numerous questions then presented, etc., it was held that appellant was entitled to an account, and the decree was accordingly reversed and the record remitted with instructions that sai.d account be stated upon the principles clearly and concisely set forth in the conclusion <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>of said opinion. Shortly afterwards the case was referred to the learned master who stated an account and reported the same to the court in May, 1893, with form of decree in favor of plaintiff for $75,896.60. To that report numerous exceptions were filed by the defendants, fifteen of which were sustained by the court and a decree entered in favor of the plaintiff for $2,746.67, from which the present appeal was taken.</p>

The learned judge of the common pleas evidently considered the questions involved with great care; and, in recasting the account, in accordance with his own conclusions, he appears to have adhered as closely as possible to the principles upon which we said the account should be stated. The subject-matters of difference between him and the learned master relate mainly to the following general items of account: (1) The alleged excess of assets over liabilities, as of December 31, 1880, amounting to $46,468.56; <em>(2) </em>the alleged balance due by the defendants, Clark and Sellers, $22,595.52; and (3) value of tools alleged not to have been accounted for, $60,119.05. Each of these is of course composed of numerous minor items, some of which involved considerable labor in the examination of statements of account, exhibits, etc. As the result of a careful examination of these three general items, the learned judge has clearly and distinctly pointed out grave errors in each of them. It is not our purpose, nor do we deem it necessary to consider them in detail. To do so, would require more time than we can possibly command, and involve an amount of purely clerical labor which in the end would be practically useless.</p>

    <p id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.7",465,[183,496,1169,407]]]'>Both parties having appealed, the two cases were argued together. From an examination of the record, in connection with the specifications of error in each case, we are satisfied that neither of the appeals should be sustained. The decree is substantially correct, and in the plaintiff’s appeal, No. 163, January Term, 1894, it has been affirmed on the opinion of the court below. That practically disposes of this appeal; and it is accordingly dismissed with costs to be paid by appellants.</p>
