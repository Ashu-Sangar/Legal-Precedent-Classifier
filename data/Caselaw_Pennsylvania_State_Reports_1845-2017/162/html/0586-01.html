If the time of death were certain, and the rate of interest determined, there would be no-difficulty ; then the present value of the amount to be paid at death, diminished by the amount of the present value of all the premiums to be paid, would give the value. But.the time of death is uncertain, and hence the present value of the running policy must always be speculative and uncertain.’ And after discussing the mode of determining this value, the conclusion is arrived at¿that the net value of the policies, without regard to the health of the holder, and calculated as of the date of the dissolution of the corporation, according to the tables of mortality used in the business of life insurance, less the outstanding premium notes, if any, fixes the true value!</p>

An order drawn upon one who has in his hands funds belonging to the drawer will not of itself amount to the assignment of the fund or any part of it, unless it plainly appears that the fund claimed was one designated out of which payment was to be made. If- a debtor appropriates particular moneys to pay a certain debt, and it is as far delivered as the nature of the case will admit of, equity will control the appropriation, but if the act of appropriation is uncertain, or the subject-matter doubtful, the right of property in the fund is unchanged.’ And in 3 Pom. Eq. Jur. 1284, it is said: ‘ An ordinary bill of exchange or draft drawn generally and not upon any particular fund, whether accepted or not by the drawee, does not operate as an equitable assignment. Its operation is not changed even when funds have been placed in the drawee’s hands as a means of payment.’</p>

But manifestly she can do neither. No fund is specified in the draft, and there are absolutely no indicia by which any fund can be designated or followed.

The argument on their behalf concedes that the rule adopted by the auditors is correct when applied to policies still running at the date when the proofs were taken; but it is contended that this is at best a calculation of chances which is adopted from the necessity of the case, and that it should not be' used where at the time it is applied the data for the ascertainment of the exact value of the policies were furnished by the death of the assured. There have been cases decided in New York and in England in which the rule contended for was adopted ; among others, People v. Security Life Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=78%20N.Y.%20180" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="78 N.Y. 180">78 N. Y. 180</a>, and Craig’s Case, L. R. 9 Eq. 711. In the first case, Eabx, J., delivering the opinion of the court, said: ‘ This company was dissolved and a receiver appointed December 14, 1876; Thomas J. Lockwood, holding a life policy upon which the' premium had been paid, died March 15,1877. . . . The referee allowed the beneficiary only the reserve value of his policy at the date of the dissolution of the company, computed in the same way as the value of running policies were computed, disregarding entirely the fact of the subsequent death of the assured. In this he erred. The claimant was entitled to be allowed as his damage the value of this policy. There is no statute regulating how such value as between the receiver and the claimant shall be determined. <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>The rules by which the referee determines the value of running policies will not in all cases do justice. In some cases they may give the claimant more damage than he has sustained, and in other cases less. In their general application, however, they will work out results sufficiently accurate for judicial action. In general they furnish the only practicable basis of computation, and hence are sanctioned. But these rules adopted from the necessity of the case should not be used where, upon facts existing, the precise value of the policy may be easily ascertained. Their use is not then justified by any necessity or considerations of convenience. Here the whole premium had been paid, and at the time the claim was presented the precise value of the policy at the time of the dissolution could easily be shown. It was free from uncertainty or speculation. . . . There can be no embarrassment in allowing the valuation of such policies to be computed in this way where the death occurs and the proofs of death are furnished at any time before-the expiration of the time for presenting claims.’</p>

It is not a question between the receiver and the claimant. The receiver is no party to the litigation, and has no interest in it. He would not be heard on exceptions to the report of the auditors, or on appeal to the Supreme Court. It is a proceeding to marshal and distribute the assets of the insolvent corporation, and the parties to it are the several claimants, who-are parties adverse whenever their interests clash, as they do if they belong to different classes. Hence their relative equities are involved, and the rights of one class cannot be determined without considering those of all other classes.</p>

If the corporation at that date had paid the claims according to that value tbe legal damage for tbe breach of contract would have been paid. On the other hand, if the net value of the policies still running had been calculated as of the date when the audit was held as damages on each, it would in each case have been different from the amount arrived at by calculating it as of the date of the dissolution. This brings into view the inequality, and, therefore, want of equity, which would result from calculating the damages as of different dates, even if the calculations were in other respects made in the same manner; and the inequality would be still greater where not only the date was different, but where the expectation of life, according to the tables, was. taken in some cases, and a fixed date, ascertained by the prior accident of death, was adopted in others.</p>

But if the damages are calculated by using data afterwards furnished by the death of the assured in particular cases, the amount, as is shown above, is different from that suffered at the date when the breach of contract occurred, and a value is fixed, as of that date, upon the policy, different from its actual value at that date. This being so, we think it would be inequitable to allow the amount to be fixed in that way, and that equity requires the same rule to be applied to all policies which were running at the date of dissolution, without regard to the fact that some have since matured by the death of the assured <em>; </em>and we do not base our conclusion on the act of 1873 (Purd. 904, sec. 6), but on the general principles of equity.</p>
