The country through which this stream flows is of limestone formation, and as is usual in such formations contains fissures and crevices through which <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>running streams flow underground for indefinite distances. During high water Mill run has a well defined surface course from the city to and across appellee’s lands. In low water, after Dry Gap run joins Mill run, the latter flows as a surface stream for several hundred yards, then sinks through crevices in the earth and continues underground for some distance, then emerges and flows upon the surface again, and again sinks and re-emerges at irregular intervals before it reaches appellee’s springs and flows across his farm. In its somewhat tortuous course from the junction of Dry Gap run to appellee’s springs it passes over and through, in the manner above stated, lands owned by persons in the order following: Baker’s heirs, Kinsel, Beamey, Kinsel again, and then appellee. Previous to its pollution by sewage its waters were pure and wholesome; and it is a mountain stream of varying volume according as the season is dry or wet. Some thirty years before the trial of this case it was discovered that washing ore in Mill run, on the Baker farm, near Altoona, discolored the water in appellee’s springs and rendered it unfit for use; sawdust also was found in the springs at an early day, when a sawmill was in operation on Baker’s land along Mill run; and the height of the water in the springs depended upon that in Mill run, and whenever a freshet occurred, increasing the flow in the run, it washed the sewage accumulated in the underground channel into the springs and overflowed the run upon appellee’s land, leaving the filth deposited there.</p>

It was there said: <em>“It </em>will be observed that the defendant has done nothing to change the character of the water or to diminish its purity, save what results from the natural use and enjoyment of their own property. They have brought nothing on to the land artificially. The water as it flowed into Meadow brook is the water which the mine naturally discharges; its impurities arise from natural and not artificial causes.” And the decisions in Howell v.
