If the two houses were built by Hugh Stewart prior to 1802, and he conveyed the house now owned by the plaintiff, retaining the other, and at that time the cellar and attic projected as hereinbefore described into the house so retained by him, it seems clear that he and his grantees could not controvert the right of the plaintiff and his grantees to keep the house and its appurtenances in the same condition as when conveyed. If the houses were built subsequently to the year 1802, then, in the construction of the plaintiff’s house and the making of the cellar, there was an intrusion upon the defendant’s land, and the testimony is undisputed that, for at least thirty-seven years, the plaintiff and those under whom he claims have occupied the cellar and attic so far as they extended into and over the defendant’s ground, and that they have occupied them continuously and exclusively and as parts of the dwelling house on the plaintiff’s land.
