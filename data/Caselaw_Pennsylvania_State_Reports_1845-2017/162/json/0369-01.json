        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nThe testatrix wrote, \u201c the residue of my estate is to be divided between my husband\u2019s grand children and the children of Ferdinand Poree.\u201d Did she mean that the fifteen grandchildren should take one half, and the four Porees the other half, or did she mean a division per capita, one nineteenth to each ?\nThe word \u201c between \u201d refers properly to two, and not more. It is.true that it is not unfrequently used, especially by the uneducated, and colloquially, in the sense of \u201c among,\u201d as referring to more than two objects. But that admittedly is not its correct use. The presumption is in favor of the proper and correct use of words, whether technical or belonging to the language of ordinary life. If we rest on this presumption the distribution of the residuary estate into two parts was right.\nIt is conceded that neither group of beneficiaries could have inherited from the testatrix, and we therefore get no light from the analogy of the intestate law, nor are there proved any family relations or other special circumstances which can be taken into consideration as guides to actual intent. We come back therefore to the presumption as to the meaning of the words, unless we find something in the will itself that shows their use in a different sense.\nIt is said that the popular use of \u201cbetween\u201d by the uneducated is in the sense of \u201c among,\u201d and that the testatrix was illiterate. The auditor reports however that she \u201c was a woman of education and refinement,\u201d though the will itself would not indicate education either in spelling or grammar. That however is far from conclusive, as there are many people of fair education who never acquire the habit of correct spelling, and as to the grammar the faultiness in that respect may be accounted for, as well as the very confused and disorderly arrangement of the bequests, by the suggestion of the learned judge below, that this will was made carelessly and intended at first as a mere memorandum. But if we concede that the testatrix was illiterate, it would not follow that she-used the word incorrectly. The great mass of the words even of illiterate persons are used correctly. The lapses are only occasional, or the language would cease to serve the purposes of communication. Illiteracy therefore raises no presumption that words are used incorrectly. At most it lets in the conjecture that they may be. That is the utmost effect that it could have here. We can suppose or guess that the testatrix may have meant \u201c among,\u201d but even that guess becomes highly improbable when we note that, in the clause preceding the one in question, she uses the word \u201c among \u201d with entire accuracy, directing her \u201c linen to be divided among the grandchildren,\u201d and follows this immediately by the direction that the residue of her estate shall be divided not \u201c among \u201d but \u201c between \u201d the grandchildren and the children of Ferdinand Poree.\nAgain it is said that the prior parts of the will show that when the testatrix desired to make a division per stirpes she knew how to do so, and almost invariably used the words \u201c one portion \u201d or \u201c one share,\u201d and if that had been her intention in regard to the residue she would have been likely to use the same phrase. But that is a two-edged argument, for the same parts of the will show also that when she intended a per capita division, she made it plain by the expression \u201c share and share alike.\u201d\nOn a general view of the whole will we see no ground on which to give the word \u201c between \u201d any other than its proper meaning, and according to that the grandchildren of Gen. Ihrie are one class, taking half, and the children of Ferdinand Poree another class taking the other half of the residuary estate.\nAs wills, like contracts, are to be construed according to the. actual intent of the maker, as ascertained from his words, precedents are of comparatively little value, but illustrations in accord with the views herein expressed will be found in Young\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 59; Osburn\u2019s Appeal, 104 Pa. 637, and Green\u2019s Est., 140 Pa. 253.\nDecree affirmed.\nMr. Justice Green dissents.",

Leary\u2019s Appeal.\nWills \u2014 Bequests\u2014Per stirpes and per capita \u2014 \u201c Between.\u201d\nIn the interpretation of wills, the presumption is in favor of the proper and correct use of words, whether technical or belonging to the language of ordinary life. Illiteracy raises no presumption that words are used incorrectly. At most it lets in the conjecture that they may be. In the absence of anything in the will itself to show the use of a word in a different sense, the correct use of the word will prevail, although the word is not infrequently used, by the uneducated and colloquially, in a different sense.\nWhere a testator provides that the residue of her estate is to be divided \u201c between \u201d her husband\u2019s grandchildren and the children of another, the presumption is in favor of the word \u201cbetween,\u201d referring to two, and not to more in the sense of \u201camong,\u201d and the residuary estate is correctly distributed in two parts per stirpes.\nWills like contracts are to be construed according to the actual intent of the maker, as ascertained from his words.\nArgued March 8, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 383, Jan.

Fox, Esq., was appointed auditor to distribute. He divided the residuary estate per capita, holding that \u201c between \u201d meant \u201c among,\u201d citing Cent. Diet., \u201c Between,\u201d \u201cAmong\u201d and \u201cDivide;\u201d Webster Dict., \u201cBetween;\u201d Hicks\u2019s Est., 134 Pa. 507; Yohe v. Barnet, 3 W. & S. 81; McNeilledge v.

J.\nErrors assigned were sustaining exceptions, quoting them.\nRussell C. Stewart, George Ross with him, for appellants,\ncited, in addition to the cases relied upon by the auditor: Weston v.
