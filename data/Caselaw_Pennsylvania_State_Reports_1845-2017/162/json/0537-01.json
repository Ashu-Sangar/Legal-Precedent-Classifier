In view of the evidence, it would have been impossible for them to have found otherwise. There is nothing in either of the specifications of error that would justify us in disturbing the verdict.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Issac H. Kreider v. Lancaster, Elizabethtown and Middletown Turnpike Co., Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Turnpike \u2014 Evidence\u2014Contributory negligence \u2014 Presumption.\nIn an action against a turnpike road company to recover damages for personal injuries, it is proper to submit the case to the jury where there is evidence that plaintiff, on a dark night while traveling on defendant\u2019s road, drove over an embankment in the road at a point where a summer road was depressed from two to four feet below the level of the macadamized portion of the turnpike.\nArgued May 14, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 42, Jan. T., 1894, by defendant, from judgment of O. P. Lancaster Co., March T., 1892, No. 112, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Livingston, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that, on the night of Dec. 3, 1891, plaintiff, while traveling along defendant\u2019s turnpike in a buggy, drove over an embankment in the road at a point where a summer road was depressed along the side of the macadamized portion of the turnpike. The height of the embankment was variously estimated at from two and one half to four feet. \u25a0 The night of the accident was in the dark of the moon but the stars were shining. Plaintiff in describing the accident testified : \u201c The wheel just seemed to me as if it was going in a deep rut on the left hand side. . . . When I first got in, it seemed as if I was in a deep rut; when I got a little piece on, if I had pulled the right line there I could have stayed on the pike.\u201d Several witnesses testified that the road was dangerous at the point where the accident occurred. Plaintiff was not familiar with the road.\nThe court charged in part as follows :\n\u201c [But where a man finds himself suddenly placed in a dangerous position by the negligence of another, without his fault, and in order to extricate himself from such danger, not having time to deliberate and judge the best way of so doing, happens to select a method of doing so which was not the best, and which, if he had time to consider, he might not have taken, the law would not impute to Mm contributory negligence so readily as if he had time to choose with judgment. All that it requires of him is to do as a prudent man would do under the circumstances. Did this man in endeavoring to extricate himself from this danger do as a careful, prudent man should have done under the circumstances ? This is for your consideration and for you to say. You or I might not have done as he did. It is hard to tell what a prudent man in his situation would have done. The presumption is that the injured party did do what a prudent man would have done under the circumstances in which he found himself placed; and in those courts which do not require plaintiffs to prove by affirmative evidence as part of his case, that he was free from fault, the absence of negligence on his part may be inferred from the love of life or the instincts of self-preservation and the known disposition of men to avoid injury to themselves.] \u201d [8]\nDefendant\u2019s request for binding instruction was refused. [7]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $558.\nErrors assigned were (7. 8) instructions, quoting them.\nEdward P. Brinton, A. E.
