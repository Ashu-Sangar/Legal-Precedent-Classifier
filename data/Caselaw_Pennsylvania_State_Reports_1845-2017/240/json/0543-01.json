    "head_matter": "McClintock\u2019s Estate.\nWills \u2014 Husband and wife \u2014 Claiming against will \u2014 Death of husband prior to election \u2014 Bight of representative to elect.\nThe right of election in a husband or wife to take against the provisions of the will of the other is a personal privilege which perishes with the person, and where such right has not been exercised in the lifetime of the survivor, it does not- accrue to his or her personal representative.\nArgued March 24, 1913.\nAppeal, No. 388, Jan. T., 1912, by Margaretta Magee, Administratrix of Lorenzo D. McClintock, deceased, from decree of O. C. Philadelphia Co., April T., 1912, No. 424, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in estate of Ada B. J. McClintock.\nBefore Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of Dallett, P. J., as follows:\nThe testatrix died April 2, 1911, leaving a will whereby she gave her husband a life interest in certain securities and gave the residue of her estate to strangers. Her husband died April 4, 1911, and at the audit of the account of the administrator c. t. a. of the testatrix\u2019s estate the administratrix of his estate claimed the right to elect on behalf of . his estate to take against his wife\u2019s will. This claim the auditing judge rejected and we think properly.\nThat a widow\u2019s right to elect not to take under her husband\u2019s will is purely personal and dies with her was decided in Crozier\u2019s Appeal (90 Pa. 384) in 1879, and the decision then made has been followed in Jackson\u2019s Appeal (126 Pa. 105) and in Anderson\u2019s Estate (185 Pa. 174).\nThat a husband\u2019s right to elect not to take under his wife\u2019s will is also simply a personal privilege was decided in Fleming\u2019s Estate (217 Pa. 610).\nIt is true that in Fleming\u2019s Estate the question determined concerned merely the right of a creditor to compel a living husband to elect to take against his wife\u2019s will, but there would seem to be no good reason why a distinction should be made and a husband\u2019s rep: resentatives allowed a privilege denied the representatives of a wife.\nAs was said by Mr. Chief Justice Agnew in Clark\u2019s Appeal (79 Pa. 376), after a reference to the acts of assembly :\n\u201cThus the legislature clearly intended to put the husband and wife on a par with each other, as to the power of each to will away property from the other, excepting that, as to the husband\u2019s independent and pre-existing freehold by the curtesy, he might retain it in lieu of any other estate.\u201d :\nThis language was adopted by Mr. Justice MestrezaT in Fleming\u2019s Estate, who also said:\n\u201cWe think that the right of the husband to elect to take against the provisions of his wife\u2019s will is simply a personal privilege and is not an asset for the payment of his debts, or a right which he can be compelled to exercise so as to discharge his trust liabilities. Every sane person of lawful age in this Commonwealth has a right to dispose of his property by will, and the policy of the law is to encourage the exercise of that right. A married woman has now the same right as her husband to devise ber property and that right should not be curtailed by the court compelling an unwilling husband to defeat it by an election to take against her will. His action in the premises is optional with him, but if he wishes to respect the last wishes of his wife as well as carry out the manifest policy of the law he refuses to interfere with the disposition which she makes of her property. Aside from any sentimental feeling in the matter, the husband should permit the will to stand, thereby recognizing the right of the wife to determine the disposition of her own property.\u201d\nMay 5, 1913:\nThe administrator of a husband\u2019s estate if clothed with the privilege of electing to take under or against the will of the husband\u2019s deceased wife would, and with propriety, look to the material interests of the estate he represented rather than to the carrying out of the wishes of the dead wife. And the desires of a best intentioned husband would thus be thwarted. This is not the policy of the law.\nThe exceptions are dismissed and the adjudication is confirmed absolutely.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions and confirming adjudication.\nSamuel H. Kirkpatrick, with him Michael J. Donoghue,. for appellant.\nWm. Y. C. Anderson, for appellee, submitted a paper book."
