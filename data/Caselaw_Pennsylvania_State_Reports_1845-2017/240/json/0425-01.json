J., Brown, Mestrezat, Elkin, and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nApril 21, 1913:\nCase stated to determine marketable title to real estate. Before Gillan, P. J.\nFrom the case stated it appeared that on September 7, 1912, Annie E. Yaukey and J. W. Yaukey, her husband, entered into an agreement in writing to sell to Thomas Coffman certain real estate situate in Quincy Township, near Elbrook Station, containing about three acres. Coffman refused to accept a deed and pay the purchase money, alleging that the vendors had no marketable title. It appeared that the vendors claimed title under the will of Jesse Baer, Mrs. Yaukey\u2019s father. The material portion of the will is as follows:\n(4) (Item: I give and bequeath to my daughter Annie E, intermarried with John Will Yaukey during her natural life and at her death, to be equally divided between her heirs of issue the property known as the Railroad property joining Israel Singer and road way between Jacob Harshman and the mill property. Also all crops remaining on said property at my death.)\nThe court entered judgment for the plaintiff for $1,800. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was the judgment of the court.\nCharles Walter, with him Arthur W. Gillan, for appellant.\nButhrauff & Ni\u00e9lelas,-tor appellee."
