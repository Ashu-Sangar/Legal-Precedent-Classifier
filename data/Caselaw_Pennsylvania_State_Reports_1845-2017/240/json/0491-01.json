    "head_matter": "Keech\u2019s Estate.\nWills \u2014 Construction\u2014Legacies\u2014Interest.\n1. The general rule is that if no time be limited in a will for the payment of legacies, interest runs thereon from a year after the testator\u2019s death.\n2. Where, however, a legatee, is a minor child, incapable of supporting himself, interest will be allowed from the death, and where the testator has given a legacy in trust until the beneficiary attains a certain age, he makes such age the limit of incompetency. Until then he will not in the judgment of the testator be capable of prudent management of his bounty, and in such ease interest will be allowed from the death.\n3. Testator by will gave a legacy to each of three children, providing \u201cthey, however, to receive only the income of said one hundred thousand dollars each until they each arrive at the age of thirty years, when they are to be paid the principal, if then living,\u201d with a gift over in the event of the death of the children under certain circumstances, and further providing: \u201cI direct my executors hereinafter named, to properly invest said sum of three hundred thousand dollars which I leave to my said three children, and to pay to them the income thereof till each child reaches the age of thirty years, if they should so long live.\u201d Meld, interest should be allowed on the legacies from the death of the decedent.\nArgued March 31, 1913.\nAppeal, No. 44, Oct. T., 1913, by Isabel Holmes Keech, residuary legatee and devisee, from decree of O. C., Allegheny Co., Sept. T., 1912, No. 134, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in Estate of William H. Keech, deceased.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Potter, Elkin, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication. Hawkins, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThe question involved in this case is whether or not interest runs on legacies given testator\u2019s children. So much of the will as relates to this matter follows:\n\u201cFifth. \u2014 I give and bequeath to each one of my three children, the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, that is to say, one hundred thousand dollars to Theodore David Keech, and a like sum of one hundred thousand dollars to Bessie Irene Keech, and the same amount, or one hundred thousand dollars, to Willis Howard Keech, they, however, to receive only the income of said one, hundred thousand dollars each until they each arrive at the age of thirty years, when they are to be paid the principal, if then living. If any one or mor\u00e9 of my said three children should die before reaching the age of thirty years, unmarried, or without issue or children even if married, the share or the legacy of the child or children dying before the age of thirty years, unmarried, or without issue if married, shall go into my residuary estate. I direct my executors hereinafter named, to properly invest said Slim of three hundred thousand dollars which I leave to my said three children, and to pay to them the income thereof till each child reaches the age of thirty years, if they should so long live.\u201d\nMr. Keech had been divorced and these children sympathizing with their mother went with her and were supported by her. The will was made in November, 1909, and testator died in 1911. The children were all over twenty-one and under thirty when their father died, and two of them are still under thirty.\nThe general rule is conceded that if no time be limited for the payment of legacies, interest runs thereon from a year after testator\u2019s death. What shall constitute a limitation is a question of testamentary intent; and certain exceptions have accordingly arisen which are as firmly established as the statutory rule itself: Flickwir\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 374. An exception of common application is that where the legatee is a minor child of testator, incapable of supporting himself and for whom no special provision is made for maintenance, interest will be allowed on the legacy even though not payable until a future time, as upon the legatee\u2019s attaining full age; and the reason of this exception lies in the father\u2019s natural obligation to maintain \u201cthe helpless being whom he had contributed to bring into the world,\u201d until he could maintain himself: Cooper v. Scott, 62 Pa. 139; Jacoby\u2019s Est., 204 Pa. 188. What shall constitute minority must depend on circumstances. The ordinary rule limits it to twenty-one years; but a rule is well settled that where the law of foreign domicile of a distributee limits it to eighteen, that will control here: Huey\u2019s Est., 1 Grant (Pa.) 51. So where a testator gives a legacy in trust until the beneficiary attains twenty-five, he makes this the limit of incompetency: Milroy v. Milroy, 14 Sim. 48, 55. Until then they will not, in testator\u2019s judgment, be capable of prudent management of his bounty. The creation of a trust implies incompetency in the cestuis que trustent. So far as appears here the facts are not in conflict with testator\u2019s judgment. The admission that since the divorce' the children have been supported by their mother is corroboratory. It has been suggested that the fact of the mother\u2019s support negatives any dependency on the father. But the mother\u2019s support was voluntary. The father\u2019s was the primary liability, and the provision made in his will for these children is his recognition of the fact and the need. The relation of dependency established, the running of interest from testator\u2019s death follows. The case of Jacoby\u2019s Est., 204 Pa. 188, is in point. The bequest was in trust to manage the estate and pay the net income to Mrs. Downs for the education of her children during their minority and then to turn over the principal to them; whereupon the court held them entitled to interest from testator\u2019s death. The need of maintenance presumptively began then; and this explains testator\u2019s purpose. The direction to invest was said in Eichelberger\u2019s Est., 170 Pa. 242, 249, to have nothing to do with the question of postponing the time when the interest begins to run. There may be available securities which will answer the direction, or if not, suitable investments may readily be found. In any event the estate is liable on the death.\nTreating the provision made by the testator for his children as an annuity, the same conclusion follows. The gift here is of net annual income, but the rule is well established that there is no difference between the legal effect of income and annuity in respect of the running of interest. It is text book law that an annuity may be for years: Roper on Wills, 1480, and it therefore embraces the provision made for these children. Being then an annuity, the case falls within this exception to the statutory rule. It is well settled that an annuity commences from testator\u2019s death: Flickwir\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 374, and having been the form of gift chosen by this testator was an expression of intent that interest should run from his death.\nError assigned was the decree of the court dismissing exceptions. ,\nFrank C. McGirr, of Marron & McGirr, for appellant.\nInterest is only allowed from death where the children are minors: Jacoby\u2019s App., 204 Pa. 188; Cooper v. Scott, 62 Pa. 139; Todd\u2019s Est., 237 Pa. 466.\nThe bequests were not annuities: Horton v. Cook, 10 Watts 124; Pearson v. Chase, 10 R. I. 456; Townsend\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 268; Robinson\u2019s Est., 35 Pa. Superior Ct. 192; Cooper v. Scott, 62 Pa. 139; Eyre v. Golding, 5 Binn. 472; Eichelberger\u2019s Est., 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 401.\nTestator\u2019s intention as gathered from his will, and the circumstances of the children\u2019s position towards him as shown by the testimony, negatives the claim of interest from death: Cooper v. Scott, 62 Pa. 139.\nJohn D. Brown, with him John E. Winner, for appellee.\nWhere a legacy is given by a testator to his child or to one towards whom he stands in loco parentis, interest will be allowed from the death of testator: Bowman\u2019s App., 34 Pa. 19; Cooper v. Scott, 62 Pa. 139; Townsend\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 268; Yost\u2019s Est., 134 Pa. 426; Flickwir\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 374; Jacoby\u2019s Est., 204 Pa. 188; Robinson\u2019s Est., 35 Pa. Superior Ct. 192.\nApril 28, 1913:"
