    "head_matter": "Walker\u2019s Estate.\nWills \u2014 Construction\u2014\"Children\u201d used as meaning \"issue.\"\nTestator devised a farm to his son \u201cunder and subject to the payment of the interest of the principal sum of six thousand dollars, which interest is the sum of three hundred and sixty dollars, to Eebecca J. Massey, annually, during her natural life, and at her decease to pay the principal sum to the child or children of my said daughter, Eebecca, in equal shares, and in case my said daughter, Eebecca, should die without living issue, then on that event I order and direct the six thousand dollars shall be paid by said son, Matthias P. Walker, into the hands of my executors hereinafter named, and be divided amongst all my children, their heirs and assigns in equal even shares.\u201d IJpon a contest between a grandchild of decedent\u2019s daughter Eebecca, who had died without leaving other issue, and the children and heirs of Matthias P. Walker, deceased, in whom the farm had vested, it was held by the lower court that the grandchild was entitled to the principal sum out of the land; that the words \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d of Eebecca should not receive a literal interpretation, but should be construed to mean \u201cissue,\u201d particularly as by other portions of the will the testator had given a like sum to each of his other children, and in view of the subsequent language of the will providing for a gift over only if the daughter Eebecca \u201cshould die without living issue\u201d; and that the words \u201cdie without living issue\u201d did not in this case differ in signification from \u201cdie without leaving any issue surviving.\u201d On appeal held no error.\nArgued February 10, 1913.\nAppeal, No. 103, Jan. T., 1912, by Matthias P. Walker, Jr., John O. S. Walker, Nathan R. Walker, Winfield W. Walker, Athalia L. T. W. Kendall and Anna B. McFarland,, from decree of O. C. Chester Co., made January 29, 1912, in Estate of William Walker, deceased.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Elkin, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for citation directed to the heirs of Matthias P. Walker, deceased, to show cause why land descending to them should not be sold for the payment of a legacy. Butler, J., filed the following opinion:\nWilliam Walker died in March, 1873, seized among other property, of a farm containing about, one hundred and thirty-one acres, and by his will devised the same to his son, Matthias P. Walker, at a valuation of $18,000, subject to the following provision: \u201cI give, devis\u00e9 and bequeath the said farm and two wood lots to my son, Matthias P. Walker, under and subject to the payment of the interest of the principal sum of six thousand dollars, which interest is the sum of three hundred and sixty .dollars, to Rebecca J. Massey, annually, during her natural life, and at her decease to pay the principal sum to the child or children of my said daughter, Rebecca, in equal shares, and in case my said daughter, Rebecca, should die without living issue, then in that event I order and direct the six thousand dollars shall be paid by said son, Matthias P. Walker, into the hands of my executors hereinafter named, and be divided amongst all my children, their heirs and assigns in equal even shares.\u201d Matthias P. Walker accepted this devise and paid the interest on the principal sum of $6,000 to Rebecca J. Massey, during her natural life, or to speak accurately, during his life, for he predeceased her. She died on August 24, 1911, leaving no child, but being survived by a granddaughter, Rebecca Massey Griffith. Matthias P. Walker died September 8, 1910, seized of the farm mentioned, leaving as his heirs the respondents, to whom it has descended. Rebecca Massey Griffith, the petitioner, urges that she is entitled to the $6,000, with interest from August 24, 1911, and in this proceeding seeks an order for the sale of the farm to the end that she may secure this money. The respondents contend that as she is not a child but a grandchild of Rebecca J. Massey, her claim is invalid. We are of the opinion that the words child or children should in this case not receive a literal interpretation, for we consider it to be manifest upon a general examination of the will that the words were employed in a broader sense, that the testator did not intend that his other children should have any part of the $6,000, given to his daughter, Rebecca, for life if she left a lineal descendant. To each of his other daughters, he had given $6,000 absolutely, and we think it is clear that he intended the like sum to remain in Rebecca\u2019s line, if possible. If in placing the $6,000 in trust during Rebecca\u2019s life, his primary design had been to protect it for his other children he would have sent it unconditionally to them at her death. Instead of doing this, he provided that it should pass to her child or children, and surely he did not use the word child in a. literal sense, did not mean that if Rebecca left no child, but did leave a grandchild, the $6,000 should be lost to Rebecca?s line, and go to testator\u2019s other children. The intent here to send the share down the daughter\u2019s line is as manifest as was the testator\u2019s purpose in Campbell\u2019s Est., 202 Pa. 459, and equally justifies extending the word child so as to include a grandchild. In the case just named, the testator not only used the word children in the first instance, but repeated it in making the provision over, saying: \u201cProvided, however, that in case of the decease of either or any of my said daughters without leaving any children surviving at the time of her decease, then her share.\u201d The court says: \u201cThe manifest general intent of his will was to send the shares of each of his daughters, respectively, down in the line of her and his blood per stirpes \u2014 \u25a0 if he had said \u2018decease without leaving any issue surviving,\u2019 it would have been beyond question.\u201d In our case, the testator does practically use this language, giving the $6,000 to his other children only in the event that \u201cmy said daughter, Rebecca, should die without living issue.\u201d After careful consideration of the earnest argument of counsel for the respondent to the contrary, we are unable to conclude that the words \u201cdie without living issue\u201d differ at all in signification from \u201cdie without leaving any issue surviving.\u201d\n- We find that the petitioner is entitled to have out of the land vested in the respondents the sum of $6,000 with interest, as here claimed by her.\nCounsel will prepar\u00e9 a decree in accordance with this opinion.\nThe court made a decree requiring the legacy to be paid out of the land. The heirs appealed.\nError assigned was decree of the court.\nClaude L. Roth and A. M. Holding, with them Wm. C. Wilson, for appellants,\ncited: Goodright, lessee of Docking v. Dunham, 1 S.
