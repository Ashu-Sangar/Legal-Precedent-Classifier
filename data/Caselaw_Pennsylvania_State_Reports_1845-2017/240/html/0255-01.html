The deceased was hurt during the course of a bar-room altercation and died a week afterwards; it was con<a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>tended that if the death was due to the alleged actions of the defendant, such actions weré in self-defense and without an intent to do material harm to anyone. It appeared that directly after the altercation the defendant left his home and did not return for nearly two weeks, when he surrendered himself. At the trial, counsel for the defendant claimed that the prisoner’s surrender was the act of an apparently innocent man. In replying to this argument the district attorney used the language complained of. The occurrence is best shown by the following abstract from the record returned to this court: — “Mr. Shea (counsel for the defense)- — We ask that a juror be withdrawn, and we ask that this be put down upon the record; that the district attorney said that there was something that had passed between him and the defendant’s counsel, who does not appear here to defend him, which would lead to his conviction. District Attorney Bigelow- — I did not say that. I say that there are some things that passed in confidence between counsel for the Commonwealth and counsel for the defendant that may not be revealed in the argument of the case. Mr. Shea — I want that explained, that is not the counsel that appears here now. We now ask that a juror be withdrawn. By the Court — We decline to withdraw a. juror and note an exception for the defendant. Mr. Salsburg (counsel for the defendant) — I desire also to have stated the remarks of the district attorney, that certain things occurred between - the counsel representing the defendant, who is not now at the defendant’s table, and the district attorney, that would lead undoubtedly to the conviction of the defendant. District Attorney Bigelow — To which the district attorney replied that he made no such statement. Mr. Salsburg — We ask the court to place upon the record the remarks which the court understood the district attorney to make. By the Court — We decline so to do, but we did not understand the statement to be as stated now.” At the conclusion of the court’s charge counsel <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>for the defense stated, “Before submitting this case we desire to submit this affidavit and make it a part of the record, and also, if you rule against me I want to take an exception and move to withdraw a juror and continue the case.” The affidavit was subscribed to by the three counsel for the defense and was to the effect that the district attorney had used the following language: “I will not say anything about his flight or his return, as there are some things between the defendant’s counsel who is not sitting in this case and the district attorney which if divulged would certainly lead to his conviction.” The district attorney filed an affidavit headed, “My Objectionable Remark,” in which he gave this version of the language he had used: “They argue that his surrender is a token of innocence; that under his counsel’s advice he offered himself without compulsion. It is not for me to say what passed between his counsel (not the counsel at the table of the defendant) and myself, and whether that confidence should or could, secure his acquittal or conviction. But, etc. (here was interrupted.)” After the affidavits were presented the court stated, “Gentlemen of the jury, in view of the fact that counsel has called our attention to it, and in view of the fact that this case, we think, is very plain and simple, and that we have taken already three days to try it, we say. to you that there was nothing said , by counsel that could at all, in our view of it, justify us in withdrawing a juror and continuing the case, and we call your attention now that anything counsel stated with relation to what had been stated before or by another counsel outside of those who are in the case, is, as they say, ultra vires, outside of the case altogether, and we ask you to dismiss that from your mind, the whole of it. You probably would do so, but I,call your attention to it now and ask you to dismiss that from your minds altogether and pay inattention to it; and for that reason we will not withdraw a juror, but will permit you to dispose of this case , as we think you <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>are well able to do, uninfluenced in any way by what has been complained of. The motion is denied, and exception noted for the defendant, and the paper may be filed, as may also the paper prepared by the district attorney, Mr. Bigelow.”</p>

When the district attorney disagreed with counsel for the defense concerning the alleged objectionable language, the latter immediately requested the trial judge to perform his duty in this respect; and when the court declined, counsel proceeded in the appropriate way to protect the prisoner’s interests and secure a review: See Com. v.
