Sherwood as the agent and for the account of Myers; that at the said time Myers “was under agreement with the Real Estate Trust Company, Sallie S.

Houston, deceased, defendants above named, who were then the owners and are still the owners of record of the said land, for the purchase thereof and had paid them on account of said purchase about the sum of $500”; that the purchase price named in the said agreement was $9,600; that Myers completed the purchase of the land on March 3d, 1911, by paying to the said trustees the further sum of $2,700 (which included the sum of $2,500 received from the plaintiff ) and having executed and delivered to them, by George C. Fry, one of the defendants, who acted in the transaction as a straw man for MyerSj a purchase money mortgage for $6,400; that said Fry also executed a deed for said land to said Myers and that the said deeds and said mortgage remain in the <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>possession of said trustees at the request of said Myers and have not been recorded.</p>

The defendant, Myers, has filed a demurrer, inter alia, denying the jurisdiction of a court in equity and asking that the court determine this issue in limine before any proceedings had on the merits of the case. The question of jurisdiction is thus properly raised under the Act of June 7, 1907, P. L. 440, entitled “An act in relation to equitable proceedings wherein it is, or might have been, alleged that there was an adequate remedy at law.” It provides inter alia, that “if a demurrer or answer be filed, averring that the suit should have been brought at law, that issue shall be decided in limine, before a hearing of the cause upon the merits.”</p>

Plaintiff contends that such a trust arises by implication from the appropriation by Myers of plaintiff’s subscription in part payment of the purchase price of the land. The bill avers in the third paragraph thereof that “at said time,” that is, at the time of the receipt of the sum of $2,500 by Sherwood, the agent of Myers for the purpose, Myers was “under agreement” with the owners of the land to purchase it and had already paid them about $500 on account of the transaction. It appears, therefore, that Myers had acquired an equitable interest in the land before the receipt of the plaintiff’s money, and that the said subscription was employed only in making a subsequent payment on account of the price. No resulting trust could arise in favor of the plaintiff under these circumstances.</p>

This case is, therefore, distinguishable from the case of McLaughlin v. Fulton, <a href="/pa/101/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="101 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="500889" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0161-01">101 Pa. 161</a>, cited and relied upon by the plaintiff. In that case a son, having in his hands or under his control money belonging to his mother, purchased a farm, paying $100 of his money as earnest of the bargain, but at the same time relying upon the funds of his mother for the balance of the purchase money and afterwards actually using her money in making payment of the same. Under those facts the court said that the purchaser would “not be permitted to defeat the trust by showing he had acquired a merely inceptive equitable interest by payment of an inconsiderable amount of his own money at the purchase.”</p>
