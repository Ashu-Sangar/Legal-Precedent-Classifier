What shall constitute a limitation is a question of testamentary intent; and certain exceptions have accordingly arisen which are as firmly established as the statutory rule itself: Flickwir’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="136 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="819996" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0374-01">136 Pa. 374</a>. An exception of common application is that where the legatee is a minor child of testator, incapable of supporting himself and for whom no special provision is made for maintenance, interest will be allowed on the legacy even though not payable until a future time, as upon the legatee’s attaining full <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>age; and the reason of this exception lies in the father’s natural obligation to maintain “the helpless being whom he had contributed to bring into the world,” until he could maintain himself: Cooper v. Scott, <a href="/pa/62/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="62 Pa. 139" data-case-ids="1017257" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0139-01">62 Pa. 139</a>; Jacoby’s Est., <a href="/pa/204/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="204 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="927504" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0188-01">204 Pa. 188</a>. What shall constitute minority must depend on circumstances. The ordinary rule limits it to twenty-one years; but a rule is well settled that where the law of foreign domicile of a distributee limits it to eighteen, that will control here: Huey’s Est., <a href="/grant/1/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Grant 51" data-case-ids="225902" data-case-paths="/grant/1/0051-01">1 Grant (Pa.) 51</a>. So where a testator gives a legacy in trust until the beneficiary attains twenty-five, he makes this the limit of incompetency: Milroy v. Milroy, 14 Sim. 48, 55. Until then they will not, in testator’s judgment, be capable of prudent management of his bounty. The creation of a trust implies incompetency in the cestuis que trustent. So far as appears here the facts are not in conflict with testator’s judgment. The admission that since the divorce' the children have been supported by their mother is corroboratory. It has been suggested that the fact of the mother’s support negatives any dependency on the father. But the mother’s support was voluntary. The father’s was the primary liability, and the provision made in his will for these children is his recognition of the fact and the need. The relation of dependency established, the running of interest from testator’s death follows. The case of Jacoby’s Est., <a href="/pa/204/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="204 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="927504" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0188-01">204 Pa. 188</a>, is in point. The bequest was in trust to manage the estate and pay the net income to Mrs. Downs for the education of her children during their minority and then to turn over the principal to them; whereupon the court held them entitled to interest from testator’s death. The need of maintenance presumptively began then; and this explains testator’s purpose. The direction to invest was said in Eichelberger’s Est., <a href="/pa/170/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="170 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="872170" data-case-paths="/pa/170/0242-01">170 Pa. 242</a>, 249, to have nothing to do with the question of postponing the time when the interest begins to run. There may be available securities which will answer the direction, or if not, suit<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>able investments may readily be found. In any event the estate is liable on the death.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[288,477,1153,747]]]'>Treating the provision made by the testator for his children as an annuity, the same conclusion follows. The gift here is of net annual income, but the rule is well established that there is no difference between the legal effect of income and annuity in respect of the running of interest. It is text book law that an annuity may be for years: Roper on Wills, 1480, and it therefore embraces the provision made for these children. Being then an annuity, the case falls within this exception to the statutory rule. It is well settled that an annuity commences from testator’s death: Flickwir’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="136 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="819996" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0374-01">136 Pa. 374</a>, and having been the form of gift chosen by this testator was an expression of intent that interest should run from his death.</p>
