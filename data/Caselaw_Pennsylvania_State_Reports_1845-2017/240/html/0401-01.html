    <p class="summary" id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[750,567,223,26]]]'>THE FACTS.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b430-6" data-blocks='[["BL_430.6",430,[290,647,1147,371]]]'>1. The Northampton Railroad Company was incorporated in 1900 and subsequently, on the 22nd day of September, 1903, became merged into the plaintiff company by virtue of the provisions of the Act of March 22, 1901, P. L. 53. The Bangor and Portland Railroad, previously incorporated, was merged by similar proceedings into the defendant company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b430-7" data-blocks='[["BL_430.7",430,[291,1029,1148,696]]]'>2. Prior to the merger of either aforesaid company they executed the agreement and supplement thereto printed in this answer as Exhibits A and B, providing for a crossing of the tracks of the Bangor and Portland Company at grade by the Northampton Railroad then in course of construction. At that time the Bangor and Portland Railroad, under a prior charter, had been built and in operation many years. The crossing was thereupon installed, has been in use and maintained ever since by the plaintiff company. The agreements to which reference herein is made have no stipulations respecting the subject now in controversy, as stated in the next paragraph.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b430-8" data-blocks='[["BL_430.8",430,[291,1736,1150,698]],["BL_431.1",431,[203,367,1150,374]]]'>3. In March, 1911, the plaintiff was notified by the defendant company that in consequence of its purpose to employ heavier power equipment on its line it became necessary to elevate the tracks at the point of crossing to ease the grade. This contemplated plan involves an elevation of four feet, at that place, and some reconstruction of the main line. It involves also reconstruction of the tracks of the crossing company to conform to the intended grade. The superintendent of the Le-high and New England expressed written consent thereto, March 28, if the expense thereof was borne by the defendant. This proposition was not accepted and no other consent was given. The changes were commenced <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>by the defendant on its road in July, and tbe plaintiff obtained this preliminary injunction which was continued by agreement until final hearing could be had. The cost of reconstructing the lines of the plaintiff company to conform to those changes for an available crossing is variously estimated by engineers from $1,200 to $8,200, based upon different plans.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b431-7" data-blocks='[["BL_431.8",431,[198,1681,1154,755]],["BL_432.1",432,[298,361,1152,1083]]]'>While the particular matter here disputed does not seem to have passed into decision by any reported case, it may be settled by application of well established rules. Whatever else may be further said the defendant cannot be enjoined from pursuing its physical operations to elevate the tracks of its own lines. The right of complainant to a grade crossing at the designated point is definitely secured by its contract, but it is not admissible to say that consent of this crossing company must be obtained by the Delaware, .Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company for improvement of its roadbed whenever increasing traffic or the use of more modern equipments may seem to make it desirable. This discretion is committed to the corporate board of directors, beyond <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>judicial control, unless asserted in bad faith, arbitrarily and wantonly in disregard of rights of others. I need not cite authority for this plain proposition.. How far these agreements, made after the approval of the Act of June 7,1901, P. L. 531, forbidding all grade crossings except as therein permitted by the court, were void, or voidable at the instance of the Commonwealth, is not the subject of discussion now. But the rights of the plaintiff company are subordinate to the elder franchise of the defendant which, through the merged company, had been operating its road for many years when this contract was made and the construction of the Northampton Railroad under a later charter was yet incomplete : Smethport R. R. Co. v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/203/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="203 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="994722" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0176-01">203 Pa. 176</a>. It is not less so because the grant of the privilege by defendant’s predecessor was a license (Lehigh and New Eng. R. R. Co. v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/228/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="228 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="969847" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0350-01">228 Pa. 350</a>), and by the expenditure of money in the installation and maintenance has become irrevocable; for the crossing right still remains unimpaired.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.4",432,[297,1457,1150,910]]]'>Railroads are public highways subject to the police power of the Commonwealth, and for the purpose of such supervision their contracts are not to be treated as those merely of private corporations: Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville R, R. Co. v. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/77/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="77 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="436305" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0173-01">77 Pa. 173</a>, 186. As common carriers, therefore, each company is required to construct, reconstruct whenever necessary, maintain and operate its road so as to fulfil its public service obligation. It cannot divest itself of this duty to the State by any contract nor can the State by legislative act surrender its power to enforce it: Boston Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, <a href="/us/97/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="97 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="3376606" data-case-paths="/us/97/0025-01">97 U. S. 25</a>. Railroad companies, as between themselves, may lawfully contract for the manner in which expenses of repair and maintenance of crossings or extensions shall be borne, but such contracts will relieve neither from answer to the Commonwealth for default.</p>

Moreover the crossing was established for the benefit of the plaintiff company. A chancellor cannot decree a liability where none otherwise exists, and exact payment as a condition for permitting the defendant to do that which without conditions we have no right to forbid. Elaboration of these reasons for my conclusion would add nothing of value to what I have now written.</p>
