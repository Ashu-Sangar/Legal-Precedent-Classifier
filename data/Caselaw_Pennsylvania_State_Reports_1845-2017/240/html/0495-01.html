In such case the evidence of plaintiff’s contributory negligence was so clear that the case was properly withdrawn from the jury.</p>

The easterly track is used by trains bound from Philadelphia toward Chestnut Hill. Trains bound from Chestnut Hill to Philadelphia travel on the westerly track. The main station house, with a platform in front of it for the accommodation of passengers who have occasion to use the outbound trains, is located on the easterly side of the railroad. On the westerly side of the railroad stands a shelter shed with a platform for the use of passengers on the inbound trains. The two platforms are not connected by a tunnel or an overhead bridge. Persons wishing to pass from one to the other must cross the intervening tracks at grade upon a plank walk. No watchman is stationed there to regulate the movements of those passing from one platform to the other, and no fences have been erected to keep passengers off the tracks when the approach of trains renders the space between the platforms dangerous.</p>

She got to the station at least five minutes, perhaps as much as a quarter of an hour, before her train was scheduled to arrive there. When she reached the edge of the platform on the near side of the tracks, she looked toward Chestnut Hill, and saw a train about four hundred feet away moving toward her on the inbound track. She immediately stepped down upon the plank crossing, and, lifting her skirt, in order to facilitate her movements, but walking at her usual gait without increasing her speed, attempted to pass to the platform oh the westerly side of the tracks. She was in the act of <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>stepping np to the far platform when her clothing was caught by the train that she had observed.

    <p class="summary" id="b525-3" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[176,547,1151,537]]]'>At the time of the accident all trains regularly scheduled to pass Tulpehocken Station stopped there. The train that killed Mrs. Lebrenz was a special train, and did not appear on the railroad company’s published timetable. It consisted of a locomotive and one coach. It was running at a high rate of speed, and did not stop after the accident until it had traveled eight hundred feet beyond the station. The locomotive’s whistle was not blown as the train approached the station. Whether or not its bell was then ringing is uncertain.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[326,482,1148,377]]]'>In the case at har there was present an element which did not figure among the facts involved in the cases referred to. It is conceded that Mrs. Lebrenz, before she tried to walk from the easterly platform to the westerly platform across the defendant’s tracks, saw that there was approaching upon the inbound track a train moving at a high rate of speed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[328,867,1149,647]]]'>It is impossible to distinguish in their essential features, the facts of this case from those presented in the case of Goller v.

In each case a train coming rapidly nearer was in plain view, and the danger of attempting to cross the track in front of it was manifest to the intending passenger. If the plaintiff in Goller v. Railroad Company had no right to recover damages for her husband’s death, because it resulted from his taking the chance of crossing the track in front of the train that he saw approaching, so here also, for the same reason, a recovery by Mr. Lebrenz is barred.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[329,1524,1150,526]]]'>It may be that Mrs. Lebrenz did not know exactly how fast the train that she saw was moving; but she was safe where she was standing where she saw the train, and she should have stayed there. She had no right to risk her safety on her own rough calculation of the chance that she might be able to walk over the track and get clear of it before the train could reach the crossing. If she made a mistake, and the chance that she took went against her, her husband must suffer the consequences without recourse to the defendant.</p>

The train that' struck and killed Mr. Goller was the very train that he was to have boarded,, and he had the same right to assume that its speed would slacken as it approached the station that Mrs. Lebrenz may have thought she had in the case of the train by which she was killed. Nevertheless, binding instruct tions for the defendant were given at the trial of that case, and were approved by the Supreme Court.</p>
