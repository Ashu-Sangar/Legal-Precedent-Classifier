The council of the Borough of Old Forge entered into a contract with Mathias Stipp for the completion of a sewer, which had been partly built by another firm. The price to be paid Stipp under his contract was $35,000, which was to cover material, labor and all other expenses incident to the construction of the sewer. The contract is in the usual form of such contracts and provides, inter alia, that Stipp shall give a corporate surety bond in the sum of $18,000, “conditioned for the faithful performance of the work according to contract...... and for the payment of all claims......for work and labor,” &amp;c. The contract and bond are in evidence. After the execution of these papers, Stipp proceeded with the work of building the sewer.</p>

The strike lasted some time; but it was finally adjusted by an agreement to pay the laborers two dollars per day, instead of $1.50, the former rate. Stipp then told the borough council that he would not be able to complete the contract, because of the advance of fifty cents per day in the wages of the laborers.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b128-4" data-blocks='[["BL_128.4",128,[319,818,1149,202]]]'>3.

The ordinance in question in this case having been passed at a regular meeting of the borough council held on October 14,1912, and the next regular meeting of the council being on October 28th, the veto of the burgess sent to the council on the latter date was in time, and the failure of the council to take action on the veto at the said meeting of October 28th, makes the ordinance void and of no effect.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b129-7" data-blocks='[["BL_129.8",129,[199,1918,1153,541]],["BL_130.1",130,[299,370,1154,1355]]]'>Our interpretations of the third section of the Act of 1893, is conclusive against the contention of the defendant in this case. The general rule touching this matter, as laid down in the textbooks, is that meetings of council on a day other than the stated one for regular meetings, assembled pursuant to the adjournment of the regular meetings, are not special meetings, nor a distinct class of meetings, but according to the great weight of authority are regular meetings with all the power and authority for municipal affairs possessed on the stated <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>day for assembling; and all municipal action taken at such meeting is as valid as if taken on the first day of the session. There is a question in some jurisdiction as to the validity of municipal action at an adjourned regular meeting on a subject not begun or touched upon at the regular meeting, but we are not now concerned with this phase of the matter, because it does not affect the dispute in the case at bar. Mr. Dillon, in the first volume of his work on Municipal Corporations, Section 285, states the law as we deem it to be in Pennsylvania to-day: “A regular meeting, unless special provision is made to the contrary, may be adjourned to a future fixed day, and at such meeeting it will be lawful to transact any business which might have been transacted at the stated meeting, of which it is, indeed, but the continuation.” The same view of the law was taken by Judge Rice in the case of Avoca Borough v. Street Ry. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Kulp%20470" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Kulp 470">7 Kulp 470</a>. And, in the case of Com. v. Fleming, <a href="/pa-super/23/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="23 Pa. Super. 404" data-case-ids="847642" data-case-paths="/pa-super/23/0404-01">23 Pa. Superior Ct. 404</a>, the same principle is laid down in the following words: “A regular meeting of the borough council may adjourn to a definite future day, and at such adjourned meeting the body may transact any business which might have been transacted at the meeting from which the adjournment was had. An adjourned meeting is the continuation of the stated meeting.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b130-4" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[307,1737,1150,643]]]'>It appears very clearly that an adjourned regular meeting is simply a continuation of the stated meeting. The meeting of the council of Old Forge held on October 21st was the same meeting as that held on October 14th; and the “next regular meeting,” referred to in the Act of 1893, means exactly what the words import, viz, the meeting of October 28th. The burgess, although he had notice of the date of the adjourned meeting, was within his rights when he waited until the “next regular meeting” (28th) before sending in his veto. The question is so simple and clear that we consider further discussion unnecessary.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_130.5",130,[356,2393,1107,42]],["BL_131.1",131,[215,370,1152,1255]]]'>We could safely leave the consideration of this case. <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>at this point, but the parties on both sides have argued the merits of the ease, viz, the validity of the ordinance. We are of the opinion that the council had no legal power to pass the ordinance in question; and this constitutes our third conclusion of law. The council had entered into a contract with the contractor to complete the sewer for a fixed, stipulated price. According to the terms of the agreement, the contractor was to pay for all materials and labor. There was no provision in the contract relating in any way to the contingency of a strike. The contractor also gave a bond in the sum of $18,000, conditioned that he complete the sewer according to contract, and that he pay for all the labor and materials entering into the construction of the sewer. Under such facts, the council had no right to increase the contract price. Counsel for defendants claim that the council was confronted with the threat on the part of the contractor to abandon his contract, and that a compromise was effected to avoid possible litigation and delay. The remedy in case of an abandonment of the contract was a simple one. The borough could have re-let the work to somebody else and then proceed on the bond to recover the loss, if any.</p>
