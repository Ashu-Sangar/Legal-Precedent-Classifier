    <p id="b497-9" data-blocks='[["BL_497.15",497,[187,1620,1153,530]]]'>The plaintiff obtained a judgment in an action for personal injuries against the Penn Allen Portland Cement Company, which became insolvent and was adjudged a bankrupt. He filed a bill for subrogation to the rights of the cement company under an indemnity policy of accident insurance issued to it by the JEtna Life Insurance Company and for a decree requiring the insurance company to pay to him the amount of his judgment against the cement company. The court sustained a demurrer and dismissed the bill.</p>

Since it has no right of action there is nothing to which the plaintiff could be subrogated. For this reason the bill was dismissed by the learned judge of the Common Pleas and in the decree entered we fully concur.</p>
