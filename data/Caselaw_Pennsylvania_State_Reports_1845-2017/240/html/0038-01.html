Unless it can be gathered from the entire will, it was the intention of the testator to divide his estate among his legatees as money and not as land, it must be held there is no conversion into personalty. The rule is, the intent of the testator is to be gathered from the four corners of the will rather than from the terms of a particular devise, which regarded alone, might be inconsistent with the scheme of the will as a whole: Dean v. Winton, <a href="/pa/150/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="150 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="834410" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0227-01">150 Pa. 227</a>.

The value of the personal property is far in excess of the value of the real estate, and much more than sufficient to pay all bequests of money,* there are no debts due the decedent by any of his legatees that make a sale of the real estate necessary in order to ascertain the shares due each. There are no shares effected by a valuation to be fixed by the executors and bequeathed in certain proportions, some share absolute and others to be held in trust, which would render a sale of the real estate necessary as in Fahnestock v.

There is no direction in the will to distribute the whole of the estate, the distribution by the executors is limited to such assets as the testator may die seized of — as they may be able to distribute to those entitled before the end of five years, the period fixed for the final settlement of the estate. There has not been a blending of the real and personal property which creates a fund out of which the beneficiaries are to be paid: Martin <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>v.

    <p class="summary" id="b70-4" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[285,682,1157,967]]]'>The Commonwealth attached considerable importance to the clause of the will which gave to the executors five years “to dispose and settle” the estate. The words “settle” and “dispose” no doubt were used by the testator advisedly, because he was a man of education, having been a practicing attorney for many years at this bar; during the last part of his life he served a term of ten years as judge of our courts. Therefore, it-is fair to assume he gave to the word “dispose” its correct shade of meaning and regarded it as a synonym of “settle” and purposely avoided the expression “dispose of,” which might be construed as a direction to his executors to sell. The fact that the testator extended the time for the settlement of his estate to five years is not important, to this issue. His reason therefor was sound, because in an estate of this magnitude and diversity it could best be conserved by taking ample time for its settlement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[292,1664,1151,374]]]'>It was contended at the argument that the beneficiaries under the will could have no partition of the real estate during the period given to the executors to settle the estate, therefore, a conversion was effected. We cannot agree with this proposition, a man can dispose of his estate by will and postpone the full enjoyment of it without effecting an equitable conversion of his real estate.</p>
