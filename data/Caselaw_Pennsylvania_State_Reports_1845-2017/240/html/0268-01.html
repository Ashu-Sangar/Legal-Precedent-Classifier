It is clear, we think, that in the present case the testator used the word in the latter sense, and intended that the estate should go to the lineal descendants of his daughter. He contemplated an indefinite failure of his daughter’s issue. The estate was to go over “only in case there should be no children of hers or aney Heirs from any of her children.” So: long, <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>therefore, as there was any of her own children or. “aney Heirs from any of her children,” the estate did not', go to the other devisees.
