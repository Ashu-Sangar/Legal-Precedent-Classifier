    <p class="summary" id="b40-5" data-blocks='[["BL_40.5",40,[316,535,1148,255]]]'>The petitioner seeks to have the sale of her property by the sheriff set aside because of irregularity in the advertising of the same. She claims that there was a violation of Section 2 of the Act of April 22, 1846, P. L. 476, which is as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b40-6" data-blocks='[["BL_40.6",40,[316,808,1150,370]]]'>“......It shall not be lawful for the sheriffs and coroners of the several counties of this Commonwealth to publish the sales of real estate, as required by the sixty-third section of the Act of June 16,1886, P.

Upon the contrary the “Doylestown Democrat” is published by the Doylestown Publishing Company, a corporation chartered under the laws of Pennsylvania, and the said publication is made at Doylestown, where it is entered, mailed and <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>delivered to subscribers and tbe public, and tbe “New Hope News” is published by the New Hope Publishing Company, a copartnership, and the said publication is made at New Hope, Pa., where it is entered, mailed and delivered to subscribers and to the public from its office of publication in the Stintsman Building, and the said New Hope Publishing Company is not owned by the Doylestown Publishing Company, or composed of the same company of men.”</p>
