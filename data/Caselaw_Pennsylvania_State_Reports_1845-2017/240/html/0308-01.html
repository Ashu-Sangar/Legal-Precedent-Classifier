He gave directly to her one-half of his real estate for life. No other meaning can be attached to his words; and, when he added, “after her death it shall go to her heirs and assigns,” his meaning is equally clear that it should descend from her. That she took a fee under the rule in Shelley’s case and the Act of April 27,1855, P. L. 368, is too plain <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>for discussion, and the only conceivable reason why this appeal was taken must have been the apprehension that, at some time in the future, some one, not a lawyer, might question the title of the testator’s daughter.</p>
