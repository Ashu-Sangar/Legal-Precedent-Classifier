The title of the former is sufficient notice of its subject matter and the title of the latter, indicating that it is a supplement to the former, is valid. A title declaring an act to be a supplement to a former one is a sufficient statement of the subject matter, if the legislation therein contained is germane to the subject matter of the original act.</p>

Where the Court of Quarter Sessions has abolished one ward in a borough and has divided the borough into three wards instead of the four previously existing the decree will not be reversed because it provides for the election of a full quota of ward officers. The right to an office is not the right of the incumbent to the place but of the people to the officer, and it is no constitutional objection to the action of the court that thereby some of the old borough officers will be deprived of their offices. In any event the right to office is not in issue in such appeal. The. proper method to determine a contest between incumbents and aspirants to office is by quo warranto brought at the suggestion of one who lays claim to the office.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b425-7" data-blocks='[["BL_425.9",425,[210,751,1149,100]]]'>The petition upon which this proceeding is based, furnished to us by appellant, is as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b425-8" data-blocks='[["BL_425.10",425,[210,861,1151,967]]]'>“December 20, 1910, Petition of thirty-three freeholders in the Borough of Summit Hill, praying the court to re-divide the said Borough of Summit Hill into wards, by consolidating two or more wards or parts of two or more wards into one ward; by erecting new wards out of parts of two or more adjoining wards, by dividing wards already erected into two or more wards, as may be found best to suit the convenience of the inhabitants thereof.” We start with the assumption that the legislature has committed to the Courts of Quarter Sessions the power to sub-divide boroughs into wards and to alter and change the lines and numbers of such wards. We understand that the Borough of Summit Hill was divided into four wards prior to the presentation of the petition in the present case and that the proceedings carried to a final decree in the court below resulted in abolishing one ward and subdividing the borough into three wards.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b425-9" data-blocks='[["BL_425.11",425,[210,1848,1149,591]],["BL_426.1",426,[291,351,1147,155]]]'>The acts of assembly under which this proceeding was carried on are the following: The Act of May 14, 1874, P. L. 159, entitled “An act to prescribe the manner by which the courts may divide boroughs into wards.” Section 1 of that act provides, “That the several courts of Quarter Sessions shall have authority, within their respective counties, to divide boroughs into wards, to erect new wards out of parts of two or more adjoining wards, to divide any ward already erected into two or more wards, to alter the lines of any two or more adjoining wards so as to suit the convenience of the in<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>habitants thereof, and to cause the lines or boundaries to be ascertained and established.” The remaining sections of the act relate to procedure.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b426-5" data-blocks='[["BL_426.4",426,[291,518,1150,525]]]'>The other act is that of March 24, 1877, P. L. 47, entitled “A supplement to an act, entitled ‘An act to prescribe the manner by which the courts may divide boroughs into wards,’ approved the fourteenth day of May, Anno Domini, eighteen hundred and seventy-four.” The act reads: “That the several Courts of Quarter Sessions shall have authority within their respective counties to divide boroughs into wards by erecting two or more wards of parts or two or more wards into one ward so as to suit the convenience of the inhabitants thereof.”</p>

We are unable to discover any merit in the contention that either of said acts is unconstitutional. The title of the .Act of 1874 gives clear and sufficient notice of the subject matter of the act and this is so plain that we do not stop to cite authorities. The Act of 1877 is surely germane to the subject of the former act and its title states clearly that it is a supplement to the Act of May 14, 1874, and when the title of the Act of 1877 is read it at once refers the reader to the Act of May 14, 1874. While it cannot be said that the question of the constitutionality of or said acts, or either of them, was Squarely raised decided in re Gettysburg Boro. Division, <a href="/pa/90/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="90 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1065626" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0355-01">90 Pa. 355</a>, yet both acts were referred to and recognized as valid in the opinion of the Supreme Court. The Act of 1877 does not offend against Section 6 of Article III, of the Constitution. It is not an act to amend but is specifically a supplement to the former act and relates to the same subject: Com. v. Taylor, <a href="/pa/159/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="159 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="850144" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0451-01">159 Pa. 451</a>. The Act of 1877 is germane to the subject of the Act of 1874 and, .therefore, the former act does not offend against any constitutional provision: Washington Boro. v. McGeorge, <a href="/pa/146/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="146 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="827899" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0248-01">146 Pa. 248</a>. “A title declaring an act to be <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>a supplement to a former one is a sufficient statement of the subject matter, if the legislation therein contained is germane to the subject matter of the original act”: Millvale Borough v.

    <p class="summary" id="b427-10" data-blocks='[["BL_427.10",427,[224,2056,1149,372]],["BL_428.1",428,[277,355,1151,973]]]'>In a conflict between incumbents and aspirants to office the remedy is, we think, quo warranto, and such questions cannot be determined on this appeal. Again, it does not appear that appellant is laying claim to a borough office and therefore he has no standing to raise that question.

It would seem, to be impossible in this case to decree the election of councilmen in such a manner as not to interfere with the terms of those heretofore elected. In Com. v. Taylor, <a href="/pa/159/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="159 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="850144" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0451-01">159 Pa. 451</a>, Mr. Justice Mitchell, speaking for the Supreme Court, said: “The Act of May 14, 1874, P. L. 159, by its fourth section directed, ‘the election of an equal number of councilmen and school directors in each of the wards,’ etc. This contemplated a separate election by each ward. Not only is that the natural meaning of the language used, but it is what is generally to be presumed, in accordance with the universal American system that the representative shall be elected by the constituency which he is to-represent and, therefore, if he is, under the law, to be a ward representative in the school board of the borough, he is, presumably, to be elected by the voters of the ward.”</p>
