    <p class="summary" id="b575-7" data-blocks='[["BL_575.7",575,[218,1521,1160,316]]]'>The plaintiffs claim that in the early part of 1908 they-went to the office of the Real Estate, Title Insurance and Trust Company, and there had an interview with.

Knight, Jr., and-receive a commission of two per cent, upon any price,which might be realized for the property for bringing, about the sale. Plaintiffs claim that Mr. Rosenberger, <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>was informed by them in their negotiations with him of the fact that they represented Mr. Knight as a prospective purchaser, but that if the sale was made they would have to look to the seller and not to the purchaser for their commissions. They also claim that they did in point of fact bring the, property to the notice of Mr. Knight, and that it was through their instrumentality, although the transaction was not concluded by their efforts, that the sale and conveyance of the property was eventually made to Mr. Knight. Most of the material allegations of the plaintiffs upon the matters just referred to were denied by Mr. Rosenberger, but thesé questions of fact were submitted to the jury, and upon these questions we have no doubt that there was sufficient in the case for the jury to pass upon. We do not, however, enlarge upon these matters, for the reason that in our view of the case it must be disposed of upon the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto. That motion is based upon what is claimed to have been a deficiency of proof to show that the Real Estate, Title Insurance and Trust Company, one of the executors and trustees under the testator’s will, had authority, either express or implied, to bind the estate or its co-executor and trustee by the making of any such contract as that upon which the plaintiffs rely.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[311,1734,1151,317]]]'>We have already stated that there is nothing in the evidence which shows that Mrs. Carson ever expressly authorized the alleged contract to be made with the plaintiffs, or authorized her co-executor and trustee to make sale of the Newport property, or, more specifically and possibly more critically, her life estate therein.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b576-6" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[310,2060,1150,376]]]'>We think that, under the language of the will, there is no room for questioning that the real estate devised by the testator was in the hands and under the control of the executors as trustees. We, therefore, must regard them as subject to the limitations and restrictions as to their authority to act which are peculiar to trustees under a will, as distinguished from executors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b577-3" data-blocks='[["BL_577.3",577,[231,375,1157,1249]]]'>
      <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>Therefore, applying familiar rules to determine their authority, we must conclude that in making the sale of the real estate devised by the testator which they had authority to sell, and in the making of arrangements therefor, they were obliged to act, not separately but together, or at least that in any case where a question might be raised as to their authority, it should be made to appear that both of the trustees were co-operating in and authorizing the sale which might be attempted, and all the necessary preliminary arrangements which should precede such a transaction. In the line of such a view of the case, the jury was in effect instructed that before plaintiffs could properly have a verdict rendered in their favor, the jury should look for and find in the evidence that which would justify the conclusion that Mrs. Carson acquiesced in and in fact approved the action of the trust company concerning a sale of the Newport property, and thereby authorized the arrangement or contract which the plaintiffs claim they had entered into with the trust company through Mr. Rosenberger, its vice-president and trust officer. We fail to see how any other instruction could properly have been given to the jury upon that question.'</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[224,1634,1169,801]]]'>Of course, that instruction related primarily to dealings concerning the sale of real estate which was in the hands of the executors and trustees with power to sell. So far as the Newport property was concerned, as executors and trustees they had no right to sell anything more than the remainder of the estate after the life estate-of Mrs. Carson should be terminated. Her life estate could not by any possibility be sold and conveyed by them in their fiduciary capacity. That was an independent estate over which she alone had control and over which she alone had the right of disposition or sale. The property which the plaintiffs intended to cover by their negotiations was, of course, the entire estate, neither the life estate nor the estate in remainder apart from each other.</p>

      <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>Conceding, as must be done, that Mrs. Carson took no actual part in any negotiations which the plaintiffs had with the trust company, and conceding also, as must be done, that, so far as the evidence shows, she had no actual knowledge of what the plaintiffs claim to have passed between them and Mr. Bosenberger, the trust officer, it seems to us that the jury ought not to have been allowed, upon the basis of any evidence that there was in the case to infer that the trust company had any author- . ity to act for its co-executor and trustee in the making of the alleged contract with the plaintiffs, in respect of the estate in remainder in the Newport'property, and . even less so in regard to the life estate belonging to Mrs. Carson.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.5",578,[309,1467,1170,855]]]'>It would not be difficult to believe that Mrs. Carson . did in point of fact rely largely upon the trust company to determine what should be done, in her own interest, and in the interest of the estate. We cannot, however, allow such a probability to take the place of positive evidence showdng either prior authority or subsequent • ratification of what was done by the trust company. No doubt there may be bases in which the necessary authority from a co-trustee may be inferred from circumstances, and no doubt there may be cases where what is done by one trustee may be of such a trifling or a necessary character that it would be proper to justify it as in the interest of an estate. The present case, however, does not appear to us to be of such a character, and for the reasons wthich we have stated we must enter judgment in favor of the defendant non obstante veredicto.</p>
