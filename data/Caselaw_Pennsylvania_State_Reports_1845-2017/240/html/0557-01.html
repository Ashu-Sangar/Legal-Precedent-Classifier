About September, 1906, there was formed an unin.corporated society known originally as the Junior Order United American Mechanics’ National Orphans’ Home Association of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. By-laws were adopted by those who organized it. These provide for its name and set forth the purpose that its members had in mind in associating themselves together. The latter are defined as the raising of funds for and assisting in every way possible the National Orphans’ Home at Tiffin, Ohio; the holding of annual outings and entertainments for the purpose of raising funds for the orphans’ home; and the promotion of fraternity and sociability among the members of the Junior Order United American Mechanics and their families. None can become members of the association who are not members of the order. Members of the association are of two classes. One class consists of those who have “a voice but no vote” in the management of its affairs. Qualification for such membership depends on good standing in the order and the payment of annual dues amounting to fifty cents. These are called social members and there are about half a dozen of them. The <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>voting membership is made np of duly accredited representatives of the various councils, of the order that desire to partake in the work of the association.</p>

From the time of its organization until the. fall of 1910 the officers and members of this, society were active and unremitting in their efforts to raise money, for, the benefits of the National Orphans’ Home.-established by the order at Tiffin, Ohio. Long appeals were addressed-to the various councils of the order to send delegates to join the society, and to secure the co-operation and assistance of their members in the work that the society had taken up in the interest of the National Orphans’ Home. In response to these appeals many contributions were received by the society. The money sent in was raised by the giving of block parties, the, getting up of excursions, collections on punch cards, the sale of souvenir postals, the giving of dances and concerts, raffles and the sale of certificates of generosity and honorable mention in the society’s archives. The certificates just referred to contained a picture representing the National Orphans’ Home at Tiffin, go did the souvenir postal cards that were sold, and the society’s annual reports. The cabbage that was raffled came from the grounds of the Home at. Tiffin, and this fact was made the basis of the request to buy chances on it. The burden of the society’s appeal for contributions was that it “was organized for the purpose of raising sufficient funds to erect a suitable building at the home in Tiffin, Ohio, as a monument to the Juniors from the. district which gave birth to the noble order,” and- all. were urged to join in the furtherance of this object. There can be no doubt that it was the intention of the officers and members of the society as. well as of the individuals and councils contributing to the fund raised: by the society that the money gathered should be used <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>for the benefit of the orphans’ home established at Tiffin by the-national council. While it is true that the promotion of fraternity and sociability among the members of the Junior Order United American Mechanics was one of the objects of the members when the society was formed, this object became a secondary one, and the entertainments given under the society’s auspices were all promoted for the sake of raising money for the orphanage at Tiffin.</p>

The money received by the society in the manner above mentioned, between the date of its formation and December 4, 1911, aggregated $2,487.49. This sum has since been increased by the interest accruing on the mortgage in which $1,600 of it is invested. Out of the fund there has been paid for postage, printing and other expenses conceded by the plaintiffs to be legitimate, $192.23. There has been applied to the payment of counsel fees for defending these proceedings the sum of $200.00, and the further sum of $50.00 has been laid out to meet other expenses connected with the case. The sum of $1,600.00 is invested in the name of Andrew G. Wirth, formerly treasurer of the society, in a mortgage secured on property known as No. 2567 North Marston street, in the City of Philadelphia. The remainder of the money raised as aforesaid and unexpended is deposited with the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ National Bank of that city.</p>

As the result of dissensions in the order between the State Council of Pennsylvania and the National Council an attempt was ihade at a meeting of the society on October 8, 1910, by certain of its members who supported the cause of the State Council to amend the society’s by-laws by changing its. name to the Junior Order United American Mechanics’ Orphans’ Home Association of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and substituting the Orphans’ Home of the State Council of Pennsylvania for the National Orphans’ Home at Tiffin, Ohio, as the subject of the society’s charitable ac<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>tivitv. Another change, relating to the qualification for membership, was agreed upon, but the question as to when it. should become effective was postponed until the next meeting. No notice had been given to the members that these amendments would be proposed, and it seems to have been regarded that their adoption at this meeting was without effect. It was, however, apparent to the plaintiffs and those associated with them in supporting the cause of the National Council that a plan had been formed to divert the fund in the society’s possession from the use of the beneficiary for which it had been= raised, and on December 9, 1910, this bill was filed for the purpose of restraining the contemplated diversion. Subsequently, at a meeting, held on January 14, 1911, after notice to all members of the society of the amendments proposed to be made to its by-laws, it was resolved by the vote of more than two-thirds of the members present that Sections 1 and-2 of Article II of the bylaws, which treat of the objects of the society, should be amended so as to read as follows:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b592-6" data-blocks='[["BL_592.6",592,[331,1096,1152,855]]]'>1. An unincorporated society is in many respects similar to a partnership. The only bond that unites its members is their contract of association. As the consent of all parties to a contract is essential to its modification, so, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, the by-law's of such a society which set forth the terms upon which its members have agreed to become associated, cannot be altered or amended without the consent of all of them. It is competent, however, for its members to provide in their articles of association for the alteration thereof by the agreement of less than all of their number, and such a term will be enforceable just as any other article in their fundamental contract, subject only to the limitation that the by-laws shall not be changed in such a manner as to be unreasonable.</p>

The by-laws of the society with which this litigation is - concerned contain an article that provides for their amendment at any regular meeting by a vote of two-thirds of the members present. The amendment of the by-laws with respect to anything included in them was, therefore, entirely lawful, provided that their requirements in respect to amendment were complied with, and provided that the by-laws as amended should not be unreasonable. It is conceded that the regularity <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>of the proceedings under which the amendments adopted at the meeting of January 14,1911, were effected cannot be questioned. There is nothing unreasonable in the change of the object that the association is to be continued to accomplish or bring about, nor, in view of this can any sound objection be raised to the society’s change of name. The amendments to its by-laws adopted at the meeting .just mentioned were entirely lawful so far as their future operation is concerned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b593-3" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[235,880,1156,702]]]'>3. The money that the society accumulated prior to the amendment of its by-laws was raised for a specific purpose by its officers and members and donated for that purpose by its contributors within- and without the society. It is, therefore, impressed with and held upon the trust that it shall be so applied. The society holds it as a trustee and can no more divert the fund from the use for which it was raised than any other trustee could. If, as has happened, the members of the society undertake to divert the fund to some other purpose, equity will raise up another trustee to administer it and apply it according to the intention of the original donors or subscribers: Schnorr’s App., <a href="/pa/67/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="67 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1022603" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0138-01">67 Pa. 138</a>.</p>

The beneficiary for whose use the fund in the hands of the society or its officers was raised is the National Orphans’ Home established by the National Council of the Junior Order United American Mechanics, at Tiffin, Ohio. While it appears that some of the appeals on which the society raised this money indicated a vague purpose of applying it to the increase of the “housing capacity” of the orphanage, the evidence is insufficient to warrant a finding that the fund in hand must be applied to that particular use, and there is no evidence that it was intended that the society should have a discretionary power to determine in what manner the money collected should be applied for'the benefit of the National Orphans’ Home. It was never intended that any portion of this money should be used in defraying the cost of resisting interference with its diversion from <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>the purposes for which it was contributed. The appropriation of the sum of $250 by the society to pay counsel and defray other expenses of this litigation was, therefore, plainly unlawful.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b594-4" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[329,589,1155,1138]]]'>5. There is no reason why the fund raised by the society should remain in the hands of either of its contending factions. It is not impossible that, if the bone of contention be removed from the reach of both parties, their strife will cease. Interest republicae ut sit finis litium. The fund was raised for the National Orphans’ Home at Tiffin, Ohio. To that institution it ought to go at once. The defendants do not care to have more to do with the Tiffin orphanage because it was established and is maintained by the National Council, and they have plainly manifested an intention to make an unlawful use of the fund in their hands. They must, therefore, be relieved of the care of it, and will, doubtless, be rejoiced thus to be saved from continued contact with inimical parties. The plaintiffs for themselves and their associates claim that this fund must be used for the benefit of the National Orphans’ Home. They will not, therefore, object to seeing it safe on its way to Tiffin, Ohio, and will, without doubt, congratulate themselves that they and their friends are to be spared from the trouble and responsibility of “administering it.”</p>

While it is true that the promotion of fraternity and sociability among the members of the Junior Order United American Mechanics was one of the objects of the members when the society was formed, this object became a secondary one, and the entertainments given under the society’s auspices were all promoted for the sake of raising money for the orphanage at Tiffin.” Though this finding is assigned as error, we have not been persuaded that it ought to be disturbed. On it and the remaining facts found by the learned chancellor below he reached correct legal conclusions, and on them the decree is affirmed.</p>
