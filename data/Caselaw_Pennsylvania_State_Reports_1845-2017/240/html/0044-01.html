    <p class="summary" id="b74-7" data-blocks='[["BL_74.6",74,[310,1198,1150,260]]]'>1. The street is in a territory which remained until late years unenclosed, irregularly improved, and accordingly open as a quasi common, being so used indiscriminately for such travel as had occasion to go in that neighborhood, without reference to street lines.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b74-8" data-blocks='[["BL_74.7",74,[310,1469,1150,428]]]'>2. In course of time, at points about the westerly limit of the proposed improvement, mills and manufacturing plants were established; at intervening points between these and Washington avenue, other improvements have been built; but all conforming to the building line called for in the various deeds; and, thus, as the travel increased it assumed a more definite route along the course of the streets as plotted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b74-9" data-blocks='[["BL_74.8",74,[310,1908,1148,316]]]'>3. This has been more noticeable, as it has been favored within the last twenty years by reason of the filling up of low places, and the grading down of a hill or knoll in another, which was done either by the Iron &amp; Coal Company or its successor in ownership of the abutting lands.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b74-10" data-blocks='[["BL_74.9",74,[308,2235,1148,208]],["BL_75.1",75,[212,380,1150,145]]]'>4. While the city has heretofore taken no corporate action in the premises nor done any work to open or improve the street, yet it has from time to time paved and curbed the intersecting avenues; and at the line of <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>Walnut street in each instance a corresponding breach has been left in the curb, where the circular form of curb was used as at all other street corners.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-5" data-blocks='[["BL_75.4",75,[210,544,1153,429]]]'>5. Within the last ten years the owners on either side throughout the three blocks covered by the proposed improvement, including the exceptant, have fences along the building line called for in their deeds; in that way the street lines have apparently become defined on the ground at a distance of sixty feet apart as shown in the maps or plots hereinafter mentioned; and the traffic, which is now by no means small, has conformed thereto.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-6" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[212,980,1148,148]]]'>6. The ordinance in question was passed in 1910. Exceptant’s titles were’ acquired by several deeds between 1893 and 1899.</p>

This was low and swampy. Twelve to fifteen years ago he caused it to be filled up by depositing waste from a coal washery which he operated in the vicinity. Possibly as incidental to that, the street area was to some extent included in the grading, although that is not entirely clear. But if it be so taken for granted, that is the only private use he ever made of it. He never enclosed it, nor by word or act indicated an intention to assert any claim of title, use or possession adverse to the city or the traveling public. On the contrary, as already noted, for some years past he has maintained fences on either side so as to exclude it from his apparent use and occupation.</p>

The street has never been closed nor does it appear that any attempt was ever made to interfere with its use by the public, or to give notice to any one that it was anything other than a public highway, though unimproved ; except that at a point in. the third block to the west of the avenue where some tracks of the D. &amp; H. R.

It was by counsel agreed at bar that the conveyance under which title to the bulk of its streets is claimed by the city, should be considered in evidence. That is a bipartite deed between the Lackawanna' Iron &amp; Coal Company and the Borough of Scranton dated March 7, 1857. Though it doesn’t appear whether the deed was ever recorded, it is a matter of familiar local history and is a fact generally well known. It is not disputed that at all times with which the case is concerned, exceptant had notice of the city’s rights under the deed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b76-5" data-blocks='[["BL_76.5",76,[302,1080,1147,144]]]'>It was made in pursuance of formal proposal by the company and equally formal acceptance by the borough, all of which is therein recited.</p>

It is not disputed that Walnut is one of the streets shown on the plan at a width of sixty feet between building lines; nor that the city is successor in title to the <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>rights thus conveyed to the borough and subject to its covenants in the premises.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b77-5" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[216,487,1153,811]]]'>11. But the company’s line, as noted at the outset, crossed the street at about ninety-four feet west of Washington avenue. To that extent the portion of the street now in question is on the Dolph tract. When that was plotted, however, the plan was made to conform to the town plot and thus Walnut was carried easterly on the same alignment to the city limits. It isn’t claimed there was any conveyance of the streets by the owners of the Dolph. Thus the status of the ninety-four feet rests on the effect of the sale of lots according to the plan. When this tract was so. laid out in town lots doesn’t definitely appear, although it is agreed by counsel to have been before 1877. It is not disputed that the plan was long since adopted by the city and that its maps conform to it.</p>

As between, private and public use in this instance, such use as was at any time made was that of the traveling public. True, at an early day that was vague and ambiguous in character. Not being confined to the street limits its course would appear to have been irregular, as determined by the line of least resistance and the traveler’s destination.
