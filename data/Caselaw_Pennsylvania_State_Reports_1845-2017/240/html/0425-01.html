Yaukey, her husband, entered into an agreement in writing to sell to Thomas Coffman certain real estate situate in Quincy Township, near Elbrook Station, containing about three acres. Coffman refused to accept a deed and pay the purchase money, alleging that the vendors had no marketable title. It appeared that the vendors claimed title under the will of Jesse Baer, Mrs. Yaukey’s father. The material portion of the will is as follows:</p>
