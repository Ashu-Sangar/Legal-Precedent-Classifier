The lower court was correct in entering judgment for defendant n. o. v., in an action against a mining company to recover damages for the death of plaintiff’s husband, a miner, who had been killed by an explosion of gas in the mine in which he was working, where it appeared that the explosion was caused by the negligence of an assistant fire boss, who had made an examination for gas, without the use of a safety lamp; that it was the duty of the mine foreman or his assistant to make the examination for gas; that the assistant fire boss was assigned to this work by the mine foreman or his assistant, and there was no evidence to show that the assignment was made with the consent or knowledge of the defendant company or any of its employees. It was not sufficient to show that the assistant fire boss was frequently at the colliery, and to argue from this that it must have been known to one of the defendant’s superintendents that he had been assigned to the duty which he undertook to perform.</p>

Jenkins, no doubt, had in mind the requirements of the act. He was cautious to what he assented. He agreed to a perfectly legitimate transaction. We are not called upon to decide what duties McHugh would have been qualified to perform if he had gone before the justice, taken the oath required by the act and filed it with the district inspector of mines, and then been appointed a fire boss, because McHugh never took the oath, and that question does not arise. The question before the court is whether there is any testimony from which it reasonably could be inferred, or which would warrant a jury in finding that Jenkins sanctioned <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>or authorized the appointment of McHugh to examine the mine for gases.
