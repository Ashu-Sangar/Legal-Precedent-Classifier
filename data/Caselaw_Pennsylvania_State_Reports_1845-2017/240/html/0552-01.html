On the last trial — resulting in the judgment now before us — the case was tried on the lines indicated in our former opinion as the proper ones, and we find nothing in the sixty-seven assignments of error which would justify a reversal and another opportunity to the City of Philadelphia to escape a liability which a second jury has placed upon it.</p>
