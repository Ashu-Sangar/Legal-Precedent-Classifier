The fan was in an iron frame which occupied the upper half of a window which was reached from the outside by opening the lower sash which hung on hinges. In oiling the bearings plaintiff was required to stand on the sloping window ledge, to support himself by holding with one hand to the iron frame, and to reach upward and forward with his arm bent over a shaft arid pulley. His arm was struck by a belt and knocked against the revolving fan and injured.

In oiling the bearings the plaintiff was required to stand on the sloping window ledge, to support himself by holding with one hand to the iron frame and to reach upward and forward with his arm • bent over a shaft and pulley.

The case was tried without regard to the Act of May 2, 1905, P. L. 352, which provides for the guarding of machinery and the negligence relied on as a ground of recovery was the failure of the defendant to provide a safe place in which to work, a duty arising independently of the Act of 1905. The questions submitted to the jury were whether it was practicable consistently with efficient use of the fan to more effectively guard it or to provide for stopping it during the operation of oiling. These questions were submitted by the learned trial judge with very full and accurate instructions.</p>
    <p id="b47-3" data-blocks='[["BL_47.4",47,[230,1253,524,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
