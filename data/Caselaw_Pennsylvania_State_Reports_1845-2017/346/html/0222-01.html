    <p id="b246-6" data-blocks='[["BL_246.8",246,[217,1235,1157,745]]]'>The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against The Gas Company in the sum of $65,000, and in favor of the City of Philadelphia. On February 24, 1942, the defendant City of Philadelphia entered judgment in its favor against the plaintiff on the verdict on February 10, 1942. Thereafter, on April 6, 1942, the defendant Gas Company obtained a rule to show cause against the defendant City why the said judgment should not be stricken off, and on April 9, 1942, the plaintiff obtained a rule against the defendant City to show cause why the plaintiff should not file a motion for a new trial <em>nunc pro tunc </em>against the defendant City and, further, to show cause why the said judgment should not be stricken off.</p>

In <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>addition, the court ordered, on its own motion, a new trial as to the defendant City of Philadelphia.</p>

The defendants having been sued jointly, neither defendant could take any action which would prejudice the rights of the other; and while the motion for new trial filed by the Gas Works was pending and under consideration by the Court, it was not proper for the other defendant, the City of Philadelphia, to enter the judgment on the verdict in its favor. In this case the plaintiff charged the defendants jointly. At the trial each defendant contended that the other was liable. The issue was one not only between the plaintiff and the defendants but also as between the defendants, so that if both were held liable the right of contribution could be enforced.”</p>

There is no complaint as to the amount of thé verdict, as reduced by the court to $40,000. There is complaint about the admission of testimony of an experiment concerning the diffusion of gas through soil and concerning an experiment to determine the relative breaking points of two pieces of. pipe, because in one case there was some difference in the porosity of the soil used in the experiment and the soil through which percolated the gas which caused this explosion and in the other casé “the materials and forces used” were different from those involved in this case. We find in this phase of the case no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial Judge, and no substantial error ánywhere in the trial. There is no reason why the verdict against the Gas Company, as reduced by the court below, should be disturbed. ■ .</p>

The Gas Company contends that “an obvious injustice might be done” unless a new trial should be granted <em>both </em>defendants. We think an obvious injustice would be done to this plaintiff if he should not be permitted to hold the verdict he won in a fair trial, against the Gas Company.
