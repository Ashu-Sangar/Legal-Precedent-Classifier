If there is anything settled in the law of negligence in Pennsylvania, it is the duty of a person to look where he is walking and see that which is obvious.</p>

On the clear afternoon of April 16, 1938, at about 4 o’clock, she fell as she was leaving the car which had stopped with its floor about three inches below the level of the station platform. It was usual for the car to cometo rest with the floor and platform exactly even. She admitted the adequacy of the lighting and excused her failure to take the necessary step up by the presence of shadows and other passengers. She also admitted that but three or four passengers preceded her in leaving the car and that immediately after the accident, while the car remained in the same position, she examined the situation and could see that the floor of the car was a few inches under the level of the platform. It is obvious she could have seen this condition if she had looked. It is not unusual for an inclined plane car or an elevator to come to rest a few inches above or below the level of the landing platform or floor. On cross-examination she testified that the other passengers “were out of the way when I stepped” and when asked what interfered with her seeing, she replied: “. . . there was shadows around there . . .” When asked: “It was shadows and not the people that prevented you seeing then?” she replied: “Exactly”. Shadows, where the lighting is otherwise adequate furnish no excuse for failure to see: <em>Mammana v. Easton Nat.
