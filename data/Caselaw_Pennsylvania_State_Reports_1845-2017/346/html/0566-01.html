When the estate upon which any transfer inheritance tax has been paid . . . shall have been involved in litigation, by reason whereof there shall have been an overvaluation of that portion of the estate on which the tax has been assessed and paid, which overvaluation could not have been ascertained within said period of two years. In such case, the application for repayment shall be made to the Board of Finance and Revenue, within one year from the termination of such litigation, or ascertainment of such overvaluation.”</p>

Subsequent litigation in the federal courts<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> determined that the tax had been levied on a sum larger than should have been the taxable base; the result was that the liability for the Pennsylvania tax was correspondingly reduced. There is no question of figures. The amounts are not disputed. The Commonwealth’s liability to refund is clear. There was the payment of the tax, the subsequent litigation, the resulting fact of overpayment and a refund petition “. . . within one year from the termination of such litigation. . . .” The petition presented to the Board shows that the overvaluation could not have been ascertained within the two <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>year period, thereby bringing the ease within the exception contained in section 503 (a) (2) quoted above.</p>
