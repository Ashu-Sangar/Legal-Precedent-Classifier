It presented its resignation as trustee and submitted itself to the order of the court. The Land Title Bank and Trust Company appeared and agreed to accept the appointment as substituted trustee. Appellant appeared specially for the purpose of denying the jurisdiction of the court “over the persons and the subject matter in said case.” The court overruled his objections and directed him to answer. He answered on the merits but repeated in his answer that he appeared specially and again asked that the petition “be dismissed for want of jurisdiction over the person of the respondent and the alleged Trust inter vivos.” The rules of the Orphans’ Court do not authorize such reservation in answering on the merits. After hearing on petition, answer and stipulation of facts, the court granted the petition, appointed the Land Title Bank and Trust Company in place of Hame Corporation, which had resigned, and directed the retiring trustee to account, etc. Mr. Schoble appeals from that order and contends that the court lacked jurisdiction (1) over him and (2) over the subject matter of the suit.</p>

Appellant’s position can perhaps best be stated by quoting from his brief a question in which he includes the bases of his contention. “May the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County assume jurisdiction of an inter vivos trust where the trustee, a corporation, and its principal officers, and the settlor, and the cestue que trust all resided outside the County of Philadelphia at the date when the trust began and have continued to reside outside the County of Philadelphia since that date?”</p>

L. 363, was supplemented June 26,1931, P. L.T384,20 PS section 2253a, by an extension of its jurisdiction “To embrace . . . (n) The control, removal, discharge, and settlement of accounts of trustees of trusts inter vivos.” Section 9, thus amended, contained a provision applying to the whole section “And such jurisdiction shall be exercised under the limitations and in the manner provided by law.” The appellant points to that provision and then refers to the Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">4</a> óf June 14,1836, P. L. 628, section 15, 20 PS 'section 2741, conferring jurisdiction of trusts inter vivos on the “. . . common pleas of the county in which any such trustee shall have resided at the commencement of the trust, or, if such trustee be a corporation in which such corporation is situate, or in which its principal officers shall have resided . . .” and contends that such restriction of the jurisdiction of the common pleas must be taken to apply to the Orphans’ Court because of the use of the words “And such juris<a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>diction shall be exercised under the limitations and in the manner provided by law.” He contends that the Orphans’ Court has jurisdiction only if the trustee corporation “is situate” in the county or if “its principal officers” reside in the county. The legislature did not intend such restriction as other provisions in section 17 show; the words at the end of section 9 were not a new provision in the Act of 1917, supra; they were in the Orphans’ Court Act of 1836, P. L. 792. Section 17 of the Orphans’ Court Act itself provides how service shall be made to obtain the appearance of parties amenable to its jurisdiction and for proceedings in default of appearance. The provision is not limited to the county of the trustee’s residence. In paragraph (d), 17 PS section 2334, it was provided that such service may be made “. . . anywhere within this Commonwealth; and if such party resides outside the Commonwealth and his place of residence is known, and the proceeding concerns property situate within the Commonwealth, the court may, in its discretion, authorize service to be made on such party personally wherever found, or by registered mail, or may direct notice to be given by publication in such manner as shall appear to the court to be reasonable and proper, according to general rules adopted by the court, or special orders made by the court in particular cases.” See <em>Heinz’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/313/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="313 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="1152702" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0006-01">313 Pa. 6</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.%20365" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="169 A. 365">169 A. 365</a>. The amendment of 1931, supra, extended the jurisdiction, to be exercised as provided in the Act, to “The control, removal, discharge, and settlement of accounts of trustees of trusts inter vivos.” So far, then, as the subject matter of the suit is a trust <em>inter vivos, </em>there is no doubt of the jurisdiction; the legislature has conferred it. Examining the subject matter more closely, it appears that appellant’s assignment of income from the Schoble family trust, was of property in Pennsylvania, created by a trust seated in Pennsylvania. Appellant contends that, as the assignee trustee was a Delaware corporation, the Orphans’ Court had no power to bring it into this state. The corporation is <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>referred to in the briefs as the Bisbee family corporation. The petition avers, “The stockholders of said Corporation.are comprised of the family of E. C. Bisbee, the father of your petitioner, and said E. C. Bisbee is president of said Hame Corporation. The principal business of said Hame Corporation is the holding of certain assets for the benefit of the said family of the said E. C. Bisbee, . . .” All the stockholders reside in the suburbs of Philadelphia, though it maintained no place of business in Pennsylvania. The stipulation of facts shows that the president of the corporation was also an officer of Bisbee Linseed Oil Corporation which maintained an office in Philadelphia and that the trustee of the Schoble family trust paid to Hame Corporation the income assigned by appellant by checks drawn on a Philadelphia bank and sent them to the President, Bisbee, at his office in Philadelphia. He then deposited them in a Wilmington bank to the credit of Hame Corporation. The record does not show how or from where the Hame Corporation paid appellant’s wife and children. The Hame Corporation, if the trustee required it, could only receive the assigned income by coming into this county for it, and if, in the administration of the Schoble family trust, any question arose in the disposition of which the Hame Corporation was a necessary party, section 17, paragraph d, of the Act of 1917, supra, provided for service out of the state and for proceedings in default of appearance. It would seem that appellant precipitated just such a situation when he notified the EidelityPhiladelphia Trust Company, trustee, that he repudiated his assignment of income and demanded payment to him, etc. The trustee, or anyone interested, might then have proceeded in the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County for a determination of the rights of the parties and in that proceeding might have required the appearance of the Delaware corporation in the manner provided by section 17 (d), supra.</p>

By paragraph 2 (c) of the assignment the trustee was directed to invest income, if any, not distributed under clause 2 (b), in “. . . legal investments under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” The relief sought is the safekeeping of the trust res and its proper administration; the record does not show whether there is any undistributed income in the custody of the Delaware trustee, but it is clear that there is such income in the Sehoble family trust now awaiting distribution.

The trustee is domiciled in Delaware, and what is more important, the trust is administered there. The “seat” of the trust is in Delawares where the settlor placed.it. The mere fact that its income is derived .from a debtor (another trust) in Pennsylvania certainly does not give Pennsylvania jurisdiction over, <em>this </em>trust.. An individual may subject himself to any jurisdiction, but I do not think a trustee can confer jurisdiction over the <em>trust res </em>on any State he may choose .for the purpose; otherwise, instead of a trust having a definite domicile, its jurisdictional situs could be changed at the will or whim of the trustee and, as in this case, against the wishes of the settlor.</p>
