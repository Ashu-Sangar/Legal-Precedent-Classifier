Rhodes, a director of the Media-69th Street Trust Company, and two associates applied to that Company for a purchase money mortgage of $40,000. to be secured upon premises at the corner of Ashby and Copely Roads, in Upper Darby, Delaware County, which they had agreed to buy for $75,000. A committee of three, including Samuel N. Rhodes, appraised the property: the land at $80,000. and the buildings at $10,000. The appraisal was reasonable at that time. The loan was approved. Title was con<a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>veyed to a straw man, who gave a bond and mortgage to the Trust Company. The property was then conveyed to Frank B. Rhodes, President of the Trust Company and father of Samuel Rhodes, who held the title in dry trust apparently to further secure the mortgagee and to facilitate transfer. It was testified that he normally took title to such mortgaged property for the benefit of the Trust Company, and that in many instances, including the present one, the practice resulted in financial loss to him for taxes which he was obliged to pay as record owner.</p>
    <p id="b451-3" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[170,895,1152,318]]]'>At this time, Samuel Rhodes and his associates had an oral agreement with one Wilson to sell the premises to him at $110,000. for the erection of a large apartment building. Frank B. Rhodes had noted upon the loan application that there was to be no commission upon the mortgage “as it will be paid off or sold within a month”.</p>
    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[171,1224,1150,317]]]'>The buildings on the mortgaged premises were razed in accordance with the oral agreement between Wilson and the real owners.

    <p id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.6",451,[169,1552,1151,589]]]'>On October 8, 1931, the trust officer of the company, being informed by a clerk that a mortgage was needed in the trust mortgage pool operated by the company, transferred this mortgage to the pool. This was done without consulting either Frank Rhodes or his son, then a Vice-President, and they had no knowledge of the transaction. The transfer increased the security of the participation certificates in the face amount of $35,600. The mortgage was not then in default, and two experienced real estate operators testified that the fair market value of the premises was $60,000. at that time.</p>

Shortly thereafter, Frank <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>Rhodes reconveyed the premises to the straw owner and mortgagor. Since that time, principal and interest have been in default.</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[249,455,1160,915]]]'>The trust company passed into the hands of the Secretary of Banking in 1933. The corporate plaintiff was appointed substituted trustee of the mortgage pool in 1934. From time to time, V. Gilpin Robinson, co-trustee with the closed trust company of the Estate of Edward O. Holmes, deceased, inquired of the Banking Department and substituted trustee of the mortgage pool, in which the estate held a participation certificate, concerning the status of this mortgage. He demanded of Frank and Samuel Rhodes details of the transaction and asserted an intention to hold them personally responsible for a breach of trust in connection therewith. In this he received no support from the Secretary of Banking or his representative. The special counsel employed by the Department testified that “it was one of the safest investments that the trust had so far as value was concerned”, (R166a).</p>

Frank Rhodes died in 1939. The present bill was filed in 1940, against his executors and Samuel Rhodes individually to compel them to withdraw the bond and mortgage from the pool, to replace them with cash or equivalent securities, and to pay all arrearages of interest and taxes.</p>

Nevertheless, he concluded that a breach of trust had been committed and that Samuel Rhodes, as a recipient of the loan proceeds, was individually liable. Exceptions were filed by both parties. The court en banc entered a final decree dismissing defendants’ exceptions but reinstating the bill as to the executors, who were ordered to join with Samuel Rhodes in paying $31,966.66 into the pool, with <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>interest, taxes and costs of foreclosure.

    <p id="b453-5" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[147,1182,1153,969]]]'>Are these two officers of the corporate trustee personally liable for the act of the corporation? The only facts established by plaintiffs show that one defendant, Samuel Rhodes, obtained a mortgage loan upon adequate security and with the approval of the proper officers of the corporation. There was nothing unlawful or improper in this initial transaction, and even if there were, these plaintiffs could assert no interest therein. It is also clear that Samuel Rhodes and his father did not request the transfer to the mortgage pool, take any part in it, had no actual knowledge concerning it, and derived no benefit thereby. The transfer was made by other officers and employees of the corporation entrusted with the duty of supervising trust investments. It was reported to a finance committee of which Samuel Rhodes was not a member and upon which Frank Rhodes did not sit. The report of the trust officer to the Board of Directors did not identify any mortgages transferred to the pool.</p>

It <em>assumed </em>that the transaction could not have occurred without their knoAvledge and consent. This assumption is clearly <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>contrary to the plain facts in the record. At the most, they are charged with nonfeasance, and not with misfeasance or malfeasance.</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[235,471,1158,473]]]'>We have been unable to find any authority in this jurisdiction for the imposition of liability on these officers and directors. The only case cited by the court below in support of its decree is <em>Bailey et al. v.

That was a suit by <em>stockholders </em>of a corporation against its president for malfeasance and misfeasance — making use of his office and corporate funds for personal profit. There is no analogy whatever between that case and the one now before us.</p>
    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.5",454,[234,964,1174,1136]]]'>It is true that a director or officer of a corporation may have personal liability for damages suffered by third persons when he knowingly participates in a wrongful act. See <em>Malone v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/231/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="231 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="973899" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0534-01">231 <em>Pa. </em>534</a>; <em>Warner v.

But where, as in this case, directors or officers are charged with nonfeasance, no individual liability attaches. This has always been the rule in this jurisdiction. See <em>Spering’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/71/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="71 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1031243" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0011-01">71 Pa. 11</a>; <em>Swentzel v.

In the latter case we held that directors of a corporation could not be charged with individual liability for conversion of property by the corporation of which they had no actual knowledge. However (at page 458), Justice Schapper, afterwards Chief Justice, pointed out that a director who participated actively in the conversion would have been personally liable. The case therefore admirably illustrates the dif-. ferent consequences attendant upon malfeasance and nonfeasance. See also <em>Mechanics’ B. &amp; S. Assn.
