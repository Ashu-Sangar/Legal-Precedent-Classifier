Some of the defendants filed preliminary objections to the bill on the ground that it' disclosed laches and that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations. The Court sustained the objections, dismissed the bill, and refused the prayer of a petition which the Secretary filed for a rehearing and an opportunity to explain the reasons for the delay.

      <em>. </em>The statute cannot be extended by the plaintiff’s act or failure to act; he cannot arrest the running of the statute by his own negligence or for his own convenience.

Obviously the answer depends upon the circumstances of the particular case. If there are no unusual or complicated conditions, and it is clear from the beginning that the bank is so hopelessly insolvent that a call upon the stockholders for the full balance of their unpaid stock subscriptions will be inevitable, there would be no justification for any prolonged delay on the part of the Secretary in making the assessment. If, on the other hand, the assets or the liabilities are of a more or less contingent nature, and only the gradual processes of liquidation can determine whether there will be a likely necessity for such a call, and if so, whether for all or only part of the unpaid balance of the subscriptions, the reasonable time for ascertainment of the controlling facts must naturally be correspondingly extended. A large measure of administrative discretion must be left to the receiver himself, it being important that unnecessary and excessive calls be avoided (see <em>Fisher v. Whiton, </em><a href="/us/317/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="63 S. Ct. 175" data-case-ids="303798" data-case-paths="/us/317/0217-01">63 Sup. Ct. Rep. 175</a>, 176). In considering what is a “reasonable time,” it is a factor to be borne in mind that the longer the delay in making the call the greater the gain to the stockholders in being permitted to retain their money, since interest does not run on their subscriptions until the demand is made. It is also to be noted that section 723 of the Department of Banking Code of 1933 provides that if “at any time” after he takes possession it shall appear to the Secretary that the assets will be insufficient to pay the debts in full, he shall, “as soon as expedient,” estimate the amount which shall be assessed against the stockholders; thus the legislature apparently intended to give considerable latitude to the Secretary in regard to the time in which to determine the need for an assessment; by way of contrast, section 705 provides that he must determine within a fixed period of six months after he takes possession whether or not to liquidate the business and distribute the assets of the institution.</p>

While the original appraisement showed a considerable excess of liabilities over' the estimated value of the assets, and this might have enabled the Secretary to determine promptly that a call for the unpaid stock subscriptions was unavoidable, much would necessarily depend upon the nature and marketability of the assets — something not disclosed in the record. Moreover, the Secretary, in his petition for a rehearing, asserted that his delay in making demand was due largely to the necessity of waiting until the litigation in <em>Harr v. Mikalarias, </em><a href="/pa/328/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="328 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="1179737" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0049-01">328 Pa. 49</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2086" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="195 A. 86">195 A. 86</a>; <em>Gordon v.

If it be determined, after all the facts shall have been presented, that the Secretary acted within a reasonable time in making his demand for payment of the unpaid subscriptions, the statute of limitations would bar thé action only after the expiration of six years from the time when payment was required by the demand. If, however, it be concluded that the principle of “reasonable time” required, under all the circumstances, that the Secretary should have made his demand earlier, the six years would have started to run from the time when such demand should have been made. Only by presentation and consideration of all the pertinent facts and circumstances at the trial of the cause can the question be satisfactorily determined. The case is not sufficiently clear on the face of the bill to justify a summary decree. Defendants should therefore be required to answer the bill of complaint and the cause be allowed to proceed to a hearing.</p>
