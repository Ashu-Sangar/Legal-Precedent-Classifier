The action was to recover from the defendants a deficiency judgment upon a bond given to secure a mortgage on real estate. The trial judge found that the bond “did not impose an unlimited personal and individual liability, but was a special agreement ... to look only to the trust property,” and, therefore, “the plaintiff is not entitled to recover from the defendant Wallower<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the deficiency as claimed.” The Court below dismissed <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>the plaintiff’s exceptions to this finding and entered judgment in favor of the defendant-appellee, E.

Hood &amp; Co., acting as broker, made a written application to the New York Life Insurance Company for a mortgage loan of $125,000, which application was on a printed form furnished by the New York Life Insurance Company, (hereinafter re-, ferred to as the Insurance Company). This application gave the “Name of the Borrower: The Lancaster Apartment Co. of Philadelphia,” and in the blank for “Information regarding Borrower ... :” it was set forth that “The Lancaster Apartment Company of Philadelphia is a company formed under Agreement and Declaration of Trust under the Massachusetts Trust Act and consists of'the following trustees: — ,” (here follows the names of the trustees in the Declaration of Trust). At the time the making of the loan by the Insurance Company was under consideration, it also had before it a letter from the broker which described “The Lancaster Apartments” in detail and. stated that the “Title to the property is held by the Lancaster Apartments Company of Philadelphia, a Company formed under Agreement and Declaration of Trust under the Massachusetts Trust Act and consists” of the trustees, naming them. The application and this letter came before Charles M. Swezey, a lawyer,, employed by the Insurance Company for 17 years and associated with its general counsel, and at the time he testified he was still in its employ. The Insurance Com-, pany’s “instructions” to its counsel “for mortgage loans by the Company” is “to proceed with the closing of the mortgage loan if the title and conditions are found satisfactory.” The only evidence showing to whom this loan was authorized by the Insurance Company is found in Mr. Swezey’s letter, written in the name of the General Counsel, to the Merion Title and Trust Company in which it is expressly stated that “This Company has authorized a loan, ... to be secured by mortgage on property, 6355 Lancaster Avenue . . . , . with the Lancaster Apartment Company of Philadelphia as mortgagor.” This letter was written after he received the <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>application and broker’s letter showing that the borrower was a Massachusetts Trust. The trial judge found as a fact, to which no exceptions were taken, that “The New York Life Insurance Company employed the Merion Title and Trust Co. of Philadelphia to search the title and insure the loan.”</p>

A settlement certificate was forwarded as well ...” Mr. Swezey examined them, sent them to the mortgage loan department for approval, which was done that day. On the same day, Mr. Swezey wrote the Merion Title and Trust Company returning the mortgage and stated that upon receipt of advice that the mortgage had been recorded, he would forward a check with which to close the loan. Upon receipt of the Merion Company’s telegram that the mortgage had been recorded, Mr. Swezey drew a warrant for a check to be dated January 12, 1925, and forwarded the check to the Merion Company.</p>

The Philadelphia Company agreed with the Corona Realty Company, then owner of the mortgaged premises, to extend the time for the payment of the principal of the bond and mortgage for three years from January 7,1928. On May 9, following, the Philadelphia Company assigned the bond and mortgage to The Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities, Trustee, the plaintiff-appellant in this lawsuit. (We will hereinafter refer to this Company as the Pennsylvania Company.) On September 20, 1931, the bond and mortgage was again past due, and an agreement was again made with the then owner, the Corona Realty Company, to extend the time for the payment of the principal of the bond and mortgage for an additional period of three years from January 7,1931.</p>

This is because the assignees of this bond, admittedly, failed to make inquiry of the obligor, and both assignees therefore took it subject to any defense to which it was subject in the hands of the obligee, the New York Life Insurance Company. If the appellee here had a defense to the bond while it was in the hands of the New York Life Insurance Company, the obligee, he has the same defense to the bond in the hands of the assignee. If the assignee had made due inquiry, it might have learned of the limitation of the liability claimed by the defendants. If, after inquiry, this defense was not then declared, the bond in its hands would be without restrictions. See <em>Lane v.

They further contend, that since the obligations on their face show this, that the courts must hold that <em>no </em>personal liability on the part of the trustees was intended. In this connection they point out that the original parties to the bond and the mortgage and the power of attorney to confess judgment which was attached to the bond, state in specific terms that the instruments are made in the name of the principal and not in the name of the trustees; that the promises or undertaking are made in the name of the principal; that nowhere in the instruments are there personal covenants by the trustees, and that the signature is that of the principal “by its Trustees” (as indicated in the mortgage and in the bond, and in the Power of Attorney to Confess Judgment attached to the bond, executed and delivered to and accepted- by the Obligee).</p>

These documents show also that the covenants are those of the Massachusetts Trust, the Lancaster Apartment Company, <em>its </em>successors and assigns.

That was clearly “in view of the parties”.

Williston on Contracts, revised edition, vol. 1, sec. 313a, recognizes the rule that in contracts with trustees there <em>may </em>be situations where “the facts justify the inference that the parties contracted subject to said limitation”, i. e., the trust agreement’s limitation as to personal liability. See also Bogert on Trusts and Trustees, vol. 2, sec. 300, as to the basis of “an inference of an agreement not to hold the trustee personally.” Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations, Permanent Edition, Yol. 16, Sec. 8254, page 1152, contains the following statement: “. . . The mere signing of an obligation by trustees in their individual names with the descriptive words Trustees’ or the like added to their signatures does not alone exempt them from personal liability, but the contrary is usually held where they sign in the trust name or in such a manner as clearly to specify that they are signing on behalf of the trust alone and not as individuals, ...” Scott on Trusts, Yol. 2, Sec. 263.2 makes this statement: “. . .

At the time of taking this assignment, The Pennsylvania Company did not ask any one for a declaration of no set-off except the Corona Realty Company, the then-owner of the premises.

The plaintiff knew that it was contracting with the trustees of such a trust, i. e., with persons acting for others in a fiduciary and representative capacity; that the defendant was a national banking association of limited powers, and that their powers and duties as trustees were defined in an instrument which was explicitly referred to in the contract and was a matter of public record. The reference to the declaration of trust in the contract was not casual or accidental, it was plainly for some important purpose; it is at the very beginning of the contract and is obviously the foundation on which the owner’s side of it rests. . . . Was the plaintiff at liberty to ignore the fact that the declaration of trust was open to its inspection as a part of a public record, and to claim that it was unaware of the limitation on the personal liability of the trustees therein contained and did not agree thereto? We do not think so. On the contrary, we think that the explicit reference to the declaration of trust, and to the public record of it where it could be found, put the plaintiff on its notice to ascertain whether its provisions affected its contract with the defendant, and that the plaintiff was bound by it, at least, to the extent to which it imposed limitations on the powers or liabilities of the persons who signed on behalf of the trust. The case is clearly distinguishable from those in which contracts were made by trustees in which there was no such explicit reference to the declaration of trust.”</p>
