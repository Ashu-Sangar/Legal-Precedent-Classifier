    <p id="b502-9" data-blocks='[["BL_502.14",502,[225,1391,1157,426]]]'>The question is this: If a creditor has lost his lien on the real estate of a decedent by failing to bring and index an action within one year after the decease of the debtor, as prescribed in section 15(a) of the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, P. L. 447, can he, after the expiration of that period,' obtain from the orphans’ court an order for collection of the rents for the purpose of paying the decedent’s debts as provided in section 14 of that Act?</p>

The land itself, when brought into administration either by the provisions of the will or <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>by proper legal procedure, has always been, in Pennsylvania, an asset for the payment of tbe decedent’s debts, but section 14, in making the rents an additional asset for that purpose, was an innovation in the law. According to the report of the commissioners who framed the Fiduciaries Act — which report may properly be considered in construing this section <em>(Tarlo’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/315/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="315 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1156734" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0321-01">315 Pa. 321</a>, 324-326, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.%20139" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="172 A. 139">172 A. 139</a>, 140, 141 — it would seem that the object was to give creditors the right to appropriate the interim rents pending the sale of the land, and it was stated that such application of the rents “during the period of administration” might in some cases obviate the necessity for a sale.</p>
