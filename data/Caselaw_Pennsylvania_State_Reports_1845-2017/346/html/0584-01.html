Appellant alleges that a contractor paid for materials furnished a sub-contractor <em>after the materialman had lost his right of action </em>on the contractor’s bond by failing to institute suit thereon within the statutory year for such suit and that therefore such payment by the contractor was made too late to permit the contractor to recover the amount so paid from the surety or the sub-contractor’s bond of indemnity.

(hereinafter referred to as Fiumara), for the construction of additions to the sewage disposal plant of the Veterans Administration Facility, Long Island, New York. Fiumara as principal, and the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co. as surety, delivered to the United States their bond conditioned for the payment of claims of all persons furnishing labor and materials in the prosecution of the work pursuant to the Miller Act. Fiumara engaged W. E. Foley and Bro. Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Foley), on October 14, 1937, to furnish certain materials and to do certain plumbing and mechanical work in connection with the construction of the additions, for the agreed price of $36,000. On October 19, 1937, Foley as principal, and the appellant, American Surety Company as surety, delivered to Fiumara their bond in the sum of $36,000. conditioned that “the principal shall faithfully perform the contract on its part, free and clear of all liens arising out of claims <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>for labor and materials entering into the construction, and indemnify and save harmless the obligee from all loss, cost or damage which it may suffer by reason of the failure so to do.”</p>

Foley, when it refused to further complete its subcontract, maintained that under its interpretation of the contract it did all the work it was obligated to perform and demanded the balance. Fiumara then completed the work in certain specifications under the subcontract at a cost to him of $14,963.35. In addition to this, Fiumara, on November 11, 1937, gave Warren Foundry &amp; Pipe Corporation, its guarantee in writing to pay it for materials furnished to Foley for the project. The material furnished under this letter of guarantee amounted to $9,924.75.

Does the Circuit Court’s, adjudication of this question warrant the plea of “res judicata” in this action? We hold with the court below that it does. Judge Swann, speaking for the Circuit Court of Appeals, says (see <em>Fiumara v. American Surety Co., </em><a href="/f2d/113/0888-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="113 F.2d 888" data-case-ids="1023131" data-case-paths="/f2d/113/0888-01">113 F. (2d) 888</a>, 889) : “Prior to the trial and the district court’s decision Fiumara had sustained no loss on account of his liability to Warren Corporation. On August 8, 1939, however, he paid $8,500.00 in satisfaction of a judgment obtained by Warren Corporation in an action upon Fiumara’s guaranty. These facts were brought to the attention of the district court by a motion to amend the judgment, entered October 16th, 1939, to provide the dismissal of Fiumara’s counterclaim and third party complaint against American Surety Company should be without prejudice to the institution of a further action against it. The payment to Warren Corporation in satisfaction of its judgment obtained upon Fiumara’s guaranty extinguished also his liability upon the Miller Act bond. It should be considered as a payment of that liability as well as of the judgment, and as such it was a loss against which the subcontractor’s bond afforded Fiumara indemnity. As the term of court had not expired and the judgment was. still within the court’s control when Fiumara moved to modify it,' we think that motion should have been granted. Accordingly the order is reversed and the judgment modified to provide that it shall be without prejudice to the institution of a further action against the American Surety Company. Costs of the appeal are awarded to the <em>appellant.”</em>

It appears here that the essential merits of the controversy were involved, not only in the pleadings and the trial of the cause, but in the very judgment of the court below which was declared to be erroneous, and in Piumara’s motion to amend the judgment, and in the argument on the appeal, and in the decision of the appellate court. We agree with this statement of Judge Finletter : “It can hardly be said that the Circuit Court meant to leave the question open after it had taken the trouble to decide it on the merits. All that was intended by the phrase 'without prejudice’ was to reserve future action based upon changed conditions, not to weaken the decision of the Court on the facts before it. <em>Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis Ry. Co. </em>(1919), <a href="/us/249/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="39 S. Ct. 237" data-case-ids="3686203" data-case-paths="/us/249/0134-01">39 Sup.

Even conceding that the Circuit Court of Appeals did not intend to determine the cause finally and upon its merits, and that the use of the words “without prejudice” by that appellate court prevents the successful plea of res ad judicata here, we still hold that the conclusions reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals are correct. That court properly construed the effect of the payment by Fiumara to the Warren Company as being “a loss against which the subcontractor’s bond afforded Fiumara indemnity.” At that, it did not go as far as the Pennsylvania courts go on the construction of such contracts of suretyship. That court adopted the rule of <em>strictissimi juris </em>.which in our courts has been deemed inapplicable to corporate compensated sureties. See: <em>M. E. Church of Franklin v. Equitable Surety Co., </em><a href="/pa/269/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="269 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="1063602" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0411-01">269 Pa. 411</a>, 415, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.%20551" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="112 A. 551">112 A. 551</a>, 552. We might properly have held, under the circumstances in this case, that “the loss, cost or damage” against which this bond was to indemnify, “intended that kind of a loss, which, in ordinary nomenclature and thought comes into existence when the liability of the assured becomes irretrievably fixed” as “by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction”. See: <em>Schambs v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em><a href="/f/259/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="259 F. 55" data-case-ids="5389090" data-case-paths="/f/259/0055-01">259 F. 55</a>, 60, s. c. <a href="/f/263/0895-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="263 F. 895" data-case-ids="3944470" data-case-paths="/f/263/0895-01">263 F. 895</a> (cert. den. <a href="/citations/?q=253%20U.S.%20494" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="253 U.S. 494">253 U.

Payment alone of this judgment does not create the loss. We defined “loss” in <em>Malley v.

Voluntary or involuntary separation from one’s money is not the only criterion of loss. Any shrinkage in value of estate or property may on proper occasions be rightfully so termed. Any depreciation or depletion of property values, as well as the destruction of all property value through judicial sale or otherwise would likewise come within the <em>definition; </em>the concrete result of these factors as it affects the owner, is a loss. (Citing <em>Schambs v. </em>

      <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra.) Therefore, following the above decisions, under a policy such as we have before us, we hold there is a potential loss, though money may not have been actually paid; the insured may sue the company directly after judgment and before he pays anything, ...” In Pennsylvania, the corporate compensated surety “in all essential particulars ... is an insurance company,” and is so treated in determining questions regarding its liability to obligees in such bonds. See <em>South Phila. State Bank v. National Surety Co., </em><a href="/pa/288/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="288 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1100823" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0300-01">288 Pa. 300</a>, 305. The entry of the judgment in the case of <em>Warren v. Fiumara </em>before the appellee paid anything could properly be considered as “a damage” or “a loss against which the subcontractor’s bond afforded Fiumara indemnity.” This judgment was entered on July 24, 1939, one day before Judge Galston rendered his opinion, and five days before the expiration of the one year in which the Surety Company said the loss should have been fixed. It may well be considered a loss within the condition of the bond. But we need not decide the issue now whether under our decisions this “was a loss against which the subcontractor’s bond afforded Fiumara indemnity” for it was judicially determined and conclusively settled by the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit. The facts and the question became res- judicata and as such should not again be litigated here. See <em>Grubb v.

The Warren Company claim was expressly admitted by Foley and the Surety Company. The day before this action was brought by the plaintiff against the Surety Company, a conference was held in the office of the Surety Company, at which were present Foley, George B. Crosby, representative of the Surety Company; Andrew Carlson of Carlson &amp; <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>Sons; Fiumara and liis counsel. The position the Surety Company and Foley then was that Foley’s subcontract had been fully completed and that Fiumara owed Foley the balance due on it of $14,999.14, and that from this sum Fiumara should pay the material bills of the Warren Company and Carlson &amp; Sons. Fiumara requested the representative of the defendant Surety Company to pay the materialmen and the representative replied: “You go ahead and pay them and take it from your contract.” At no time was the validity of these two claims for material challenged. The next day this action was started, and in the first statement of claim plaintiff charged that Foley failed to pay Warren &amp; Company and Carlson &amp; Sons’ claims in connection with the project, and that by virtue of the terms of the bond given by the plaintiff under the Miller Act, “plaintiff will be obliged and legally bound to pay said claims.” This averment was admitted by the appellant with the added averment that the “subcontractor has heretofore requested plaintiff to pay said two materialmen the respective sum due each of them for material furnished to said public improvement and to deduct the sum so paid from the balance due subcontractor, but that plaintiff . . . has refused so to do.” The court below found as a fact, that, “The validity of plaintiff’s claim based upon his payment of the Warren claim was admitted by the defendant Surety Company. In all the pleadings until the last affidavit of defense and in the pre-trial conference, plaintiff’s claim based on his payment of the Warren bill Avas recognized. In a conference between all the parties, in which defendant was represented by its counsel, the latter advised the plaintiff to ‘pay them and take it from your contract’. The plaintiff relied upon this attitude of the defendant and paid the Warren claim.”</p>

Not until after Judge Galston’s opinion dismissing Foley’s claim, and almost fifteen months after payment of the Warren &amp; Company claim, and for the first time in the third amended affidavit of defense here filed did the Surety Company raise the defense that the Warren &amp; Company’s claim was paid belatedly and that the appellee should not have paid it since Warren &amp; Company did not bring suit under the Miller Act within the one year period. Why Warren &amp; Company was required to bring a suit in New York under the Miller Act when all parties in interest admitted the claim and recognized its validity is not apparent. See: <em>American Surety Co. v. Wheeling Structural Steel Co., </em><a href="/f-supp/26/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="26 F. Supp. 395" data-case-ids="4161142" data-case-paths="/f-supp/26/0395-01">26 F. Supp. 395</a>, 400.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> Every act of Foley and the defendant Surety Company, until after payment to Warren &amp; Company by the plaintiff, indicated that this materialman’s claim was a valid one, and that therefore it could be paid by Fiumara, without hazarding the interposition of some technical defense under the Miller Act. “The case falls clearly within the class in which the allegation of any specific ground of objection, of defense, or of excuse for the nonperformance of a contract operates as a waiver of all others, and as an estoppel, by the act of the party, against setting up any other ground.”: <em>United Fruit co. v. Bisese, </em>25 Pa. Sup. Ct. 170, 174. See also <em>Popper v. Rosen, </em><a href="/pa/292/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="292 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="1109725" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0122-01">292 Pa. 122</a>, 126; <em>W. &amp; A.

We agree with the learned judge of the court below who found that “had defendant raised this second contention in its first affidavit of defense”, before the limitation had run under the Miller Act, “plaintiff would have easily met the same by having Warren file a complaint under the Miller Act, and thereupon pay the claim.”</p>
