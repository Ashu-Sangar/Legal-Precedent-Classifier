Subsequently a valuable barn was destroyed by fire, seriously diminishing the value of the farm; decedent collected and retained the insurance. In the early part of 1941 he verbally contracted to sell the property for $2,600; settlement was to be made on April 1, 1941, but was postponed because it was found necessary to obtain the release of a dower charge and it was agreed that the purchaser -should meanwhile enter into possession. Testator died on- April 6,1941, without having executed a deed. By decree of May 1, 1941, the-court, on petition of the executor, ordered specific performance of the contract and conveyance was made accordingly.</p>

That intention must be gathered not only from the language used in creating the bequest but from the provisions of the will as a whole, and if there is doubt in regard to it courts incline toward a construction which classifies the legacy as demonstrative rather than specific: <em>Balliet’s A.ppeal, </em><a href="/pa/14/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="14 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="405891" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0451-01">14 Pa. 451</a>, 461; <em>Walls v.

As Jacob had already obtained $6,000, and each daughter $2,000, he gave to each daughter $4,000 more and to Clayton the farm and its contents, the value of which he expressly fixed at the sum of $6,000 “so that, my said son shall receive the use and benefit of <em>said amount </em>out of my estate.” The only departure from absolute equality was that, for a reason best known to himself, he restricted the gift to Clayton to a life interest, vesting in the trustees discretionary power to pay Mm any amounts of principal or income they might deem best. Thus the case is similar to, and indeed governed by <em>Hammer’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/158/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="158 Pa. 632" data-case-ids="848274" data-case-paths="/pa/158/0632-01">158 Pa. 632</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20A.%20231" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="28 A. 231">28 A. 231</a>, which in <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>effect ruled that although a bequest or devise may apparently be specific in its terms it is to be construed as being demonstrative if it is evidently given as a means of carrying out the testator’s intention to divide his estate equally. In that case there was a provision for the sale of real estate and out of the proceeds to pay to the testator’s son $3,000 “to equalize him with my other sons . . . who were advanced three thousand dollars each in the purchase of real estate,” and it was held that this was a demonstrative legacy, although, were it not for the expression of the intention to equalize the shares among his sons, it would have appeared to be a specific legacy. Upon somewhat analogous facts the same conclusion was reached in <em>Lake v. Copeland, <a href="/tex/82/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="82 Tex. 464" data-case-ids="2213825" data-case-paths="/tex/82/0464-01">82 </a></em><a href="/tex/82/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="82 Tex. 464" data-case-ids="2213825" data-case-paths="/tex/82/0464-01">Tex. 464</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20S.W.%20786" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="17 S.W. 786">17 S.

    <p id="b124-4" data-blocks='[["BL_124.4",124,[176,1115,1158,1198]]]'>Since, then, the devise to Clayton is a demonstrative one, it was not adeemed by the sale of the farm, which merely necessitates the substitution of $6,000 in cash or other assets to make up the trust res. As-the will directs that Clayton’s share shall be held in trust and that he shall receive only such part of the income or principal as the trustees, exercising their judgment as to his best interests, may give him or expend for his maintenance and support, this provision cannot be nullified by an agreement among the beneficiaries of the estate destroying the trust: <em>Schwehm’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/264/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="264 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1048534" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0355-01">264 Pa. 355</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20A.%20699" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="107 A. 699">107 A. 699</a>. Moreover, upon the death of Clayton the balance of the funds then in the hands of the trustees is to be divided equally among testator’s then surviving children or, if any of them are deceased, their shares are to be paid to their children; the contingent interests of testator’s grandchildren, including possibly some yet unborn, cannot be defeated by a family settlement to which they are not parties: <em>Stewart’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/253/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="253 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1024038" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0277-01">253 Pa. 277</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.%20569" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="98 A. 569">98 A. 569</a>. The court, therefore, properly awarded the six thousand dollars in trust for the use of Clayton in accordance with the terms of the will.</p>
