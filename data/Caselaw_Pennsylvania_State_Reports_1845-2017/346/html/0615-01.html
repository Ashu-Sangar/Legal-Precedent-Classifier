    <p id="b638-12" data-blocks='[["BL_638.20",638,[230,1729,1159,479]]]'>. On July 10, 1920, The Commonwealth Title Insurance and Trust Company was appointed guardian of the Estate of Millard P. Snyder, a weak-minded person, now confined in the United States Veterans5 Hospital, at Coatesville, Pennsylvania. An inventory was filed in 1926. Provident Trust Company of Philadelphia succeeded by merger to the guardianship, and, on May 19,1942, filed its First Account. The court below appointed an examiner and listed the account for audit.</p>
    <p id="b638-13" data-blocks='[["BL_638.21",638,[230,2220,1157,209]],["BL_639.1",639,[189,294,1152,371]]]'>The account shows that the estate increased from $1,515 in 1920 to $41,017.55 in 1941. During this period the guardian received $11,861 from the Federal Government as disability compensation to the incompetent, and <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>$14,490 in benefits from war risk insurance. These funds with the incompetent’s final army pay of $90, and a refund of $75.90 in war risk insurance premiums were invested in Treasury and private bonds and in first mortgages, and the accumulations were reinvested. Some of the mortgages have been foreclosed and the real estate is held by the guardian, pending liquidation.</p>
    <p id="b639-4" data-blocks='[["BL_639.4",639,[190,676,1151,807]]]'>Exceptions to the account were filed by counsel for appellant on behalf of two brothers and a sister of the incompetent as next-of-kin, seeking to surcharge the accountant for two mortgage investments and for $2,001.36 paid to the United States Veterans’ Bureau to provide spending money to the incompetent at rates varying from $10 to $20 per month. Objection was also made to a credit of $2,469.24 for commissions to the accountant. The sister and one brother of the incompetent having indicated that they were unwilling to join in the exceptions, supplemental exceptions were filed by appellant alone, asking, in addition to the foregoing items, that the accountant be surcharged for small Christmas gifts to the incompetent totalling $125, and charging generally mismanagement of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b639-5" data-blocks='[["BL_639.5",639,[188,1494,1151,746]]]'>At the audit, testimony was received sur the exceptions, and a “final judgment” was entered by the auditing judge confirming the account. No exception to this order was filed. Appellant’s petitions to strike the examiner’s report from the record for irregularities, and for the amendment of the record to include certain colloquy of court and counsel alleged to have been omitted, and requests for exceptions and rulings which counsel had neglected to make at trial to certain evidence, were dismissed. Appellant excepted and appealed to this Court from the orders dismissing his petitions and from the “final judgment”. An opinion sustaining the action of the auditing judge was filed by the court below en banc.</p>

Many irregularities of procedure, on the part both of appellant and of the court below, appear in the record. The auditing judge should not have designated his adjudication of the account as a “final judgment”, but as appellant filed no exception to it, he cannot complain that the court en banc did not hear him. Although the court entered no final decree, this court will construe the opinion of the court en banc to be an adoption of the “final judgment” of the auditing judge as its final decree.</p>
    <p id="b640-4" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[232,941,1159,533]]]'>There is no need to consider at length appellant’s argument regarding irregularities in the reception of the examiner’s report. The fact that the auditing judge ambiguously designated him as an “examiner or auditor” and “approved” his report cannot obscure the fact that his function was solely that of an examiner, and adviser to the court, and not an auditor, empowered to hear and make recommendations on claims. Appellant is therefore mistaken in assuming that the rules of the court below applicable to auditors were violated.</p>
    <p id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.5",640,[229,1485,1160,806]]]'>The court below has already passed upon, and rejected, appellant’s contention that important omissions exist in the transcript of the case. The auditing judge properly refused to permit appellant to read into the record the World War Veterans’ Act of 1924 and its amendments. These laws are matters of which our courts will take judicial notice. See <em>Di Donato v. Phila. &amp; R. Ry. Co., </em><a href="/pa/266/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="266 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1056006" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0412-01">266 Pa. 412</a>, 416; <em>Hendricks v. Pyramid M.

As to appellant’s contention that he was thereby deprived of the right to raise a federal question concerning the violation of these statutes, it is sufficient to say that the record clearly indicates that the question was raised below in appellant’s requests for conclusions of law and disposed of in the opinion of the court en banc.</p>
    <p id="b640-6" data-blocks='[["BL_640.6",640,[228,2300,1158,102]],["BL_641.1",641,[146,284,1153,1462]]]'>There is no merit in the contention, and it comes with peculiarly bad grace from appellant, to object that the <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>incompetent’s funds were used to provide him with clothing and small comforts. The accountant paid out these sums to the hospital authorities at their request, and with the approval of the Veterans’ Administration and the office of the Solicitor General. The Act of July 2, 1926, ch. 723, Section 9, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20Stat.%20794" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="44 Stat. 794">44 Stat. 794</a>, amending the Act of June 7,1924, ch. 320, Section 202, 38 U. S. C. A., Section 484, provides that where a hospitalized veteran “is financially unable to supply himself with clothing, he shall also be furnished with such clothing as the Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs may deem necessary. . . It is further provided that a veteran’s pension shall not be subject to deduction for “board, maintenance or any other purpose incident to hospitalization” while he is in a government hospital. Here the incompetent is possessed of a considerable estate and is well able to pay for these few items of clothing and small incidentals. There is no evidence that any part of the incompetent’s pension was used for his board or maintenance at the hospital, which fact alone distinguishes this case from <em>Reynolds v. United States, </em><a href="/us/292/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="292 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="429833" data-case-paths="/us/292/0443-01">292 U. S. 443</a>, or that it was used to purchase anything which the hospital or Veterans’ Bureau was obliged by law to supply. The federal officers charged with the care of the incompetent and with the administration of the Veterans’ Act and its amendments have supervised and approved all of these expenditures.</p>

The first of these was for $1,600 secured upon premises 2318 N. Mutter Street, Philadelphia ; the second, for $1,400 secured upon premises 2811 W. Gordon Street, Philadelphia. The evidence shows that these properties were appraised at values far in excess of the mortgages at the time that the mortgages were acquired by accountant. Appellant contends that the accountant committed a breach of trust by transferring these mortgages to the guardian’s estate. The testimony shows, however, that the mortgages were originally acquired by the bank, and held but for a short <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>period, solely for the purpose of trust investment, and the transactions are therefore within the rule of <em>Greenawalt's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/343/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="343 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="1208373" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0413-01">343 Pa. 413</a>, and <em>Saeger Estates, </em><a href="/pa/340/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="340 Pa. 73" data-case-ids="1203316" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0073-01">340 Pa. 73</a>, rather than that of <em>Tracy et al., Co-Trustees, v.

The fact that the appraisals were made by an employee of the corporate fiduciary does not affect their value in the absence of any showing of fraud or bad faith. <em>Saeger Estates, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b642-4" data-blocks='[["BL_642.4",642,[248,710,1156,153]]]'>Appellant also contends that the accountant in both instances violated the Act bf June 13, 1836, P. L. 589, Section 34, 50 PS, Section 755, which provides:</p>

In that case, however, as a careful reading shows, the fiduciary was surcharged for investing without prior approval in bonds of a private corporation which becomes valueless. The discussion makes it plain that these bonds were considered as <em>non-legal investments, </em>and it was pointed out that a fiduciary makes such investments at his own risk where he fails to obtain the protection afforded by the Act of 1836 against individual liability by applying to the court for approval. It was said, page 248, “If, therefore, the committee disregards the act of assembly and invests the trust funds <em>in other than statutory securities </em>and without the consent of the court, he does so at his own and not at the lunatic’s peril.” Referring to the surcharge imposed, it was said, page 248, “While this may be a hardship upon the committee, he could have relieved himself <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>from all liability for tlie investment of the funds of the cestui que trust by applying to the common pleas for an order of court. The legislature has made provision for the protection of the committee of a lunatic in the investment of trust funds, and the committee should avail himself of the statute.”</p>
    <p id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.4",643,[138,623,1155,1244]]]'>It is manifest, therefore, that the act did not require, mandatorily, that the court must approve all investments. It did not even require that the court approve non-legal investments. It merely provided, as interpreted in the <em>McConnell </em>case, a means whereby the fiduciary could make <em>non-legal investments </em>without danger of individual liability. See also <em>Gibson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/312/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="312 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1150647" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0359-01">312 Pa. 359</a>; <em>Henry’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/341/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="341 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1204476" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0439-01">341 Pa. 439</a>. This interpretation was reiterated by this Court in <em>Curran’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/312/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="312 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="1150684" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0416-01">312 Pa. 416</a>, 423, where it was pointed out that the Court in <em>McConnell’s Estate </em>had overlooked the fact that the bonds in question were secured upon real estate, and were not, therefore, non-legal investments. <em>Riebel’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/321/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="321 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1165882" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0145-01">321 Pa. 145</a>, referring to the <em>McConnell </em>case, also makes it clear that the former decision was intended to relate to non-legal investments. If any doubt whatever remains upon the construction of the Act of 1836 it should be resolved now, and definitely, by our holding that it does not require prior approval of the court of <em>legal or statutory trust investments </em>by guardians of weak-minded persons. Here the accountant invested in first mortgages of real estate which have always been recognized as legal trust investments. <em>Curran’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/312/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="312 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1150647" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0359-01">supra.</a></p>

The fact that payments by the government were made periodically, instead of in a lump sum, is immaterial.
