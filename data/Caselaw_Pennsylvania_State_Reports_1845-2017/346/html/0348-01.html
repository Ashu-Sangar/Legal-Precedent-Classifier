Loeb, the appellant, delivered three fur coats to appellee, Jacques Perber, a fur dealer, for the purpose of storage. At the time of delivery of the coats to him appellee signed a printed “Storage Receipt”, providing as follows: “In consideration of $25.00 charges I hereby agree to keep the said articles free from damage by moths <em>and to return the said articles in the same condition as when received by me.” </em>The form used also stated: “And further, it is <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>understood that I have caused the above goods to be insured against loss by Fire or Burglary up to the 31st day of December, 1941, for the amount of $-, the value hereby, agreed upon by the bailor”; but this clause was stricken out on the receipt issued to appellant by a horizontal line drawn through its entire length. Upon the failure of appellee to return one of the fur coats, worth $3500, on demand, appellant instituted this action of assumpsit to recover its value. Appellee filed an affidavit of defense admitting his failure to return the coat but denying liability therefor on the ground that prior to appellant’s demand for its return it had been stolen from his place of business by a trusted employee without any fault or negligence on his part. On the theory that the agreement “to return the said articles in the same condition as when received” obligated appellee to make good the loss of the coat irrespective of negligence, appellant filed a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The court below discharged the rule after argument thereon, and this appeal followed.</p>

Jur., Bailments, section 180. A mere agreement to return the bailed property, without more, does hot impose such unusual responsibility; and the same is generally held though the promise is “to return in good condition”, or as in the present case, “in the same condition as when received.” The reason for this is well stated’in <em>Young v. </em>Leary, <a href="/ny/135/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="135 N.Y. 569" data-case-ids="2255067" data-case-paths="/ny/135/0569-01">135 N.

Jur., Bailments, section 182. Here there is more reason for so holding than in the usual case in view of inclusion in the form of agreement of the specific provision for obtaining insurance which was stricken. If that provision had been permitted to remain as part of the contract between the parties, it would undoubtedly have indicated that appellant should be entitled to the higher protection contended for, but by the same token elimination of the provision would seem to indicate that the affording of such protection was not contemplated. As the court below states: “It is obvious from the contract that taking out the insurance was not for the protection of the bailee, but for the bailor, and that, if the bailor wished to be so protected, there was an additional fee for that added security.” The sum mentioned as the consideration for appellee’s services was plainly nominal and, considering the value of the bailed articles, was obviously intended to cover storage only.</p>

The distinction between the two classes of cases, so far as concerns the liability of the bailee or lessee, is pointed out by Judge Keller in <em>Brinton v.

It follows that appellee is not liable to appellant for the loss occasioned by a theft of the coat, occurring wholly without his fault, and that the refusal of the court below to enter judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense was proper: <em>Smith v.
