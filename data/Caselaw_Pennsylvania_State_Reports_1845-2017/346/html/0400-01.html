The will challenged was that of Charles N. Cressman, who died on December 21,1940, aged 79 years, and it was executed on November 28, 1940.</p>

(b) Whether the said paper writing dated November 28,1940, was procured by undue influence, duress and constraint practiced upon the said decedent, Charles N. Cressman, by Rose B.

    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[261,630,1154,535]]]'>It was stipulated and agreed by counsel for the proponents and for the caveators that the testimony taken before the Register of Wills should be considered by the Orphans’ Court in this proceeding to have the same force and effect as though it had been taken before the court, de novo, with the right to either proponents or caveators to supplement the record with such additional testimony as they might deem material in the case. In pursuance of this agreement, some additional testimony was subsequently taken before the court, sitting in banc.</p>
    <p id="b424-6" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[257,1176,1158,588]]]'>The decedent was for many years and until his retirement in 1933 engaged in the business of manufacturing cigars, having a large and perhaps dominant interest in certain “cigar companies”. In 1931 his estate was worth about $500,000. His first wife died on August 31,1939. The caveators are all his children by this wife. There were no other children. On September 3, 1940, he married Rose Beer, who then resided with him until his death and who is the proponent of this challenged will. She had been in his employ since 1905 and for many years she had been his secretary.</p>

(In the first and second wills the bequests to Miss Beer had been $5000 and $25,000 respectively.) The then Miss Beer typed the first two wills. The second will was executed in November, 1939.</p>

Grim, Esq., and <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>asked Mm to prepare another -will (this was the third will), and he gave his attorney instructions for its preparation. His wife (the proponent) asked if she should leave the room and Mr. Cressman replied in the negative. He then said to his attorney: “I have given this matter a lot of thought and a lot of attention, and I know exactly what I am doing and I have reasons for it”. He also spoke of having supported one son “practically all his life” and that he had supported another son and “we always got along fine but this time he will have to more or less see for himself”. As to his married daughter, he said: “Bill (her husband) can well afford to take care of Marion, there is no financial trouble there.”</p>
    <p id="b425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_425.4",425,[153,1010,1151,1071]]]'>The testator said to his attorney at the time that his estate “would be about $150,000,” and that he was leaving everything to Bose (Mrs. Cressman) because he was not certain there would be enough money to last. He added: “I want her to remember she is Mrs. Charles N. Cressman and it is going to cost her money to live. If it costs the way it cost me in the past, it is not going to last for many years”. He stated that he wanted to be certain that his widow “was going to be taken care of”. Attorney Grim prepared the will according to instructions and delivered it to the testator on the following morning. The testator read it and declared: “This will is exactly what I want”. The attorney then left to keep an engagement and on that afternoon pursuant to arrangements made by the testator, through his wife, Dr. Herman Grim, his attending physician and longtime friend, and Samuel Cressman, a banker and also a long-time friend of the testator, and also the nurse, Buth Greisamer, witnessed the execution of the will by Mr. Cressman.</p>

The Court below correctly held: “Where a will was properly executed in every particular, a presumption of testamentary capacity and lack of undue influence arises, compelling evidence to upset the will, since the law favors its validity, unless it appears that the testator for some time prior to its execution has been mentally incapable of transacting business, in which event the burden of proof is on the proponent of the contested will. <em>Landis v.

She grew up with the business of the decedent’s firm, Allen E. Cressman Sons and, at the height of the firm’s business activities, had charge of the entire office. She was a faithful and conscientious employee and was in a position to know all of the decedent’s financial affairs. After the firm’s dissolution and the decedent’s retirement, she remained with him as his secretary and looked after his financial and business interests. There is no testimony, whatsoever, which would warrant any reasonable inference that proponent at any time exercised or attempted to exercise, any undue influence, within the meaning of that expression as hereinbefore defined, upon the decedent. On the contrary, the uncontradicted testimony is to the effect that Mr. Cressman was a man of strong character, determined and forceful. He had a strong personality, with a will and a mind of his own.”</p>
