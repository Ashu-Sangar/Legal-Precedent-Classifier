There is no contention that it was designed to apply to any particular locality or localities, and it is clear that this was not its purpose. It applies, or may apply, to every borough, town and first class township in the Commonwealth. If a given first class township has no police organization, or no organization justifying the system, the application of the Act is of necessity suspended.

It was contended that the exemptions rendered this act local and , special in violation of the Constitution. Mr. Justice Frazer, speaking for the Court, said (p. 304) : .

      <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>The instant case stands or falls on the assertion that municipalities may not be “classified” except according to their population. Article III, section 7, supplies the answer. That Section was adopted for a very simple and understandable purpose — to put an end to the flood of privileged legislation for particular localities and for private.purposes which was common in 1873. The Section said what it meant. It was aimed at laws that were in the proper sense local and special. See <em>Commonwealth v. Gilligan, </em><a href="/pa/195/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="195 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="914028" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0504-01">195 Pa. 504</a>. In 1875 the Section first came before this Court, in <em>Wheeler v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/77/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="77 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="436265" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0338-01">77 Pa. 338</a>. The legislature in 1874 had passed the first compre1 hensive classification law for cities, dividing them into three classes according to their population, and legislating separately for each class. Under the classification, Philadelphia was the only city of the first class, and the law was accordingly attacked as local and special. The opinion of the Court was written by Mr. Justice Paxson. He held that the constitutional provision was not intended to prevent the legislature from meeting diverse needs; that classification was not excluded; and that the fact that Philadelphia was the only member of a class did not make the act local, since it provided for a class as such, into which other members might come. The learned judge gave specific illustration of the necessity for classified legislation by pointing out the large amount of legislation which had been passed for Philadelphia because of its status as a great port and continued (p. 350): “. . . We have but to glance at this legislation to see that the most of it is wholly unsuited to small inland cities, and that to inflict it upon them would be little short of a calamity. Must the city of Scranton, over 100 miles from tide water, with a stream hardly large, enough to float a batteau, be subjected to quarantine regulations, and have its lazaretto?”</p>

The Court, and in particular Mr. Justice Paxson, recognized <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>at the very outset in the interpretation of Section 7 that there are differences between cities calling for differences in legislative treatment which have no relation to population at all. It was on the basis of such a difference, employed as a specific illustration, that the Court sustained the principle of classification of municipalities.</p>
    <p id="b29-3" data-blocks='[["BL_29.4",29,[232,626,1150,427]]]'>Section 7 was next before the Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Patton, </em><a href="/pa/88/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="88 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="1061212" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0258-01">88 Pa. 258</a> (1879). This opinion was also written by Mr. Justice Paxson. He held that the act designating Titusville as a place for the county coart to sit was clearly special, since it applied only to Titusville and could never apply to any other city, and the correctness of this result is of course obvious. The Court said there (p. 260) :</p>
    <blockquote id="b29-4" data-blocks='[["BL_29.5",29,[226,1066,1155,696]]]'>“. . . This is classification run mad.

Or all counties with a population of over sixty thousand watered by a certain river or bounded by a certain mountain? <em>There can he no proper classification of cities or counties ewcept hy population. </em>The moment we resort to geographical distinctions we enter the domain of special legislation, for the reason that such classification operates upon certain cities or counties to the perpetual exclusion of all others . . .” (Italics added.)</blockquote>

It is a purely parenthetical insertion in a condemnation of geographical classification. It is made without emphasis, without authority, and, it seems clear, without careful thought concerning its implications. Certainly, the same learned judge who within four years had made so clear the need of differentiation between cities with respect to matters unrelated to population, would not as casually as this retract his elaborated views. It cannot be supposed that Mr. Justice Paxson meant to say that if Philadelphia and Scranton had the same population, every bit of port <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>legislation appropriate to Philadelphia would, without exception, have to' be applied to Scranton.</p>
    <p id="b30-4" data-blocks='[["BL_30.4",30,[200,400,1158,589]]]'>If the statement is given appropriate meaning, it must be restricted to the kind of classification that had before that time come before the Court — comprehensive and specific classification such as the general grouping of cities made in the Act Of 1874. It is hard to imagine any basis except population for a broad classification of municipalities for general legislative purposes. But this is very different from a statement that for all purposes, whatever the reason, no distinction may be made in applying legislation to municipalities unless it is done according to the number of people who live in them.</p>
    <p id="b30-5" data-blocks='[["BL_30.5",30,[195,1000,1161,806]]]'>The latter doctrine is not the law. Its impossibility is proven by the illustration employed by Mr. Justice PaxSON in <em>Wheeler v.

That it is not the law is shown by two decisions: <em>Bennett v.

There is no merit in the contention.

The language is “The Legislature shall have power to classify . . . according, to popula<a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>tion.” There is no requirement that the legislature employ this method of classification, and no prohibition of any other method.

It is said that the statute grants privileges to members of the police force in first class townships having a police force of more than three members, and denies them to policemen in other such townships. The obvious answer is that such differences always happen whenever legislation regulating municipal affairs is made effective in certain municipalities and not in others.
