    <p id="b514-7" data-blocks='[["BL_514.10",514,[255,852,1156,310]]]'>As appears in the prior appeal between these parties the defendant surety company (Appellant) became liable to pay $10,000. to the plaintiff (Appellee). We directed judgment to be entered in favor of the Appellee “in the sum of $10,000 with interest”. Our opinion is reported in <a href="/pa/342/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="342 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1207040" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0322-01">342 Pa. 322</a>.</p>
    <p id="b514-8" data-blocks='[["BL_514.11",514,[255,1181,1157,364]]]'>Appellant maintains in the present proceeding that such interest runs from the date when our opinion was filed. Appellee contends, and it was so decided by the Court below, that interest should be calculated from the date when demand was made upon the surety upon its bond, which was the date of suit. We agree with the Court below.</p>
    <p id="b514-9" data-blocks='[["BL_514.12",514,[255,1564,1155,153]]]'>The appropriate definition of “interest” upon obligations reduced to judgment through litigation is stated in <em>Kelsey v. Murphy, </em><a href="/pa/30/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="30 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="415551" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0340-01">30 Pa. 340</a>, 341:</p>

      <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>Under this definition, as prerequisites to running of interest, the debt must; have been liquidated with some degree of certainty and the duty to pay it must have become fixed: <em>Lackawanna Iron &amp; Steel Company v. Lackawanna &amp; Wyoming Valley R. R., </em><a href="/pa/299/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="299 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="1122335" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0503-01">299 Pa. 503</a>; <em>Graboyes v.

The requirement that the claim be liquidated is not strictly applied in certain situations of obvious necessity, notably in actions for accounting for royalties and other profits: <em>McCornack v. Sharples, </em><a href="/pa/254/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="254 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1025420" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0541-01">254 Pa. 541</a>, and the cases therein cited. In cases sounding in tort or for unliquidated damages, interest does not run until the amount is fixed by the verdict: Act April 6, 1859, P. L. 381, Sec. 1, 12 P. S. 781: See <em>Kelsey v. Murphy </em><a href="/pa/30/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="30 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="415551" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0340-01">(supra).</a></p>
    <p id="b515-4" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[130,1066,1153,1249]]]'>Many such cases have been cited in Appellant’s paper book but obviously they have no application to the present situation. Here the debt <em>was </em>liquidated by the audit. The judgment against the principal on the bond established his liability as well as that of his surety. Interest on official bonds runs from the date demand was made upon the surety, despite the fact that liability may be contested: <em>Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives, etc. v. Swain, </em><a href="/pa/189/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="189 Pa. 626" data-case-ids="903484" data-case-paths="/pa/189/0626-01">189 Pa. 626</a>. See <em>Folz v.

As it does not appear that formal demand was presented prior to suit, the bringing of the suit itself is the demand: <em>Punxsutawney v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/320/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="320 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1163606" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0168-01">320 Pa. 168</a>; <em>Ayoob v.

Super. 496" data-case-ids="1010358" data-case-paths="/pa-super/132/0496-01">132 Pa. Superior Ct. 496</a>. To accept Appellant’s contention, the words “with interest” in our order would have been without meaning because the Act of 1700,1 Smith’s Laws 7, Sec. 2 (12 P. S. Sec. 782) provides that judgments carry interest. The words “with interest” directed that interest be paid from the time of demand to the time of judgment, as the Court below properly held.</p>
