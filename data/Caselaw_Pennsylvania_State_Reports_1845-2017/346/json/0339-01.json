        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is from an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Lycoming County dismissing exceptions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to an auditor\u2019s report disallowing a claim of $3,170.20, presented by the Commonwealth against the Estate of Herbert M. Brubaker, deceased, for expenses incurred by it in the maintenance of decedent\u2019s insane and indigent son at the Danville State Hospital for the Insane from January 5, 1931, to January 7, 1941, the date of decedent\u2019s death. This son was committed to the Hospital upon an order made on January 5, 1931, by the Court of Quarter Sessions of Lycoming County, which placed the costs of maintenance on the county. The order was never revised or challenged and for that reason, the Orphans\u2019 Court upheld the auditor in disallowing the claim.\nThe Act of June 1, 1915, P. L. 661, imposes liability for the support of an indigent, insane child, in the interest of the Commonwealth, on, inter alia, its parent. The fact that there has been no effort to enforce this liability during the lifetime of the parent does not bar the enforcement of such liability by appropriate proceedings against the parent\u2019s estate; Harnish\u2019s Estate, 268 Pa. 128. The subsequent Act of July 11,1923, P. L. 998, known as The Mental Health Act, does not take away this right of the Commonwealth to present claims for expenses incurred in the maintenance of indigent, insane persons against their parents\u2019 estate even though no effort to enforce such claims was made during the latters\u2019 lifetime. Had the attention of the court below been called to our decision in Ilarnish\u2019s Estate, supra, it would have undoubtedly so held in the instant case.\nThe order of the court below is reversed and the record is remitted with directions to make distribution in accordance with this opinion.",
