        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court reversing the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas No. 5 of Philadelphia. Ellen Linaka, plaintiff below, is the widow of John Linaka, Jr., who as a city-fireman in Philadelphia was killed on October 30, 1938, while in the discharge of his duty. At that time he was a member in good standing of the Firemen\u2019s Pension Fund of Philadelphia. On November 4,1938, his widow applied to this corporation for a widow\u2019s pension, under Art. 2, sec. 5 of the by-laws which provided, inter alia, that \u201cthe widow ... of a member who was killed while in the discharge of his duty . . . shall be entitled to apply for a pension.\u201d The application was duly referred to a committee for investigation and report.\nOn the evening of that day the annual meeting of the Pension Fund was held and among the changes then made in the by-laws was a provision in Art. 12, sec. 5, by which change the amount of \u201cany pension allowed to a widow\u201d was increased from $20.00 to $50.00 per month. Section 2 of the same article was amended by adding a provision that \u201cthe pension granted to a widoAV . . . shall begin on the date of the death of a member.\u201d Theretofore there had been no provision in the by-laws as to when pensions granted to a widow were to begin. The \u201cgap\u201d between the date of a member\u2019s death and the first payment of a pension had been bridged by \u201cdonations\u201d.\nOn January 3, 1939, the committee recommended to the Board of Control that plaintiff be granted a pension of $20.00 a month, beginning February 1, 1939. The Board approved this and also made the widow a donation of $60.00, equivalent to $20.00 a month from November 1, 1938, to February 1, 1939, when the payment of the pensions would begin. The claimant-widow declined to accept this award and brought suit for eight months\u2019 pension from November 1,1938, to June 1,1939, at the rate of $50.00 a month, and for interest thereon. The trial judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff. An appeal was taken to the Superior Court. The only issue raised was as to the amount of the monthly pension to which claimant was lawfully entitled.\nThe Court of Common Pleas took the position that after plaintiff\u2019s husband was killed the by-laws of the association gave her no right except \u201cthe right to make application\u201d for a pension and that the \u201cright to a pension did not vest until the Board had acted.\u201d The court then reasoned that since the application for a pension was still pending when the amount of the pension to be paid to dependents of deceased member was raised to $50.00 a month, the Board \u201cshould have followed the existing by-law, which fixed the penison at $50.00.\u201d\nThe Superior Court, in an opinion by Judge Stadtfeld, after stating that \u201cthe by-laws constitute the contract of association of its members: Leatherman et al. v. Wolf et al., 240 Pa. 557, 88 A. 17\u201d held that the rights of the widow-claimant \u201cwere conditioned upon the death of the member under certain circumstances and became fixed upon the happening of that event. It was that particular event which provided the basis for and gave rise to any claim against the association. Hence, it is with reference to the time of the death of the member that the rights of the dependent relatives are to be determined.\u201d The cases of St. Patrick\u2019s Male Beneficial Society v. McVey, 92 Pa. 510, and Chambers v. Knights of Maccabees, 200 Pa. 244, 49 A. 784, hold that a member himself of an incorporated beneficial society can claim only such benefits as are prescribed by the by-laws existing at the time the right to relief arises.\nIn cases like the one before us it must be assumed that the payments made by a society such as the defendant society are not mere gratuities which can be granted or withheld arbitrarily. They are benefits which are paid for by contributions of the members and otherwise. There must be a definite date when the right to the pension provided for arises. The logical date is the date when the thing happens which makes a benefit payment or a pension necessary. In the case of sick benefits, that date is when the sick member becomes incapacitated by his sickness. Of course, the Society\u2019s by-laws can fix a different date, such as, for example, one week after the disability arises, but if there is any ambiguity about the provision fixing the date for the arising of the right to the benefit provided for, it is a reasonable inference that the date intended is the date referred to above as the \u201clogical date.\u201d\nIn the instant case the language quoted about claimants being \u201centitled to apply for a pension\u201d lends some support, when viewed superficially, to the view that the only right this widow had after her husband\u2019s death was to apply for a pension and that when the application was favorably acted upon the pension she then had a right to get, was the pension of $50.00 a month as provided in the by-laws then existing. We do not so interpret the language of these by-laws. When claimant\u2019s husband was killed \u201cin the discharge of his duty\u201d, her right to the pension thus provided for in the by-laws became a vested right. Before she could obtain that pension she had to apply for it and to establish facts which brought her claim within the prescriptions of the by-laws. The quoted phrase \u201centitled to apply for a pension\u201d simply meant that if the widow wished to receive the pension provided for in such cases, the duty of acting was upon her. The \u201cdoor\u201d to a pension was opened by her husband\u2019s death but she had to enter that door and prove certain facts before the pension would be put in her grasp. She acted and when the facts were established to the Board\u2019s satisfaction, a pension was payable to her. The amount of that pension was the amount fixed by the by-laws when the event occurred which gave rise to her claim, to wit, her husband\u2019s death while discharging his duty. No action taken by the defendant corporation subsequent to her husband\u2019s death could abridge her rights to payments out of the funds of that corporation ; and on the other hand, any increase in death benefits made by the corporation\u2019s by-laws, after her husband\u2019s death, did not enlarge in the slightest degree her legal claim to payments out of that fund. The increase provided for in the by-laws operated prospectively not retrospectively. Her rights and their value are measured by the by-laws in force when her cause of action arose and that was on October 30, 1938.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.",
