        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Drew,\nThis controversy concerns the construction of the residuary clause of the will of William A. Ramsey, who died on January 15,1928, leaving to survive him a widow and four daughters. The first paragraph of this clause created a vested estate in each of testator\u2019s daughters in the sum of $6,000, in trust,' the income payable to \u00e9ach upon reaching twenty-one years of age until she becomes thirty, when she shall receive the principal. The next two paragraphs of the. clause in question directed the payment of the income from the remainder of the residuary estate to testator\u2019s widow, and provided also for the event of her death or remarriage. The last paragraph makes the following provision for the circumstance of a daughter of testator dying with or without issue.: \u201cIf any child of mine dies, whether married or single, leaving-issue, such issue shall receive his or her parent\u2019s share. If any child of mine dies without leaving issue, him surviving, the share of such child shall be divided equally among the survivors, and the children of any child who may be deceased, leaving, issue at the time, per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d The principal of the $6,000 fund held for her under the will was awarded to testator\u2019s three surviving daughters (they having all attained the age of 30 and no claim having been entered by testator\u2019s widow). This appeal is by the administrator of the deceased daughter\u2019s estate from the final decree of the learned court below confirming the award.\nThe: question for determination is whether the deceased daughter\u2019s interest in the $6,000 fund was indefensibly vested in her at the time she became twenty-one, with receipt of the principal postponed, however, until she should reach the age of thirty, as appellant contends; or whether it was subject to divestiture by her death before she reached tlie age of thirty, as held by the court below.\nIn discussing the applicable principles of law, we said, in Wettengel\u2019s Estate, 278 Pa. 571, 573: \u201cWe have repeatedly held that where the dominant purpose shown by a devise is to vest' a fee, this estate cannot be stripped of its inherent attributes by subsequent words indicating an intent so to do: Pattin v. Scott, 270 Pa. 49, 51, and cases there cited: Long\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 480, 485-6. On the other hand, we have probably as often held that, in finding the controlling intention, all the words used by testator should be taken into account, and, if the intent to restrict the gift is clear, it must be given effect-, [citing cases].\u201d (Italics added.) See also Hanna\u2019s Estate, 344 Pa. 548; Byrne\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 513.\nA careful reading of the will shows that it falls within the last stated rule. Since the testator states that \u201cIf any child of mine dies without leaving issue, him surviving, the share of such child shall be divided equally among the survivors\u201d, there can be no doubt that his intention ivas to give an absolute estate in f6,000 to each daughter upon reaching the age of twenty-one, subject to divestiture if she did not reach the age of thirty, and in case of her death without issue before reaching the latter age her full share should vest equally in her surviving sisters.\nDecree affirmed.",
