        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the action of the Court below in dismissing plaintiff\u2019s exception to the adjudication of the trial judge, who in an action of trespass for the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband, in which a jury trial was waived, held that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. Plaintiff\u2019s husband, Hugo Anschel, aged 58 years, fell into an elevator shaft in the defendant\u2019s Broad Street station, Philadelphia, at noon on Sunday, July 28, 1940. While he was in the station waiting for a train he left his wife and adult son to go to the.men\u2019s room. Two days later his dead body was found at the bottom of the shaft of a passenger elevator in that station. In the passageway from the train platform (where the deceased ivas last seen by his son) to the men\u2019s room there were two doors entering upon elevator shafts. One of these doors opened upon the shaft at the bottom of which the deceased was found, 30 feet below the \u201ctrain level floor\u201d. This floor was described as the \u201clast stop for the elevator\u201d when descending.\nThe negligence alleged was in the defendants leaving \u201cthe door or safety gate of the elevator shaft unenclosed, unguarded and unprotected\u201d and for violating the Act of April 25,1903, P. L. 304, which requires that elevator doors be kept closed when not in use. This act was repealed by the Act of May 1,1929, P. L. 1063, section 4900.\nThe elevator door was \u201ca double leaf sliding door, which was opened and closed by a handle on the inside, and when opened one leaf slid behind the other and then both leaves disappeared behind the jamb of the door. It was held closed by two devices, one the inter-locking safety catch on the wall of the shaft and the other the catch on the door\u201d.\nThe operator of this elevator who was on duty on the day in question testified that he found the door open on one of his trips down from the upper floors, though the door was \u201call the way shut\u201d before he left the floor on the ascending trip. He said the mechanism of the elevator door was such that the elevator could not leave the floor unless the door was closed and that there is another \u201cmesh door\u201d that also has to be shut before the elevator can be moved. When he found the door open, there was nothing wrong with its mechanism. According to this witness, the door \u201ccan be opened\u201d from the outside of the elevator \u201cbut you would have to kick and bang on it. It would take an awful hard blow to make it leave its place\u201d. Soon after the body was found in the pit, the defendants plant supervisor, John J. Boyle, inspected the door and found nothing wrong with its mechanism. He said the engineer had worked on the car between the Sunday when this fatality occured and Tuesday, and found nothing out of order. Boyle characterized this accident as a \u201cmystery\u201d and on the record this characterization must be accepted. That it is a mystery is the fatal weakness in plaintiff\u2019s case.\nThe burden of proof was, of course, upon the plaintiff, and as we said in Whigham v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 343 Pa. 149, 156, 22 A. 2d 704: \u201cThe burden of proof resting upon plaintiffs in civil actions cannot be met by conjectures. The phrase \u2018burden of proof\u2019 means exactly what it says\u201d. The basic proposition essential to plaintiff\u2019s recovery in the instant case was not established by proof. The fact of the accident did not alone prove negligence on the part of the defendant. Nothing was shown to be defective in the elevators. No neglect of duty on the part of the elevator operator or on other of defendant\u2019s employees was shown. The defendant company was not an insurer of the safety of this decedent while he was in the station. \u201cThe full measure of the defendant\u2019s duty was to use reasonable care by inspection and policing to keep its station in a safe condition\u201d : Green v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, 214 Pa. 240, 243, 63 A. 603. Restatement of Torts, Yol. 2, section 347. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is this: \u201cSince the door could not be opened from tbe outside, it must have been left open by the elevator operator, as he left the floor on the up trip. This was the negligence, of the defendant.\u201d It was not established as a fact that the door \u201ccould not be opened, from the outside\u201d. The evidence was as already noted. The possibility that Anschel himself opened this door is not excluded by the testimony. He was blind in one eye and he may have thought that the elevator door was the door to the washroom and that it was barred and he then may have done exactly the thing necessary to be done, to open it. The \u201chard blow\u201d described as necessary to \u201cmake the door leave its place\u201d might have been administered by him. That hypothesis cannot- be judicially excluded so that liability can be imposed on the defendant.\nIf the door had been left unfastened or open, it was Anschel\u2019s duty to take care lest he walk into the shaft. The hour was mid-day and Anschel\u2019s son answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cIt was quite bright from daylight on the train platform\u201d. In Douville v. Northeastern Warehouse Company, 337 Pa. 188, 10 A. 2d 394, we said: \u201cIf an elevator shaft is properly lighted, a person .who approaches it is charged with the duty of seeing whether or not the elevator door is open when the elevator is not at that .floor.\u201d In Bailey v. Alexander Realty Co., 342 Pa. 362, 20 A. 2d 754, (which was also an \u201celevator shaft\u201d case) we said: \u201cThe duty of.availing oneself of one\u2019s senses, for self-protection can seldom be breached with physical impunity and never with legal sanction\u201d. In this case as in that one, \u201cthe rule, that a victim cannot recover damages for injuries sustained by him if he could have avoided the injury by the exercise of ordinary care bars this plaintiff\u2019s recovery\u201d.\nThe fact that the deceased\u2019s eye-sight was impaired did not. increase defendant\u2019s duty toward him in this case, nor excuse him from his own negligence. See Bilotta v. Media, Middleton, A. & C. Ry. Co., 220 Pa. 542, 70 A. 123; and Malloy et al. v. Castle Shannon Bor ough et al., 344 Pa. 469, 25 A. 2d 722; Smith v. Sneller et al., 345 Pa. 68, and Flynn v. Pittsburgh Railways Company, 234 Pa. 335, 83 A. 207. \u201cIf the actor knows that he is physically inferior in any particular, he is required to use his remaining faculties with greater diligenceRestatement, Torts, Yol. 2, section 289, comment \u2018h\u2019, page 768. The presumption that the deceased used due care, does not relieve the plaintiff of any of the burden of proof, nor does it prevent a finding from the facts, if they warrant it, as they do here, that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nMr. Justice Maxey became Chief Justice on January 4, 1943, after this opinion was filed.",
