        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from the refusal of the court below to take off a compulsory nonsuit in an action of trespass. The wife plaintiff, Mrs. Mary Papkin, was driving her four-door sedan westerly on 65th Avenue, at or near its intersection with Smedley Street, on October 3, 1940. At the same time defendant\u2019s small coup\u00e9 driven by an employee was moving north on Smedley Street. Near the middle of the intersection of these two streets these two cars collided. Mrs. Papkin testified that just prior to the accident she looked to her right and then to her left and \u201csaw nothing coming either one way or the other or coming towards\u201d her. The plaintiff continued on her way, and when she was \u201cabout three-quarters away across,\u201d she felt \u201ca terrible thud,\u201d and she \u201cheard a crash against the car.\u201d The employee who was driving defendant\u2019s car was called as a witness by the plaintiff. His testimony was to the effect that he was traveling in the center of Smedley Street just prior to the accident, that the brakes on his car were defective, and that he did not see plaintiff\u2019s car until he hit it.\nThe court below in its opinion refusing to take off the compulsory nonsuit correctly stated the rule of law applicable to cases of this character; quoting from Byrne v. Schultz, 306 Pa. 427, 433, 160 A. 125, as follows : \u201cThe law only makes obligatory the rule of common sense regarding the duty of a driver at the intersection of streets, where traffic is very dangerous because conflicting. He must be vigilant, must exercise a high degree of care, must have his car under complete control, and must look, and see what is visible, before attempting to cross the intersecting street.\u201d In Galliano v. East Penn Electric Co., 303 Pa. 498, 503, 154 A. 805, we said: \u201cIt is the duty of the driver of a street car or a motor vehicle at all times to have his car under control, and having one\u2019s car under control means having it under such epntrol that it can be stopped before doing injury to any person in any situation that is reasonably likely to arise under tbe circumstances.\u201d The court below properly held that the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s own testimony obviously convicted her of contributory negligence under the above stated well established rules of law. The only conclusion that can be drawn from her testimony is that the accident was caused, at least in part, by her own carelessness and disregard for her own safety. It was her duty in entering the intersection to continue to looh until her view of the intersecting road was sufficient to assure her that she could clear the intersection in advance of any vehicle approaching at a not unusual speed.\u201d It was her duty to be vigilant, to exercise a high degree of care, and to continue to look, and see what was visible, before attempting to cross. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony obviously convicts her of a failure so to continue to look as she entered the intersection. The court below also properly held that the statement of defendant\u2019s driver that the brakes of the car he was driving were defective did not relieve the plaintiff of the consequences of her own contributory negligence.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
