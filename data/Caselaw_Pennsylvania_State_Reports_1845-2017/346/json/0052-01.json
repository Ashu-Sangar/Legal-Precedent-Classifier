L. 212, 17 PS sections 197, 198. In the certificate it was stated that \u201cthe same legal question is involved in both of the above appeals.\u201d\nIn the first case, an opinion reversing the judgment appealed from was written by President Judge Keller, from which Judges Kenworthey and Rhodes dissented. In the second, affirming the judgment appealed from, the opinion was written by Judge Hirt, Judge Rhodes dissenting.\nThe question for decision was stated by President Judge Keller to be: \u201cWhere land, subject to a valid judgment, is conveyed by deed, which is at once recorded, does the lien of the judgment bind the land in the possession of the terre-tenant for a period of five years from the date of the recording of the deed, even though the judgment was not subsequently revived against the judgment debtor by scire facias within five years of the entry of the judgment?\u201d The question was answered in the affirmative.\nWe adopt the judgment of the Superior Court rendered in each of the cases.\nJudgments affirmed.",
