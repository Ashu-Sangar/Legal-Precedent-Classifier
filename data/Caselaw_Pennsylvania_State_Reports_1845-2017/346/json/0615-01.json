        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearns,\nThis appeal raises questions concerning the propriety of investments and expenditures by the corporate guardian of a weak-minded person.\n. On July 10, 1920, The Commonwealth Title Insurance and Trust Company was appointed guardian of the Estate of Millard P. Snyder, a weak-minded person, now confined in the United States Veterans5 Hospital, at Coatesville, Pennsylvania. An inventory was filed in 1926. Provident Trust Company of Philadelphia succeeded by merger to the guardianship, and, on May 19,1942, filed its First Account. The court below appointed an examiner and listed the account for audit.\nThe account shows that the estate increased from $1,515 in 1920 to $41,017.55 in 1941. During this period the guardian received $11,861 from the Federal Government as disability compensation to the incompetent, and $14,490 in benefits from war risk insurance. These funds with the incompetent\u2019s final army pay of $90, and a refund of $75.90 in war risk insurance premiums were invested in Treasury and private bonds and in first mortgages, and the accumulations were reinvested. Some of the mortgages have been foreclosed and the real estate is held by the guardian, pending liquidation.\nExceptions to the account were filed by counsel for appellant on behalf of two brothers and a sister of the incompetent as next-of-kin, seeking to surcharge the accountant for two mortgage investments and for $2,001.36 paid to the United States Veterans\u2019 Bureau to provide spending money to the incompetent at rates varying from $10 to $20 per month. Objection was also made to a credit of $2,469.24 for commissions to the accountant. The sister and one brother of the incompetent having indicated that they were unwilling to join in the exceptions, supplemental exceptions were filed by appellant alone, asking, in addition to the foregoing items, that the accountant be surcharged for small Christmas gifts to the incompetent totalling $125, and charging generally mismanagement of the estate.\nAt the audit, testimony was received sur the exceptions, and a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d was entered by the auditing judge confirming the account. No exception to this order was filed. Appellant\u2019s petitions to strike the examiner\u2019s report from the record for irregularities, and for the amendment of the record to include certain colloquy of court and counsel alleged to have been omitted, and requests for exceptions and rulings which counsel had neglected to make at trial to certain evidence, were dismissed. Appellant excepted and appealed to this Court from the orders dismissing his petitions and from the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d. An opinion sustaining the action of the auditing judge was filed by the court below en banc.\nAs appellant has not included in the statement of questions involved and assignments of error his objection to the manner in which this case was disposed of by the court en banc, this court cannot consider it on appeal: Pramuk's Appeal, 250 Pa. 45; Commonwealth to use v. Crow et al., 294 Pa. 286. Many irregularities of procedure, on the part both of appellant and of the court below, appear in the record. The auditing judge should not have designated his adjudication of the account as a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d, but as appellant filed no exception to it, he cannot complain that the court en banc did not hear him. Although the court entered no final decree, this court will construe the opinion of the court en banc to be an adoption of the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d of the auditing judge as its final decree.\nThere is no need to consider at length appellant\u2019s argument regarding irregularities in the reception of the examiner\u2019s report. The fact that the auditing judge ambiguously designated him as an \u201cexaminer or auditor\u201d and \u201capproved\u201d his report cannot obscure the fact that his function was solely that of an examiner, and adviser to the court, and not an auditor, empowered to hear and make recommendations on claims. Appellant is therefore mistaken in assuming that the rules of the court below applicable to auditors were violated.\nThe court below has already passed upon, and rejected, appellant\u2019s contention that important omissions exist in the transcript of the case. The auditing judge properly refused to permit appellant to read into the record the World War Veterans\u2019 Act of 1924 and its amendments. These laws are matters of which our courts will take judicial notice. See Di Donato v. Phila. & R. Ry. Co., 266 Pa. 412, 416; Hendricks v. Pyramid M. F. Corp. et al., 328 Pa. 570, 575. As to appellant\u2019s contention that he was thereby deprived of the right to raise a federal question concerning the violation of these statutes, it is sufficient to say that the record clearly indicates that the question was raised below in appellant\u2019s requests for conclusions of law and disposed of in the opinion of the court en banc.\nThere is no merit in the contention, and it comes with peculiarly bad grace from appellant, to object that the incompetent\u2019s funds were used to provide him with clothing and small comforts. The accountant paid out these sums to the hospital authorities at their request, and with the approval of the Veterans\u2019 Administration and the office of the Solicitor General. The Act of July 2, 1926, ch. 723, Section 9, 44 Stat. 794, amending the Act of June 7,1924, ch. 320, Section 202, 38 U. S. C. A., Section 484, provides that where a hospitalized veteran \u201cis financially unable to supply himself with clothing, he shall also be furnished with such clothing as the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs may deem necessary. . . It is further provided that a veteran\u2019s pension shall not be subject to deduction for \u201cboard, maintenance or any other purpose incident to hospitalization\u201d while he is in a government hospital. Here the incompetent is possessed of a considerable estate and is well able to pay for these few items of clothing and small incidentals. There is no evidence that any part of the incompetent\u2019s pension was used for his board or maintenance at the hospital, which fact alone distinguishes this case from Reynolds v. United States, 292 U. S. 443, or that it was used to purchase anything which the hospital or Veterans\u2019 Bureau was obliged by law to supply. The federal officers charged with the care of the incompetent and with the administration of the Veterans\u2019 Act and its amendments have supervised and approved all of these expenditures.\nAppellant has objected to two mortgage investments made by the accountant. The first of these was for $1,600 secured upon premises 2318 N. Mutter Street, Philadelphia ; the second, for $1,400 secured upon premises 2811 W. Gordon Street, Philadelphia. The evidence shows that these properties were appraised at values far in excess of the mortgages at the time that the mortgages were acquired by accountant. Appellant contends that the accountant committed a breach of trust by transferring these mortgages to the guardian\u2019s estate. The testimony shows, however, that the mortgages were originally acquired by the bank, and held but for a short period, solely for the purpose of trust investment, and the transactions are therefore within the rule of Greenawalt's Estate, 343 Pa. 413, and Saeger Estates, 340 Pa. 73, rather than that of Tracy et al., Co-Trustees, v. Central Tr. Co., 327 Pa. 77. The fact that the appraisals were made by an employee of the corporate fiduciary does not affect their value in the absence of any showing of fraud or bad faith. Saeger Estates, supra.\nAppellant also contends that the accountant in both instances violated the Act bf June 13, 1836, P. L. 589, Section 34, 50 PS, Section 755, which provides:\n\u201cIt shall be lawful for any committee as aforesaid, by the leave, and under the direction of the court of common pleas having jurisdiction, as aforesaid, to invest the money of a lunatic or habitual drunkard, in such stocks, or upon such security, as shall be approved of by such court, and if such investment be made bona fide, the committee making the same shall not be liable for any loss that may arise thereby.\u201d\nAppellant construes this act to make it mandatory in the case of any investment by the guardian of a weak-minded person that the approval of the court shall first be obtained. Commonwealth ex rel. v. McConnell, 226 Pa. 244, is cited. In that case, however, as a careful reading shows, the fiduciary was surcharged for investing without prior approval in bonds of a private corporation which becomes valueless. The discussion makes it plain that these bonds were considered as non-legal investments, and it was pointed out that a fiduciary makes such investments at his own risk where he fails to obtain the protection afforded by the Act of 1836 against individual liability by applying to the court for approval. It was said, page 248, \u201cIf, therefore, the committee disregards the act of assembly and invests the trust funds in other than statutory securities and without the consent of the court, he does so at his own and not at the lunatic\u2019s peril.\u201d Referring to the surcharge imposed, it was said, page 248, \u201cWhile this may be a hardship upon the committee, he could have relieved himself from all liability for tlie investment of the funds of the cestui que trust by applying to the common pleas for an order of court. The legislature has made provision for the protection of the committee of a lunatic in the investment of trust funds, and the committee should avail himself of the statute.\u201d\nIt is manifest, therefore, that the act did not require, mandatorily, that the court must approve all investments. It did not even require that the court approve non-legal investments. It merely provided, as interpreted in the McConnell case, a means whereby the fiduciary could make non-legal investments without danger of individual liability. See also Gibson\u2019s Estate, 312 Pa. 359; Henry\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 439. This interpretation was reiterated by this Court in Curran\u2019s Estate, 312 Pa. 416, 423, where it was pointed out that the Court in McConnell\u2019s Estate had overlooked the fact that the bonds in question were secured upon real estate, and were not, therefore, non-legal investments. Riebel\u2019s Estate, 321 Pa. 145, referring to the McConnell case, also makes it clear that the former decision was intended to relate to non-legal investments. If any doubt whatever remains upon the construction of the Act of 1836 it should be resolved now, and definitely, by our holding that it does not require prior approval of the court of legal or statutory trust investments by guardians of weak-minded persons. Here the accountant invested in first mortgages of real estate which have always been recognized as legal trust investments. Curran\u2019s Estate, supra.\nAs there was no technical breach of trust, the burden was upon appellant to show that the accountant acted negligently or imprudently in making these investments, and the findings and conclusions of the court below negativing the implication of such conduct are conclusive upon this court. Quinn\u2019s Estate, 342 Pa. 509, 514; Frank\u2019s Estate, 339 Pa. 499, 501. See also Bard\u2019s Estate, 339 Pa. 433, 437; Clabby\u2019s Estate, 338 Pa. 305, 309-310.\nThe charge of appellant that certain expenditures for repairs to the Gordon Street property were not made was disproved by tbe testimony of accountant\u2019s witness, and by the statement of tbe counsel for tbe Veterans\u2019 Administration that he bad investigated tbe same charge and found it baseless. Tbe only evidence offered in support of tbe exception to this item was appellant\u2019s own testimony that he bad visited tbe property two years after the work was done and found no evidence of repair, and that be bad conversed with an unnamed neighbor who said that no repairs bad been made for five years. The neighbor was not called to testify. Clearly tbe court below was correct in allowing this credit.\nAccountant did not file its first account until tbe expiration of 22 years. It gave no notice to appellant of its intention to apply for leave to sell certain foreclosed real estate. It does not appear, however, that any loss to tbe estate has resulted thereby. On tbe whole the estate of tbe incompetent has been prudently and successfully administered. Despite tbe financial depression tbe total amounts received by tbe incompetent from tbe federal government, $28,032.23, have been increased by investments to a net estate of $41,017.55, of which $3,039.56 has been distributed. Tbe Veterans\u2019 Administration has approved tbe management of tbe estate by tbe guardian, and two of tbe three next-of-kin of tbe incompetent have expressed their complete satisfaction. This, in itself, is significant of tbe guardian\u2019s successful administration of tbe fund entrusted to its care. Clabby\u2019s Estate, 338 Pa. 305, 310.\nTbe final objection relates to tbe credit taken by the accountant for commissions at 5% on $49,384.74. It does not clearly appear why tbe claim for commission is based upon this amount when tbe debits total $51,-350.32. It is well established that except in unusual circumstances commission on corpus is not allowed until tbe trust has terminated or tbe particular trustee\u2019s relation to it has ended: Bosler\u2019s Estate, 161 Pa. 457; Mylin\u2019s Estate, 32 Pa. Super. Ct. 504. Tbe rule is sound. Before the termination of a trust, the trustee may die, resign, or be removed, and tbe appointment of a substitilted trustee may become necessary. When such situations arise, it has always been the practice that in the sound discretion of the court, commissions or compensations are equitably adjusted between such fiduciaries. To pay the entire commission on principal in advance might result in the payment of a double commission. In the event, however, of extraordinary services an immediate compensation may be allowed: Penn-Gaskell\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 208 Pa. 342; Thouron\u2019s Estate, 182 Pa. 126.\nUpon the record before us it does not appear that the adjusted or withheld compensation of the disabled veteran, and the proceeds from his War Risk Insurance Policy, are in any sense income to this estate. This was payment for services theretofore rendered in the one instance, and benefits of insurance in the other. The fact that payments by the government were made periodically, instead of in a lump sum, is immaterial. Until the termination of the trust, or the withdrawal therefrom by the fiduciary, all that it is entitled to receive by way of compensation is a commission on income, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances. The court below must determine, under the facts of this particular case, what is principal and what is income, and allow compensation as above indicated, taking into consideration the existence of any unusual circumstances justifying an immediate allowance of a commission on principal. We are unable to approve the credit for commissions as shown by the account.\nThe decree of the court below, as modified, is affirmed, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Half the costs of this appeal are to be paid out of the estate, and half by the appellant.",
