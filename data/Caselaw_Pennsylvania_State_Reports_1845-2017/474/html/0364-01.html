He filed motions to suppress evidence of certain statements given by him to police and certain physical evidence seized by the police. Following a hearing on these motions, the Court of Common Pleas by order dated November 6, 1975 suppressed evidence of a .38 caliber gun taken by the police from Jones’ possession and evidence of statements made by Jones to the police on April 6,1975. The Commonwealth filed this appeal from that order. We now affirm.</p>

Hoffman proceeded to the police station without encountering Jones. At about 8:30 a. m. on the <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>same day, Hoffman again observed Jones; but, in this instance, Jones was walking south about three miles from where he was first observed, on United States Route Number 63 which intersects Interstate 44. During both observations, Jones was without luggage. Hoffman, in uniform, stopped his vehicle, a marked police car, and asked Jones for identification. Jones handed Hoffman an identification card and Hoffman then “asked [Jones] to have a seat in the patrol car.” Hoffman radioed to have a check on Jones run through the NCIC. While the check was being made, Hoffman and Jones engaged in “general conversation.” Hoffman testified that Jones was free to leave before the results of the NCIC check were obtained. From the check, Hoffman learned of the outstanding arrest warrant.</p>
