A prospective juror’s personal views are of no moment absent a showing that these opinions are so deeply embedded as to render that person incapable of accepting and applying the law as given by the court. So long as the juror is able to, intends to, and eventually does, adhere to the instructions on the law as propounded by the trial court, he or she is capable of performing the juror’s function.

Remoteness is not simply a question of how long after the crime the statement was made. Rather, remoteness involves a determination whether various factors make the probative value of the evidence to the issue of the accused’s insanity at the time of the crime unduly speculative. Not only the lapse of time between the crime and the statement must be considered, but also the nature of the evidence offered and the possible effect of intervening events. Here, the excluded statement dealt with appellant’s beliefs concerning the circumstances existing at the time of the crime, and his reasons for committing the crime. This evidence bears a close relation to appellant’s state of mind when he killed the victim, and there is little reason to fear that appellant’s beliefs reflect events which occurred after the killing, rather than his state of mind at the time of the killing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> It was an abuse of discretion for the court to keep this evidence from the jury.</p>

Being untrained in the law, jurors not only have difficulty comprehending these principles, but often come to the jury selection process saddled with misconceptions as to what these concepts mean. See e. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Rolison, </em><a href="/pa/473/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="165" data-cite="473 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="1730283" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0261-01">473 Pa. 261</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="166" data-cite="473 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="1730283" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0261-01">374 A.2d 509</a>, (filed June 3, 1977) (dissenting opinion of Manderino, J.). The record in <em>Rolison </em>revealed that a substantial percentage of the prospective jurors questioned as to their understanding of these fundamental concepts were unable to lay aside their misconceptions about them and accept the instructions of the trial judge as to their proper application to the case. Certainly, those whose beliefs are at odds with these principles would properly be challenged for cause, and the refusal to grant such a challenge would be an abuse of discretion and reversible error. But a challenge for cause cannot be made if there is no opportunity to discover the prospective juror’s fixed misconception. Furthermore, allowing questions such as those requested here would give defense counsel the opportunity to obtain the information necessary for an intelligent exercise of the right of peremptory challenge. The numerous peremptory challenges that a criminal defendant is allowed are of little practical value if counsel is unable to obtain sufficient knowledge about the prospective jurors to enable an intelligent exercise of those challenges. <em>See, </em>ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Trial by Jury, Approved Draft, 1968, § 2.4:</p>
