      <em>“Sales to a condemnor of properties which it could, and if necessary would, acquire by condemnation are not, in my judgment, sales on the open market between a willing seller and a willing buyer. </em>They involve an ingredient of compulsion on the part of the seller that <em>might </em>(Emphasis in original) make the ‘sales price’ too low; there may be an ingredient of anxiety for speedy acquisition or some other factor operating in the mind of the authority which would place the ‘sales price’ on the high side of fair market value. The fact is that the parties are not only buying and selling real estate; they are also settling a potential lawsuit, with all the elements of time, trouble, expense, and worry that would be involved. The properties may indeed be comparable, but for one reason or <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>another the transactions may not be, and the so-called ‘sales price’ may be higher or lower than if no condemnation were involved. To admit such testimony would be to invite side excursions into all the other related factors; such collateral matters would unduly complicate and delay the trial. For these and the other reasons contained in the opinion of the lower court, I see no reason to depart from the so-called ‘exclusionary rule’, which has long been the law in Pennsylvania, and represents the majority view in the United States. See Nichols on Eminent Domain (3d Ed., 1967), §§ 21-33; Snitzer, Pennsylvania Eminent Domain (1965), § 705(1)-2.11.” (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
