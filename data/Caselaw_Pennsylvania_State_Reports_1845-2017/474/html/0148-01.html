Tyler created October 7, 1919 does not contain a direction to the trustee to classify ordinary stock dividends (less than 6%) as income rather than as principal. The instrument is entirely silent on that point. Nor are we able to find any language in the trust itself which might indicate such an intention on the part of the settlor.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[263,759,1158,723]]]'>Appellant offered into evidence in the lower court certain other trust instruments created by Sidney F. Tyler<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> in which a specific direction is made to classify all stock dividends (ordinary and extraordinary) as principal. Appellant’s argument is that the insertion of such explicit provisions in two other instruments proves that Mr. Tyler, by not inserting such a provision in the instrument now before us, intended that small stock dividends be classified as income. The auditing judge at first sustained an objection to the introduction of these other trust instruments but then in his adjudication considered their evidentiary value and declared that the inference he was asked to draw therefrom was “pure conjecture.” A five-judge court en banc agreed with this conclusion.</p>

This case is unlike <em>Pew Trust </em>where, according to the majority opinion, the corpus of the trust was funded with common stock on which there was regularly paid an ordinary stock dividend of less than 6%. If it were not the intention of the settlor of the <em>Pew </em>trust to give these small stock dividends to the income beneficiary, then the benefits afforded by the trust to that beneficiary would have been entirely illusory. Here, however, the trust was funded originally with 2,500 shares of <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>preferred stock with respect to which no small stock dividends were ever paid. While appellant’s argument based on the other trusts created by Sidney F. Tyler is a reasonable one, it falls short of making it “especially clear” (see the alternate holding in <em>Pew Trust, </em>supra) that the settlor intended a different treatment of the ordinary dividends in the trust now before us than that ordained by the Act.</p>
