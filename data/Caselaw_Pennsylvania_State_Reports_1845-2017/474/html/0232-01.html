    <p id="b285-14" data-blocks='[["BL_285.14",285,[203,1780,1149,464]]]'>The appellee, John Shehadi, trading as Shehadi Brothers, sued the appellant, Northeastern National Bank of Pennsylvania, hereinafter the Bank, in assumpsit. In substance, Shehadi alleged that the Bank wrongfully appropriated the sum of Nine Hundred Seventy-five dollars and sixty-three cents ($975.63) from an account the parties had established as a “loss reserve” account pursuant to an arrangement whereby the Bank would buy installment contracts from Shehadi.</p>
    <p id="b285-15" data-blocks='[["BL_285.15",285,[209,2265,1148,101]],["BL_286.1",286,[273,279,1155,199]]]'>More particularly, the Bank and Shehadi, an appliance dealer, entered into an agreement whereby the Bank agreed <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>to purchase Shehadi’s installment contracts. The terms on which the contracts were purchased were set forth in an agreement, executed by both parties, entitled “Non-Recourse Plan.”</p>
    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[270,515,1158,537]]]'>The Non-Recourse Plan, which was in the form of a “letter agreement” provided that Shehadi would sell installment sales contracts to the Bank for an agreed-upon price and further provided that the Bank was to establish a “loss reserve” on its books by crediting thereto “all charges in excess of 6.5% discount” made on [installment] contracts purchased from Shehadi. The Plan further provided that the reserve fund was to be charged with “the unpaid balances, less any unearned finance charge, of delinquent installment sales contracts” purchased from Shehadi.</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[269,1079,1156,198]]]'>A portion of any balance remaining in the loss reserve fund was to be refunded to Shehadi at the end of each year and the entire balance was payable to Shehadi upon termination of the Plan.</p>
    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[267,1314,1156,308]]]'>While party to the Plan, Shehadi made an installment sale to one John Grochal, and entered into an installment contract with Grochal on a form provided by the Bank. The form contained two clauses for assigning the installment contract to the Bank. One clause was headed “with recourse” and read as follows:</p>
    <p id="b286-7" data-blocks='[["BL_286.7",286,[600,1650,460,42]]]'>“1) WITH RECOURSE</p>

    <p id="b286-9" data-blocks='[["BL_286.9",286,[265,2055,1153,88]]]'>The other clause was headed “without recourse” and read as follows:</p>

    <p id="b287-6" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[208,497,1148,253]]]'>The Bank and Shehadi both signed the “WITHOUT RECOURSE” portion of the form. Grochal defaulted and the Bank deducted the unpaid balance of $975.63 from the loss reserve fund it maintained for Shehadi. Shehadi brought suit to recover that amount.</p>
    <p id="b287-7" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[212,813,1151,758]]]'>The trial court concluded that Shehadi’s assignment “WITHOUT RECOURSE” precluded the Bank from charging the “loss reserve” fund with the loss resulting from Grochal’s default. The trial court reasoned that there existed an ambiguity between the plain meaning of the words “WITHOUT RECOURSE” in the installment contract and the terms of the “NON-RECOURSE PLAN” whereby the Bank could deduct certain losses from the “loss reserve” fund. The trial court then construed the contracts most strictly against the Bank which had prepared them. Shehadi was awarded $975.63 with interest. Exceptions filed by the Bank were dismissed and the Bank appealed the matter to the Superior Court which affirmed the trial court. We granted the Bank’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b287-8" data-blocks='[["BL_287.6",287,[209,1657,1150,481]]]'>We conclude that the trial court erred in finding that an ambiguity existed. The words “WITHOUT RECOURSE,” as they appeared in the assignment clause of the installment contract, are not to be read in a vacuum ignoring the explicitly stated intention of the parties, particularly where, as here, both parties are businessmen contracting at arms-length who knew that this particular transaction took place in the larger context of the financing assignment established by the “non-recourse plan.”</p>
    <p id="b287-9" data-blocks='[["BL_287.7",287,[211,2196,1150,150]]]'>As pointed out above, the endorsement in the installment contract “WITHOUT RECOURSE” referred to “a certain letter agreement,” i. e., the “NON-RECOURSE PLAN.”</p>
