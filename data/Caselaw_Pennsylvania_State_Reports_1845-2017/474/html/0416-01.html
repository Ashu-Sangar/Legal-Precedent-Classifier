Implicit in our holding in <em>Kravitz </em>is the conclusion that the facts which must be proved to establish the elements of the crime of murder in a criminal proceeding also establish that a killing is “wilful and unlawful” under the Slayer’s Act. Appellant suggests that the same is true of the crime of involuntary manslaughter.</p>

We believe that the different degree of culpability between murder and involuntary manslaughter justifies different treatment under the Slayer’s Act and reaffirm our holding in <em>Kravitz Estate </em>that the record of a murder conviction conclusively establishes a wilful and unlawful killing under the Slayer’s Act. In effect, a killing is wilful under the Slayer’s Act if it is committed intentionally or with malice.</p>

The measure of proof in a homicide case is ‘beyond a reasonable doubt.’ In a civil case it is the ‘fair weight of the evidence.’ Thus, an accused may be acquitted of homicide on the ground that the evidence did not prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and yet be denied a share of the victim’s estate for the reason that the fair weight of the evidence proves him to be a wilful killer.

By stating that appellee had not even been accused of wilful murder, the court was indicating that if it has the power to relitigate after an acquittal, a fortiori it has the power to decide the issue where an individual has never been tried for the offense. Moreover, other parts of the court’s opinion indicate that the criminal proceedings were not considered conclusive; rather, appellant simply failed to meet her burden of proof.

Appellant also argues that the Orphans’ Court improperly refused to determine whether the estate was entitled to recover from appellee the proceeds he collected as beneficiary of decedent’s life insurance policies. The only basis for appellant’s claim to the proceeds is the Slayer’s Act. ' Thus, even if the Orphans’ Court should have reached the issue, appellant has not been prejudiced. Had the court reached the merits, its determination that appellee was not a “slayer” would also have negated appellant’s claim for the insurance proceeds.
