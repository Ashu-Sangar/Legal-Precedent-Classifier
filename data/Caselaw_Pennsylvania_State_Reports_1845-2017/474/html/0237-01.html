Proving the existence of a marriage contract, except where <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>it is entered into ceremonially, is difficult, because it is likely to arise in an informal setting, where records are not kept. Therefore, the courts of this Commonwealth have developed certain rules and presumptions to aid them in determining whether a marriage contract has been entered. Appellant asserts that when these rules and presumptions are properly applied, the evidence is insufficient to prove a common law marriage between decedent and appellee Mildred K. Moyer.</p>
    <p id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.4",293,[195,819,1148,715]]]'>Cohabitation of a man and a woman, both of whom are capable of contracting marriage, and a reputation as husband and wife in their community together raise a presumption that the parties have contracted marriage. E. g., <em>Thorndell </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em><a href="/pa/25/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="25 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="975831" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0326-01">25 Pa. 326</a> (1855); <em>Commonwealth v.

Where, however, the relationship between the parties began while at least one party was married to a third person, the courts will presume that the parties continued to live together unmarried even after the impediment to their marriage had been removed. Clear and convincing evidence of a change of status is required to rebut this presumption. E. g., <em>Pierce v. Pierce, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b293-6" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[197,1562,1148,380]]]'>In this instance, the Auditing Judge recognized that the cohabitation of Harold L. Garges and Mildred K.

All that is essential is proof of an agreement to enter into the legal <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>relationship of marriage at the present time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> For example, in <em>Rosenberger Estate, </em><a href="/pa/362/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="362 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="477310" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0153-01">362 Pa. at 155</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.2d%20377" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="65 A.2d 377">65 A.2d at 379</a>, a marriage contract was found where the man gave the woman a ring and said, “Now you have the ring and you are my wife,” whereupon she replied, “That is fine. I love it.” These words are in form mere statements by the man that a condition of marriage exists and by the woman of pleasure with that fact, but in their context the words indicated an agreement to marry.</p>
