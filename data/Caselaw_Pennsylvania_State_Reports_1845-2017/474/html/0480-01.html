The suppression motion was granted after a hearing and the motion to quash denied. At the beginning of trial, the Commonwealth’s attorney informed the court that he was proceeding on the murder count in the indictment and that the involuntary manslaughter charge would be nol-prossed at “the proper time.” Appellant’s counsel did not then object to this procedure or seek to have the general charges consolidated for trial. At the conclusion of the testimony, however, defense counsel submitted to the court a point for charge on the elements of involuntary manslaughter. This was denied. The jury found appellant guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Following denial of post-trial motions appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one and one-half to ten years.

He awoke at approximately 4:30 a.m. on July 2 and went to get a glass of water in the kitchen, when he heard his neighbor, Mr. Fred Dean, outside preparing to go to work. After calling out to Mr. Dean, inquiring whether he could have a cigarette, the defendant went out the back door of his house, got the cigarette and returned a few minutes later. It was at this point, the defendant testified, that he first heard some sort of noise on the second floor of his house. The defendant testified that he was concerned because he had not given permission to anyone to enter his house the night before nor had he been aware of anyone even being in his house prior to his hearing the noise. The defendant stated that he suddenly became ‘a little shaky and scared’ because he had been the victim of eight burglaries within <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>the last couple of years. The defendant stated that he then got his gun. As the defendant was going up the stairs, he said he realized the noise was coming from the middle bedroom, the door of which was shut. He then opened the door and saw a man and a woman in bed. He stated that he did not immediately recognize who the woman was but subsequently identified her as Miss Miller. He recognized the man to be an individual whom he knew as ‘Payton’ (subsequently identified as the decedent, Leon Williams), a man with whom he had come in contact on many previous unpleasant occasions.</blockquote>

I view this as a motion to sever the count charging involuntary manslaughter. <em>No objection was interposed by the defense. </em>The trial court granted the request and the trial proceeded. At the conclusion of the presentation of testimony, when both sides rested their respective cases, defendant submitted a requested point of charge as to the elements of involuntary manslaughter. This request was, in fact, no more than a belated request that the court reconsider its earlier order permitting the severance of the count charging involuntary manslaughter. Thus, the real question raised was whether the court abused its discretion by refusing to reconsider its earlier order to which the defendant did not express opposition. So stated, no responsible reviewing court could find such an abuse of discretion would justify reversal and the grant of a new trial .with the incidental unnecessary and unwarranted <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>expense and inconvenience to the people of this Commonwealth.

As I stated in my dissent in <em>Garcia, </em>the accused has no right to determine the charge or charges that are brought against him. The accused’s rights flow from the response to those charges. As we urged in the dissent in <em>Garcia, </em>the charging decision is a prosecutorial function. Thus the prosecution, in electing to seek an involuntary manslaughter indictment, could have been required to present this charge to the jury. However, the prosecution like the defense, has a right to seek permission from the court to modify an earlier decision that they believe upon reflection to have been unwise. Where that request was not opposed and granted by the court, a belated request for reconsideration of the order could only constitute an abuse of discretion when the most compelling reasons were offered. Such was not the case here.</p>
