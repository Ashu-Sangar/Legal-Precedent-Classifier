We granted appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal and this appeal followed. Appellant contends that the trial court improperly granted appellee’s motion for a compulsory non-suit after appellant had rested her case.

The last tenant to occupy appellee’s rental property vacated the premises in the fall of 1968. The property was in a state of disrepair: windows were broken; beneath one window was a large hole; another hole, located in the foundation wall, had been stuffed with rags; several other holes existed in the outside walls; lattice work between a frame porch and the ground had been torn down; the property harbored large rats; dogs wandered in and out of the basement; and unpleasant odors emanated from the property.</p>

Such properties “invite” strangers for various purposes and are more likely to be targets for arsonists than are properties maintained in good repair. Appellee’s conduct in allowing the property to deteriorate, particularly after the first fire, increased the risk that a fire would occur on the premises. We are unwilling to say, as a matter of law, that the <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>maintenance of a vacant dwelling house in a state of disrepair visible to passersby does not create an unreasonable fire hazard. That hazard in this case was located only five or six feet from appellant’s house. A jury question was thus presented as to whether the appellee negligently maintained his property prior to the second fire. The jury should have been permitted to consider the condition of the property, and whether its state of disrepair created an unreasonable risk of harm by fire to appellant’s property.</p>

Whether the issue is discussed in terms of <em>proximate cause </em>or <em>legal cause </em>the underlying considerations and the result are the same. Under the older and more traditional approach the issue was whether the defendant’s conduct was a proximate cause or a remote cause. Under the Restatement approach the issue is whether the defendant’s conduct was, on the one hand, a “substantial factor” or a “substantial cause” or, on the other hand, whether the defendant’s conduct was an “insignificant cause” or a “negligible cause.” See Section 431, Restatement of Torts, Second. The determination of the issue simply involves the making of a judgment as to whether the defendant’s conduct although a cause in the “but for” sense is so insignificant that no <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>ordinary mind would think of it as a cause for which a defendant should be held responsible. Section 431, comment a, Restatement of Torts, Second, explains the distinction between substantial cause and cause in fact as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="AJL2" data-blocks='[["BL_647.4",647,[209,515,1106,564]]]'>“The word ‘substantial’ is used to denote the fact that the defendant’s conduct has such an affect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause, using that word in the popular sense, in which there always lurks the idea of responsibility, rather than in the so-called ‘philosophic sense,’ which includes every one of the great number of events without which any happening would not have occurred. Each of these events is a cause in the so-called ‘philosophic sense,’ yet the effect of many of them is so <em>insignificant </em>that no ordinary mind would think of them as causes.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b647-5" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[163,1110,1150,621]]]'> The determination of whether the conduct of the defendant was a substantial cause or an insignificant cause of plaintiff’s harm should not be taken from the jury if the jury may reasonably differ as to whether the conduct of the defendant was a substantial cause or an insignificant cause. Section 434(l)(a), Restatement of Torts, Second. Such is the case before us. When one negligently maintains property so as to create a fire hazard to an adjoining property and fire harm results, we refuse to conclude, as a matter of law, that the negligent conduct in maintaining the fire hazard was an insignificant cause. This issue is therefore one for the jury to consider.</p>

The danger of fire is certainly within the ambit of risks occasioned by the conduct of a property owner who allows his premises to fall in such a state of disrepair that it becomes a fire hazard, and the adjoining property owners are within the class of persons likely to be harmed thereby. If the jury determines from the evidence that the property owner could have abated the hazard and made the premises reasonably safe “by repair or otherwise”, the owner’s failure to do so may properly be considered a failure to exercise reasonable care, therefore justifying a finding of negligence.</p>

It is therefore urged that there can be no basis for a finding that the state of disrepair of appellee’s property was in fact a legal cause for the resulting damage to appellant’s property. In essence the argument presupposes that in absence of positive evidence that the dilapidated condition substantially contributed to either the start of the fire or its spread, we must hold as a matter of law that appellant has failed to establish that the condition was a legal cause and thus there would be no basis upon which to fasten upon appellee the responsibility for appellant’s loss.

When such evidence is in the case, the liability of the allegedly negligent property owner is a question properly left for resolution by the jury. The principle as stated is merely a procedural doctrine, the effect of which is to raise an <em>inference </em>to a causal nexus between the alleged negligence and the harm, and to shift to the defendant the <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>burden of going forward with the evidence, thus taking all such cases to the jury.</p>

The general rule appears to be that an owner of property is <em>not liable </em>for the spread of fire started upon the owner’s property by a stranger or by some other cause with which the owner has no connection, where he has not been negligent with respect to the condition of his premises. <em>See </em>Annot. <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.L.R.%202d%201081" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="18 A.L.R. 2d 1081">18 A.L.R.2d 1081</a>, 1093-95. However, the critical question in determining the property owner’s liability turns upon whether his neglect has rendered the condition of the premises a fire hazard. A number of jurisdictions have held that an owner of property which has been negligently left in such a condition that it is easy for a fire to ignite thereon, or to spread to neighboring premises, is liable for damage resulting from a fire even though the fire starts by pure accident, by an act of a third party or some other source for which he would not otherwise be held responsible. <em>See Scally </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em><a href="/cal-app-3d/23/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="23 Cal.

This inference of causation is not conclusive, and unlike a rebuttable presumption, may be rejected by the factfinder even in absence of evidence contrary to the inferred fact. <em>See </em>Wigmore, Evidence, § 2490 (3d Ed. 1940). When the evidence in a case establishes that the condition created by the defendant’s negligence actually constituted a fire hazard; that is, created an unreasonable risk that a fire might ignite thereon, or an unreasonable risk that a fire, once ignited, would spread to adjoining premises; and that a conflagration actually occurred thereon, it does no violence to our jurisprudence to permit the factfinder to conclude, solely from these facts, if it chooses to do so, that there existed a causal relationship between the conduct of the defendant landowner and the resultant harm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
