He was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Following denial of post-verdict motions, sentence of 5-10 years imprisonment was imposed. This direct appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b683-8" data-blocks='[["BL_683.8",683,[159,893,1148,468]]]'>Summarized briefly, the record establishes that two men entered the victim’s store on the evening of October 27, 1972. One was armed with a rifle and the other with a pistol. During the course of the robbery the proprietor was mortally wounded. A third man, appellant, drove the others to and from the scene and remained outside in his automobile during the incident. Two of the perpetrators were apprehended by police and subsequently implicated appellant.</p>
    <p id="b683-9" data-blocks='[["BL_683.9",683,[158,1393,1147,259]]]'>Appellant Jackson was arrested at approximately 11:00 P.M., November 7, 1972. He was transported to the office of the Chief of Detectives and informed that he had been implicated in the armed robbery. Appellant then received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and gave the following responses:</p>

Jackson said, “All right bring him in.” The confrontation occurred but appellant insisted the man was lying and made no incriminating statement. . Appellant was booked for armed <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>robbery and murder but was arraigned only on the charge of armed robbery at 3:15 A.M. on November 8,1972. Thereafter he was returned to the cellblock where he remained until 8:00 P.M. that evening. At that time he was approached by an officer who stated: “Doug, we have the rifle which came from the cellar of your home . . . It’s being sent to the lab . . .We have the bullets taken out of the body of Mr. Stieff [sic] ... is there anything you want to say. The District Attorney is up there now, do you want to talk to him?” Appellant responded, “I want to say my side of the story, those two punks say their story and they are the ones who did it.” Following <em>Miranda </em>warnings appellant made an inculpatory statement which was then reduced to writing and signed. Arraignment on the murder charge occurred at approximately 9:00 P.M. on November 9, 1972.</p>

Appellant argues that his initial response indicated a desire to remain silent.
