The United States Supreme Court reasoned that due process does not permit vindictiveness against a defendant who has successfully attacked his conviction to play a part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.

Presumably, those ‘unarticulated principles’ have to do with the ultimate goals of rehabilitation, deterrence, and punishment. Although it has been argued that trial and appellate courts should more closely analyze sentences as possible means of attaining those goals, it should be noted that certain less cosmic ‘reasoñs’ for severe sentences have been designated as improper. For example, the fact that the defendant stood trial or refused to admit his guilt should in most jurisdictions be irrelevant to the sentencing decision. Such reasons now become part of the record only if the sentencing judge is unusually frank or if he blunders. To say that recorded reasons will not necessarily be honest overlooks the potentially benign, standardizing effect of appellate instruction as to proper reasoning in sentencing.</blockquote>

The sentencing colloquy indicates that the trial court may have sentenced appellant under the misapprehension that the maximum sentence was fifteen years and a fine of $250,000.

Moreover, this record does not <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>contain sufficient information to determine whether the sentence imposed was proper or whether as three judges of the Superior Court found the sentence was “manifestly excessive.” <em>Commonwealth v.
