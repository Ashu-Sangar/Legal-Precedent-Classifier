    <p id="b118-7" data-blocks='[["BL_118.6",118,[254,759,1161,958]]]'>On July 28, 1973, at approximately 11:45 a. m., John Benkert was fatally wounded by a gunshot while seated in his car at a highway intersection in south Philadelphia. At trial, two eyewitnesses identified Perillo as the person who shot Benkert. Perillo was also connected to the killing through a fingerprint, and through ballistic tests which compared cartridge casings of bullets found at the scene of the crime with cartridge casings of bullets fired from a .25 caliber pistol owned by Perillo and seized by police pursuant to a search warrant. The defense disputed the validity of the Commonwealth’s evidence concerning the fingerprint and the validity of the conclusions which were drawn from the ballistics tests. Additionally, the defense presented various witnesses in an attempt to establish Perillo was not at the scene of the crime at the time Benkert was shot. In this connection, the defense called Daniel Murtha who testified, in effect, that he saw a person with a gun fleeing the scene of the killing and that Perillo was not this person.</p>

The boy referred to is Anthony Helmer, who appeared for the Commonwealth at trial and testified that he was present at the scene of the crime and that Perillo was the person who shot Benkert. This statement contains admissions which suggest Giordano’s trial testimony was perjured as a result of inducements offered by an investigator working on behalf of Perillo. The other statement was given by Anthony Helmer’s mother, Theresa Helmer, and suggests the same investigator told her that Anthony was the only witness to the killing and that Anthony would alone bear the responsibility of putting Perillo “behind bars.” She opined the investigator was attempting to pressure Anthony into not testifying. Both statements were given to authorities subsequent to trial.</p>
