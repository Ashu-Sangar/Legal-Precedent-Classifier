Appellant and his witnesses testified to several instances in which he was subjected to verbal abuse because of his race. Such verbal abuse was a continuing occurrence throughout appellant’s three year employment at Victor’s Restaurant. The continuing racial tension created by such abuse caused appellant repeated humiliation and apprehension. These reactions were not mere whims, nor were they caused by any overly sensitive emotional condition on appellant’s part. The humiliation and apprehension were emotions grounded in reality and were substantial burdens placed upon appellant’s ability to perform his job. The degrading and abusive effects of the repeated expressions of racial prejudice were cumulative in nature and ultimately created an employment condition which would have been intolerable to any reasonable person in similar circumstances. The record establishes that appellant left his job after suffering through three years of such repeated incidents of racial prejudice and verbal abuse. These incidents provided appellant with “ . . . real, not imaginary, substantial, not trifling . ” reasons which “compelled” his termination of employment. <em>Sturdevant Unemployment Compensation Case, supra, </em><a href="/pa-super/158/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="158 Pa.
