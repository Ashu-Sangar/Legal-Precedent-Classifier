Neither appellant nor her husband were present at either time. The three children were left alone without an adult in charge. The worker observed that clothes were strewn throughout the living room, that Kelly’s eye was pink, and that the baby, Shannon Coleen, was dirty and improperly clothed. John said that his mother and stepfather were out trying to find a doctor, but that he did not know who the doctor was. When asked if he and the other children had anything to eat, John replied that appellant and her husband would bring groceries back when they returned. The worker made a third visit to the trailer later in January and again found the children unattended.</p>

The worker contacted the trailer owner on behalf of the Burnses, and obtained their clothing from the trailer. On January 23, she met with appellant at the apartment to discuss the family’s situation. Appellant was in considerable discomfort, however, and the meeting was short. The same day, appellant entered the hospital and subsequently suffered a miscarriage.</p>

Mrs. Davis agreed to do so. Mr. Burns was to bring Kelly to an agreed upon location in town where Mrs. Davis was to receive the child. He did not appear, however, and the following day both Kelly and John arrived at Mrs. Davis’ house in a taxi. Although appellant had never asked her to take care of John, Mrs. Davis took both children and kept them for at least four days. Appellant did not notify Mrs. Davis when she was discharged from the hospital. When Mrs. Davis learned from the hospital that appellant had been discharged, she took the children and began looking for appellant. Mrs. Davis located the mother at a bar or restaurant and returned Kelly and John.

Based on the agency’s prior knowledge of the family, and the information provided by John, Child Welfare Services immediately obtained a court order authorizing the placement of Kelly and Shannon in foster care. The two children were taken from the Kress home and placed in foster care the same day.</p>

Appellant and her husband did not receive this notice until after the hearing. However, appellant learned of the hearing through her mother-in-law a day or two before it was held. Appellant testified that she was unable to attend the hearing because she had no transportation from Uniontown. On the day of the hearing appellant reached the Child Welfare Services worker in the judge’s chambers by telephone. She was extremely angered by the agency’s placement of the children in foster care and told the worker, “There’s going to be somebody dead over this.” The worker made an appointment for appellant and Mr. Burns to visit with her the following day.

From the date her children were placed in foster care, until she responded to the petition to terminate her parental rights more than ten months later, appellant completely removed herself from active involvement in the lives of her children. Despite appellant’s hostile reaction to having her children placed in foster care, after the placement she was content to allow others to provide for their care and support, while she pursued goals and activities of her own. Appellant’s passive interest in their well being did not satisfy the children’s continuing needs for responsible parental care. Her conduct did not satisfy her affirmative duty to utilize all available resources to preserve her parental rights.</p>

She argues that Child Welfare Services was not justified in placing the children in foster care because there is no evidence that the care they were receiving at Mrs. Kress’ home was inadequate. Because she believed the placement unwarranted, she refused to contact the agency. The record amply supports a finding that judicial action was necessary at the time the children were placed in the custody of the agency. The haphazard manner in which Kelly and Shannon Coleen, in appellant’s absence, found their way into an unfamiliar home, supports this conclusion. However, even if the court had erred in placing the children in foster care, this occurrence would not suspend appellant’s duty to continue efforts to maintain a place of importance in her children’s lives. The children, and not the agency, suffered from appellant’s inaction.</p>

A parent may, in order to avoid the stigma of a finding of abandonment, oppose a petition to terminate parental rights, and yet be willing to consent to an adoption he or she perceives to be in the best interests of the child. It is also possible that, despite a present finding that a parent’s rights have been preserved, subsequent failure to maintain the parental relationship may at a later time justify termination of the parent’s rights.
