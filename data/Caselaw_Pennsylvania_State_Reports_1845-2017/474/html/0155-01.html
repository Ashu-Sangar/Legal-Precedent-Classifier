      <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>On remand, the trial court made the following findings. The district attorney was assigned to this case on February 7, 1973, and had exclusive control over the prosecution. His representation of the victim began on August 29,1973, when the victim’s counsel in Pittsburgh referred the civil case to the district attorney. The civil action involved the same evidence, the same witnesses and many of the same legal and factual issues. The district attorney decided not to name appellant as a defendant in the civil action because he concluded that a judgment against appellant would be worthless. Instead, he decided to sue the owner of the bar where the stabbing took place. The district attorney did not disclose to the prosecution witnesses that he represented the victim in the civil action. On August 28, 1974, the district attorney voluntarily withdrew from the civil case.</p>

Nor was his obligation to the victim in the civil action actually inconsistent in any respect with his obligations to the Commonwealth in the criminal prosecution of the appellant.” It appears that the trial court concluded that appellant suffered no actual prejudice as a result of the district attorney’s dual representation. A conclusion that there was no conflict of interest would clearly be erroneous. A district attorney’s professional responsibility is to seek justice — to protect the innocent as well as to convict the guilty. A private attorney, however, has an obligation to zealously represent his client and to seek to resolve all questions in favor of his client. Because the professional responsibilities of a district attorney and a private attorney differ, anytime a district attorney represents the victim in a civil suit at the same <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>time that he is prosecuting the defendant, a conflict of interest exists.</p>
