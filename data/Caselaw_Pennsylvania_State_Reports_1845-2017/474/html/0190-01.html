For purposes of the instant discussion it is sufficient to note that prior to his formal arrest appellant made numerous oral statements which were contradictory and, although intended to be exculpatory, placed the appellant at the scene of the crime with the victim at or about the time she met her untimely death. The questioning of Mr. Romberger by police officials took place between 12:30 P. M. and 11:52 P. M. when he was formally charged with the murder. During this period of time he was moved from his home to police headquarters, a partial polygraph was conducted and he was taken to the scene of the crime. Thereafter he was formally charged, arraigned and administered full <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Thereupon appellant admitted killing the deceased, gave a written signed statement to that effect. It is conceded for purposes of this appeal that Mr. Romberger was not given the full panoply of warnings until he was formally charged and arraigned.</p>

In response the prosecution argued that appellant was afforded all the required procedural safeguards dictated by <em>Miranda. </em>Specifically, it was argued that the questioning prior to the time appellant was formally charged with the murder of Ms. Keifer did not require that the warnings be given, that in any event the statements were voluntary, that Romberger had waived his right to the particular warning and, in the alternative, that under the totality of the circumstances, the warning in question was unnecessary.

The trial court predicated its finding that the written statement was admissible upon its. conclusion that the giving of adequate warnings prior to the obtaining of that statement dissipated the taint arising from the original illegality. The court distinguished the issue presented in the first trial on the grounds that in that trial the Commonwealth had been allowed to introduce, over defense objection, testimony relating to the oral statements as well as the written statement. In the second trial all evidence pertaining to the questioning which elicited appellant’s oral responses was excluded and only the written statement was introduced. The court reasoned that since the written statement was preceded by the formal arrest, arraignment and adequate warnings these factors attenuated the taint occasioned by the initial incomplete warnings.
