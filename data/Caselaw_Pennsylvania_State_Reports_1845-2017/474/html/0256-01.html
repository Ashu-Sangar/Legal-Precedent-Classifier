The judicial discretion is the determination of the period of control over the person of the offender in view of the nature of the crime, the background of the defendant and the other pertinent considerations for such a decision. <em>See Commonwealth v. Martin, </em><a href="/pa/466/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="466 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1714943" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0118-01">466 Pa. 118</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="466 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1714943" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0118-01">351 A.2d 650</a> (1976). It is this exercise of discretion that the rule of the “inviolability of final judgment” seeks to protect. The institution in which the sentence is to be served, the objects sought to be accomplished during this period of control and all of the other penological considerations are not primarily judicial functions. Thus the <em>Cain </em>Court properly concluded that those portions of the statute which did not alter the judicial decision as to the length of time of state control over the offender did not impinge upon the traditional judicial sentencing power and thus did not alter <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>or modify the judicial sentence which had become final.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> On the other hand, that Court found unconstitutional those provisions of the Act in question which would have permitted an alteration of the duration of the sentence.</p>

An even more graphic example of how a retroactive application can completely frustrate the judicial discretion and bring about a miscarriage of justice can be found in the appeal of Mr. Sutley. Although the court accepted a plea of possession of marijuana, the testimony of the arresting officer established a clear case of sale. Trooper Oliver’s statement indicated that on September 12, 1970, at approximately 5:20 P.M., he purchased from James W. Sutley a substance which was later identified to be marijuana. At the time of the sentencing hearing, which was conducted by a judge other than the one who had accepted the plea, the following statement occurred:</p>
    <blockquote id="b322-5" data-blocks='[["BL_322.7",322,[299,1196,1116,415]]]'>THE COURT: Well, the problem we’ve had concerning Mr. Sutley all along is where he is going to live and what he is going to do.

I don’t know why the District Attorney reduced it down to possession. It appeared as if the offense was reasonably clear. I didn’t take the plea.</blockquote>

If, however, the new Section is held to apply in this instance and a resentencing is required, the court is powerless to impose a new sentence which would be commensurate with the true nature of the offense. Thus, not only does such a result completely distort the exercise of judicial discretion which permitted the plea to the lesser offense, but it also frustrates the legislative purpose sought to be achieved by a new Act since the new provision was specially designed only for those who committed the crime of possession and not for those who were engaged in the unlawful sale or distribution of controlled substances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

The court has the same discretion in imposing sentence under the Resentencing Amendment as it does in imposing sentence on persons convicted of violating the Controlled Substance Act. Even if the court had no discretion, however, this would not mean that the Resentencing Act was unconstitutional. See <em>United States v.

The majority asserts that it is common to accept a plea to a lesser offense, then impose the same sentence as would be imposed if the defendant had been found guilty of the greater offense. I am not prepared to take judicial notice that such a practice is widely followed. As the judge who sentenced Sutley was not the judge who accepted the plea, a claim that the practice was followed here would be pure speculation. Assuming the practice is a common one, it raises some troublesome issues. It is certainly arguable that it would be improper to sentence a person as though he had been convicted of the greater offense, when he has only been convicted of a lesser offense. In some cases, the practice might raise doubt as to the validity of the plea. The propriety of the practice is not before us, however. It is enough to conclude that the possible existence of the practice is not a sufficient basis to hold that the Resentencing Amendment is unconstitutional.

In his dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Manderino concludes that the discussion of the constitutionality of the legislation in <em>Johnson </em>was not a holding of the Court. I agree with this conclusion. Although the Court in <em>Johnson </em>stated that it thought the act was unconstitutional, it decided the case “independently of the constitutional objection, which is not decisive to all of us.” <a href="/pa/42/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="214" data-cite="42 Pa. 446" data-case-ids="481565" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0446-01">42 Pa. at 449</a>.
