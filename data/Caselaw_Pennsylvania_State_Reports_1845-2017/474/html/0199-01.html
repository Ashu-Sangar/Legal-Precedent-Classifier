Neville used these blocks as components in the production of structural planks which were fitted together to form floor and ceiling systems in the construction of buildings. The. blocks were delivered to Neville in bound “cubes” containing a number of blocks. These “cubes” were kept in Neville’s inventory until needed on Neville’s production line for the manufacture of the structural planks. The manufacturing of the planks involved (1) grinding the ends of the blocks to make them smooth; (2) assembling the blocks end to end to form a plank of the desired length; (3) placing reinforcing rods and a prestressing cable through the holes in the concrete block units and stressing the plank; (4) inserting grout around the reinforcing rods and cable and (5) curing the completed plank. The manufactured planks were fit together by tongue and groove to form the floor and ceiling systems in various types of buildings. After installation in a building, the grooves between the planks on the floor surfaces were filled in with grout to make a solid level floor. On the ceiling surface, the points formed by the abutting planks were filled with a cement caulking and any chips or defects were filled in and textured. The floor surface was then <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>ready to receive carpeting and the ceiling surface was ready for painting.</p>
    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[262,406,1157,521]]]'>. In 1963, when Neville began purchasing cement blocks from Lampus, Neville instructed Lampus as to its requirements for the block which it desired to use in the assembly of the floor and ceiling systems. These instructions included dimension, strength, and material requirements. From 1963 until 1967 Neville ordered block of a type known as “Dox” block. Beginning in 1967 Neville also began to order “Celdex” block, a block of a different size than “Dox” block. From August, 1968, until May, 1970, Neville purchased “Celdex” block exclusively.</p>
    <p id="b254-5" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[257,949,1159,946]]]'>During the 1967-1968 transition from the manufacture of “Dox” block to “Celdex” block, Lampus experienced certain manufacturing problems resulting in the delivery of some defective blocks to Neville. By letter dated July 21, 1968, Neville made claims against Lampus in the amount of $51,990.24 for damages suffered as the result of defective blocks received. On August 15, 1968, Lampus settled the claim by crediting Neville’s account for $25,000.00. Lampus, however, did not solve its manufacturing problems and some of the blocks it delivered afterwards were also defective, either in structural soundness or aesthetic appearance. Complaints by Neville resulted in repeated meetings between the parties. At these meetings Lampus representatives were shown samples of the defective blocks. Lampus representatives were also shown finished ceilings which did not have the required appearance because of defects in the blocks. Lampus acknowledged it was having manufacturing problems and indicated that they could be solved.</p>

Subsequently, by letter dated July 15, 1970, Neville submitted a claim for damages allegedly sustained after July 31,1968, as a result of the defective blocks. Shortly thereafter, Lampus brought an action in assumpsit to recover over $97,000 allegedly due for the concrete block units and related equipment and supplies. Neville filed a <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>counterclaim for damages totalling approximately $178,000 claiming breach of express and implied warranties.

The Superior Court discussed <em>Keystone Diesel, supra, </em>and commented on “certain difficulties faced by courts and commentators in interpreting <em>Keystone Diesel </em>in light of the Code provisions . . . .” The Court also noted that the “tacit agreement” test seemingly used in <em>Keystone Diesel </em>to determine the existence of “special circumstances” under section 2-714(2) appears inconsistent with Uniform Commercial Code section 2-715(2)(a). Section 2-715(2)(a) states that consequential damages-include any loss resulting from the buyer’s needs or requirements “of which the seller at the time of contracting <em>had reason to know,” </em>(emphasis added), thus indicating a “reasonable foreseeability” approach. The Superior Court opinion also refers to Comment 2 of section 2-715, which states that “[t]he ‘tacit agreement’ test for thé recovery of consequential damages is rejected,” and Comment 3 which states that “[i]t is not necessary that there be a conscious acceptance of an insurer’s liability on the seller’s part.”</p>

It found, contrary to the trial court, that items 5 through 8 were within the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the contracts at issue “because the record reveals that sufficient facts were communicated to Lampus to put it on notice that Neville intended to hold it responsible for the damages it seeks to recover.” It affirmed the trial court’s disallowance of the last two items, Nos. 9 and 10, because they were losses which reasonably could have been prevented, and because 2-715(2)(a) limits recovery to those consequential damages “which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.” Finally, the Superior Court concluded that Neville was not barred, under Uniform Commercial Code Section 2-607(3)(a), relat<a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>ing to notice to the seller of breach, because “many meetings between the parties took place during the years in question, and . . .

In <em>Keystone Diesel, </em>a dealer in diesel engines sold a diesel engine to one Irwin. This engine was subsequently installed in a tractor, but did not function properly. Repairs were then made for which Irwin refused to pay. Keystone sued in assumpsit and Irwin filed a counterclaim for loss of profits. The basis of the counterclaim was Irwin’s inability to use the tractor for 27 days because of various breakdowns of the engine, in breach of an implied warranty of merchantability. The trial court struck off the counterclaim because the claim for loss of profits was too speculative. We affirmed, holding that “special circumstances,” mentioned in Section 2-714(2), must be communicated to the seller to make it apparent that the consequential damages, mentioned in Section 2-715, were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties.</p>
    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[260,1279,1162,1066]],["BL_259.1",259,[204,306,1146,152]]]'>Lampus now asks us to apply the law of <em>Keystone Diesel </em>to this case. It argues that “special circumstances” (Section 2-714(2)) were not established by Neville and thus Neville is not entitled to the consequential damages (Section 2-715) claimed because the parties did not contemplate such damages. Upon further reflection, however, we conclude that <em>Keystone Diesel </em>incorrectly held that the “special circumstances” mentioned in Section 2-714 must be established before consequential damages under Section 2-715 can be recovered. Section 2-714(2) is concerned with <em>value of the goods </em>damages and not with incidental (Section 2-715(1)) or consequential damages (Section 2-715(2)). <em>See </em>J. White &amp; R.

Under Section 2-715(2), consequential damages are proper for any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting <em>had reason to know </em>and which could <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.

    <p id="b261-4" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[190,861,1151,1497]]]'>Under Section 2-715(2), Neville was entitled to any consequential damages resulting from its general or particular requirements and needs which Lampus <em>had reason to know </em>and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise. The “had reason to know” test does not require that it be shown that the seller contemplated or tacitly agreed to certain consequential damages. A seller “had reason to know” that which a reasonable person would have known. Of necessity, the test also covers that which a seller knows. If a seller knows of a buyer’s general or particular requirements and needs, that seller is liable for the resulting consequential damages whether or not that seller contemplated or agreed to such damages. Applying this test rather than the <em>Keystone </em>test followed by the Superior Court, we reach the same conclusion. Lampus not only had reason to know, it actually knew, <em>all </em>of Neville’s requirements and needs. Lampus knew that the cement blocks had to meet certain structural and aesthetic standards to be of full value to Neville. It knew exactly what use Neville was making of the blocks. It knew that the blocks were to be formed into planks for use in structural floor and ceiling systems. In short, there was absolutely nothing that Lampus, the seller, did not know about the general or particular requirements and needs of Neville, the buyer. Moreover, there is no doubt that Neville’s losses resulted from its requirements and needs as known by Lampus. Under these circumstances, Neville was entitled to the consequential damages awarded by the trial court and the Superior Court.</p>

Lampus has moved to strike that portion of Neville’s brief because Neville did not file a petition for allowance of appeal from the order of the Superior Court. We agree with Lampus and grant the motion to strike. We thus express no opinion as to those two items of damages.</p>
