It is axiomatic that a criminal conviction cannot be upheld when sufficient evidence to support the conviction does not exist in the record. See, e. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Stanley, </em><a href="/pa/453/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="453 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="577583" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0467-01">453 Pa. 467</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20408" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="309 A.2d 408">309 A.2d 408</a> (1973). This proposition applies with equal force to contempt. <em>Commonwealth v.

Because facts recited in a court opinion cannot serve as a substitute for facts of record, <em>Commonwealth v.

Therefore, I must dissent.</p>
