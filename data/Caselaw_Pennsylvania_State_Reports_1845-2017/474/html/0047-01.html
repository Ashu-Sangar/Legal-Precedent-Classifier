Appellant John Black was arrested immediately thereafter and charged with murder. Following a trial before a jury in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Black was convicted of murder of the second degree. Post-trial motions were argued and denied and appellant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of not less than five nor more than twenty years in the state correctional institution at Graterford.

It is now argued that the trial court erred in refusing to permit the jury to hear the testimony of two defense witnesses, a psychiatrist and a psychologist, who would have testified concerning the state of mind of appellant at the time of the incident in order to support the claim of self-defense.

On the evening of January 10, 1974, appellant was at his home on Juniata Street in Philadelphia with his <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>common law wife, Ruth Black. Mrs. Black was the mother of Lillian Williford, the wife of the decedent, who resided on North 21st Street in Philadelphia. Mrs. Williford telephoned her mother that evening at approximately 7:00 P.M., and after they had briefly conversed, appellant informed his wife that he wished to speak to Mrs. Williford. Appellant took the telephone and asked to speak to the decedent. Mrs. Williford went upstairs to listen to the conversation on an extension telephone, and the decedent’s 14-year-old son also listened in on a basement extension. They both testified that appellant sounded “drunk.” They heard appellant curse at decedent and tell him, “If you come down here, I’ll kill you on the spot. I’ll shoot you. I’ll be waiting for you.” They further testified that the decedent said, “Now John,” then hung up the telephone, put on his coat and left the house. Following his departure at approximately 7:30 P.M., Mrs. Williford telephoned the police.</p>

The body was between appellant’s property at 1851 Juniata Street and the adjoining neighbor’s residence at 1853. Appellant was sitting on the top step of his front porch holding a gun in his hand. The officer asked what happened and appellant replied, “I shot him.” After handing over his weapon, a .22 calibre revolver, to the officer, appellant was arrested and taken to the Police Administration Building for questioning. The Commonwealth’s medical examiner testified that the decedent died from a single .22 calibre bullet which entered his chest from the front.</p>

Appellant testified that the decedent had argued with him one month before the shooting concerning statements made by appellant to a woman whom the decedent was seeing. Appellant testified that Mr. Williford was enraged because be (Black) had told the lady that Williford was married. It was further testified that the decedent initiated the same argu<a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>ment over the telephone on the evening of the shooting. The decedent threatened appellant, and, despite appellant’s entreaties, stated that he was “coming down to settle it on the street.” After hanging up, Black stated that he was “mixed up and excited.” He feared a confrontation, and instructed his wife to bring their dog around to the front of the house. He then stood in the open front doorway to await Williford’s arrival. Within minutes, the decedent pulled up in front of the house, jumped out of his car and ran toward appellant while reaching into his pocket.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The decedent’s actions allegedly frightened appellant, and in response, Black grabbed a gun which the family kept on the top of the radio near the front door, pointed it in decedent’s direction and “just hauled off and shot him.” After firing one shot, which proved fatal, appellant sat down on the porch to await the arrival of the authorities. Williford, upon being struck by the bullet, collapsed on the sidewalk near the curb.</p>

Any of these options could have safely been pursued without increasing the risk of harm to Black. Under these circumstances, we find that the use of deadly force was unwarranted.

Appellant did not request an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, but this does not constitute a waiver of a claim that the killing was committed without malice. Appellant’s belief that he was acting in self-defense might serve to negate malice. Because this evidence might serve to negate an element of the crime, appellant was entitled to introduce evidence of his belief, even though the evidence might prove appellant guilty of another crime. If there is a concern that appellant might be found not guilty of murder where the evidence indicates that he was guilty of voluntary manslaughter, the Commonwealth should request an instruction on voluntary manslaughter.

Our recent cases clearly indicate that once the possibility of a defense of self-defense has entered the case (regardless of the source of that possibility), the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was <em>not </em>acting in self-defense at the time of the slaying in order for the conviction to be sustained. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walley, </em><a href="/pa/466/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="466 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1714931" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0363-01">466 Pa. 363</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="466 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1714931" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0363-01">353 A.2d 396</a> (1976); <em>Commonwealth v. Cropper, </em><a href="/pa/463/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="463 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1708132" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0529-01">463 Pa. 529</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="463 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1708132" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0529-01">345 A.2d 645</a> (1975). To negate the claim of self-defense the prosecution must show that <em>at least </em>one of the elements of that defense was absent. Therefore, it is necessary for the prosecution to establish either that the <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>defendant did not subjectively believe that he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, or if such belief was, in fact, held, the prosecution may negate the defense by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that that belief was unreasonable under the circumstances. Also, the prosecution could prevail by establishing that the slayer was not free from fault in provoking or continuing the incident which resulted in the slaying, or, the prosecution could meet its burden by showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the slayer had a duty to retreat or to avoid the danger and that he or she had the opportunity to do so but elected not to. <em>See Commonwealth v. Myrick, </em><a href="/pa/468/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="468 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1719722" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0155-01">468 Pa. 155</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="468 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1719722" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0155-01">360 A.2d 598</a> (1976); <em>Commonwealth v. Cropper, <a href="/pa/463/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="463 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1708132" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0529-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/463/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="463 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1708132" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0529-01">463 Pa. 529</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="463 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1708132" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0529-01">345 A.2d 645</a> (1975).</p>

The question which must be answered is whether the prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not acting in self-defense at the time the homicide was committed. Evidence of the defendant’s state of mind is relevant to the jury’s determination of that issue and, as conceded by the majority, its exclusion is therefore error. Contrary to the assertion of the majority, however, the exclusion of the evidence at issue in the instant case cannot be considered harmless because we, as an appellate court, cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have arrived at the same result had they heard it. The proffered testimony was such that it could have created a reasonable doubt in the jury’s collective mind as to whether the prosecution had established all the elements of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. It could have, for example, created a reasonable doubt as to whether appellant acted with malice, for if he believed he was in imminent danger, he could not have acted maliciously. It could also have created a reasonable doubt as to the prosecution’s claim that such a belief was unreasonable under the circumstances. Furthermore, it had relevance concerning the question <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>of provocation, and could have allowed the jury to acquit by creating a reasonable doubt as to whether appellant, as claimed by the prosecution, provoked the incident which resulted in the slaying.</p>
