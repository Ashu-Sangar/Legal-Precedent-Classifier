Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to a term of not less than three nor more than seven years imprisonment. In this direct appeal, Polimeni raises two issues: the first, a challenge to the array of the petit jury in the court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County; the second, a denial of a requested charge on involuntary manslaughter. We find the second claim to be meritorious and that a new trial must be had. Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of appellant’s challenge to the array of the petit jury.</p>

The purpose for the proposed meeting was to discuss some missing pills and a pill bottle belonging to Polimeni which he believed Dellaquilla had stolen. When Dellaquilla and Grande arrived at appellant’s home at about 11:30 p. m., there were with them four other men: David Dowling, John Dyer, Frederick Kostanich and Kenneth Patterson. Surprised at seeing the others, appellant went into his bedroom alone, removed a loaded .38 caliber pistol from the safe there and placed the gun in his back trouser pocket. <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>He thereupon joined the others, including his brother Peter, in the downstairs game room.

Beginning to feel faint and as if he might “black out,” appellant pushed Patterson away from him with one hand, and with the other began to fire his gun.

The reasons for this are historical: it having long been the law in Pennsylvania that a jury has the “power” to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter on a murder indictment even absent any evidence of the elements of manslaughter, see, <em>e.g., Commonwealth v. Hoffman, </em><a href="/pa/439/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="439 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1930989" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0348-01">439 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20726" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="266 A.2d 726">266 A.2d 726</a> (1970), due process of law was violated in the failure to charge on that offense on request. In contrast, the law in Pennsylvania until now has been that a jury had no power to return a verdict of involuntary manslaughter absent an indictment for that offense. The voluntary manslaughter anachronism is thus no precedent for what the rule should be with respect to involuntary manslaughter.</p>

If in its wisdom a jury decides that involuntary manslaughter is a proper verdict, a judge should not disturb that verdict. There is no reason to fear that juries will irrationally return an involuntary manslaughter verdict in cases where there is no basis of any kind for such a verdict.
