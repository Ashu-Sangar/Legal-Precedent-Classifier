The descriptions and names of the two suspects were broadcast. The following morning, a bus driver telephoned the state police when he observed three men boarding his bus in Altoona, two of whom he thought matched the broadcast descriptions. Appellant was one of the passengers. Three plain clothed police officers, armed with complete descriptions of the two suspects, boarded the vehicle at its destination in Monroeville, approximately 70 miles from Altoona, and immediately proceeded to the rear of the bus where appellant and his two companions were seated. The officers <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>identified themselves as police, requested that the three youths stand, and asked for identification. Despite the fact that all three youths produced identification inconsistent with the names of the murder suspects, one of the officers conducted a pat-down search of the appellant and felt a bulge in appellant’s coat pocket. The officer ordered appellant to empty his pockets. The bulge, which the officer testified he believed might be a small automatic weapon, was a two-inch by four-inch plastic bag of marijuana and six foil packets containing 571 diamphetamine tablets. The appellant was removed from the bus, and a subsequent check of identifications cleared the appellant and his two companions of any complicity in the police murder.</p>

The officers had detailed descriptions of the two men wanted for the police murder, and appellant fit neither description. One suspect was described as having long, shaggy, black hair. Appellant’s hair, as one officer testified, was light brown and could, in places, even be considered blond. Suspect number two was described as five feet eleven inches tall, one hundred eighty pounds, long, thin hair, with a mark on the left side of his face. Appellant was four inches shorter, thirty pounds lighter, and had no facial marks whatsoever. We find it difficult to conclude that appellant sufficiently resembled either suspect number one or suspect number two to give the officer probable cause for any arrest. <em>Hill v.

In <em>Hill, </em>the Supreme Court observed that when the police have probable cause to arrest one person, and <em>reasonably </em>mistake a second party for the first party, the arrest of the second party is a valid arrest. The person mistakenly arrested in <em>Hill </em>fit the description of the man the police were seeking. <a href="/us/401/0797-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="401 U.S. 797" data-case-ids="11714932" data-case-paths="/us/401/0797-01">401 U.S. at </a>803 &amp; n.6, <a href="/us/401/0797-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="401 U.S. 797" data-case-ids="11714932" data-case-paths="/us/401/0797-01">28 L.Ed.2d at </a>489 &amp; n.6. In this case, the disparities in physical make-up between appellant and either of the suspects sought by the police made it unreasonable to mistake appellant for the suspects. The police also had the <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>names of the suspects. When appellant and his companions were asked to produce identification they did so promptly, and the identifications shown the officers were inconsistent with the names of the suspects. There was no testimony that appellant or either of his companions in any way acted suspiciously. Appellant was merely riding a bus. The only resemblance appellant had to the two suspects was that he was white, young and had long hair. If the police officers were justified in searching appellant under these circumstances, we see no reason why any young, long-haired youths within 70 miles or more of Altoona, traveling in a group of two or three, could not have been stopped and likewise validly searched in connection with this particular crime. This we cannot accept. The Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause, gives every person in this Commonwealth the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The amendment protects an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy from unjustifiable governmental intrusions.

Appellant engaged in no “unusual and suspicious” behavior which might have reasonably led the police officers to conclude that criminal activity was afoot. There was nothing that would lead to the conclusion that appellant was “armed and <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>dangerous.” The prosecution argues that the “unusual and suspicious” behavior requirement was satisfied when the police tentatively identified the appellant as the suspect in the shooting. We think it would blur accepted usages and meanings in the English language to assert that one who in only a very general way resembles a police suspect — white, young, and long haired — is acting “unusually or suspiciously.” These officers had hardly a suspicion that appellant was the suspect they were after. Without particular facts from which to infer that criminal activity has or is about to be committed, and an individual is armed and dangerous, we have consistently held that a stop and frisk is not constitutionally justified. <em>See e. g., Commonwealth v.
