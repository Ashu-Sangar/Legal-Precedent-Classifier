    <p id="b464-10" data-blocks='[["BL_464.8",464,[261,1796,1159,422]]]'>We agree. The basic theory of redaction seems sound. If a confession can be edited so that it retains its narrative integrity and yet in no way refers to defendant, then use of it does not violate the principles of <em>Bruton. </em>The practical application of the theory may be difficult and in many cases it may be decided that separate trials are necessary. However, this kind of determination must be made on a ease by case basis.</p>
    <p id="b464-11" data-blocks='[["BL_464.9",464,[259,2245,1160,98]],["BL_465.1",465,[180,308,1150,590]]]'>In this particular case appellant contends that omitting words naming him from a statement telling who went <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>upstairs was prejudicial to Sue Grendall, since it makes it appear that she went upstairs alone. In the first place, the confession was admissible against Sue Grendall so it rightly should inculpate her. In the second place, appellant lacks standing to object to a violation of his co-defendant’s rights, if any occurred. Finally, since Sue Grendall was acquitted, this would be harmless error, if it were error at all. This point was raised originally by Sue Grendall’s attorney, apparently to be used as a basis for an appeal if she had been convicted. It is obviously inappropriate as a basis for an appeal by the appellant.</p>
    <p id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[183,930,1150,744]]]'>The appellant also objects that the part of the original confession that originally read “Chinese, Derick, Kenny and myself were upstairs in my bedroom planning what to do” was redacted by the deletion of “Chinese” which was the nickname of the appellant. The contention is that with only three of the four people going upstairs the jury would wonder what, if anything, the fourth person was doing. The assertion of the jury’s wonderment on this score had no relevancy to any issue in the case. In order for a redacted confession to be rejected as inculpatory by way of inference, it must have some incriminatory impact. The possible inference of the jury that the appellant, admittedly in the house, was upstairs or downstairs before the commission of the crime, was in no sense prejudicial.</p>
    <p id="b465-6" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[184,1696,1152,474]]]'>Here we had a painstaking effort on the part of the trial judge to delete references to appellant in the confession and in every case of a doubt he deleted words and phrases that might possibly implicate appellant. On one questionable segment, not mentioning appellant by name, but including him in the pronoun “we” along with Ms. Grendall, the court ruled that the reference must be deleted. “No. I won’t permit that. I don’t want any reference at all, any stretch of the imagination that could include Chinese.”</p>
    <p id="b465-7" data-blocks='[["BL_465.6",465,[186,2205,1149,152]],["BL_466.1",466,[272,310,1158,411]]]'>As stated above, these questions must be left within the discretion of the court to be decided on a case by case basis. Certainly, when it is not clear that a confession can <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>be redacted without prejudice to defendant, the confession should be excluded. It is incumbent upon district attorneys who plan to redact a confession to raise the issue at pretrial, rather than during the trial, so that if redaction is unwarranted, separate trials can be ordered. Where, however, as in this case the confession does not contain a trace or a hint of participation in the crime by appellant, redaction is permissible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <p id="b466-16" data-blocks='[["BL_466.2",466,[263,1886,1156,229]]]'>. Another issue raised by appellant is whether the judge erred in not allowing the jury to set the penalty. We do not reach this question here, however, since by the failure of defense counsel to make any objection at the time or to make any mention of it in the original motion for a new trial the issue has been waived. <em>Commonwealth v.
