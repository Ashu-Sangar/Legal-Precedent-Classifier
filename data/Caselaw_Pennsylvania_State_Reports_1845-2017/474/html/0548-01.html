The prosecution certified that the crime rose no higher than murder in the third degree. Appellant was tried without a jury and found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Post-verdict motions were denied, and she was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than two nor more than five years. This appeal followed.</p>

The deceased was appellant’s friend. Appellant had given him a key to her apartment, he kept clothes there, and lived there “sometimes.” At about 2:00 a.m., on the day in question, Dilks telephoned appellant at her place of employment, and told her he would see her at her apartment after she finished work. Appellant returned to her apartment at approximately 4:00 a.m. and prepared and ate a snack of salami and Pepsi, slicing the salami with a knife. She placed the knife on a coffee table in front of the sofa, and fell asleep on the sofa. Dilks awakened her at about 6:00 a.m. having entered the apartment using his key. At this time Dilks was “exceedingly drunk” according to the finding of the trial court. His blood contained .21 per cent alcohol, the equivalent, according to the prosecution’s evidence, of ten ounces of 100 proof liquor.</p>

Using the knife with which she had sliced the salami, appellant fatally stabbed Dilks as he lunged toward her.</p>

This was more complete than the version of the incident given by appellant to the police shortly after the homicide.

Having done this, he turned and “lunged” at appellant. The trial court concluded that appellant’s belief was unreasonable because appellant had seen the decedent in a drunken and abusive state on numerous previous occasions, and that on those previous occasions the decedent had never become physically violent towards her. We believe that these prior instances enhance, rather than diminish, appellant’s claim. On several prior occasions, according to the trial court, appellant had witnessed the decedent become verbally abusive when drunk. Never before had the decedent become physically abusive when drunk, however. On the night of his death, the decedent became <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>physically violent, and directed that physical violence toward various objects within appellant’s apartment and within close proximity to her. This change in the decedent’s behavior gave appellant reason to believe that the violence which decedent had been directing toward the various objects within the room was about to be directed at her.

The father of the deceased testified that the deceased resided with him at 1924 South Camac Street. The South Camac Street was also listed as the decedent’s address on the medical examiner’s report.</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[176,675,1151,575]]]'>There is no doubt that the evidence sustains a conclusion that the decedent was a frequent guest in the appellant’s apartment and had permission to be a guest even when the appellant was not present, since he was given a key to the apartment. It does not follow, however, that a frequent and freely-invited guest resides in the apartment, and the trial court’s conclusion that the decedent was a member of the household and had an equal right of access to appellant’s apartment was erroneous. Under these circumstances, the appellant, who was without a doubt within her dwelling, had no duty to retreat.</p>
    <p id="b609-5" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[177,1275,1156,361]]]'>Even, however, if we were to assume that the appellant had a duty to retreat, the evidence does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that that duty was violated. Under the Crimes Code, the prosecution had a duty to establish that the appellant knew that she could avoid the necessity of using deadly force <em>with complete safety by retreating.</em>

We read this evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution as the verdict winner. Appellant’s testimony describing the relative positions of the sofa, of the coffee table, of Dilks, and of herself as they related to the room, the other objects in it, and to the door leading to the common hallway in the apartment building, shows that at the time the decedent lunged at appellant, she was standing between him and the wall at which the kitchen sink and stove were located. The apartment door is located around the corner from this wall, and to escape appellant would have had to exit around that corner. At the moment when appellant <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>stabbed Dilks, it was at least theoretically possible, however, that appellant could have turned and escaped into the common hallway without exposing herself to any greater risk of injury. In spite of this possible escape route, appellant stood fast and chose to meet the decedent with deadly force. We are unwilling to say that in doing so she violated any duty to retreat. The prosecution offered no evidence as to whether the door leading into the hallway was locked or unlocked, or whether it was secured by a chain lock or bolt in such a way as to prevent appellant from exiting rapidly and safely. Furthermore, the prosecution presented no evidence as to the layout of this common hallway, and nothing in the record indicates whether or not it would have afforded appellant a safe retreat in the event she had been able to escape from the apartment. Photographs, and other exhibits introduced by the prosecution did show, however, that the path which appellant would have had to take in order to exit from the apartment into the hall required her to make at least two right angle turns in order to avoid various objects of furniture located in the apartment. Additionally, these exhibits established that the room was extremely cluttered and that even walking about was made difficult by the close proximity of the various objects within it.</p>
    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[253,1524,1161,467]]]'>Because the prosecution has failed to show that the only escape route which appellant possibly could have used to avoid the confrontation could have been used without increasing the risk of injury to which she was already exposed, it has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant violated any duty to retreat. Having failed to negate any of the elements of the defense of self-defense, the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty of criminal homicide.</p>
