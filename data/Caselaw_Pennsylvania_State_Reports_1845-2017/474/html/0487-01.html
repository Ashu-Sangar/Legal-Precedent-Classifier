During the initial investigation on November 15, the police found a spent shell casing across the street from the police station, approximately sixty yards away. On November 19, 1972, the state police, assisted by about one hundred volunteer firemen, conducted a search of the field on the northern edge of Kennett Square. The search party discovered a .308 caliber rifle at a location between the police station and appellant’s home, approximately a sixteen minute walk from the station and a three minute walk from appellant’s home. The barrel of the rifle was bent. A sight cover and bolt were also found in the general vicinity of the rifle. On November 21, 1972, the police found a sling in the field. The sling fit the .308 rifle.</p>

The bullet fragments recovered from Officer Posey’s body were too badly damaged to determine whether they were fired from the .308 rifle, but one expert was able to determine that these fragments were fired from a rifle “having the same class characteristics” as the .308 rifle. The other expert testified that the shell casing found across the street from the police station had been discharged by the bolt found near the .308 rifle. The ballistics experts <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>also testified that the spent shell casing had been “reloaded” several times.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b544-4" data-blocks='[["BL_544.4",544,[251,405,1161,1107]]]'>The Commonwealth introduced evidence linking appellant to the murders. On January 23, 1970, almost three years before the killings, the police, pursuant to another investigation, seized four weapons from appellant’s home, including the .308 rifle which was used in the sniper attack on Officers Davis and Posey. The four weapons were returned to appellant'-s mother in May 1972. When the police searched appellant’s home and the house trailer of his brother James Hamm, which is located on the same property as appellant’s home, they discovered three of the four weapons. The missing weapon was the .308 rifle, later found in the field near appellant’s house. Thus, the evidence permitted the jury to conclude that appellant was the owner of the murder weapon. In addition, appellant was a skilled marksman and had been seen practicing with the .308 rifle prior to the killings. Appellant was proficient in reloading his own shells and possessed the necessary equipment for doing so. Approximately one month before the murder, appellant attempted to purchase a human silhouette target from a sporting goods store; such targets are normally sold only to police departments.</p>

Officer Davis had filed criminal charges against appellant on several occasions. Appellant believed that Davis was harassing him. The most recent charges arose out of an incident which took place on September 21, 1972, less than one month before the murders. On that date, Davis stopped appellant’s car. After appellant refused to display his operator’s license and vehicle registration, appellant and Davis became involved in a physical confrontation. Appellant was arrested and taken to the police station where he and Davis continued to argue with each other. At one point, appellant stated, “Davis, I’m not scared of you,” and “I’ll get even with you.” Appellant was <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>charged with resisting arrest and assault and battery. These charges made by Officer Davis were scheduled for grand jury proceedings commencing November 27, 1972.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[183,461,1153,777]]]'>The Commonwealth introduced the testimony of Frazer Culbreath, who was an inmate at the Chester County Prison Farms while appellant was held there awaiting trial. Culbreath testified that appellant told Culbreath that “he wish[ed] he had never attained the knowledge on firearms and rifles and individual handguns and reloading procedures, and above all he wish[ed] his mother could have been spared the degree of embarrassment she had endured due to his rash, but justifiable actions.” Culbreath testified that appellant said he had a good excuse as to why the weapons were found where “I put . . . .” Culbreath said that appellant stopped short and did not complete his sentence after using the expression “I put.” Culbreath further testified that appellant told him that he intended to write a “treatise on the art of snipering,” after gaining his freedom.</p>

Upon remand, the court should make the statements available to appellant’s counsel, and, if appropriate, take evidence and make findings of fact.

In <em>Swierezewski, the </em>defense requested access to the prior statements of Commonwealth witnesses which related to matters raised on direct examination. The trial court accepted the Commonwealth’s representation that access would result in disclosure of confidential information and denied the defense request. The Superi- or Court held that the trial court erred in denying the defense request without first examining the prior statements in camera. Thus, the Superior Court’s statement of its holding, limiting the defense to examination of those prior statements determined by a trial court to be related to the direct examination, was overbroad and unnecessary to the decision of the case. Defense counsel only requested material which related to the direct examination; the issue whether the defense is entitled to other statements was not before the court. In addition, the case was complicated by the Commonwealth’s claim of confidentiality. When a claim of confidentiality is made, in camera <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>review by the trial court may be appropriate. See generally ABA Project On Minimum Standards For Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial § 4.6 (Approved Draft, 1970). Yet, the Superior Court did not so frame its holding. Instead, the court stated that the trial court should determine whether the prior statements relate to the direct testimony.</p>
      <p id="b550-7" data-blocks='[["BL_550.2",550,[298,1673,1127,585]]]'>In <em>Kubacki, </em>like <em>Swierczewski, </em>the trial court denied a defense request to examine the prior statement of a Commonwealth witness without first inspecting the statement in camera. After Kubacki was found guilty, the trial court examined the statement and found that it did not relate to the case. The Superior Court granted Kubacki a new trial, concluding that the prior statement did relate to the direct testimony. Since the Superior Court determined that the prior statement related to the direct testimony, it was unnecessary to decide whether the defense is entitled to examine a prior statement which the trial court concludes does not relate to the Commonwealth witness’ direct testimony. The Superior Court also stated that the trial court should have examined the prior statement before the witness was cross-examined by the defense. Since the tried court failed to do so, the issue whether in camera review adequately protects a defendant’s rights was not squarely presented.</p>
