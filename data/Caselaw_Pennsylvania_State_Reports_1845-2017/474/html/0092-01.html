    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[174,457,1151,315]]]'>Richard Wright was convicted in Philadelphia of murder of the second degree, criminal conspiracy, and robbery following a trial without a jury. Post-verdict motions were denied by a court <em>en banc </em>and judgment of sentence of life imprisonment was imposed on the murder conviction. Judgments of sentence on the other convictions were suspended.</p>
    <p id="b145-7" data-blocks='[["BL_145.6",145,[173,799,1152,750]]]'>Wright appealed from the judgment of sentence imposed on the murder conviction advancing only one assignment of error. He argued the court committed prejudicial error in not granting a motion to suppress evidence of and later permitting at trial evidentiary use of an incriminating statement given by him while in police custody because the statement was not voluntarily given. When the appeal was first presented to us, the record disclosed certain deficiencies in the suppression court’s findings of fact. Hence, we continued jurisdiction and directed that court to make additional findings. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em><a href="/pa/472/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="472 Pa. 524" data-case-ids="1727723" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0524-01">472 Pa. 524</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="472 Pa. 524" data-case-ids="1727723" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0524-01">372 A.2d 812</a> (1977) (filed April 28, 1977). These findings have now been filed, and we can now pass on the merits of Wright’s argument.</p>

    <p id="b147-6" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[175,652,1151,533]]]'>The suppression court, observing that the defendant, 25 years of age and a high school graduate, was “big, healthy and knowledgeable”, found it “difficult to believe that one blow would have so terrorized this man that he would have been coerced into giving a statement”. The court also noted that despite Wright’s statement that he was afraid, his own testimony indicated that he was aware of his rights and that his will was not overborne. While not condoning the mistreatment at the hands of the detective, the court found that it did not “amount to coercion”.</p>
    <p id="b147-7" data-blocks='[["BL_147.7",147,[171,1222,1153,867]]]'>I agree with the view implicit in the trial court’s opinion that the law is not that <em>any </em>amount of physical contact, regardless of its nature or degree and regardless of other attendant circumstances, will automatically render a confession invalid. The basic inquiry in cases such as this remains whether under the totality of circumstances a statement is “the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice of its maker.” <em>Culombe </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em><a href="/us/367/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="367 U.S. 568" data-case-ids="1785545" data-case-paths="/us/367/0568-01">367 U.S. 568</a>, 602, <a href="/us/367/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="367 U.S. 568" data-case-ids="1785545" data-case-paths="/us/367/0568-01">81 S.Ct. 1860</a>, 1879, <a href="/us/367/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="367 U.S. 568" data-case-ids="1785545" data-case-paths="/us/367/0568-01">6 L.Ed.2d 1037</a>, 1057 (1961). But I think one must conclude that being struck on the head with a blackjack during the course of custodial interrogation is a sufficiently severe and brutal act of physical abuse as to preclude the conclusion that the statement which followed was voluntary in any meaningful sense of the word. Because I believe this to be the thrust of the majority’s holding, I join in the opinion of the Court.</p>
