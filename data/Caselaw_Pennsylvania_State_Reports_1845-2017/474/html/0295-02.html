Asking the jurors to imagine their own memories fading in such a situation, and saying the jurors would feel like “two cents” upon having their credibility discredited, was an improper appeal to the sympathies of the jury. In effect, the prosecutor asked the jury to assume the witness told the truth, and to act out of sympathy for the witness, instead of performing its duty to assess the credibility of the witness.

He asked the jury to tell the people of Philadelphia that “shootings on the street like the wild west” will not be tolerated. This argument was an invitation to the jurors to shift their inquiry from the guilt or innocence of appellant to the need to make an example of someone accused of participating in a public shooting. This appeal to the emotions of the jury was compounded by the prosecutor’s statement that the jurors themselves might be the victims of crime — “burglary, robbery, God forbid a rape.” Thus the prosecutor encouraged the jury to deliberate on an issue not before it, and decide the case on the basis of passion rather than reasoned evaluation of the evidence presented.</p>

      <p id="b359-7" data-blocks='[["BL_359.6",359,[249,770,1118,419]]]'>In arguing that the evidence of guilt is overwhelming, the Commonwealth simply refers us to its argument on the sufficiency of evidence. In so doing, however, the Commonwealth ignores the distinction that is drawn when this Court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence on the one hand and the harmlessness of an error on the other. While we view evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth in testing sufficiency, and thus resolve ambiguities and disputes in the Commonwealth’s favor, see note 2, supra, in testing whether the evidence is overwhelming, those same ambiguities and disputes are crucial to the determination of whether the evidence compelled the result reached.</p>
      <p id="b359-8" data-blocks='[["BL_359.7",359,[250,1193,1118,382]]]'>In its argument on sufficiency, the Commonwealth relies heavily on the testimony of Mrs. Roby. While her testimony was sufficient evidence of guilt, it was anything but overwhelming; her credibility was sharply disputed. Reasonable jurors, faced with the inconsistencies pointed out by appellant, may very well have differed in assessing Mrs. Roby’s credibility; thus her testimony cannot be relied upon as overwhelming evidence. See <em>Commonwealth v. Lasch, </em><a href="/pa/464/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="464 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1710356" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0259-01">464 Pa. 259</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="464 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1710356" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0259-01">346 A.2d 547</a> (1975) (testimony weakened by impeachment with prior inconsistent statements will not support a finding of harmlessness).</p>
      <p id="b359-9" data-blocks='[["BL_359.8",359,[250,1580,1118,341]]]'>The Commonwealth also relies on a statement taken from appellant by the police. However, appellant’s statement was in many respects exculpatory: he attributed the statement “This is a stickup” to Byron Edwards; he claimed that he told the others in the station wagon “I ain’t got nothing to do with this” and left the station wagon while the attempted robbery was in progress. The Commonwealth’s reliance on this statement is therefore misplaced. Neither the testimony of Mrs. Roby nor the statement of appellant support a conclusion that the evidence of guilt is overwhelming.</p>

California, </em><a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. 18</a>, 23, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">87 S.Ct. 824</a>, 827-28, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">17 L.Ed.2d 705</a> (1967); R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 64-73 (1970). Those errors which infect the process of determining guilt or innocence cannot be overlooked by pointing to the strength of the Commonwealth’s case. See e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Bishop, </em><a href="/pa/472/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="472 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="1727755" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0485-01">472 Pa. 485</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="472 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="1727755" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0485-01">372 A.2d 794</a> (1977) (defective instruction to jury on burden of proof constitutes reversible error which cannot be overcome by overwhelming evidence). Because we reject the Commonwealth’s claim that the evidence of guilt is overwhelm<a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>ing, we need not decide whether closing arguments which divert the jury from its proper function can be harmless in the absence of cautionary instructions which remove the prejudice.</p>
