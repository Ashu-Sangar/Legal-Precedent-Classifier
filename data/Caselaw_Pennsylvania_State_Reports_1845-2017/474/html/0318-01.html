The court’s questioning clearly conveyed the impression that the trial court did not believe Coley’s trial testimony, and that Coley should adopt his testimony from the preliminary hearing. The court asked Coley five times if he was telling the truth at trial. The court repeatedly <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>asked Coley if any threats or promises caused him to testify falsely at trial, and asked Coley three times if he wanted to change or correct his testimony at trial. The court did not ask Coley if any threats or promises caused him to testify falsely at the preliminary hearing, or give Coley the opportunity to explain why he testified as he did at the preliminary hearing. The witness could have little doubt as to which testimony the court believed. The court’s questioning, coupled with the use of perjury warnings, improperly pressured the witness to change his trial testimony to conform with his testimony at the preliminary hearing.</p>

Asked by the prosecutor if, on the night of the killing, he saw the person who stabbed the victim, Coley responded, “All I know is a light skinned person.” Coley, who had been a classmate of appellant’s and had known appellant for four years, stated that he did not know the name of the light skinned person. The prosecutor then asked if the light skinned person was in the courtroom. Coley replied, “No. I didn’t really see what happened.” In response to further questioning, Coley testified that he saw the light skinned person come close to the victim immediately before the victim fell from the stab wound, but that he did not see any contact between the two. The prosecutor again asked if the light skinned person was in the courtroom. Coley answered, “I don’t know.” Upon examination by the court, Coley clearly stated that the person he saw come towards the victim immediately before the victim fell from the stab wound was not in the courtroom.

Second, and more important, the witness improperly cross-examined in <em>Moore </em>continued to adhere to his initial testimony. Moore relied on <em>Commonwealth v.

The judge then advised Coley concerning the nature of the crime of perjury and inquired whether the witness desired to change his trial testimony. Coley responded that he did not.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The Commonwealth then pleaded surprise and was granted permission to cross exam<a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>iné the witness. Prior to recalling the jury, the court <em>again </em>instructed the witness on the crime of perjury. When trial resumed, the district attorney cross exámined Coley concerning the prior inconsistent statements and as a result, the witness finally admitted that his previous identification of appellant as the assailant was correct.</p>

The intensive questioning by the prosecutor and the court coupled with the perjury instructiori and the impeachment clearly suggested to the witness that the court disbelieved his trial testimony. Thus, it is highly probable that Coley ultimately conformed his trial statements to his preliminary hearing testimony to satisfy what he perceived to be the court’s expectations, rather than testify from his own recollection of the events which transpired. Because Coley’s identification of Laws was crucial to the conviction, I concur in the award of a new trial.</p>

The judge occupies an exalted and dignified position; he is the one person to whom the jury, with rare exceptions, looks for guidance, and from whom the litigants expect absolute impartiality.

The record is to the contrary. The judge never told Coley that he did not believe him and that if he did not change his testimony and identify appellant he would be prosecuted for perjury, nor did he imply as much. All the judge did was to state in general, neutral and declarative terms that to lie (i. e., tell an untruth knowingly) under oath is punishable by fine and imprisonment.

Coley replied that he did not want to change his previous trial testimony. It was not until after his preliminary hearing testimony had been read to him for a second time and he had been cross-examined by the Assistant District Attorney in open court before the jury that Coley altered his trial testimony to coincide with what he had sworn to at the preliminary hearing. Under these circumstances, I am satisfied that no action of the trial judge intimidated Coley into identifying appellant as the assailant of the decedent.
