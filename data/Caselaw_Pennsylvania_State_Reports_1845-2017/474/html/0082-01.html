These reports must include an annual assessment of the public utility realty within the political boundaries of each local taxing authority. The first such assessment was to be made by October 1, 1970. 72 P.S. § 3275 (Supp.1976). Each report must also include the local taxing authority’s real estate tax rate for the current fiscal year. 72 P.S. § 3276 (Supp.1976).

    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.4",140,[276,403,1160,846]]]'>The first distribution of PURTA revenues was based upon the local property assessments made by October 1, 1970, and the local tax rates in force on April 1, 1971. Both dates fall within the Commonwealth’s fiscal year beginning July 1, 1970 (fiscal year 1971). Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 177, § 608, as amended, 71 P.S. § 228 (Supp.1976). July 1, 1970, was also the scheduled effective date of Article VIII, section 4. We conclude from these facts that PURTA provides for the distribution of funds collected during the fiscal year in which the local reports are filed, and was not intended to change the scheduled effective date of Article VIII, section 4 from the beginning of fiscal year 1971. Since the June 1970 PURTA collection was made prior to the effective date of the constitutional amendment, Article VIII, section 4, does not require that the 1970 revenues be distributed to local taxing authorities.</p>

      <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>First, the Legislature contemplated no such double distribution when it enacted PURTA. PURTA provides no means for the Commonwealth to determine either the amount to be distributed, or the proportional share due each eligible local taxing authority from the revenue collection in June 1970. Section 6 of PURTA, 72 P.S. § 3276 (Supp.1976), provides that the first annual reports from local taxing authorities, containing their local assessments and current tax rates, be submitted on or before April 1,1971. In <em>School Districts of Deer Lakes and Allegheny Valley v. Kane, </em><a href="/pa/463/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="463 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1708056" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0554-01">463 Pa. 554</a>, 566, <a href="/pa/463/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="463 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1708056" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0554-01">345 A.2d 658</a>, 664 (1975), we recognized that this information is essential to the implementation of PUR TA’s distribution scheme. We held that although the terms of the constitutional amendment mandate distribution of a minimum amount of revenues to local taxing authorities, it is not violated by a section of PURTA which provides that local taxing authorities failing to timely submit the required reports forfeit any share in the distribution. PURTA cannot be read to require a distribution without this information.</p>

It is apparent that, in imposing the PURTA tax, the Legislature contemplated this secondary purpose of providing the Commonwealth with revenues, since a substantial excess of revenues over the constitutional minimum has been collected pursuant to PURTA since Article VIII, section 4 went into effect on July 1, 1970.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

There we stated that “The tax imposed by PURTA is the sole source of revenue for distribution to local taxing authorities pursuant to article VIII, section 4 and PURTA. Furthermore, because the new tax is designed exclusively for this purpose and therefore will not affect the Commonwealth’s general revenues, it is a ‘special tax’ as contemplated in the Constitution.” (footnotes omitted) <a href="/pa/461/0716-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="461 Pa. 716" data-case-ids="483852" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0716-01">461 Pa. at 729</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0716-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="461 Pa. 716" data-case-ids="483852" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0716-01">337 A.2d at 850</a>. Read in context, it is clear we meant only that PURTA, and no other tax, was intended as the source of revenues for implementing the distribution to local taxing authorities contemplated by Article VIII, section 4. In <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, </em>local taxing authorities were asserting a right to subject public utility realty to local taxation pursuant to the constitutional amendment. We held only that PURTA was intended <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>to implement Article VIII, section 4, and its payment precluded local taxation. The issue whether local taxing authorities were entitled to a distribution of the 1970 PURTA collection was not before us.</p>

We note that because different local taxing authorities have different fiscal years, an actual lifting of the exemption of public utility realty from local taxation would have different tax consequences in different taxing units in the first year of operation. For example, townships operating on a calendar fiscal year, see 53 P.S. §§ 56701, 65901 (Supp.1976), could have imposed their taxes for fiscal year 1970 after Article VIII, section 4 went into effect July 1, 1970, as well as in fiscal year 1971 and thereafter. School districts, operating on a July to June fiscal year, see 24 P.S. § 6-671 (Supp.1976), in the same circumstances, would have been limited to raising revenues in their 1971 fiscal year. Thus, in the first year of the exemption, some local taxing authorities would have been able to impose their taxes twice, while others could have collected only once. The constitutional amendment, however, contemplates only a single annual distribution of funds collected by the Commonwealth. It does not require consideration of what any particular taxing authority could have obtained in revenues if the exemption from local taxation were actually lifted. <em>Southeast Delco School District v.
