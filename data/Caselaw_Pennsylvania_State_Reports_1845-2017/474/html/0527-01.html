In that case, we upheld a verdict and judgment in the amount of $215,000 entered against three joint-tortfeasors, Parke-Davis and Company (Parke-Davis), Domenico Cincinotta, and Samuel I. Levin. The verdict was entered on December 14, 1967; judgment was entered on November 24, 1969. Parke-Davis, through its insurer, Lloyds of London, paid the entire amount of the judgment on November 19, 1971. The judgment included not only the principal amount of $215,000, but also $50,833.30 in interest accrued from December 14, 1967, until the date of payment, and $2,378.84 in costs. Thereafter the judgment was marked to the use of Parke-Davis and satisfied as to it only. This use-judgment was then assigned to Karen Blanck, an employee of counsel for Parke-Davis and the appellant in this case.</p>

Levin was insured in the same amount by appellee Firemen’s Insurance Company of Newark, New Jersey (Firemen’s). Parke-Davis claimed that Firemen’s and Medical Protective were each liable, under their respective policies with their insureds, for (1) the $10,000 policy coverage, (2) one-third of the interest which accrued on the $215,000 award between December 14, 1967, the date of the verdict, to November 19, 1971, the date when Parke-Davis paid all accrued interest on the principal award to the plaintiff, (3) one-third of the total costs paid by Parke-Davis on November 19, 1971, and (4) interest on the sum of items (1), (2) and (3) from November 19, 1971, when Parke-Davis satisfied the judgment due plaintiff as well as all interest and costs due.

In June of 1972, the issue was submitted to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County on stipulated facts and cross-motions for summary judgment. On September 24, 1974, the trial court entered summary judgment for appellant holding that each appellee was responsible for one-third of the costs, and that they were not responsible for any interest whatever since they had paid to the limits of their liability under their respective policies. In so deciding, the trial court relied on our decision in <em>Hafer v.

The trial court found the language of both policies to be substantially the same as that of the policy in <em>Hafer, </em>and, without elaboration, simply concluded that the policies did not impose any obligation upon appellees to pay any amounts (excluding costs) in excess of $10,000.00.</p>

Appellees counter by claiming they in fact made timely tenders to Parke-Davis at a pre-trial conference long before the verdict and judgment were entered and are not bound to pay any sum in excess of its policy limits of $10,000.

      <em>Hafer </em>involved jury verdicts of over $100,000 against two defendants, one of whom was insured by Erie Insurance Exchange (Erie) for $20,000. After Erie’s post-trial motions were withdrawn or abandoned, it sent a check for $20,000 to plaintiff. The plaintiff returned the check with a demand for interest on the entire amount of the verdict plus costs. A subsequent tender by Erie of the policy limits plus one-half of the accrued interest from date of verdict and one-half costs was also refused, and was then deposited in court. The plaintiff thereafter entered judgment on the verdict and commenced execution proceedings. After a decision in the trial court adverse to Erie, Erie appealed, and we reversed. Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Eagen, Mr. Justice Roberts and Mr. Justice Musmanno dissented.</p>

The Court went on to state, however, that “an insurer is not liable for any interest <em>in excess of the policy limits of liability </em>unless and to the extent it has contracted with its insured to do otherwise.” <a href="/pa/429/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="429 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="1913476" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0289-01">429 Pa. at 292</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20785" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="239 A.2d 785">239 A.2d at 787</a>.

The three Pennsylvania cases which consider the insurance company’s liability for interest between the date of the verdict and the entry of judgment are unanimously agreed that the insurer is liable. See <em>Paul v. Dwyer, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/42/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="42 Pa.

In each case the policy provision at issue was identical to that here involved. The <em>Skinner </em>court held that under the clear language of the Act of 1859 the company was liable for interest from the date of the verdict. I agree, for I think it clear that the Act of 1859 makes the words “judgment” and “verdict” synonymous for these purposes.

The clause presently under review was inserted into policies for the express reason of assuring the policyholder that the insurance carrier would assume liability for interest on the entire amount of the verdict. See Ramsey, “Interest on Judgments Under Liability Insurance Policies,” Insurance L.J., No. 414, at pp. 407, 411 (July, 1957): “The new family combination automobile policy, issued by The National Bureau of Casualty Underwriters, now provides with reference to this question that the insurance company is required to pay: ‘. . . all interest on the entire amount of any judgment therein which accrues after entry of the judgment and before the company has paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of the company’s liability thereon.’</blockquote>

As a result, the wording with respect to payment of interest in the new Family Automobile Policy has been restated, in order that it be entirely clear that all interest on the entire amount of any judgment, which accrues after entry of the judgment, is payable by the insurer until the insurer has paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of the insurer’s liability thereon. All Automobile and General Liability policies will be changed accordingly upon revision. In the meantime, they should be interpreted in keeping with the above intent.’ ”</blockquote>

The insurance company, <em>in good faith, </em>files a timely new trial motion which is not resolved until one year later when that motion is denied. Under <em>Moore v.

To avoid this result (one mandated by the majority’s opinion), it is obvious that verdict and judgment mean the same thing for purposes of this policy.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[185,1514,1151,575]]]'>We adhere to the general rule stated in <em>Hafer </em>that absent an insurer’s agreement to do so, an insurer is not liable for interest in excess of policy limits. We hold today, however, contrary to <em>Hafer, </em>that when an insurance company contracts with an insured to “pay ... all interest accruing after entry of judgment,” Pennsylvania law requires that the defendant pay interest computed from the date of verdict to the entry of the judgment and interest on the amount of the judgment entered thereafter. To decide otherwise would ignore the language and legislative intent embodied in § 781.</p>

Although we speak of “policy limit” in referring to the amount of liability coverage, that amount is not really the “policy limit.” The “policy limit” includes not only the liability coverage but <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>also all other amounts for interest, costs or expenses which the insurer has contracted to pay. The insurer contracts to pay these other items to be fair to the insured since the insurer has control of the litigation until all legal recourse is exhausted.</p>
    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.4",590,[247,589,1162,689]]]'>If a stated policy limit enabled an insurer to escape paying the interest accruing during the time appeals were pending, appeals which the insurer itself initiated, the insured will be liable for the interest accumulating from the date of verdict despite his or her complete lack of control over the litigation. It is therefore both fair and sensible to hold the insurer liable for interest accruing from the date of verdict notwithstanding its stated “policy limit.” <em>See </em>Appleman, 8 <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>§ 4899, at 364 (1964). We therefore hold that Firemen’s is liable for interest computed from the date of verdict, regardless of so-called policy limits, when, as here, it agreed to pay all interest “accruing after entry of judgment.”</p>
    <p id="b590-6" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[244,1314,1160,852]]]'>The issue remains as to the amount of Firemen’s liability for interest. Appellant Parke-Davis contends that Firemen’s is liable for one-third of the accrued interest on the entire verdict. Firemen’s argues that its interest liability should be calculated on the basis of the ratio of its policy limit to the total judgment. We find Firemen’s argument without merit. Here again the contract between insured and insurer is controlling. Firemen’s easily could have limited its interest liability on a large judgment against its insured to that portion of the judgment covered by its policy. No such provision appears in the contract between Fireman’s and its insured. We read Firemen’s policy as saying, in effect, it will pay all interest on the judgment until it tenders its part of such judgment, not as saying it will pay interest on <em>its part </em>of the judgment until it tenders its part of the judgment.</p>

The same is true as to interest due; a party with a judgment could look to any one of the joint tortfeasors for full payment of interest. Neither of these rights is in any way affected by a tortfeasor’s right to contribution under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, 12 P.S. §§ 2082-2089.14 (Purdon 1967 &amp; Supp. 1977-1978). <em>Hafer v.

In light of this fact, and the fact that the insurer is in control of the litigation, obligating the insurer to pay interest on the full amount of the verdict is the only means of giving realistic protection to the insured. <em>See Underwood v.

Rather, it provides that Medical Protective will furnish a defense until “all remedies by appeal . . . shall have been exhausted <em>at the Company’s cost and without limit as to the amount expended.” </em>(Emphasis added.) In connection with the policy limits, the policy states, “such amount [the policy limits] being in addition to the cost of the unlimited defense provided. . . ” In our opinion, these provisions are, at the least, ambiguous as to interest, and thus must be construed against Medical Protective. <em>See, e. g. Cadwallader </em>v. <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em><a href="/pa/396/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="396 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="1284898" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0582-01">396 Pa. 582</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20484" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="152 A.2d 484">152 A.2d 484</a> (1959). The costs of a full defense may reasonably include interest, which is as much a cost of conducting a defense as court costs, attorneys’ fees, filing fees and the like. <em>See </em>12 P.S. § 781. The language in Medical Protective’s policy can reasonably be construed to include interest, and for the <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>reasons stated above with regard to Firemen’s obligation to pay interest on the entire verdict, we hold that Medical Protective is obligated to pay interest on the entire verdict.</p>

We find no merit in this argument. Plaintiff’s counsel rejected the appellees’ offers as not being adequate, and the matter proceeded to trial. Both Firemen’s and Medical Protective were obligated, by the terms of the respective insurance policies, to defend any suit against the doctors they insured. Appellees would now have us hold that their attempt to escape any further responsibility for defending their insureds, by offering $10,000 on a claim which the eventual verdict proved was worth much more, constituted a “tender.” This we refuse to do. Appellees were legally bound to defend their insureds, they lost at trial as well as in the appellate courts, and then tendered an amount in attempted satisfaction of their legal obligations which was less than the full amount each owed contractually. Under these circumstances, appellees cannot be heard to argue that their pre-trial offers to settle constituted a valid legal tender. <em>Englehart v.

As such it is construable against the insurer and can readily mean all interest due and owing after the entry of judgment. A strict interpretation that the phrase means interest only <em>on </em>the judgment produces the undesirable conclusion that procrastination by the insurer after the <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>verdict and payment prior to judgment enables it to have the use of the money without any payment of interest.</p>
