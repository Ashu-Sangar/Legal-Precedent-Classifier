Community College of Beaver,-Pa.-, 375 A.2d 1267 (1977), this Court stated that an arbitrator\u2019s award is to be respected by the judiciary if the award \u201c \u2018can in any rational way be derived from the agreement, viewed in light of its language, its context, and any other indicia of the parties\u2019 intention . . . (Slip opinion at 17), quoting Ludwig Honold Mfg. Co. v. Fletcher, 405 F.2d 1123, 1128 (3d Cir. 1969). See also Washington Arbitration Case, 436 Pa. 168, 259 A.2d 437 (1969).\nApplying this standard of review, we conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s award in the instant case was rationally derived from the agreement and that the Commonwealth Court erred in reversing the arbitration award.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the arbitration award is reinstated.\nWe hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp.1977).",
