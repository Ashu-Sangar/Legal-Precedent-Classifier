        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPACKEL, Justice.\nThe main contention of appellant is that this is \u201ca clear case of irresistible impulse\u201d and that this Court should depart from its old and recent views with respect to that defense. It is uncontroverted that the appellant shot and killed his wife and also her friend who had tried to stop him from entering a room occupied by his wife.\nThe contention need not be considered because a review of the record does not reveal this as a case of irresistible impulse but rather a matter of deliberative choice by the appellant. This appears from- the testimony of appellant\u2019s psychologist, who responded to appellant\u2019s counsel as follows:\n\u201cQ. When you describe him having a conversation with his wife then going out to the car, thinking about the rifle apparently, apparently already provoked, disturbed yet he stops and puts oil in the car\u2014\nA. He\u2019s going'back and forth, \u2018What should I do\u2019 and getting oil is an innocuous activity, gives' him time to think.\nQ. It\u2019s an effort to avoid going further? -\nA. Or at least evaluate what he should do and coming up with the bad choice. That\u2019s the way I recall his relating it to me.\u201d (N.T. 71).\nThe real purpose of the psychologist\u2019s testimony was to establish that intense passion caused the killings. We agree with the court below that neither murder conviction should be reduced to voluntary manslaughter.\nJudgment affirmed!\nROBERTS and MANDERINO, JJ., concur in result.\n. The other contention as to the use of a subjective standard rather than an objective standard in determining provocation is dealt with in Commonwealth v. Miller, 473 Pa. 398, 374 A.2d 1273 (1977).\n. See Commonwealth v. Mosler, 4 Pa. 264, 267 (1846).\n. See Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 459 Pa. 304, 329 A.2d 212 (1974).",
