See Pa. Human Relations Commission v. Alto-Reste Park Cemetery Assoc., 453 Pa. 124, 135-136, 306 A.2d 881, 888 (1973). Because the order of the Commonwealth Court from which appeal is sought is not in accord with this determination, the order must be vacated and the case remanded to the Commonwealth Court for proceedings consistent herewith.\nIt is so ordered.",
