This direct appeal followed. We have examined the issues raised by appellant and find all of them to be without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nJONES, former C. J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P L 673 No. 223, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1977).\n. Appellant argues that the evidence was not sufficient to support a verdict of murder in the first degree. We have reviewed the record, see Act of February 15, 1870, P.L. 15, \u00a7 2, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1187 (1964), and are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of evidence concerning the recovery and identification of the victim\u2019s body, and that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the prosecutor to ask leading questions of a Commonwealth witness.",
