        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAgnes Shea Klein (decedent) died in an automobile accident on November 1, 1972. Her husband, Albert B. Klein (appellee), the driver of the vehicle in which she was riding, was subsequently charged and convicted for the involuntary manslaughter of decedent.\nOn November 22, 1972, decedent\u2019s will was admitted to probate and letters testamentary were issued to decedent\u2019s daughter, Marlene Shea Indovina (appellant), the executrix of the estate. By the terms of the will, Marlene Shea Indovina was to receive three parcels of real estate, certain government bonds and $10,000.00 in cash. The residue of the estate was left to appellee.\nOn May 20,1974, appellant filed an inventory of the assets of the estate. On July 1, 1974, appellee filed an election to take against the will. Appellant then filed a \u201cpetition to revoke and vacate\u201d the election on the ground that appellee was barred from sharing in the estate by the Slayer\u2019s Act. Appellee later claimed the family exemption of $1,500.00.\nOn October 28, 1974, appellee filed a petition to recover from the estate funds which were formerly on deposit in two bank accounts in the names of Albert Klein or Agnes Klein. Appellee alleged that decedent had withdrawn the funds from the two accounts without his knowledge or consent and had deposited the proceeds in two new accounts in the name of Agnes Klein, in trust for Phillip and Michelle Indovina.\nA hearing on these petitions was held on September 30, and October 1, 1975. During this hearing, appellant also contended that the proceeds received by appellee as beneficiary of decedent\u2019s life insurance policies should be returned to the estate pursuant to the Slayer\u2019s Act.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court: (1) denied appellee\u2019s petition to take against the will; (2) allowed appellee\u2019s application for the family exemption; (3) granted appellee a share of the joint bank accounts; and (4) declined to rule on the merits of the estate\u2019s attempt to recover the proceeds of the insurance policies. Appellee filed no exceptions to the court\u2019s decree. Appellant filed exceptions which were dismissed by the court en banc on March 17, 1976. This appeal followed. We affirm.\nI\nSection 8802 of the Decedents, Estates and Fiduciaries Code provides:\n\u201cNo slayer shall in any way acquire any property or receive any benefit as the result of the death of the decedent, but such property shall pass as provided in the sections following.\u201d\n20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8802 (1975). Section 8803 provides:\n\u201cThe slayer shall be deemed to have predeceased the decedent as to property which would have passed from the decedent or his estate to the slayer under the statutes of descent and distribution or have been acquired by dower, by curtesy or by statutory right as surviving spouse.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 8803. The Code defines a slayer as\n\u201cany person who participates, either as a principal or as an accessory before the fact, in the wilful and unlawful killing of any other person.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 8801.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court held that appellee\u2019s conviction for involuntary manslaughter did not conclusively bar him from sharing in the estate. The Slayer\u2019s Act requires that the killing be \u201cwilful and unlawful\u201d to bar inheritance. Id. \u00a7 8801. Appellant argues that the court erred in concluding that involuntary manslaughter does not constitute a \u201cwilful\u201d killing.\nOur task is to determine what kind of culpability the Legislature intended to encompass by the use of the word \u201cwilful\u201d in the Slayer\u2019s Act. We conclude that the Legislature did not intend that a conviction for involuntary manslaughter should conclusively bar an individual from sharing in the victim\u2019s estate.\nWe have previously recognized that the term wilful \u201cis a word of many meanings, depending on the context in which it is used.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Wright v. Hendrick, 455 Pa. 36, 40, 312 A.2d 402, 404 (1973). In various contexts, wilful has been interpreted to mean \u201cintentional,\u201d \u201cdeliberate and intentional,\u201d and has been said to suggest \u201cthe presence of intention and at least some power of choice.\u201d We believe that in employing the expression a \u201cwilful\u201d killing in the Slayer\u2019s Act, the Legislature intended to designate a higher degree of culpability than that required for involuntary manslaughter.\nUnder the Penal Code, involuntary manslaughter was defined as a death \u201chappening in consequence of an unlawful act, or the doing of a lawful act in an unlawful way.\u201d When a death resulted from an act lawful in itself but done in an unlawful way, the Commonwealth had to present evidence establishing \u201ca departure from the behavior of an ordinary and prudent man as to evidence a disregard of human life or an indifference to the consequences,\u201d in order to sustain a conviction for involuntary manslaughter. Commonwealth v. Feinberg, 433 Pa. 558, 566, 253 A.2d 636, 640-41 (1969). Thus, a conviction for involuntary manslaughter does not require that the killing be committed intentionally or with malice. Of the various degrees of unlawful killings, involuntary manslaughter requires the lowest degree of culpability. We conclude that by requiring that a killing be \u201cwilful,\u201d the Legislature intended to exclude involuntary manslaughter from the scope of the Slayer\u2019s Act. Indeed, any other conclusion would render the word \u201cwilful\u201d surplusage as all unlawful killings would then be covered by the Slayer\u2019s Act.\nOur conclusion is buttressed by the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Slayer\u2019s Act. The present statute was adopted in response to a decision of this Court which held that under the prior statute a criminal conviction was necessary before an individual would be barred by the Slayer\u2019s Act from inheriting from the victim\u2019s estate. Tarlo\u2019s Estate, 315 Pa. 321, 172 A. 139 (1934). At the time Tarlo\u2019s Estate was decided, the Slayer\u2019s Act barred recovery by any\n\u201cperson who shall be finally adjudged guilty, either as principal or accessory, of murder of the first or second degree . . . .\u201d\nThe statute was held inapplicable in Tarlo\u2019s Estate because although Tarlo had intentionally killed his wife, he immediately thereafter committed suicide and therefore was never brought to trial.\nAfter Tarlo\u2019s Estate, the Legislature amended the Slayer\u2019s Act. The requirement that a conviction precede application of the Act was eliminated and the Legislature adopted a definition of \u201cslayer\u201d substantially the same as the definition proposed by Professor Wade. See Wade, Acquisition of Property By Wilfully Killing Another \u2014 A Statutory Solution, 49 Harv.L.Rev. 715 (1936); Larendon Estate, 439 Pa. 535, 538, 266 A.2d 763, 765 (1970). In the commentary to his proposed statute, Professor Wade stated that involuntary manslaughter should not be considered a wilful and unlawful killing:\n\u201cShould a statute of this sort include manslaughter? . [I]t is believed it should not if the killing is involuntary. If the wrong was not intentional, it is difficult to say as a matter of policy that the perpetrator should be prohibited from acquiring property.\u201d\nId. at 722 (footnotes omitted). The history of the Slayer\u2019s Act in Pennsylvania suggests that the language adopted in the present version of the Slayer\u2019s Act was not intended to encompass involuntary manslaughter.\nWe therefore hold that involuntary manslaughter is not a wilful killing within the meaning of the Slayer\u2019s Act and that a person convicted of involuntary manslaughter is not conclusively barred from sharing in the victim\u2019s estate.\nAppellant next asserts that the Orphans\u2019 Court, which made its own determination whether appellee had committed a wilful and unlawful killing even though appellee had only been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, erred in finding that the killing was not wilful. We do not agree.\nThe only evidence introduced at the hearing relative to the circumstances surrounding decedent\u2019s death was appellee\u2019s testimony. According to appellee, he and decedent attended a party at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport in Allegheny County on November 4, 1972. He left the party with decedent and a friend, Mrs. Redd. Appellee stated that he could remember nothing from the time he left the airport parking lot until after the accident. He later learned that he drove his car on the wrong side of the highway leading from the airport. After traveling on the highway for about two or three miles, appellee\u2019s automobile collided with a truck. He was hospitalized for five months as a result of the injuries he received in the accident. Decedent was killed and Mrs. Redd sustained serious injuries.\nAppellant asserts that the evidence established that appellee\u2019s actions were wilful and unlawful. Even if the evidence could support a finding that appellee\u2019s culpability constituted wilfulness, the Orphans\u2019 Court found that appellee\u2019s actions were not wilful. In reviewing the decision of the orphans\u2019 court, this Court\u2019s responsibility is to assure that the record is free from legal error and to determine if the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and adequate evidence. E. g., In re Estate of Cohen, 445 Pa. 549, 284 A.2d 754 (1971). This Court is bound by the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by the record. See Brentwater Homes, Inc. v. Weibley, 471 Pa. 17, 369 A.2d 1172 (1977). After reviewing the record, we conclude that the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s determination that decedent\u2019s death did not result from a wilful killing is supported by the record and should not be disturbed.\nFinally, appellant asserts that the record is inadequate for a determination whether the killing was wilful and requests that this Court remand the case with instructions for a more complete evidentiary hearing. However, the very purpose of the hearing which was held by the Orphans\u2019 Court was to determine whether appellee was entitled to share in decedent\u2019s estate. Appellant asserted before the court that appellee\u2019s claims in the estate were barred by the Slayer\u2019s Act. Nothing in the record indicates that appellant was limited in any way from establishing that appellee had wilfully killed decedent. We reject appellant\u2019s request for a second bite at the apple.\nII\nAppellant asserts that the Orphans\u2019 Court erred in allowing appellee to recover from the estate one half of the amount of money formerly held in two bank accounts in the names of Albert Klein or Agnes Klein. The facts relevant to this issue are not disputed.\nAppellee and decedent were married on August 22, 1970. On January 7, 1971, decedent withdrew $5,418.88 from a savings account in her name at the Penn Hills branch of the Western Pennsylvania National Bank and deposited the money in a growth account at the Kenmawr branch of the same bank in the names of Albert Klein or Agnes Klein. On the same day, decedent withdrew $7,872.12 from another savings account in her name at the Penn Hills branch and deposited the money in a savings account at the Kenmawr branch in the names of Albert Klein or Agnes Klein.\nOn August 13,1971, decedent closed both accounts she had established on January 7. At the time, there was $5,542.17 in the growth account and $4,777.50 in the savings account. On the same day, she created two tentative trust accounts entitled: \u201cMrs. Agnes Klein in trust for Phillip and Michelle Indovina,\u201d into which she deposited the $5,542.17 and $4,777.50 respectively. Appellee testified that he did not learn that decedent closed the growth and savings accounts until he was in the hospital following the automobile accident which resulted in decedent\u2019s death.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court ruled that the creation of the joint accounts in the names of appellee and decedent established a tenancy by the entireties. The court then decided that appellee was entitled to one half of the funds held in the accounts.\nAppellant contends that a tenancy by the entireties was not created when decedent established a joint account with her husband with funds which formerly belonged to decedent alone. Appellant argues that when a wife places her sole property in joint names with her husband a gift is not presumed, but rather the husband is viewed as holding the property as trustee of a resulting trust for the wife. This argument misapprehends the law.\nIn Cohen v. Goldberg, 431 Pa. 192, 244 A.2d 763 (1968), this Court stated that absent evidence of a contrary intent, a deposit in a banking account or a savings account which is opened or registered in the name of a husband and wife or a husband or wife creates a tenancy by the entireties. Id. 431 Pa. at 195, 244 A.2d at 765.\nAppellant relies on Shapiro v. Shapiro, 424 Pa. 120, 224 A.2d 164 (1966), for the proposition that the presumptions which arise when property is placed in joint names \u201cdepend on which spouse was the donor.\u201d Appellant fails to note that Shapiro has been overruled. The differing presumptions based on sex which were employed in that case \u201ccan no longer stand in view of the passage of the Pennsylvania Equal Rights Amendment, Pa.Const. Art. I, \u00a7 28 (adopted May 28,1971) . . . .\u201d Butler v. Butler, 464 Pa. 522, 527, 347 A.2d 477, 480 (1975). In Butler, this Court abandoned the presumption that a transfer without consideration from a wife to her husband creates a trust for the wife in favor of the presumption that interspousal transfers are gifts regardless which spouse is the donor:\n\u201c[I]n a marital relationship a gift to entireties property is presumed for contributions made by either husband or wife. A constructive trust will be imposed only when it appears that the parties are in fact in a confidential relationship with one party enjoying an advantage over the other because of superior knowledge or influence and that this domination caused a gift to entireties property to arise.\u201d\n464 Pa. at 529, 347 A.2d at 481; accord, Yohe v. Yohe, 466 Pa. 405, 410-11, 353 A.2d 417, 420 (1976).\nWe reject appellant\u2019s claim that the Orphans\u2019 Court applied an incorrect presumption to the facts of this case. Accordingly, there is no basis for disturbing the court\u2019s adjudication that decedent created a tenancy by the entire-ties when she established bank accounts in the names of Albert Klein or Agnes Klein on January 7, 1971.\nDecree affirmed.\nEach party pay own costs.\n. Appellee was also charged with but acquitted of drunken driving.\n. The will provided in pertinent part:\n\u201cFIRST: I direct that all of my just debts and funeral expenses be paid as soon as may be conveniently done after my demise.\nSECOND: I hereby devise to my beloved daughter, MARLENE SHEA INDOVINA my home at 539 Dendron Drive, Robinson Township, Pennsylvania, also my home known as Sheadyrest Cottage, Francis Drive, Geneva, Ohio, and my home at 1955 Federal Street Extension, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.\nTHIRD: I hereby bequeath to my beloved daughter, MARLENE SHEA INDOVINA, my United States Government Series \u2018E\u2019 Bonds previously held by myself and my daughter\u2019s father, Aleck J. Shea, Deceased.\nFOURTH: I hereby bequeath to my beloved daughter, MARLENE SHEA INDOVINA Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars.\nFIFTH: All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, of whatsoever nature and kind, whether real, personal or mixed, I hereby give, devise and bequeath to my h\u00fcsband, ALBERT B. KLEIN.\nSIXTH: I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my daughter, MARLENE SHEA INDOVINA, as Executrix of this my Last Will and Testament, she to serve without bond.\u201d\n. The inventory listed the following assets: U.S. Savings bonds worth $9,577.43; proceeds from the settlement of a survival action brought by the estate against appellee in the amount of $8,025.00; and the three parcels of real estate mentioned in the will. As the Orphans\u2019 Court observed, it was apparent after the inventory was filed that if the estate were distributed according to the terms of the will there would be no residue and appellee would therefore not share in the estate.\n. See 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2508 (1975).\n. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 2509(c), 8801-15.\n. See Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, \u00a7 2. In 1974, the family exemption was increased to $2,000.00. See 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121 (1975).\n. See 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8811 (1975).\n. The court held that the election was not timely. See id. \u00a7 2511. Appellee has not appealed the court\u2019s ruling.\n. The court stated in its opinion:\n\u201c[W]e will not here consider the question of insurance proceeds since it was not raised prior to trial. . . . Therefore, this opinion and order attached hereto cannot be considered as a ruling one way or other on this issue.\u201d\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, art. II, \u00a7 202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp.1977).\n. 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8815 (1975) provides that the provisions of the Slayer\u2019s Act \u201cshall be construed broadly in order to effect the policy of this State that no person shall be allowed to profit by his own wrong, wherever committed.\u201d\n. Accord, id. \u00a7 2509(c): \u201cAny surviving spouse who participates either as a principal or as an accessory before the fact in the wilful and unlawful killing of the testator shall have no right of election.\u201d\n. If appellant\u2019s argument is correct, appellee\u2019s conviction would be a conclusive bar to his right to share in decedent\u2019s estate. See Kravitz Estate, 418 Pa. 319, 211 A.2d 443 (1965). In Kravitz, this Court held that the record of a conviction for murder was a conclusive bar to Mrs. Kravitz\u2019s right to take under or against her husband\u2019s will. Kravitz followed the principle that when a criminal conviction is introduced in. a civil proceeding, it conclusively establishes in the civil proceeding those facts logically necessary to the conviction. See generally Hurtt v. Stirone, 416 Pa. 493, 206 A.2d 624 (1965). Implicit in our holding in Kravitz is the conclusion that the facts which must be proved to establish the elements of the crime of murder in a criminal proceeding also establish that a killing is \u201cwilful and unlawful\u201d under the Slayer\u2019s Act. Appellant suggests that the same is true of the crime of involuntary manslaughter.\n. Commonwealth ex. rel. Wright v. Hendrick, 455 Pa. 36, 40, 312 A.2d 402, 404 (1973).\n. Rapoport v. Sirott, 418 Pa. 50, 58, 209 A.2d 421, 424 (1965).\n. Lucciola v. Commonwealth, Secretary of Education, 25 Pa. Cmwlth. 419, 420, 360 A.2d 310, 311 (1976), quoting Sinton\u2019s Case, 151 Pa. Super. 543, 548, 30 A.2d 628, 630 (1943).\n. Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, \u00a7 703, formerly codified in 18 P.S. \u00a7 4703, repealed, Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, \u00a7 5. Involuntary manslaughter is presently defined at 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2504 (1973). See note 18, infra.\n. Under the new Crimes Code, a person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter\n\u201cwhen as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.\u201d\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2504 (1973).\n. Act of June 7, 1917, P.L. 429, \u00a7 23, amended, Act of August 5, 1941; P.L. 816, \u00a7 1, presently codified in 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8801 (1975).\n. \u201c[T]he term \u2018slayer\u2019 shall mean any person who wilfully and unlawfully takes or procures to be taken the life of another . . .\u201d 49 Harv.L.Rev. at 721-22.\n. Nothing in our holding today is meant to undermine our decision in Kravitz Estate, supra, where we held that an individual who has been convicted of murder is barred by the Slayer\u2019s Act from sharing in the victim\u2019s estate. We recognize that a killing may constitute murder even if it was not committed intentionally. The essential element distinguishing murder from involuntary manslaughter is the state of mind of malice. See Commonwealth v. Thompson, 466 Pa. 15, 351 A.2d 280 (1976); Commonwealth v. Boyd, 461 Pa. 17, 334 A.2d 610 (1975). Malice may be found if a killing is committed with an intent to kill or with an intent to inflict serious bodily harm. Malice may also be found even if the killing was not intentional, where the perpetrator \u201cconsciously disregarded an unjustified and extremely high risk that his actions might cause death or serious bodily harm . . . Commonwealth v. Taylor, 461 Pa. 557, 565-66, 337 A.2d 545, 549 (1975) (concurring opinion of Roberts, J., joined by Jones, C. J., Eagen, J., and Manderino, J.); accord, Commonwealth v. Boyd, 461 Pa. at 22-23, 334 A.2d at 613. However, the high degree of recklessness which may permit a factfinder to conclude that an unintentional killing constituted murder involves a greater degree of culpability than the recklessness or gross negligence which forms the basis of involuntary manslaughter. See generally Commonwealth v. Garcia, 474 Pa. 449, 378 A.2d 1199 (1977) (plurality opinion). We believe that the different degree of culpability between murder and involuntary manslaughter justifies different treatment under the Slayer\u2019s Act and reaffirm our holding in Kravitz Estate that the record of a murder conviction conclusively establishes a wilful and unlawful killing under the Slayer\u2019s Act. In effect, a killing is wilful under the Slayer\u2019s Act if it is committed intentionally or with malice.\n. The trial court reasoned:\n\u201cThe Kravitz case holds that a conviction of murder is conclusive that the slayer may not share in the estate of his victim but the converse is not true, i. e., one acquitted of the homicide may still be denied a share in the estate of the victim. The measure of proof in a homicide case is \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 In a civil case it is the \u2018fair weight of the evidence.\u2019 Thus, an accused may be acquitted of homicide on the ground that the evidence did not prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and yet be denied a share of the victim\u2019s estate for the reason that the fair weight of the evidence proves him to be a wilful killer. Here Albert Klein was not even accused of the offense of wilful murder.\u201d\nAppellant seizes upon the last sentence of this passage and asserts that the court, in effect, denied her the right to prove that decedent\u2019s death resulted from a wilful killing. Appellant argues that the court \u201cwas erroneously assuming that since the Grand Jury declined to accuse [appellee] of violating a criminal statute,\u201d appellee could not come within the terms of the Slayer\u2019s Act.\nWe are convinced that appellant has misread the Orphans\u2019 Court opinion. In this passage, the court asserted that it has the power to relitigate an individual\u2019s culpability even after he has been acquitted of an offense which would disqualify him under the terms of the Slayer\u2019s Act, from receiving property from the victim\u2019s estate. By stating that appellee had not even been accused of wilful murder, the court was indicating that if it has the power to relitigate after an acquittal, a fortiori it has the power to decide the issue where an individual has never been tried for the offense. Moreover, other parts of the court\u2019s opinion indicate that the criminal proceedings were not considered conclusive; rather, appellant simply failed to meet her burden of proof. See note 23, infra.\nIn the present context, we are not called upon to decide whether the Orphans\u2019 Court was correct in asserting that it has the power to relitigate the culpability of an individual who has been acquitted of a criminal charge. First, there has been no previous acquittal since appellee was never tried for an offense for which a conviction would conclusively bar him from sharing in decedent\u2019s estate. Second, appellant failed to prove in the civil proceedings that the killing was wilful.\n. The court stated:\n\u201cThe only evidence on the issue of his culpability is his testimony to the effect that he was unaware of his actions at the time of the accident. The record will not support a finding that he was a \u2018slayer\u2019 and the statute does not bar him from sharing in his wife\u2019s estate.\u201d\n. Appellant also argues that the Orphans\u2019 Court improperly refused to determine whether the estate was entitled to recover from appellee the proceeds he collected as beneficiary of decedent\u2019s life insurance policies. The only basis for appellant\u2019s claim to the proceeds is the Slayer\u2019s Act. ' Thus, even if the Orphans\u2019 Court should have reached the issue, appellant has not been prejudiced. Had the court reached the merits, its determination that appellee was not a \u201cslayer\u201d would also have negated appellant\u2019s claim for the insurance proceeds. Since we have affirmed the court\u2019s ruling that the Slayer\u2019s Act does not apply to appellee, appellant suffered no harm when the Orphans\u2019 Court declined to decide the insurance proceeds claim.\n. The growth account had accumulated interest. The savings account had been reduced by a withdrawal of approximately $3,100.00. The record does not indicate whether decedent or appellee withdrew the money. Appellee testified that the withdrawal was used as a down payment for the purchase of an automobile for him and decedent.\n. The trial court stated:\n\u201cWhen one spouse appropriates the funds for his or her own benefit this amounts to an offer to partition the fund which the other spouse may accept by making demand for one-half the balance. ... In the case at bar [decedent\u2019s] withdrawal of the funds on August 13, 1971 constituted an offer to sever the joint tenancies and to divide the proceeds. [Appellee] accepted this offer by his demand of one-half of the balances.\u201d\nThe record indicates that in the Orphans\u2019 Court appellee sought all the money which he jointly held with decedent. See Cohen v. Goldberg, 431 Pa. 192, 244 A.2d 763 (1968) (doctrine recognizing fictional offer to terminate estate by the entireties and fictional acceptance does not apply if acceptance occurred after offeror\u2019s death). However, appellee has not appealed from the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s decision to direct appellant to pay appellee only one half the sum held in the joint accounts.\n. The creation of an account in the names of the husband and wife does not conclusively establish a tenancy by the entireties. \u201c[Intention is the cardinal and controlling element and if it is the intention of the parties to create an estate other than by entireties, such intention will be given effect . . . .\u201d Brenner v. Sukenik, 410 Pa. 324, 330, 189 A.2d 246, 249 (1963).\n. In Shapiro, the Court noted that while a transfer of property by a husband to his wife without consideration creates the presumption that a gift was intended, 424 Pa. at 129, 224 A.2d at 169, a transfer from a wife to her husband alone creates a rebuttable presumption that a trust was created in favor of the wife, id. 424 Pa. at 133, 224 A.2d at 171. The Court then concluded that the presumption that a trust is created in favor of the wife is proper regardless whether the transfer was from the wife to the husband alone or was from the wife to the husband and wife as tenants by the entireties. Id. at 133-34, 224 A.2d at 171-72 (alternative holding).",
