        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Moschzisker,\nThe plaintiff in this case, Pauline O\u2019Donnell, widow of John J. O\u2019Donnell, was denied an award under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, on the ground that her husband\u2019s death had come about by an accident occurring in the course of interstate commerce; the referee, the board and the court below agreed in this conclusion; judgment was entered for defendant, and plaintiff has appealed.\nDefendant railroad is a common carrier, engaged in intra- and interstate commerce; it operates a train from Pittsburgh, Pa., to Phillipsburg, N. J.; on June 1, 1920, engine No. 1676 was assigned, by proper authority, to haul this train from Mt. Carmel, an intermediate Pennsylvania point, to its destination; plaintiff\u2019s husband was directed to run the engine from Hazleton, Pa., where it was stationed, to Mt. Carmel, Pa., where it was needed for the purpose of its assignment, and, after its delivery, he was to take charge of another engine, attached to a freight train containing interstate shipments; engine No. 1676 left the track, on the run from Hazleton to Mt. Carmel, thus causing the injury which resulted in O\u2019Donnell\u2019s death.\nThe derailed engine was due to arrive at Mt. Carmel at ten o\u2019clock in the morning; and, in regular course, would not be required to haul the train to which it was assigned until about five o\u2019clock that evening. Plaintiff contends that this break in the time, leaving room for a change of assignment, and the fact that, when the accident happened to her husband, the train to which his engine had been assigned was being drawn from Phillips-burg to Mt. Carmel by another locomotive, which would have had to be relieved from service before engine No. 1676 could be attached to the train in question, showed, when given due weight, that the latter engine was not in interstate service at the time of its derailment. In disposing of these contentions, the compensation board correctly states: \u201cEngine No. 1676, at the time it was being driven by O\u2019Donnell, had a definite assignment to interstate commerce, and O\u2019Donnell himself had definite orders to deliver the engine at Mt. Carmel and then to assist in the movement of an interstate freight train, [therefore] what O\u2019Donnell was doing at the time of the accident was certainly an incident of interstate commerce.\u201d\nNumerous decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States sustain the view of the board; which, on appeal, was adopted by the common pleas: see P. & R. Ry. Co. v. Polk, 41 U. S. Sup. Ct. Reporter 518, 519; P. & R. Ry. Co. v. DiDonato, U. S. 41 Sup. Ct. Reporter 516, 517; Southern Pacific Co. v. Industrial, etc., Commission, 251 U. S. 259, 263; Kinzell v. Chicago, etc., Co., 250 U. S. 130, 133; P. & R. Ry. Co. v. Hancock, 253 U. S. 284, 286; Erie R. R. Co. v. Collins, 253 U. S. 77, 83; Erie R. R. Co. v. Szary, 253 U. S. 86, 89; Shanks v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., 239 U. S. 556, 558; Pederson v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., 229 U. S. 146, 151.\nIn the recent case of Koons v. P. & R. Ry. Co., 271 Pa. 468, 470, Mr. Justice Kephart, speaking for this court, says: \u201cWhere intra- and interstate acts are mingled, or at times alternate, there is no separation; the interstate feature predominates and by it must the questioned act be judged. \u2018To separate duties [of an employment] by moments of time or particular incidents of its exertion would be to destroy its unity......This service and the other service cannot be separated in duty and responsibility\u2019 : P. & R. Ry. Co. v. DiDonato, 41 U. S. Supreme Court Reporter 516. Employment follows interstate transportation and begins when the workman, on a carrier\u2019s premises, makes a forward move to serve in that traffic or employment and ends only after he has completely dissociated himself therefrom.\u201d See also P. & 35. Ry. Co. v. Polk, 41 U. S. Supreme Court Reporter, 518, 519, where Justice McKenna says: \u201cWe cannot accede to the view there is a presumption that duties performed on a train constituted of interstate and intrastate commerce were performed in the latter commerce. The presumption, indeed, might be the other way. It is to be remembered it is the declaration of the cases that if there is an element of interstate commerce in a traffic or employment it determines the remedy of the employee. Second Employers\u2019 Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 32 Sup. Ct. 169, 56 L. Ed. 327, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; New York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, 244 U. S. 147, 37 Sup. Ct. 546; N. P. Ry. v. State of Washington, 222 U. S. 370, 375, 32 Sup. Ct. 160, 56 L. Ed. 237......It would seem indisputable, therefore, if there be an assertion of the claim or remedy growing out of an occurrence in which there are constituents of interstate commerce, the burden of explanation and avoidance is on him who asserts the claim on remedy, not on the railway company to which it is directed, and there is nothing in Osborne v. Gray, 241 U. S. 16, 36 Sup. Ct. 486, 60 L. Ed. 865, in opposition. Indeed, the court was asked in that case to do what the referee and the Supreme Court in this case have done; that is, to assume to know things of which there is no evidence.\u201d\nThe Polk and DiDonato cases are the most recent decisions of the Federal Supreme Court touching the questions here involved, and they in effect rule the facts at bar. There can be no doubt that plaintiff\u2019s husband was engaged in \u201ca forward move to serve in\u201d interstate commerce, from which he had not dissociated himself prior to the fatal accident. Even if appellant\u2019s contention, \u2014 that engine No. 1676, after arrival at Mt. Carmel, might have been used, during the day, as auxiliary to the hauling and transferring of intrastate traffic, \u2014be correct, nevertheless, decedent\u2019s purpose, in taking the engine to such point, was no less than a joinder of interstate with intrastate objectives, and, under the authorities above discussed, this would not serve plaintiff on the present appeal.\nPlaintiff further contends that, even if the accident which caused her husband\u2019s death did happen in interstate commerce, she is, nevertheless, entitled to recover under our compensation act, because this statute creates, according to her contention, a contractual relation between employer and employee of a character which the former cannot overcome by setting up the defense of interstate commerce. She bases this contention on article III, section 302 (a), of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1915, P. L. 736, wherein it is provided that, \u201cin every contract of hiring made after\u201d December 31, 1915, \u201cand in every contract of hiring renewed or extended by mutual consent, expressed or implied, after said date, it shall be conclusively presumed the parties have accepted\u201d the \u201celective compensation\u201d provided for in the act and \u201chave agreed to be bound thereby,\u201d unless they file the proper rejection thereof.\nWe can no more sustain plaintiff\u2019s contention on this branch of the case than on the one first discussed. The only agreement for death compensation, if any, is the one which arises out of the application of the state statute, and, if such an agreement exists, it is through the \u201cpresumption\u201d the act undertakes to create; but the decisions of the United States Supreme Court are uniformly to the effect that the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, \u2014 representing, as it does, a power exercised by Congress, \u2014 excludes the jurisdiction of state workmen\u2019s compensation acts in all matters relating to interstate commerce. That is to say, these decisions establish the act of Congress as superseding the laws of the states upon all matters within the scope of the federal statute, and so long as it remains upon the books, in cases involving accidents happening upon interstate railroads to employees engaged in interstate commerce, such state laws as the compensation acts must be viewed as though nonexistent, \u2014 including, of course, all the direct and indirect effects thereof, whether these, when applicable, create contractual relations or otherwise.\nIn Erie R. R. Co. v. Winfield, 244 U. S. 170, 172, 173, Mr. Justice Van Dev antee said: \u201cThe questions presented for decision are: First, whether the Federal Act is regulative of the carrier\u2019s liability or obligation in every instance of injury or death to one of its employees in interstate commerce, or only in those instances where there is causal negligence for which the carrier is responsible......Third, whether by reason of the state statute the carrier became bound contractually to make compensation in this instance, even though it came within the Federal Act.\u201d In ruling these questions in favor of the supremacy of the federal law, he further said: \u201cThere was no express agreement in this instance and there is no basis for regarding the carrier as in any way bound by [the state compensation] statute, save as it provides that an agreement to be bound by it shall be presumed in the absence of a declaration to the contrary. But such a presumption cannot be indulged here, and this for the reason that, by the Federal Act, the entire subject, as respects carriers by railroad and their employees in interstate commerce, was taken without the reach of state laws. It is beyond the power of any state to interfere with the operation of that act, either by putting the carriers and their employees to an election between its provisions and those of a state, or by imputing such an election to them by means of a statutory presumption.\u201d See also New York Cent. R. R. Co. v. Winfield, 244 U. S. 147, 149; N. Y. C. & H. R. R. R. Co. v. Tonsellito, 244 U. S. 360, 361; Pryor v. Williams, 254 U. S. 43, 46.\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.",

R.\nWorkmen\u2019s compensation \u2014 Railroads\u2014Interstate commerce \u2014 Interstate train \u2014 Break in continuity of service.\n1. Where intrastate and interstate actions are mingled, or at times alternate, there is no separation; the interstate feature predominates and by it must the question be judged.\n2. Employment follows interstate transportation, and begins when the workman on a carrier\u2019s premises makes a forward move to serve in that traffic or employment, and ends only after he has completely dissociated himself therefrom.\n3. If there be an assertion of the claim or remedy growing out of an occurrence in which there are constituents of interstate commerce, the burden of explanation and avoidance is on him who asserts the claim or remedy, not on the railroad company to which it is directed.\n4. Where an engineer is fatally injured while taking an engine from one point in the state to another, and it appears that the engine in question was to arrive at the second point about ten o\u2019clock in the morning, and was definitely assigned to an interstate passenger train at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and it also appeared that the engineer after delivering the engine at the second point was to assist in moving with another engine an interstate freight train, the engineer at the time of his injury was engaged in interstate commerce.\n5. The fact that during the interval from ten o\u2019clock in the morning to five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the engine in question might possibly be assigned to other work, is immaterial.\nWorkmen\u2019s compensation \u2014 Railroads \u2014 Interstate commerce \u2014 Contractual relations under state laws superseded by Federal Act.\n6. The Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act excludes the jurisdiction of state workmen\u2019s compensation acts in all matters relating to interstate commerce, including all the direct and indirect effects thereof, whether these, when applicable, create contractual relations or otherwise.\n7. It is beyond the power of the states to interfere with the operation of the Federal Act, either by putting the carriers and their employees to an election between its provisions and those of a state, or by imputing such an election to them by means of a statutory presumption.\n8. Where a railroad employee is killed while engaged in interstate commerce, his widow cannot set up a claim for compensation under the state act, because of a contractual relation between the deceased and his employer arising from the fact that neither had rejected the act, and that this contractual relation could not be overcome by the defense of interstate commerce.\nArgued February 14, 1922.\nAppeal, No. 258, Jan. T., 1922, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Schuylkill Co., Sept. T., 1921, No. 500%, sustaining decision of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, in case of Pauline O\u2019Donnell v. Director General of Railroads, operating Lehigh Valley Railroad Co.\nBefore Mosciiziskee, C. J., Fbazeb, Wauling, Simpson, Sadleb and Schaffee, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. Before Beegeb, J.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the facts.\nJudgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned, inter alia, was judgment, quoting it.\nRoger J. Dever, for appellant.\nThe movement of engine No. 1676 was not an interstate commerce movement : Chicago, etc., R. R. v. Harrington, 241 U. S. 177; Minneapolis, etc., R. R. v. Winters, 242 U. S. 353; Erie R. R. v. Welsh, 242 U. S. 303; Anderson v. Steel Co., 255 Pa. 33.\nThe employer\u2019s contract in this case was to pay to the employee or his dependents according to the schedule contained in the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and the contract being complete, the employer cannot be relieved of its obligation by asserting that the accident happened in interstate commerce.\nOtto F. Farquhar, for appellee.\nThe work in which decedent was engaged, at the time of his death, was directly and closely connected with interstate commerce: North Carolina R. R. v. Zachary, 232 U. S. 248; Scanlon v. Payne, 271 Pa. 391.\nEven though decedent was on his way to perform work of interstate character, if it be considered in that light, he would be engaged in interstate commerce: Erie R. R. Co. v. Winfield, 244 U. S. 170; Knorr v. R. R., 268 Pa. 172; N. C. R. R. v. Zachary, 232 U. S. 248; Hogarty v. Ry., 245 Pa. 443.\nLiability of an employer for compensation under the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, if he fails to reject liability therefor in the manner prescribed by said act, exists by reason of a statutory presumption.\nThe question raised by appellant has been passed upon and finally determined by the Supreme Court of the United States: Erie R. R. v. Winfield, 244 U. S. 170; N. Y. C. & H. R. R. R. Co. v. Tonsellito, 244 U. S. 360.\nMarch 20, 1922:"
