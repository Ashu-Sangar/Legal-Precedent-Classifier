Under her husband\u2019s will, she has the right \u2018to dispose of the same [the entire estate] as she sees proper\u2019......The power of disposition given to plaintiff, and the limitation over upon her death of only that portion of the testator\u2019s estate of which she might die possessed, evidence a clear intent on testator\u2019s part to give his wife the power of consuming his [whole] estate, either during her entire lifetime, or [considering the other provisions as to keeping testator\u2019s name], at least, during the period of her widowhood; this, it is clear, gives plaintiff power to convey: Allen v. Hirlinger, 219 Pa. 56, 60; Benedict v. Hawthorn, 270 Pa. 529, 531; Edwards v. Newland, 271 Pa. 1, 5.\u201d See also Grundler v. Chmielinska, 272 Pa. 197.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
