        "text": "Per Curiam,\nSince this appeal by plaintiffs is from a judgment on a demurrer to a bill in equity, and goes to the substance of the case, which is correctly disposed of in the following opinion of the court below, we shall only say, as to the procedural points sought to be raised, that we see no merit in any of them.\nIn entering judgment for defendant, the court below stated: \u201cDefendant holds title to certain real estate used for religious purposes; its charter, among other things, provides that the congregation, or its trustees, shall not at any time cause the land \u2018to be sold or give any mortgage or lien on their church or grounds.\u2019 As the matter was presented to the court, it appears that defendant corporation is erecting on a party line a building to be used as a parsonage. The wall extends over on plaintiff\u2019s property as far as it is permitted to extend by law. It is alleged that this party wall will narrow the alleyway of plaintiffs, and, in addition, is in violation of the charter of defendant. In our opinion, the demurrer must be sustained. We fail to see how plaintiffs have standing to invoke provisions [such as here involved] of the charter of defendant, in a private controversy. Assuming that they could be heard, we are obliged to say there is nothing in the charter which prevents defendant from constructing a wall on a party line; this right is one which belongs to all owners of real estate. The clause in the charter referred to could not have prevented plaintiffs from constructing a party wall on the party line had it been to their interest to do so; the rights are reciprocal, and, if defendant chose to exercise its right, it was not in violation of the terms of its charter, even if plaintiffs should in the future decide to cut into the wall for the construction of a building on their own property. This could not be regarded as a lien on defendant\u2019s land, within the meaning of the prohibition in the charter. The averment that the effect will be to narrow an alleyway on the property of plaintiffs gives them no standing in equity. [The so-called \u201calley\u201d is not a passageway held in common along the party line, but, as shown by the bill, \u201cis wholly upon the land\u201d of complainants.] When they purchased the land [and when they laid out their alley], they knew, or ought to have known, that the adjoining owner had the right to construct the wall. We fail to see how any great injury could be done plaintiffs by the encroachment of the few inches permitted by law......; but, if we were convinced injury would result, we are without power to grant relief.\u201d\nThe decree is affirmed.",

Ann Carmichael Memorial Presbyterian Church.\nEquity \u2014 Injunction \u2014 Restraining erection of party wall \u2014 Church \u2014 Charier\u2014A Hey.\n1. An owner of land abutting on land owned by a church, has no standing to maintain a bill in equity against the church to restrain it from erecting a party wall, for the reason that the charter of the church provided that neither congregation, or its trustees, should at any time cause the land \u201cto be sold or give any mortgage or lien on their church or grounds.\u201d\n2. Even if the plaintiffs had a standing, they are not entitled to relief on the ground the wall would lessen the -width of an alleyway owned by them, where it appears that when they purchased their land and laid out the alley, they knew or ought to have known that the adjoining owner had a right to construct the wall.\nArgued February 2, 1922.\nAppeal, No. 87, Jan.
