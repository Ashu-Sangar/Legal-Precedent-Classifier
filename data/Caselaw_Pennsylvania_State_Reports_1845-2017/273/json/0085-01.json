        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Moschzisker,\nIn this workmen\u2019s compensation case, the claim was refused by the referee, allowed by the board, and affirmed by the court below; defendant has appealed.\nJames Maguire, plaintiff\u2019s husband, was a foreman in defendant\u2019s mill. On December 23,1919, he had a quarrel with two subordinates, in the course of his employment and concerning a matter connected with his employer\u2019s business; about two hours subsequent to this quarrel, after Maguire\u2019s daily working hours had ceased and when on his way home, he was met in the public street, at a point about 500 feet from defendant\u2019s works, in front of a property belonging to a third party, by the two men with whom he had quarreled; these men, who had armed themselves at defendant\u2019s mill with iron pipes, at once attacked and killed Maguire; compensation was allowed his widow, for the injury thus incurred.\nAppellant contends that Maguire\u2019s death was not due to an injury by accident in the course of his employment, and therefore plaintiff was not entitled to an award under the Compensation Act.\nSection 301 of the act in question (P. L. 1915, p. 736, 738) provides, inter alia, that, in instances where the statute has been accepted, \u201ccompensation for personal injury to, or for the death of,\u201d an employee, \u201cby an accident in the course of his employment,\u201d shall be made in all cases; that the term \u201cinjury by an accident in the course of his employment,\u201d as used in the act, shall not include \u201can injury caused by an act of a third person\u201d intended to injure the employee because of reasons personal to him and not directed against him as an employee or because of his \u201cemployment,\u201d but shall include \u201call other injuries sustained while the employee is actually engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of the employer, whether upon the employer\u2019s premises or elsewhere\u201d; then the act provides that the term under discussion shall include injuries occurring on \u201cthe premises\u201d of the employer.\nSince, admittedly, the injury in the present case did not occur on the premises of the employer, and since the findings of the compensation board and the court below are to the effect that the intent to harm was \u201cdirected against\u201d Maguire \u201cbecause of his employment,\u201d the only question left for determination is, Did the injury occur in the course of Maguire\u2019s employment, or while he was, in the words of the act, \u201cactually engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of his employer\u201d?\nThe compensation board and the court below thought that, because a causal connection could be found between the original quarrel, which occurred when Maguire was \u201cactually engaged\u201d in the affairs of his employer, and the attack subsequently made upon him, they were warranted in connecting the two as one transaction; and thus they reached the conclusion that the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband was due to an injury by accident incurred during the course of his employment. The difficulty with the application of this line of reasoning to the present case arises because of the words of the act; they require the injuries for which compensation is claimed to be \u201csustained\u201d while the employee is \u201cactually\u201d engaged in his employer\u2019s affairs. The act does not give a right to1 compensation for all injuries arising out of the employment, as do the laws of some other states, nor does it allow compensation for injuries the proximate cause of which may be traced to the employment. On the contrary, it requires, in express words, the injuries, not occurring on the premises of the employer, to be sustained while the employee is \u201cactually\u201d engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of his employer; and by no line of justifiable reasoning can it be held that the injuries in this case were sustained by plaintiff.\u2019s husband when he was so actually engaged.\nLanguage is a medium for conveying ideas; courts can give words a liberal interpretation, when construing an act such as the one now before us, in order to carry out its advanced humane intentions, as we have repeatedly done, and shall continue to do, in the administration of this law; but we have no power to depart from the clear meaning of a plainly expressed phrase: \u201cactually\u201d means \u201cas an actual or existing fact\u201d; and the word \u201cactual\u201d is used as \u201copposed to constructive\u201d: Century Dictionary. The phrase employed in the present statute, \u201cactually engaged in......the business or affairs of his employer,\u201d cannot be interpreted to mean \u201cconstructively\u201d engaged, but must be read as it is written \u2014 \u201cactually\u201d engaged. The law was expressed as it is by those having the sole power to write it, and thus the courts must read and administer it.\nA glance at our prior decisions will show that, in every instance where compensation was allowed for accidental injuries, occurring off the premises of the employer, the facts warranted the conclusion that the employee sustained his injuries while actually on the errand of, or during a time set apart for the performance of, some as yet uncompleted business of his employer; in other words, while actually engaged in the transaction of the latter\u2019s business.\nIn Lupfer v. Baldwin Locomotive Works, 269 Pa. 275, relied on by appellee, the claimant receivedinjuri.es on the premises of his employer; as a result of these injuries, he became insane and subsequently committed suicide, at his home. That case fairly fell within the provisions of the statute, because the accident which caused the injuries took place while the deceased was, as a matter of fact, engaged in the affairs of his employment, and the insane act of suicide followed as a consequence of the injuries thus incurred; whereas, in the present case, the accident happened after working hours, off the premises of the employer, and at a time when the employee was not engaged in the former\u2019s affairs.\nIn Callihan v. Montgomery, 272 Pa. 56, we recently held that, whether one was killed in the course of his employment, within the meaning of that term as used in the act, is a question of law, and as such open to review; the opinion there filed contains a full discussion of our prior rulings on this point.\nFor the reasons already stated, we cannot agree with the view of the court below, and the compensation board, that Maguire\u2019s death was due to an accidental injury incurred during the course of his employment, as that term is defined in the act. It may be, were we constructing the statute, instead of construing it, we would write the law so that plaintiff, under the circumstances of this case, could be allowed compensation; but, unfortunately for her, the courts are confined to the words of the law as enacted by the legislature, and here these are too explicit to permit of the interpretation given them by the court below, in adopting the view of the compensation board.\nThe judgment of the court below and the award of the compensation board are reversed; judgment is here entered for defendant.",
