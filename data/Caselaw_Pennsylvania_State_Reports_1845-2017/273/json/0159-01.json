The first assignment complains of the refusal to admit the Carlisle tables in evidence; in view of the verdict, this could have done no harm. The seven separate points set forth in the second assignment were all sufficiently covered in the general charge. The remaining assignments call for no further comment; they are all dismissed.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

Under the evidence in this ease the question whether a conductor had failed in his duty to guard a passenger attacked by another passenger, was left to the jury, and a judgment on a verdict for defendant was sustained.\n2. The refusal in a negligence case to admit in evidence the Carlisle tables, is not ground for reversal, where the verdict was for the defendant.\nArgued January 31, 1922.\nAppeal, No. 160, Jan. T., 1922, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 5, Phila. Co., March T., 1919, No. 4001, on verdict for defendant, in case of William McMullin v.
