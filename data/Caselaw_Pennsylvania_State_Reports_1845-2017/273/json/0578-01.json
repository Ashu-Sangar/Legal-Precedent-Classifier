The court below opened the judgment, saying: \u201cThe depositions leave it a matter of great uncertainty as to whether or not there was any consideration moving to defendant for the judgment note filed of record in this case; we are of opinion, therefore, the rule to open should be made absolute and the matter referred to a jury for determination.\u201d The lien of the execution not having been released, defendant petitioned for a rule to obtain that relief, and the court made this order: \u201cRule absolute; defendant has leave to enter security in sum of $3,000 to secure judgment, interest and costs, including sheriff\u2019s costs.\u201d We construe this to mean that the lien is released on the entry of approved security as above stated, and not before.\nThe order appealed from is accordingly affirmed.",

A judgment entered on a note is properly opened where the court finds that the depositions leave it a matter of great uncertainty as to whether or not there was any consideration for the note on which the judgment was entered.\n2. Where a fieri facias issued before the judgment was opened, and the court makes absolute a rule to show cause why the lien of the execution should not be released, saying that defendant has leave to enter security in an amount stated to secure judgment, interest and costs, the appellate court will construe such order as meaning that the lien is released on the entry of such security, and not before.\nArgued March 23, 1922.\nAppeal, No. 337, Jan. T., 1922, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1919, No. 3717, making absolute rule to open judgment, in case of Commonwealth Brewing Co. v. Joseph A.
