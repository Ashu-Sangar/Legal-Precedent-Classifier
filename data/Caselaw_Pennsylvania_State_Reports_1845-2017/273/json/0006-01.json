When the new lease was to commence was not shown; this is greatly at variance with the averment of the petition [in support of the relief asked], and, in itself, is sufficient to justify us in discharging the rule. We are not convinced, however, that......an agreement [for a new period of three years] was made. There was discussion touching a new lease, which never, verbally or otherwise, was reduced to definite terms. The fact that the tenant was permitted to remain for another year, at an [agreed] increase of rent [in the absence of proof of the alleged agreement for a new term of three years, depended on by appellant] must be regarded as a withdrawal of the notice and a continuance of the existing lease [at the new rent].\u201d\nFor correct statements of the ruling principles involved, see Walker v. Githens, 156 Pa. 178, 180; Whitehill v. Schwartz, 27 Pa. Superior Ct. 526, 529; see also opinions by Judge Allison in Taylor v. Winters, 6 Phila. 126, and by Judge Stroud in Pittfield v. Ewing, 6 Phila. 455, 457, 458. The following cases, from other states, also are enlightening: Higgins v. Halligan, 46 Ill. 173, 180, 181; Amsden v. Floyd, 60 Vt. 386, 390; Despard v. Walbridge, 15 N. Y. 374, 376; Schuyler v. Smith, 51 N. Y. 309, 313; Adriance v. Hafkemeyer, 39 Mo. 134, 135; Moore v. Harter, 67 Ohio 250, 253. Abrams v. Sherwin, 269 Pa. 31, 33, is readily distinguishable in its facts from the case at bar.\nThe order appealed from is affirmed.",
