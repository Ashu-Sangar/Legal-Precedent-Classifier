        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from the refusal to open a judgment entered on a note under seal signed by defendant. The evidence shows that defendant worked for use-plaintiff; he proved a defaulter, and the obligation in suit was given to cover the balance due his employer. The note was taken in the name of the legal plaintiff, Francis S. Laws, at the special solicitation and request of defendant, who feared that, if judgment for such a large amount were entered against him by his employer, just as he, defendant, was leaving a position which he had occupied for some years, it might cause suspicion and impair his chances of obtaining other employment. This simple statement of facts disposes of the necessity for discussing the points of law so earnestly urged upon us by appellant\u2019s counsel, and it is necessary to say only that, after reading the testimony, we are not convinced of error.\nThe order appealed from is affirmed.",

Maxwell, Appellant.\nJudgment \u2014 Opening judgment \u2014 Discharge of rule.\nWhere a judgment entered on a note given by defendant to plaintiff is sought to be opened on the ground that defendant was not indebted to plaintiff, the rule to open will be discharged, where it appears that the judgment had been marked to the use of a corporation by which defendant had been employed, that its amount represented a sum embezzled by defendant, and that the note had been taken in the name of the legal plaintiff at defendant\u2019s request, so chat it might not cause suspicion, and impair his chance of obtaining other employment.\nArgued January 19, 1922.\nAppeal, No. 132, Jan. T., 1920, by defendant, from order of O. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., June T., 1918, No. 4515, discharging rule to open judgment, in ease of Francis S. Laws to use of Edward K. Tryon Co. v. William H. Maxwell,\nBefore Moschzisker, C. J., Frazer, Walling, Simpson, Kephaet, Sadler and Schaefer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nEule to open judgment.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the facts.\nEule discharged. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was, inter alia, above order.\nWalter Thomas, for appellant.\nPlaintiff has attempted to bring on the record a stranger, Tryon Co., and substitute Tryon Co. for plaintiff: Markowitz v. Dye Works, 73 Pa. Superior Ct. 129; Whitehead v. Auto Co., 48 Pa. C. C. R. 648; Heagy v. Umberger, 10 S. & R. 339.\nTo make a defense the judgment must be opened (Weaver v. Adams, 132 Pa. 392), otherwise Maxwell would be liable to pay the judgment twice.\nOtto Wolff, Jr., with him Lewis, Adler & Laws, for appellee.\nFebruary 6, 1922:"
