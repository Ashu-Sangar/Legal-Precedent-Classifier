How did they control it; by rightfully or wrongfully acquiring all <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>the sugar that could be had?

On the contrary, on its face it would appear to be a beneficial means for enabling old customers to assure themselves of a supply of sugar at a time, three and four months distant, when the entire community was clamoring for it because the price had greatly advanced and it was believed would continue so <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>to do; Moreover there is no averment that the alleged “express purpose” was effective in defendant’s case in that, by reason thereof, it contracted for “abnormally large purchases of sugar at high and excessive prices.” The affidavit of defense expressly admits that at this time “sugar was in demand and could have been sold by plaintiff [and that] defendant did not indicate to plaintiff......any unwillingness on defendant’s part to take the sugar,” and, by failing to properly deny it, admits also that “plaintiff could not nearly meet the demands of the trade for the prospective output of its refinery.” Beyond this, however, defendant has only itself to blame if it relied upon the matters of opinion above quoted (Watts v. Cummins, <a href="/pa/59/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="59 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="426978" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0084-01">59 Pa. 84</a>, 91; Lynch’s App., <a href="/pa/97/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="97 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="444822" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0349-01">97 Pa. 349</a>, 352); if it was unwilling to buy unless protected against the possibility of a fall in price, it should have asked for a guarantee; doubtless it did not because it could not afford to take the risk of plaintiff’s refusal to sell under such conditions, when it could easily have sold all the sugar obtainable, without making itself liable to market fluctuations.</p>

It will be noted, however, that the deliveries were not to be made during September or October, but during those months, “or as soon thereafter as is possible,” and that, before delivery was required, defendant was obliged to advise plaintiff what kind of sugar was desired. It is true, the latter could deliver any kind it had, if the former did not furnish the assortment, but this was an option on the part of the seller and not a compulsory requirement; admittedly defendant never furnished any assortment and, when plaintiff finally required it to act, it repudiated the contract. Hence defendant errs when it says plaintiff’s failure “to make delivery of such grades of sugar as it had was a breach of contract on its part”: Merchants and Manufacturers National Bank v.
