So, also, it must be remembered that “after all, as has often been said, rules of construction have very little weight in the case of wills, and ‘precedents ought never to be allowed an unbending control of any case <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>not precisely analogous or even strictly identical’ ”; per Penrose, J., in Ashburner’s Est., <a href="/pa/159/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="159 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="850215" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0545-01">159 Pa. 545</a>, 6, his opinion being adopted by this court.</p>
    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[287,495,1166,1344]]]'>In the light of those principles, we desire to add but little to that which was so well said by Judge Gest, in his opinion in the court below on a prior adjudication in this estate, when deciding that the great-grandchildren were entitled to share in the distribution: “Considering now the effect of the parenthetical clause, ‘the children and issue of my four daughters,’ it is clear that the words ‘children of my four daughters’ [if taken alone] would be merely explanatory of the word‘grandchildren,’ for that is exactly what the granchildren are, and these words would add nothing to and subtract nothing from the meaning of what goes before them. Do the added words ‘and issue’ affect the construction placed upon the will? Obviously, this word ‘issue’ was either intended to add further explanation, perhaps unnecessary, of the word ‘grandchildren,’ or else was intended to be used in its regular and normal meaning of ‘descendants,’ thus amplifying the meaning of the word ‘grandchildren,’ and showing that the testator contemplated the possibility of the death of some of his grandchildren leaving issue before the death of the survivor of his own daughters. Certainly this word ‘issue’ cannot be used in a restrictive sense; if it has any meaning here at all, it must extend or amplify the scope of the testator’s gift to grandchildren.”</p>

Parke, <a href="/binn/5/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="5 Binn. 601" data-case-ids="1793643" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0601-01">5 Binn. 601</a>, 610. Here we have the added words “and issue,” which are mere surplusage if not construed to extend the gift to the great-<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>grandchildren; a result not permissible unless no other is reasonably possible: Ludwick’s Est., <a href="/pa/269/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="269 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1063475" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0365-01">269 Pa. 365</a>. As the conclusion reached by the court below gives those words an appropriate and natural meaning, they cannot be rejected. We therefore conclude that the decision upon this point was correct.</p>
    <p id="b459-5" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[185,644,1153,1248]]]'>Upon the other question involved, it is conceded of course that where distribution is directed to specified children and to the descendants of others, the stirpetal rule should be applied, for under such circumstances the testator has himself designated the classes to whom he desires the distribution made: Sipe’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/30/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="30 Pa. Super. 145" data-case-ids="862158" data-case-paths="/pa-super/30/0145-01">30 Pa. Superior Ct. 145</a>. Here, however, he has distinctly provided for but one class, for he gives the estate “to all and singular my grandchildren, the children and issue of my four daughters, that may then be living, to be divided equally between them share and share alike.” The “them” can only refer to the ones designated as grandchildren, who are the children and issue of the daughters, and the estate is “to be divided equally between <em>them </em>share and share alike.” If the clause had directed the division among the children and issue of the four daughters, leaving out the word “grandchildren,” there might be some slight room for the contention now made; but the gift is directly to the grandchildren, and the designation of “children and issue” is only for the purpose of determining what is meant by the word “grandchildren,” and not to specify classes or change the method of distribution expressly provided.</p>
