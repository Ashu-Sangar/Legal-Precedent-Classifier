The law, whether through the working of equitable principles or on the theory of an implied promise, fixes the one who has the property with an obligation to indemnify his vendor against loss from existing mortgages; this obligation arises as soon as the vendee takes any character of possession under the contract of purchase (he then being the equitable owner of the property), and continues at least till the delivery of the deed of conveyance; but, after this takes place, it is unusual to look to the prior contract for evidence of the obligation to indemnify; ordinarily, under .such circumstances, the deed is depended upon for that purpose.</p>

The vendee in the agreement, Cylinder, made no effort to perform personally his part of the contract, but, by writing endorsed thereon, assigned all his rights to the plaintiff, Dobkin, for a valuable consideration. Dobkin tendered to defendants, for execution, a deed conveying title to him, instead of Cylinder, the instrument setting forth that the conveyance was made “under and subject nevertheless to the payment of an existing mortgage debt or principal sum of <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>three thousand dollars.” Defendants refused to sign, stating they were ready and willing to execute a deed to Cylinder, in accordance with the terms of the contract between them and him, but they would not convey to plaintiff; thereupon this suit was brought. Alter hearing, on pleadings and proofs, the bill was dismissed. Subsequently, a reargument was ordered, and the court below, having changed its view, granted the relief prayed for; defendants have appealed.</p>
    <p id="b225-3" data-blocks='[["BL_225.4",225,[227,839,1151,918]]]'>Appellants first contend that “a contract, to be enforced specifically, must be mutual both as to remedy and obligation”; that, as they could not sue plaintiff to enforce their rights as vendors under the agreement of sale, —made with the former’s assignor, and not with him,— hence plaintiff should be held incapable of enforcing his alleged rights thereunder, against them, by a bill for specific performance. To this contention plaintiff replies that, since defendants had an ample remedy, by action for purchase, money, there existed all the mutuality the law required. We shall not discuss this interesting feature of the controversy, however, because the case was decided by the court below upon another point, and we feel the present appeal must be determined on a governing principle, calling for a retrial, which will probably eliminate the question sought to be raised by the contentions just stated.</p>

The report is meagre, and the reasons prompting the affirmance of the judgment are not stated; but an examination of the paper-books shows that, in an agreement of exchange of real estate, the parties expressly assumed the' mortgages on the properties to be granted to them respectively, and there was an express covenant in the agreement on part of defendant to personally assume the mortgage debt in controversy. As said before, plaintiff offered evidence that there was no intention to waive or merge that covenant of the agreement by the execution of the deed to a third person; he testified the execution of the deed by him to the son of defendant was by mistake; that the name of the party with whom he contracted was J.

Kuster, <a href="/pa/44/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="44 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="484305" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0392-01">44 Pa. 392</a>, 394. Therefore, the question in a suit such as we have mentioned might well be, Was the obligation of the original vendee, to indemnify the vendor, intended to be consummated by the conveyance? In other words, <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>The deed being executed by the vendor to a party other than the vendee named in the contract of sale, was not the latter thereby released from any possible obligation to indemnify the former? Since the vendee is not a party to this suit, we do not intend here to indicate an opinion as to how such a question should be answered; it can be decided, as a controlling factor, when, and only when, he is present on the record, and thus has an opportunity to be heard as to the facts involved and their legal significance.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[193,893,1158,1414]]]'>To the suggestion that the documents in the case must be allowed to speak for themselves, the answer is: In some instances it may be shown by parol that an effect, which usually is given to a written instrument, was, as a matter of fact, not intended by the parties concerned. For example, in Backenstoss v. Stahler’s Administrators, <a href="/pa/33/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="33 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="988361" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0251-01">33 Pa. 251</a>, 254, it was shown that growing crops, which ordinarily would have passed by a conveyance of land, were reserved; and this was allowed to be proved by evidence of a parol agreement, to that effect, between the parties in interest. So here, in the event of a suit 'on the original agreement of sale, to enforce the alleged liability of the vendee named therein, it might be shown that, albeit such a liability, under the ordinary rules of law, could be held to exist (a point upon which we do not rule), yet, as a matter of fact, it was agreed otherwise between those concerned, their intention being that the transferee of the vendee, on the delivery of the deed, was to occupy the place of the latter, so far as the liability in question is concerned: in this connection see Girard, etc., Co. v. Stewart, <a href="/pa/86/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="86 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1056625" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0089-01">86 Pa. 89</a>, which shows that, even in a suit against a vendee who took title with an “under and subject” clause in the deed, facts may be shown which will relieve him from the prima facie liability thus appearing; see also Metzgar and Gernert’s App., <a href="/pa/71/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="71 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="1031255" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0330-01">71 Pa. 330</a>, 332; and Merriman v.

Therefore, we cannot decree a conveyance from the vendors to plaintiff, by undertaking to determine the liability of one who is not a party to the proceeding; the result of such an attempt might be to pay the vendors for their property in that which, when they came to realize on it, would prove of no legal value, and this a court will refuse to do, as “unjust” and “inequitable.” For discussion of the principles governing the rule that courts will not proceed in the absence of indispensable parties, see our opinion, filed simultaneously herewith, in Fineman v. Cutler [the next case], and authorities there cited: also see Black v. American International Corp., <a href="/pa/264/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="264 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1048496" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0260-01">264 Pa. 260</a>, 264, and Hoover v.

To guard against the last-mentioned contingencies, were a direct conveyance to the assignee of the vendee decreed, Should the vendee be ordered to give his personal bond, as evidence of his continuing liability, or, should the situation be worked out by directing two conveyances, one from defendants to their immediate vendee and the other from the latter to his assignee?
