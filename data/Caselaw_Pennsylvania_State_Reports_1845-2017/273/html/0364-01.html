This was an erroneous contention, for so far as relates to the residuary estate, nothing is given the son but the income thereof for life (except the $10,000); while at his death the corpus is given directly to his children, who take as purchasers from the testator and not as heirs of their father. The words “child” and “children” are presumptively words of purchase and not of limitation (Chambers v. Union Trust Co., <a href="/pa/235/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="235 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="984825" data-case-paths="/pa/235/0610-01">235 Pa. 610</a>; Pifer v.

This is the usual case of an estate given in trust for the use of one for life and then over to his children in fee, which we have often held creates but a life estate in the first taker, which is not changed by the provision that, if the life tenant dies without leaving children or issue him surviving, the estate is to vest in other relatives of testator: Daley v. Koons, <a href="/pa/90/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="90 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1065574" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0246-01">90 Pa. 246</a>; Kemp v. Reinhard, <a href="/pa/228/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="228 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="969848" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0143-01">228 Pa. 143</a>; <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>Livezey’s App., <a href="/pa/106/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="106 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="455715" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0201-01">106 Pa. 201</a>. It will also be observed that the gift here is not to appellant and Ms cMldren, but to appellant for life and in a subsequent clause to Ms cMldren in remainder; this emphasizes the intent to limit the interest of the first taker to a life estate: Cote v. Van Bonnhorst, <a href="/pa/41/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="41 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="480064" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0243-01">41 Pa. 243</a>; Curtis et al. v.

Where, as here, the intent clearly appears to carry the corpus or principal over to others, the words of the will must be permitted to have their proper force: Bechtel, Exr., v. Fetter, <a href="/pa/267/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="267 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1057682" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0173-01">267 Pa. 173</a>. Moreover, appellant’s interest being equitable and that of the remaindermen legal, there is no blending; the former takes but a life interest and the rule in Shelley’s Case has no application : Eshbach’s Est., <a href="/pa/197/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="197 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="918674" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0153-01">197 Pa. 153</a>.</p>
