When the new lease was to commence was not shown; this is greatly at variance with the averment of the petition [in support of the relief asked], and, in itself, is sufficient to justify us in discharging the rule. We are not convinced, however, that......an agreement [for a new period of three years] was made. There was discussion touching a new lease, which never, verbally or otherwise, was reduced to definite terms. The fact that the tenant was permitted to remain for another year, at an [agreed] increase of rent [in the absence of proof of the alleged agreement <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>for a new term of three years, depended on by appellant] must be regarded as a withdrawal of the notice and a continuance of the existing lease [at the new rent].”</p>
