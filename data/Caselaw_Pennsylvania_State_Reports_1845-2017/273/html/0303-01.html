Two months after the goods were received and paid for, plaintiff, through his agents, inspected them, and, finding they were deficient in quality, complained to defendant the goods were not as warranted. No remuneration having been received, plaintiff instituted this suit to recover for breach of the warranty; on verdict and judgment in his favor, defendant appeals.</p>

Pittsburgh Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/95/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="95 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="492896" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0348-01">95 Pa. 348</a>, 356.

Nor does the operation of an established usage or custom depend upon the gratuitous assent of any individual. It must be a rule, peacefully acquiesced in, to govern the conduct of persons in relation to a given matter, — so certain and uniform as to be not only valid and enforceable in a court of law, but the parties must be presumed to have known it and acted in reference to it: Corcoran v. Chess, <a href="/pa/131/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="131 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="810311" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0356-01">131 Pa. 356</a>, 359; Bubb v.

If the consent or permission of one of the parties is necessary before the custom or usage can be effective, it is not a rule of conduct, binding alike on both parties, regardless of consent, — it is not a trade usage or custom. There is no such thing as discretion in trade usages or customs. They are absolute and final, unless set aside by agreement or statute.</p>

    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[195,513,1158,1137]]]'>To establish the custom, Albus, plaintiff, living in Philadelphia, testified that, in the twenty-two years he had been in the business of manufacturing ladies’ wear, there was a custom in the trade as to the time when goods were to be examined, — such custom was known to the people who buy and sell woolens to and from manufacturers, and the custom was to “buy the goods three months ahead before he needs them to cut the piece; he never examines them and never sponges them, but puts them in stock, and when he gets ready for a piece, he takes out the goods and sends them to an examiner and sponger, and puts them in a different place, ready to be cut......The custom is to examine the goods when a manufacturer gets ready to make up the samples.” Even though the goods were paid for and held as long as six months, it was the custom in the business to examine the goods when needed for manufacture, and not the custom <em>to </em>examine immediately, because “we buy from reliable people.” When further questioned by the court as to the custom of time limitation within which an examination should be made, he replied “about sixty days.”</p>
    <p id="b357-7" data-blocks='[["BL_357.5",357,[195,1661,1156,756]],["BL_358.1",358,[275,336,1165,588]]]'>If we are to assume some sort of custom was in existence for twenty-two years, there was no evidence to show the extent of the one here contended for. If it was intended to cover all such transactions in the eastern states, or part of them, so that it could be said to be a general custom, it should have been so stated. It might have been limited to the City of Philadelphia, but, as defendant is a New York jobber, it could not have affected him unless he knew of it. The so-called custom is not as precise and certain as a rule of conduct should be that is intended to govern a designated subject-matter, uncertain in that the right to inspect may be in sixty days in some instances, in others six months, as they “deal with reliable people.” All this is contrary to the <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>express elements of a good custom. The character of the people, reliable or unreliable, has nothing to do with its operation, — a custom governs all alike engaged in the line of' business affected. The evidence does not show how prevalent the custom has been; sufficient detail of its existence is lacking to warrant a court or jury in declaring it to be notorious. If six months is the time limit, it is unreasonable, as injecting confusion into validly subsisting obligations. If such contracts are to be influenced by evidence of this character, our mercantile dealings will stand on a flimsy foundation.</p>
    <p id="ApKp" data-blocks='[["BL_358.4",358,[271,937,1163,1136]]]'>In further support of the custom, witness Melnicove does not attempt to speak of its continuousness or extent, and fixes a different period of time within which goods may be returned. His evidence indicates it is a matter of grace rather than right. Koplin’s testimony is lacking in the same particulars, more especially with respect to the element of discretion or right. When asked, “Is that the custom of the trade,” he answered, “Well, it seems to be. They tolerate it.” While he dealt in various cities, he does not attempt to plant his custom in those cities except inferentially. Written contracts cannot be lightly set aside by uncertain evidence of usage or custom. It should be clear, certain, precise, and leave no doubt in the minds of the court as to its existence, scope and extent. Koplin Axes a standard different from other witnesses as to the time within which goods may be returned. Uditsky does not attempt to fix any length of time, nor the extent of the custom; nor does he attempt to imply knowledge to defendant, assuming him to be a nonresident, and limits the knowledge to the manufacturers and the mills, and not to jobbing houses.</p>
