The fact that the original intention of the parties to a contract, was to make a sale, and that such is the legal effect of their first agreement, does not prevent a change while it is still executory, into a bailment with an alternative of future conversion into a sale on the compliance with the stipulated conditions.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b90-6" data-blocks='[["BL_90.6",90,[278,969,1167,263]]]'>2. Where the parties enter into a contract of bailment after there had been original sale proposals between them, and replevin is brought for the property covered by the bailment, that the original sale proposals were not admitted in evidence in such action, would at best be only a harmless error, as the legal effect of the transaction would not be altered.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b90-7" data-blocks='[["BL_90.7",90,[279,1256,1161,129]]]'>3. It is unnecessary for a bailment lease to stipulate for a return of the property. Replevin may be brought for the property although no such stipulation is in the contract.</p>

Where a bailment authorized the bailor upon demand to forthwith take possession of the property, and the bailor, twenty-eight days before he issues a writ of replevin, notifies the bailee in writing he would be obliged to retake the property unless past due installments are paid, the bailee cannot set up a lack of demand as a defense.</p>

Defendants filed an affidavit of defense and the case went to jury trial, where there was a directed verdict for plaintiff and, from judgment entered thereon, defendants brought this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[277,1334,1163,972]]]'>Prior to the execution of each lease, the parties had entered into,a written contract called a “sales proposal,” being a proposition by plaintiff to furnish and deliver the truck to defendants, on terms of payment, etc., similar to those later embodied in the lease. These proposals were accepted by defendants and were in form contracts of sale, but were superseded by the bailment leases, under which the trucks were delivered to the defendants. While the sales proposals remained executory it was competent for the parties to change them to bailment leases, and having done so the latter became the actual final agreements. “The fact that the original intention of the parties is to make a sale, and that such is the legal effect of their first agreement, does not prevent a change, while it is still executory, into a bailment with an alternative of future conversion into a sale on the compliance with the stipulated conditions”: Goss Printing Co. v.

    <p id="b93-4" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[150,807,1157,1301]]]'>Installments, long overdue, were unpaid when the writ of replevin issued, but by mere indulgence plaintiff did not lose its right to reclaim the property in accordance with the terms of the contracts. There had been no modification of the leases nor any waiver of plaintiff’s rights; on the contrary, twenty-eight days before the writ issued, the use-plaintiff wrote defendants stating, inter alia, “we will be obliged to repossess these trucks unless <em>the </em>past due [paper] is taken care of in the near future.” This is inconsistent with the claim of a waiver, being in effect a demand for the trucks unless the defaults were promptly made good, which they were not. The leases authorized plaintiff, upon demand, to forthwith take possession of the trucks, but defendants had practically a month’s written notice, in addition to verbal notices as shown by the uncontradicted evidence. Such notice, whether oral or written, need be in no set form of words (1 Cyc. 696), and, as we regard the written notice sufficient, it is unnecessary to determine whether a demand must precede the suit. As defendants made no offer or effort to make good the defaults, either before or after the issuing of the writ, there is no merit in their claim of lack of demand, and nothing which required a submission of that question to the jury.</p>
