At the trial, the court below refused plaintiff’s point for binding instructions, directed the jury to render a verdict for defendants, later refused plaintiff’s motion for judgment non obstante veredicto and entered judgments on the verdicts; Whereupon plaintiff apfpealed, assigning those rulings as error.

He thereupon changed his beneficiaries so as to make each certificate “payable to my wife Clarissa C.

Young, my stepdaughter [plaintiff herein], and in case of her death, to her heirs.” After this latter change was made, the two associations, as theretofore they had done, sent bills for fees and assessments to decedent, and he forwarded some or all of them to plaintiff’s husband, who paid them. It does <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>not appear whether this was done by virtue of an agreement and if so when or under what circumstances it was made; or whether it was because, from time to time, decedent found himself unable to pay them and hence sent them to plaintiff’s husband, who paid them to protect his wife as beneficiary, or advanced the moneys as a loan to decedent. If the latter, plaintiff could recover, even if she had no insurable interest (Chidester v.

It is urged by appellees, however, that, as the suits were brought in this State, we should enforce our public policy which forbids recovery under such circumstances (United Brethren Mutual Aid Society v.

If this is the law, and such is defendant’s contention, the temptation would be to end the insured’s life before the first premium fell due; in other words to sooner end the life in this event than it would in the other. Such a possibility would appear to demonstrate that this contention of defendant is essentially wrong, since the public policy, relied upon, exists and is enforced for the sole purpose of removing the temptation to shorten the life of the insured.

This was permitted because of facts very similar to those in the present case. There, as here, plaintiff came to live with decedent at the time of her mother’s marriage to him, and remained with him until she married and established a home of her own; later she separated from her husband and supported herself, but prior to the date of the certificate she returned to decedent’s home and remained with him until his death, receiving, as compensation for her services during this later period, food, clothing and a certain amount of spending money. Her living with him at the time the certificate was made payable to her, is the only fact not appearing in the present case. It is evident, however, that this alone, without the prior relationship, would not have given her an insurable interest; hence its effect could only have been to show that the relationship continued until after the certificate was issued; and it necessarily follows that if this fact is established by other evidence, the same conclusion must be reached. If it be said that the point of the decision was that “child,” under the circumstances stated, must be held to include stepchild, then it mnst do so also in the instant case, if equally potential facts are shown. If it be said that the validity of the certificate there was determined under the law of Maryland, then these assignments should be sustained under the laws of New York and Ohio and the same result would be reached. If it be said that the question of the public policy of this State was not raised in that case, it is answered that this court determined the question according to its construction of the contract, and not because of any decision by the courts of Maryland; and hence if, by reason of the relationship, a stepchild may be treated as a child under that certificate, so it may be under these assignments. We are aware that some of <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>the facts appearing in that case, and in this also, were disclosed by the testimony in United Brethren Mutual Aid Society v.

In this state of the case the proof regarding the former family relationship was evidently not considered of sufficient weight to establish an insurable interest, and hence it was not referred to in our opinion. On the other hand, if that case should be considered as determining the questions raised here, then in effect it was overruled, upon this point, by Hummel v. Supreme Conclave Improved Order Heptasophs, <a href="/pa/256/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="256 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="1030660" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0164-01">supra,</a> or at least so far antagonized thereby as to entitle us to consider and decide the question upon principle.</p>

True, he paid the premiums on it; the case was not decided on this ground, however, but because “without any legal obligation other than friend, he chose to assume all the burdens incident to this domestic relation of parent and child.

Doubtless an intent to sever the relation might be shown; but he who so avers must prove it, since the law presumes the continuance of a status once shown to exist (McConville v. Ingham, <a href="/pa/268/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="268 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="1061505" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0507-01">268 Pa. 507</a>, 518); and hence it was expressly decided by Judge Boss in Dull’s Est., 1 Legal Opinion 125, that the subsequent marriage and removal of the stepchild, does not necessarily dissolve the relation in loco parentis. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the tender ties which spring up between stepfather and stepdaughter, where, during the child’s minority, they have lived together for years and really loved each other, are no more destroyed by the marriage of the latter, a removal to her new home and support by her husband, than they would be in the case of an own daughter; and no one would contend that the latter lost her insurable interest under such circumstances.</p>

When he married plaintiff’s mother, plaintiff was twelve or thirteen years of age and was living with her grandparents. She remained with them about six months, then went to live with decedent and continued a member of his family about ten years, when she was married, and she and her husband established a home of their own, where they lived for about three years, after which they together returned to decedent and lived with him for about two years. They then separated (and later were divorced), plaintiff obtaining a position in and moving to Philadelphia where she lived for eleven or twelve years. During this time she returned to decedent’s home every summer, staying with him from the first of July to the middle of September. While in Philadelphia she supported herself in part, but received considerable aid from him. When her mother was taken ill, plaintiff gave up her position, returned to decedent’s home and nursed her mother about <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>four months, when the latter died. Shortly thereafter, and while plaintiff was still living with decedent, he told her he intended to make her the beneficiary in the two certificates, the proceeds of which are the subject of this litigationand perhaps this alone should resolve the controversy in her favor, since at this time plaintiff was a member of his family (Corson’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=113%20Pa.%20439" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="113 Pa. 439">113 Pa. 439</a>; Brown v. Ancient Order of United Workmen, <a href="/pa/208/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="208 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="998167" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0101-01">208 Pa. 101</a>; Phillips’s Est., <a href="/pa/238/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="238 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="991577" data-case-paths="/pa/238/0423-01">238 Pa. 423</a>); he did not, however, carry out his purpose until two months later and after her second marriage, which was celebrated at his home. Immediately following this marriage she returned to Philadelphia and lived there with her husband, during the two and a half years which elapsed before decedent’s death; spending a few weeks with him at Ms home during the summer, and he spending a few weeks with her at her home during the winter.</p>
    <p id="b499-5" data-blocks='[["BL_499.4",499,[154,1266,1154,1178]]]'>More than a year after the assignments to plaintiff decedent made his will, and therein stated: “Whereas since the death of my wife, I have transferred to my stepdaughter my two life insurance policies, there is an advantage in them that will give her a preference when my death occurs, I therefore direct that if I shall die by violence, so that my accident insurance shall come into play, that said accident insurance shall be payable to my sister.” Defendants insist that this will was not admissible for any purpose, but, as was pointed out by Judge Eoss in Dull’s Est., supra, it is evidence to show the relation in loco parentis was not sundered by the marriage and plaintiff’s removal to the home of her husband; and especially is this so in the instant cases, since decedent made no testamentary gift to plaintiff, and hence could only have intended this paragraph to show that his relations with her remained unchanged. Defendants contend that the effect of allowing plaintiff to recover these sums of money would be to give her “a preference out of his estate”; this is true, but it is exactly what the above-quoted paragraph of the will proves decedent intended.</p>

It also clearly shows that plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of pecuniary aid from him, if needed, and this under all our cases is sufficient to establish an insurable intention. Moreover, as tersely •stated by the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey in Thomas v. National Benefit Association, <a href="/njl/84/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="84 N.J.L. 281" data-case-ids="219659" data-case-paths="/njl/84/0281-01">84 N. J.

In this case, however, defendants educed the evidence referred to by cross-examination of plaintiff, which not being disputed must be taken as true (Dunmore v. Padden, <a href="/pa/262/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="262 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1044461" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0436-01">262 Pa. 436</a>; Krewson v.

If any one was entitled to challenge her credibility it would be the appellee, and the appellee does not do so.” This was the attitude of both counsel in both arguments in this court; defendants fairly planted their contention solely upon the facts that plaintiff was only a stepdaughter of decedent, was not living with him at the time the assignments were made, and that her husband for her had paid all the later premiums ; for the reasons stated, this was a broken reed which gave appellees no support.</p>
