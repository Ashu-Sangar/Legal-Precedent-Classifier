The Constitution of Pennsylvania, article I, section 9, provides, “In all criminal prosecutions the accused......cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself.” This and language of similar import in the Constitution of the United States crystallized a principle in our constitutions, state and federal, which had been established in English law, necessary to the maintenance of liberty. <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>This rule of law was somewhat slow of development as compared with the ripening of other doctrines deemed essential to individual liberty. “The woof of its long story is woven across a tangled warp composed in part of the inventions of the early canonists, of the momentous contest between the courts of the common law and the church, and of the political and religious issues of that convulsive period in English history, the days of the dictatorial Stuarts”: Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 3, page 3070. “Down to the early 1600s, at any rate, it was certainly lacking” in the common law: Ibid., page 3084. “The Petition of Eight (1629) though it insists upon the right secured by Magna Carta to be condemned only by the law of the land, and sets forth by way of grievance divers violations of it, is silent upon the practice of compulsory self-incrimination, though it was then a matter of common occurrence in all the courts of the realm. The bill of rights of the first year of the reign of William and Mary (1689) is likewise silent, though the practice of questioning the prisoner at his trial had not then ceased”: Twining v. United States, <a href="/us/211/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="211 U.S. 78" data-case-ids="11926611" data-case-paths="/us/211/0078-01">211 U. S. 78</a>. This principle, eventually firmly established, has never been departed from or infringed, since it obtained full recognition.

Would this be true, if he could be subjected to call in open court for testimony deemed by the prosecution necessary to establish guilt, when, in many instances, not to speak, in answer to the call, would be more prejudicial than to give full utterance, and where to answer at all, without complete explanation, might amount well nigh to confession of guilt? To jealously guard the rights of one accused of crime, has been one of the fundamentals of the administration of justice, in all courts where English law and customs regulate the affairs of <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>men; and one of the great safeguards of the accused would be broken down, if, on his trial, demand could be made on him before his triers to produce evidence intended to aid in his conviction. If letters can be called for, why not other documents and things believed to be incriminatory? If there be a missing link in the Commonwealth’s case, what more damning circumstance could there be to the defendant, to whose possession it is alleged to have been traced, than his standing mute under call. Mr. Justice Day, now of the Supreme Court of the United States, speaking for the circuit court of appeals, in McKnight v. United States, <a href="/f/115/0972-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="115 F. 972" data-case-ids="3705007" data-case-paths="/f/115/0972-01">115 Fed. R. 972</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20C.C.A.%20358" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="54 C.C.A. 358">54 C. C. A. 358</a>, thus characterized and pointed out the dangers of such a practice: “A perusal of the decisions of the Supreme Court shows that no constitutional right has been the subject of more jealous care than that which protects one accused of crime from being compelled to give testimony against himself. The right to such protection existed in the common law, and was carried into the Constitution, that the citizen might be forever protected from inquisitorial proceedings compelling him to bear testimony against himself of acts which might subject him to punishment. In the present case the accused, in the presence of the jury, was, by direction of the court, called upon to produce the document...... The production of such a paper would have been self-incriminating to the defendant in the highest degree. .......The accused, by the demand made upon him before the jury, after proof tending to show possession of the document, was required either to produce it, deny or explain his want of possession of the writing, or by his very silence permit inferences to be drawn against him quite as prejudicial as positive testimony would be. ......We think the procedure was an infraction of the constitutional rights of the accused, within the meaning of the fifth amendment of the Constitution.” When this case was again before the circuit court of appeals (McKnight v. United States, <a href="/f/122/0926-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="122 F. 926" data-case-ids="1898264" data-case-paths="/f/122/0926-01">122 Fed. R. 926</a>), where the <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>notice to produce had been given, but not in the presence of the jury, the court said: “To say to a defendant in the presence of a jury, ‘If you do not produce such and such a document, we will prove its contents by the best evidence within reach,’ is a method of compelling a defendant to become a witness against himself, as most unjust inferences may be drawn from a refusal to comply with such a demand, and even more dangerous results from compliance.” The Supreme Court of Oklahoma arrived at the same conclusion in Gillespie v. State, 5 Oklahoma Crim. 546, <a href="/okla-crim/5/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="115 P. 620" data-case-ids="8744741" data-case-paths="/okla-crim/5/0546-01">115 Pac. R. 620</a>, as did the Supreme Court of Iowa, in reversing a conviction of assault with intent to commit manslaughter, where the trial court had interrogated the accused, who had not offered themselves as witnesses, as to the possession of certain papers. Commenting on this, that court said: “Accused persons cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves, nor can they be placed in the position of admitting or denying in the presence of the jury anything having a moral bearing on their guilt”: State v. Markley, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20Iowa%20695" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="75 Iowa 695">75 Iowa 695</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20N.W.%20111" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="39 N.W. 111">39 N.

A. 437</a>, was determined upon another constitutional provision, it contains an admirable discussion of the general question of immunity from self-crimination.</p>
    <p id="b267-3" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[187,1681,1154,705]],["BL_268.1",268,[282,313,1165,1356]]]'>The right to compel the accused to exhibit himself for identification, which is closely related to the question we are considering, has been the subject of much discussion. In People v. Gardner, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20L.R.A.%20699" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="28 L.R.A. 699">28 L. R. A. 699</a>, the New York Court of Appeals decided that compelling the defendant in a criminal case to stand up, for the purpose of identification, does not violate the constitutional provision against compelling one to be a witness against himself, the court in the course of its opinion saying, “The history of the constitutional provision referred to clearly demonstrates that it was not intended to reach a case like this......The main purpose of the provision was to prohibit the compulsory oral examination of the prisoners <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>before trial, or upon trial for the purpose of extorting unwilling confessions or declarations implicating them in crime.” The note to this decision in which the American and English cases on the question are reviewed (<a href="/citations/?q=28%20L.R.A.%20699" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="28 L.R.A. 699">28 L. R. A. 699</a>), states there is a hopeless conflict of authority, on the identical point just enunciated each side of which is supported by a respectable line of apparently well considered cases. The same conflict of authority is pointed out in 8 Ruling Case Law, page 78. The result of a study of these decisions is to show that, while the courts are not at all of uniform opinion as to whether it is a violation of the constitutional privilege to compel the defendant on trial to exhibit himself for the purpose of identification or comparison, nevertheless the uniform principle, recognized in all of them, is, that he cannot be required by speech or the equivalent of speech to criminate himself. In the instant case, this principle applies, because, on the call for the letter, he was bound to speak or remain silent and silence was the equivalent of speech. “The prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal court to be witness against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion to extort communications from him, not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it may be material”: Holt v. United States, <a href="/us/218/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="218 U.S. 245" data-case-ids="8286703" data-case-paths="/us/218/0245-01">218 U. S. 245</a> (1910).</p>

Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/115/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="115 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="551775" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0369-01">115 Pa. 369</a>, one of the most celebrated criminal trials of its day, the district attorney called upon the prisoner on trial, to stand up and repeat certain words, in the presence of the widow of the man he was charged with having murdered, for the purpose of aiding her in identification. Of this incident in the trial, we said it “may be dismissed with the remark that no objection was made or exception taken thereto in the court below. So far as the record shows, the request was promptly acceded to without any objection either by the prisoner himself or his counsel. Having thus waived the right of objection and taken the chances of a favorable result, it would be con<a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>trary to every rule of practice to permit Mm to take advantage of what was done, even if it was erroneous...... It does not appear that the silence of the record, as to any objection or exception to the action complained of, is the result of accident or mere oversight. If such had been the case, the court on application would have so corrected the record as to show what actually occurred on the trial. But, assuming for the sake of argument, that timely objection was made and exception taken, we are not prepared to say it would be of any avail to the prisoner. He was not asked, much less compelled, ‘to give evidence against himself.’ The sole object of the request was to afford the witness, Mrs. Sharpless, then on the stand, an opportunity of seeing the prisoner and hearing the sound of his voice, so that she might the more intelligently testify whether he was or was not the man by whom she was confronted on the night in question. To hold that this was a violation of the clause, in section 9 of the Declaration of Bights, which declares the accused ‘cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself,’ would in my judgment be a strained construction of that instrument. If it should be sanctioned, what would prevent a person accused of having stolen property in his possession from successfully interposing a like plea of constitutional immunity and thus thwarting any attempt to search for and recover the property? While the constitutional rights of those accused should never be violated, care must be taken not to deprive the Commonwealth of any legitimate means of detecting and punishing crime. It is not our purpose, however, to pass upon the question, intended to be raised by these specifications, until it is properly presented. If it should ever arise and be deemed worthy of serious consideration, it will then be definitely settled.” While we do not pass upon the precise question in that case now, yet the question we are considering bears a close analogy to it.</p>

There, a witness for the prosecution was on the stand, who had been an accomplice of the defendant and turned state’s evidence. He testified as to letters written by the defendant, and that letter press copies thereof were in letter books in the latter’s possession. Thereupon counsel for the prosecution gave defendant and his counsel notice to produce the letter press copies of the letters written by him, and the originals of the letters written to him, to which his counsel replied there were no such letters in existence. The trial court ruled, the witness having testified that the letter books were in the possession of the defendant, and the defendant not having produced them, their contents should be shown by the witness on the stand. In affirming this ruling, it was pointed out in the opinion that “No objection was made as to the time or manner in which the notice to produce was given.” No question was raised as to any violation of the defendant’s constitutional privilege, and therefore the case has no bearing on the question we are called on to decide.</p>

Hubbard, <a href="/pa-super/65/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="65 Pa. Super. 213" data-case-ids="625396" data-case-paths="/pa-super/65/0213-01">65 Pa. Superior Ct. 213</a> (1916), where the immediate question was, whether secondary proof of the contents of a paper, traced to defendant’s possession, could be given without demand having been made on him to produce it. Mr. Justice Kephart, then of the Superior Court and speaking for it, in demonstrating the proposition that it was not necessary to call on the defendant to produce a document traced to him, used this significant language, “The court is without power to compel obedience to such notice and the notice would be futile. Courts should not require vain things to be done. If the notice were required, the prosecuting officer, in the presence of the jury, would have the right to demand the production of the original writing. The accused must then either produce the document, explain its nonproduction or remain silent. In either circumstance, the result is likely to be highly prejudicial to his case before the jury. The accused, under the Constitution of Pennsylvania, need not be required to testify against himself. He should not be placed in a position before the jury where his action would be tantamount to giving, under compulsion, incriminating evidence against himself.”</p>

The letter was not addressed to defendant alone, but to “Mr. and Mrs. Frank Valeroso.” For anything that appeared, the wife of the defendant may have received it, not he. Certainly, the contents of a letter addressed to two individuals, without proof as to its receipt by the one to be affected by it, cannot be received in evidence in the trial of a cause, either civil or criminal.</p>
