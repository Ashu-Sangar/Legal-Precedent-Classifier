March 1, 1920, the duly constituted authorities of the Catholic Church divided the parish in which it belonged, and directed that all of its members on one side of the newly established boundary line should be members of St. Stanislaus’ Church, another Catholic church in Shenandoah, which was created as a new parish; the effect of this, under the canons of <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>the church, was to transfer the petitioners and several hundred other members of the first named church from membership in it to membership in the latter.</p>

Accordingly the petition we are now considering was presented to the court below, the prayer of which was that the appellants, petitioners, be appointed trustees of the legal title of the church property, in trust for the congregation of the church, in the place and stead of the archbishop.</p>

After hearing, the petition was dismissed by the court below, which held that the proper ecclesiastical body of the church, empowered to make the division, had divided St. Casimir’s parish, that this action by the church authorities was binding on the courts, and that under the laws, customs and usages of the Roman Catholic Church, those members of St. Casimer’s Church residing within the boundary lines of the newly established St. Stanislaus’ parish, ipso facto, by the order of division, ceased to be members of the former and became members of the latter, <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>without any voice thereafter over the temporal affairs of the original parish, or power or authority over any of the church property therein.

This brings us to the critical inquiry in the case. Is church membership a temporal or spiritual matter; does the decision as to who are and who are not members of any given church lie within the domain of the tribunals of the State or of the Church?

In English ecclesiastical law, it has been used to designate the territory committed to the particular charge of a parson or priest.

All who unite themselves to such a body, do so with an implied consent to this government and are bound to submit to it.

We know of no legislation which gives to a member of a congregation a property right in his membership therein. His rights in the church property flow from his membership.

It was held in Waller v. Howell, <a href="/nys/45/0790-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="45 N.Y.S. 790" data-case-ids="3464133" data-case-paths="/nys/45/0790-01">45 N. Y.

We must take the fact of expulsion as conclusive proof that the persons expelled are not now members of the repudiating church; for, whether right or wrong, the act of excommunication must, as to the fact of membership, be law to this court. For every judicial purpose..... .we must consider the persons who were expelled by a vote of the church, as no longer members of the church, or entitled to any rights or privileges incidental to or resulting from membership therein...... Every member of that church has a beneficial interest in the property thus conveyed, so long as he or she shall continue to be a member, but no longer. It is only as a constituent element of the aggregated body or church, that any person can acquire or hold, as a cestui que trust, any interest in the property thus dedicated to that church......The judicial eye of the civil authority of this land of religious liberty, cannot penetrate the veil of the church, nor can the arm of this court either rend or touch that veil for the forbidden purpose of vindicating the alleged wrongs of the excinded members. When they became members they did so on the condition of continuing or not, as themselves and their church might determine. In that respect they voluntarily subjected themselves to the ecclesiastical power, and cannot invoke the supervision or control of that jurisdiction by this or any other civil tribunal. Then, not being now members of the church to whose use the ground was conveyed, the appellants seem no longer to be entitled to any beneficial interest in that property, nor to any other right which this court can either enforce or recognize.” In our own case of German Reformed Church v. Seibert, <a href="/pa/3/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="3 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="400726" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0282-01">3 Pa. 282</a>, we held that as a person <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>excommunicated from tlie church ceases to be a member, he loses his right as a corporator of the church. In Wheelock v. First Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, 51 Pacific Repr. 811, the Supreme Court of California decided that the division of a local Presbyterian church into two organizations by an act of a presbytery, according to the recognized ecclesiastical law of the Presbyterian Church, is binding upon the local church and upon the civil courts whenever material to pending litigation.</p>
