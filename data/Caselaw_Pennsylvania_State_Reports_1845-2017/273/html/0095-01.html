    <p id="b145-4" data-blocks='[["BL_145.7",145,[183,599,1156,742]]]'>On April 15, 1913, defendant’s team, attached to a street-sweeping machine and in charge of an employee, was being driven east in Larchmont Avenue, Phila., and in making the turn at Fifty-Second Street, one of the horses fell on the pavement. The driver unhitched the other horse and turned its head away from the pole, where it was left unrestrained, although young, shy and skittish, while the driver went over by the fallen horse and by kicks, etc., urged it to arise. The latter in struggling kicked the hind leg of its mate, which, being free, ran three blocks down the street, where it injured Mrs. Maumee Jordan, the plaintiff. The jury found in her favor and this appeal by defendant is from judgment entered thereon.</p>

The mere fact that a horse runs away does not of itself establish negligence (Luks v. American Ice Co., <a href="/pa/267/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="267 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1057685" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0337-01">267 Pa. 337</a>; Coller v.

Moreover, <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>due caution might have suggested the probability that a skittish horse would take fright from the struggles of the mate in regaining its feet.</p>
