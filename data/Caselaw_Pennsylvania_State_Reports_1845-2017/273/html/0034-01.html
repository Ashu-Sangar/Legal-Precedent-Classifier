    <p id="b83-8" data-blocks='[["BL_83.13",83,[188,1423,1154,748]]]'>This is an action of trespass for personal injuries to Clarence Idell, a minor of seventeen. The accident happened on the evening of January 23, 1920, at about 10 o’clock, while young Idell, in company with eight others, all minors, was sled riding on a roadway in Germantown known as Lincoln Drive. Their sled collided with defendant’s automobile. Verdicts for the minor and father were recovered in the court below, but, as appellant took but one appeal, instead of two, which the law requires, he was compelled to elect which judgment he would contest; by paper filed, he abandoned his objection to the father’s judgment, and assigned as error to that of the minor the refusal of the court to give binding instructions in favor of defendant.</p>
    <p id="b83-9" data-blocks='[["BL_83.14",83,[187,2188,1155,210]],["BL_84.1",84,[282,319,1166,1242]]]'>Lincoln Drive, in the suburban section, is an eighty-foot wide street, fifty feet from curb to curb, with fifteen-foot sidewalks. The houses are built back twenty-five feet from the house-line, and, at Carpenter Street, <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>where it intersects Lincoln Drive, there is an unobstructed view down the latter for at least 800 feet. The occupants of the sled had come some distance before reaching the scene of the accident, which was 300 feet south of Carpenter Street, on the right side of the road. Here there is little or no grade, and the sled was merely drifting, its momentum having been spent in the distance passed over, beyond which, as the boys described it, the hill was steeper and the coasting better. When they reached Carpenter Street, going south, they were traveling possibly from five to eight miles an hour, and the automobile could be seen coming north upon the right side of the road, the sled being on its proper side, — eight to ten feet from the west curb-line of the road. There were no lights on the sled, but warning from a klaxon horn was sounded by the boys at all crossings, or whenever necessary to attract the attention of pedestrians who happened to be on the highway. There was an arc light at Carpenter Street and gas lamps along the sides of Lincoln Drive, — one immediately at the place of the accident. , From the evidence it appeared the night was clear enough that the persons on the drive could be seen for a distance of from 800 to 1,000 feet.</p>

The speed of the car did not cause the accident; while the sled was not in a fixed position, the accident was bound to result <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>when the car was turned directly in front of it within a few feet of its approach. It would have happened to any vehicle traveling in the same direction as the sled, under the circumstances here detailed. The doctor’s acts imperiled the life of every one who might be traveling, as the sled was, on the opposite side of the street. His excuse received all the consideration it was entitled to by the court below, for what the headlight mistakenly revealed to him, as he says, could not have been true, and, if it was, should he not have made reasonably certain that people were actually ahead? He could have had his illusion dispelled by driving within fifty feet of the supposed pedestrians, when the shadows would have disappeared, in the brilliancy of his headlights; and, if he could see these supposed people walking, why couldn’t he see the boys coming slowly along with their sled? If he had suspected there was something on the road in front of him, he should, as any prudent man would, have gone close enough to it to find out. Shadows are quickly neutralized in the glare of an electric headlight, and his suspicions would have been quickly dissipated had he followed a reasonable course.</p>

In the absence of such statutory requirement, it seems to me that due and ordinary care demands that those using such a sled on such a highway at night must give warning of its presence by the means other vehicles use. As I view the testimony, the fault here was not with the defendant, but with the plaintiff, and there should be no recovery permitted; therefore, I dissent.</p>
