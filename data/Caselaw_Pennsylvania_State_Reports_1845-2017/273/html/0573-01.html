The actual personal intent of the testatrix should govern (Tyson’s Est., <a href="/pa/191/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="191 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="907042" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0218-01">191 Pa. 218</a>) and it must be ascertained by a consideration of the will as a whole: Schuldt v. Reading Trust Co., <a href="/pa/270/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="270 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="1066011" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0360-01">270 Pa. 360</a>; Packer’s Est.

Blackmore, <a href="/pa/74/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="74 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="1034700" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0414-01">74 Pa. 414</a>. The clause of the will first above quoted creates an active spendthrift trust of Edgar’s moiety, giving him the life use with the power to make an absolute disposition of the one-half thereof by his last will, which he did. In the event of his failure to do so, however, the will continues that one-half within the trust during the life of his widow and for her use, then gives <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>the entire moiety to Edgar’s children in fee. This provision gives rise to appellant’s contention that by it the power given Edgar was revoked, except as to the use of the one-half of the moiety during the life of his widow, should she survive him. While plausible, we cannot agree that such is a sound construction, for, if so, the Xiower would have been wholly destroyed by the death of Edgar’s wife in his lifetime, yet there is nothing in the will to such effect or that limits the power to a life use. If the latter was all the mother intended to bestow upon her son she probably would have omitted the power clause and, as she did in the event of its nonexercise, have given the life use directly to the surviving widow. The gift in remainder of the entire moiety to Edgar’s children may have been based on the thought of his failure to exercise the power of appointment; moreover, as the gifts to Edgar and his wife were limited to life estates, it was proper to dispose of the entire moiety in remainder, for the power might not be exercised. So the gift over of the whole moiety in general terms does not indicate an intent to revoke the power, but rather a provision for the contingency of its nonexercise and in any event to dispose of the one-half of the moiety excluded therefrom. This construction gives effect to the several provisions of the will, which should always be done if possible (Patton’s Est., <a href="/pa/268/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="268 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1061593" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0367-01">268 Pa. 367</a>), and, is, we believe, what the testatrix intended.</p>

Conceding the remainder of the moiety was vested in Edgar’s children, it was subject to be divested by the exercise of the power given the father: see McCauley’s Est., <a href="/pa/257/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="257 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="1032402" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0377-01">257 Pa. 377</a>.</p>
