These cases would be controlling against plaintiff’s right of recovery against his employer, the operator of the car, but as the suit is against a third person, the owner and operator of the automobile which backed into the car, they have no application. The car had the same privilege to traverse the street as any other vehicle, and those riding on it, the right to assume that other users of the highway would <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>be regardful of them, and take due care not to collide with the car to their injury. It certainly could not be maintained, if plaintiff had occupied a similar position to that which he had on the car, in an automobile or wagon driving along the street, and defendant had backed into it, and injured him, that defendant’s position in the automobile or wagon would impute any negligence to him; the fact that he was riding in a trolley car under the circumstances here appearing can make no difference in the application of legal principles affecting the users of highways.</p>

The cause of the accident was the violent collision, resulting, as the jury found, from defendant’s negligence, and not because of the place plaintiff occupied on his car. His being there was merely a condition, not the cause of the accident. A person injured by the negligence of another is not deprived of all remedy merely because at the timei he was occupying an unusual position in a conveyance, unless he thereby cooperated in causing his injury.” While the circumstances were different in Little v. Central District &amp; Printing Telegraph Co., <a href="/pa/213/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="213 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="943434" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0229-01">213 Pa. 229</a>, the principle there invoked is applicable here: “It is not of itself negligence for a person riding in a wagon on a public highway to permit his feet or arms to extend beyond the side of the vehicle. When one is injured while occupying such position, it is for the jury to determine whether he was, at the time, exercising the care required by the circumstances, unless the danger was so apparent that a reasonably prudent person would not have taken the risk.” It appeared in Thirteenth and Fifteenth <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>Street Passenger Railway Co. v.
