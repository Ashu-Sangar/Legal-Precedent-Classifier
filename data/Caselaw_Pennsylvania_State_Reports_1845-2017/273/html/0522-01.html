Within the limitation of one year prescribed by section 2 of the Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 309, a summons in trespass was issued and returned nihil habet; no appearance was entered and no- further writ was issued until over two years later, when an alias summons was issued and duly served. The affidavit of defense alleged the action was barred because of the delay; the court below assumed that, under section 20 of the Procedure Act of May 14, 1915, P.

Prior to the passage of the Act of 1915, it was held that the question, as to whether or not a plaintiff’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations, could not be raised by demurrer (Heath v. Page, <a href="/pa/48/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="48 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="422183" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0130-01">48 Pa. 130</a>; Barclay v.

Marvel, <a href="/pa/270/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="270 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="1065994" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0378-01">270 Pa. 378</a>. For this reason the Superior Court correctly decided, in a suit commenced since the passage of the act, that it would not be dismissed, as a matter of law, because the record showed it was begun after the period fixed by the statute: Carter v. Vandegrift, <a href="/pa-super/74/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="74 Pa. Super. 26" data-case-ids="645608" data-case-paths="/pa-super/74/0026-01">74 Pa. Superior Ct. 26</a>.

The Act of March 27, 1713, 1 Smith’s Laws 76, provides that, depending on the nature of the action, suit must be brought within six years, two years or one year after the cause of action arose, “and not after”; section 2 of the Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 309, states that, for injuries resulting in death, “the action shall be brought within one year after the death, and not thereafter”; and section 2 of the Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 236, that for personal injuries not resulting in death, the action “must be brought within two years from the time when the injury was done and not afterwards.” The same reasoning must, therefore, apply to all suits governed by any of these statutes.</p>

True, the usual practice, since the Procedure Acts, has been to consider it at that time; but they do not so require, either actually or by reasonable implication. Before their passage, when the statute of limitations was pleaded, plaintiff filed a replication averring the facts which he alleged operated to toll it, and to this defendant demurred, if of opinion they were not sufficient for the purpose (see Curcier’s Est., <a href="/pa/28/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="28 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="981704" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0261-01">28 Pa. 261</a>-2), and the court either sustained the demurrer and entered judgment for defendant, or overruled it, leaving the disputed facts upon this point to be determined by the jury at the trial of the issues raised in the case.
