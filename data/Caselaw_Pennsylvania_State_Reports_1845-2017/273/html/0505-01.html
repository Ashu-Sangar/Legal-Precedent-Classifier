Where a testator makes limitations over to survivors after the death without issue of the first taker, and names as remainder-men persons in being, a strong presumption is raised that an indefinite failure of issue is not contemplated; and this is strengthened when the limitation over is of but a life estate.</p>

If it appears, either by expression or clear implication, that by the word “issue” testator meant issue living at a particular period, as at the death of the first taker, and not the whole line of succession, it must necessarily be construed as a word of purchase, and the rule in Shelley’s Case can have no application.</p>

As to the Pine Street property, devised in the third item of testatrix’s will to Mary, appellant contends that, upon the death of the devisee without issue, this real estate became vested in Frederick, as the sole surviving brother of Mary, and, the limitation to such surviving brother (in the will of Christiana Mebus, deceased), being without any words to designate what estate he was to have, Frederick took in fee, by virtue of section 9 of the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249, and appellant became entitled to the property under her brother’s will. As before indicated, botli of these contentions were overruled by the court below.</p>

If Frederick took an estate in fee in the properties originally devised to him, then, equally, Mary must have done likewise in those devised to her; and, if she had an estate in fee, there could be no remainder to her surviving brothers. Hence, upon the death of Mary, Frederick would have taken no interest in the property devised to her, she having willed all her estate to others. It is not necessary to further consider this aspect of the matter, however, since we agree with the court below that Mary and Frederick had but life estates, both in the <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>properties devised to them individually and in those which they might take as surviving cross-remaindermen.</p>

Therefore, a preliminary question to be solved is, Did testatrix mean to employ the word “issue” as indicating a line of inheritance from the devisee, or merely as a description of the persons to take from her, the testatrix? In other words, Did she intend an indefinite failure of issue? Again, in this connection, Did she contemplate and intend to provide for the event of her children dying after her, without leaving any issue surviving them at the time of their death, or did she merely intend to provide for the contingency of their death in her own lifetime?</p>

However, as said before, an analysis of the will shows that, by “so much of [her] estate as may then [on the death without issue of all her children] remain,” she had in mind simply so much of her property as at that time had not been exhausted <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>through loans negotiated thereon by her children, under the power to encumber given to them in the sixth item of the will.</p>

No such unreasonable construction should be placed on the will unless the language employed plainly shows it to be the intent of the testatrix; and, as before stated, when the writing is taken as a whole, we do not so understand it. As we read the words of the will, it sufficiently appears testatrix purposed that none of her children should take more than a life interest in any of the property left by <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>her, and she never intended to constitute them or any of them a source of inheritable succession; this, in all probability, was to prevent, so far as she could, her estate from going to others than those of her own blood.</p>

Some of the original executors might have found it necessary to exercise this latter power, in case any one of them had died leaving issue; or the successors of such executors might need to use it, in order to make ultimate distribution of the principal among those entitled, in the event of the death of all the original devisees without issue. Again, it is to be observed that the so-called power to consume, given by the sixth item of the will, is only by way of putting encumbrances on the real estate, thereby reducing its worth to the ultimate takers, but still leaving the property itself subject to the original limitations for its devolution marked out by the testatrix ; in other words, a legal right to destroy the ultimate limitation over is not placed within the power of the first taker. All of which reaffirms our conclusion that the intent of the testatrix was to give her children life interests only, with authority to raise money for their support, if necessary, by borrowing on the real estate, and that this was arranged with the evident purpose of doing justice to testatrix’s children, and, at the same time, carrying out her paramount intent to prevent the property disposed of by the will from going to others than those of her own blood, so far as she could attain that end. This latter purpose is shown by the whole scheme of the writing, and the idea is reinforced by the second item, in reference to the family cemetery lot, where testatrix particularly excludes the right of burial to children of any <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>subsequent marriages which, her son-in-law or daughter-in-law might make.</p>

After all is said, we must come back to the thought that the main points here involved are, whether or not testatrix meant a definite or indefinite failure of issue, and, hence, whether or not the rule in Shelley's Case applies. It merely remains for us to refer to a few general principles which seem particularly pertinent.</p>
    <p id="b566-6" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[294,957,1161,1069]]]'>The rule of construction, — whereby a devisee over, in event of the death of the first taker, is generally understood to mean death occurring in the lifetime of the testator, — applies only when the will itself shows no other period to which the words may, on a proper interpretation, be referred; and the rule is never applied “where the first takers referred to are treated as living at a period subsequent to the death of testator”: Stoner v. Wunderlich, <a href="/pa/198/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="198 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="920291" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0158-01">198 Pa. 158</a>, 164. Here the whole will shows a contemplation by the testatrix that her children would survive her. The sixth item clearly refers to and treats them as living subsequent to the death of the testatrix, and authorizes them to borrow money on their shares of her estate, if necessary for their respective maintenance and support: therein testatrix particularly says, as to these possible loans, it'is her intention “to provide for the comfortable maintenance and support” of her children, adding, “even though it should exhaust the whole of their respective estates and leave nothing for the remainder-men.”</p>
    <p id="b566-7" data-blocks='[["BL_566.6",566,[293,2048,1156,320]],["BL_567.1",567,[166,326,1151,422]]]'>There is another relevant rule: When a testator makes limitations over to survivors, after the death without issue of the first taker, and names as remaindermen persons in being, a strong presumption is raised that an indefinite failure of issue is not contemplated (Stoner v. Wunderlich, <a href="/pa/198/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="198 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="920291" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0158-01">198 Pa. 158</a>, 163), and this is strengthened <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>when the limitation over is of but a life estate (Id. 162). In tbe present instrument, tbe first limitation over, on default of issue, is to persons in being, namely, surviving brothers and sisters of the respective devisees, and, as before shown, these surviving brothers and sisters take but a life estate; all of which strongly indicates that testatrix intended a definite and not an indefinite failure of issue.</p>

Good, <a href="/pa/245/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="245 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="326013" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0383-01">245 Pa. 383</a>, 386); this is relevant here.</p>
