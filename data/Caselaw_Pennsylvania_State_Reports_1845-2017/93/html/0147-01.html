    <p id="AJK" data-blocks='[["BL_148.6",148,[269,767,1169,445]]]'>Before the Act of February 2d 1854, Pamph. L. 45, commonly called the Consolidation Act, a system had been established in the county of Philadelphia which conferred on the guardians of the poor the primary power to provide for the maintenance of the poor in the almshouse. This power was exercisable upon their own discretion. Although in the city and districts, as the same existed before 1854, there were boards of commissioners and of councils with powers to assess and levy taxes and appropriate moneys, yet the expense incurred in the maintenance of the poor was paramount ¡to the discretion of such city and districts. It is believed that it has not been changed by any subsequent legislation.</p>

    <p id="b148-8" data-blocks='[["BL_148.8",148,[269,1373,1170,554]]]'>Does the 5th section of “A further supplement to the Act incorporating the City of Philadelphia,” approved April 21st 1858, Pamph. L. 386, change this? It is suggested that the true interjDretation of this statute is that a debt incurred for purposes municipal in its nature, and by officers subject as such to municipal regulation and control are alone meant. The support of the poor is not a municipal duty. It has never been imposed upon them. The duty is imposed by the Commonwealth, and the expense thereof, though a debt, may be collected adversely: Smith <em>v. </em>City, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Phila.%201" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Phila. 1">5 Phila. 1</a> ; City <em>v. </em>Dyer, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20468" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Wright 468">5 Wright 468</a>; Smedley <em>v. </em>Irwin, 1 P.

It is also true that a supplement thereto passed 1st April 1805, declared that all money, levied, assessed and collected for the use of the poor of the city should be under the control and superintendence of the board of guardians. The Consolidation Act of 1854, did not substantially lessen the power of the guardians of the poor in that respect, but it did take from that body its distinct corporate existence, and made it a department of the city. The Act of 21st April 1858, expressly declares “ that no debt or contract thereafter incurred shall be binding upon the city of Philadelphia, unless authorized by law or ordinance, and an appropriation sufficient to pay the same be previously made by councils.” The judgment of the court below is fully sustained by this act, and numerous decisions: City of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Flanigen, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%2021" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="11 Wright 21">11 Wright 21</a>; Same <em>v. </em>Johnson, Id. 382; Bladen <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 10 P.
