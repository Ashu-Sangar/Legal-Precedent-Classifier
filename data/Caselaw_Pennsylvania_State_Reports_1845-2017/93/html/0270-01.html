Dierkes to provide for the support of his mother. Caroline A. Cropley, the daughter of Rosanna Dierkes, made application to the solicitor representing the Guardians of the Poor for a citation, stating that she was unable to alone provide for the support of her mother, who was poor, old and unable to work. The citation was issued, based upon the affidavit, served upon Frank J. Dierkes, the appellant, who, on the 8th of September 1877, appeared in the Court of-Quarter Sessions before Briggs, J., when, after the case was heard, an order was made upon the said Dierkes to pay the sum of §3 per week for the support of his mother, Rosanna Dierkes, and to give security in the sum of §300, pay the costs and stand committed until the order should be complied with. Subsequently, a rule was granted to show cause why the amount should not be reduced, and, after a hearing was had, the court <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>reduced it to §1.50 per week. The said Dierkes, however, not complying with the order of the court, the said Caroline A. Cropley again appeared before the solicitor, and made affidavit to the fact of non-compliance, and upon this affidavit the court ordered the issuance of an attachment for his arrest. Dierkes then took this writ of certiorari, alleging that the court erred in their order and in the issuing of the attachment.</p>

After a hearing the court made an order “that the defendant, Erank J. Dierkes, pay the sum of three dollars per week for the support of his mother Rosanna, and the further sum of-dollars for each of his minor children, from the 8th of September 1877, and give security in the sum of $300 for the faithful performance of this order, pay the costs, and stand committed until the order be complied with.”</p>
    <p id="b272-18" data-blocks='[["BL_272.8",272,[242,892,1168,645]]]'>This order was assigned for error. The 28th section of the Act of 13th June 1836, Pamph. L. 547, under which it is said the order was made, does not justify it. Said section provides that in such cases the defendant shall comply with the order of the court “ on pain of forfeiting a sum not exceeding twenty dollars for every month they shall fail therein, which shall be levied by the process of the said court, and applied to the relief and maintenance o.f such poor person.” The act does not authorize the court to require security, much less to commit the defendant for a non-compliance with its order. Nor can the power to commit for contempt in not obeying the order be implied in view of the penalty expressly imposed. That penalty is $20 per month which “shall be levied by the <em>process </em>of the said court.” The error was doubtless caused by the carelessness of a clerk in making out the order, as the blank used was intended for desertion cases in which the law is different, and the form in question the proper one.</p>
