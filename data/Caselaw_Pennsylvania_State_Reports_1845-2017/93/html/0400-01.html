In 1874 the city of Reading, which is situated on one of the tributaries of the stream from which the. ditch is supplied, diverted the water from this tributary for the use of the city. In an action by A. for damages, <em>Held, </em>that the action would lie under the Act of April 14th 1853. <em>Held, further, </em>that section 8, article 16, of the new constitution protects such an owner, as that section provides for the making of compensation not only for the taking of private property for public use, as was the case theretofore, but also for its injury or destruction.</p>

Prior to this time the city had purchased a tract of land, known as Ohlinger’s Mill, through which the Ohlinger stream flowed. In 1872, the city councils passed the necessary legislation to authorize the water department to bring in the waters of the Ohlinger creek from a point on the city tract, near the Ohlinger mill, to the city reservoir. A dam was built and pipes laid from it to the reservoir, and in July 1874, the water was diverted from the stream. William Althouse owns a farm in Exeter township, some five miles from the point of diversion. He claimed damages for the loss of water used in irrigating <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>his meadows. This water does not flow into his land through its natural channel, but is diverted from its natural channel into an artificial irrigating ditch at a point on the stream about four miles from the city dam and one mile above plaintiff’s farm. This ditch irrigates the lands of a number of persons, and existed in 1769. It was not known when it was made. It was used for the purpose of irrigating the lands of Mordecai Lincoln. The water was derived from the Antietam creek. Lincoln devised those lands, having previously divided them, and assigned to each its proportion of the water, to be used for irrigation, and arranged that each portion should have a certain period of time in which to use the water. Althouse derived title from Lincoln, with the right thus to use the water from the ditch. The Ohlinger c reck is a tributary of Antietam creek.</p>

The determinative question then is, did this stream of water, or what is the same, the water of this stream called Ohlinger, or any material part of it, before it was diverted by the city of Reading, flow through the plaintiff’s land ? The channel may be called what you please: Antietam creek or Lincoln’s ditch — that is of no consequence ; was the water formerly wont to flow through the Althouse property ? If so, ho had property in it; a right to it which is protected by the act. Tho counsel for the defendant scorns to think that the provisions of the act extend but to the owners of the natural bed and banks of the stream, but this is a construction warranted neither by the letter nor spirit of the statute. Who would doubt the application of the act were this ditch a natural branch, division of, or outflow of the main stream ? But what radical difference is made by the fact, that man dug the present channel instead of nature ? And how can this affect vested rights, rights now more than a century old ? In the submission executed by the two Lincolns and Michael Seyster, one hundred and eleven years ago, this ditch is spoken of as an existing race or watercourse; but who dug it, or how long it existed before that time, is not mentioned, and no one now knows. Its origin is literally buried in the shades of the past, hence, for all practical purposes it is a natural watercourse; prescriptively and, therefore, legally it is so. The right to it could be no better were it natural. As was said by Chief Justice Gibson, in Seibert <em>v. </em>Levan, 8 Barr 383, <em>“ </em>Whilst the grantor was lord of tho whole, he might assign a permanent channel to the stream, and as regards himself and those who claim under him, impress it with any character he should see proper. There is no particular sanctity in the natural bed of a stream, which is perpetually changing its course from accidental causes.” And in speaking of tho rule that water shall flow <em>ubi aurrere solebat et consuevit, </em>he says, it applies rather to the duty of returning it, than to the channel through which it flows. And so in Sutclife <em>v. </em>Booth, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20Law%20J.%20Q.B.%20136" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="32 Law J. Q.B. 136">32 L. J., Q.
