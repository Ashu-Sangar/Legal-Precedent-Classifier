It also shows that an interview had taken place, in which the subject of a reconciliation had been discussed. Her desire for a reunion is very apparent, and there is an entire change from the desire for a separation shown in the letter of September 7th. Upon October 17th, he writes to her requesting hor to come down to join in a deed, and expresses his intention, if her father and mother are willing, to accompany her to hor home in Elemington, N. J. On December 14th, he writes her, acknowledging the receipt of a letter dated the 8th, which said that she expected him to spend Christmas with hor at her home in Flemingfon. He answers that he cannot promise, but that he will be glad to do so. It is clear from these letters that a reconciliation had taken place, but they do not show an actual reunion, although it is clear that the woman who wrote the letter of September 27th 1863, would have followed him to the end of the world if he had wished it. Why she did not do it we cannot exactly see, until his letter of February 18th 1864, is read. In it he acknowledges the receipt of hers of the 13th, and says: ‘As to our domestic difficulties I have nothing new to say, excepting, perhaps, that I do not think I can in justice ask you to leave your father and mother <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>again for me. I am sorry to say so, but I cannot help it.’ Upon the argument much was made of her letter of February 24th, which was in answer to this. The wonder is that she did not say more. All that she did say was justified by what he had said. She truly says, that if he earnestly desired a reunion, as he said, he would not let father nor mother nor anything else on earth stand in the way. From this time forth it cannot be said that there was wilful and malicious desertion on the part of this wife.</p>

The letter of October 11th does not in its heading indicate the year distinctly, but its substance shows it to bo subsequent to that of October 6th, and that it is one of this series of letters. In that of October 6th, he says that he went to Flemington on Monday to see if she would come to him, that she did not seem able to make up her mind, that her father had said that if she left, he and his wife would break up and board, that he did not want this done, and had concluded, as <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>soon as he could, to sell out in Philadelphia, to go to Flomington, buy her father’s house, so that all could live together. After much more, he closes thus: ‘You must be your own judge whether you come on Monday or not; the number is 1245 North Eleventh street.’ He adds, in a postscript, that the reason he speaks of going to Flemington and buying her father’s house, is that she suggested it on Tuesday night. In the letter of October 11th he addresses her as ‘ My dear wife,’ in all others as ‘ My dear Sarah,’ or ‘ Dear Sarah.’ He speaks of his disappointment in having received a letter from her instead of seeing her. Then says that he has never been so miserable and unhappy since their separation, as he has been since her father said if she left, he and her mother would break up and board. This fixes the letter as having been written in 1865, subsequent to the conversation detailed in his letter of October 6th. The rest of this long letter is full of consideration of her duty to her aged parents, and seems to concede that her prior duty is to them ; but its unhappy tone would bring a true woman to her husband if she loved him at all. Upon October 19th, he writes that he has told his servant that he will keep house no longer with her. He also says that he will not give the person who wishes his house a decided answer, for in his own words, ‘ I would like to know if you are still of the opinion that you would be willing to come and give it a trial of being alone in the house during the day before you bring all your goods.’</p>

The evidence of several witnesses also establish the fact that Mr. Peterson always spoke’of the petitioner as his wife, and that this continued up to his death. They separated in 1867, and met but once afterward. On November 4th 1865, he made a deed in which she joined as his wife.</p>

There is nothing in the correspondence to show that he was not acting in good faith. His anxiety for their welfare seems entirely sincere. He obtained, however, divorce, and must have known it; he certainly remembered it, since after the final separation he passed titles without her joining. Before the divorce, whilst they were separated, he had her to join in his deeds. We hardly think that he intended to perpetrate the great outrage that was done to his wife.

Here there was no subsequent marriage, and the offer of the petitioner, made in open court, to release her interest in all properties conveyed by her husband without her joining, relieves it of all solicitude for purchasers, whether for value or not.

The grounds of divorce there were desertion. The depositions taken on behalf of the petitioner showed, as they do hero, that there was no wilful and malicious desertion. Here in addition, we have the resumption of the marital relation. It was argued here, that in that case the year for an appeal had not elapsed, but that does not appear to have been considered material by the Supreme Court in that case, nor in the earlier case of Allen <em>v. </em>McClellan, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%20328" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Jones 328">2 Jones 328</a>.

Ordinarily knowledge or notice of any kind, ought to conclude parties after decree. But even if it is granted that she had actual knowledge, we think there was enough in this case to convince her that the proceedings had been abandoned. From his letters we find he made her several visits in 1865, and at least two other visits in that year are established by oral testimony. Both before and after the divorce his visits were those of a man to his wife. How complete their reconciliation was at this time, before the divorce, is shown in that soon afterwards she left her parents to go to him, notwithstanding his recognition of their groat need of her, and his almost persuasion of her to remain with them. What else could she think but that all their difficulties were at an end. There is no evidence or pretence that she knew more of the divorce than is contained in the correspondence. In the light of his intercourse with her, his frequent visits, their reunion and living together as man and wife, we must say that we believe that he led her to believe that the divorce suit, if she over knew of it, had been utterly abandoned, and that the decree obtained was a fraud upon her.</p>

He who comes into equity must come with clean hands. Did the petitioner fulfil this requirement ? The basis and foundation of her case is stated in her petition to be her entire ignorance that proceedings in divorce had ever been commenced by her husband. On this vital point she is contradicted by her own letters.</p>
    <p id="b250-6" data-blocks='[["BL_250.6",250,[254,745,1166,450]]]'>The application to vacate the decree was too late. There is no authority to vacate a decree of divorce after such a lapse of time. The application to set aside the divorce resolves itself into a question of distribution of the libellant’s estate after his death. In such litigation it would be inequitable to wrest from his heirs and personal representatives an inheritance cast upon them by the law, solely to give it to a woman from whom he had been legally divorced ; who had, while her husband was alive, acquiesced in it for over twelve years, and who did not present her petition to set the decree aside until nearly three months after the libellant’s death : Singer <em>v. </em>Singer, <a href="/barb/41/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="41 Barb. 139" data-case-ids="5109949" data-case-paths="/barb/41/0139-01">41 Barb. 139</a>.</p>

Fraud vitiates everything it touches, and time is not an element in this case. All the testimony shows conclusively that appellee did not know of the divorce, and none of her letters disclose the fact of knowledge. The court will set aside a decree of divorce even where one of the parties is dead, where fraud has been practised: Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, 3 Phila.
