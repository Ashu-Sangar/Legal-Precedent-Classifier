H. Corbin to lay the bricks in the erection of certain houses, for which he was to be paid partly in cash and partly with one of the houses to be erected. On May 22d 1877, II. II. Corbin assigned all his interest as builder to 13. R. Corbin, who thereupon assumed the liabilities of H. H. Corbin under the aforesaid contract with Moore. That on January 29th 1878, W. J. Moore having completed his contract, demanded from I). R. Corbin a conveyance of the house and lot agreed to be conveyed to him, and that the conveyance should be made to Henry Moore, to whom William J. Moore had transferred his interest for a valuable consideration. That on the 29th of January 1878, a deed was executed by D. R. Corbin to Henry Moore, but inasmuch as there was a dispute about an item alleged to be still due under the contract, the deed was delivered to a third party to he held in escrow until said dispute was settled. That before said settlement, and while said deed was still held in escrow, one William H. Taylor recovered a judgment in Court of Common Pleas, No. 2, of Philadelphia county, against said 13. R. Corbin, and that in pursuance thereof a vend. ex. had issued at the suit of said Taylor, and the lot of ground was advertised to be sold by the sheriff on tlie first Monday of October 1878, as the property of said D. R. Corbin. That upon the settlement of the disputed item on the 14th of August 1878, the deed was released from escrow and delivered to Henry Moore, and that on the succeeding day it was duly recorded. That the said deed of Donald R. Corbin vested in complainant a good title, in fee simple, free and clear of all debts of said Donald R. Corbin, not then (to wit, on January 29th <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>1878), of record; for the reason that the equitable title to said premises was vested in said William J. Moore, from the time of his selection of the said real estate, to wit: at and from the date of his said contract with said Corbin, in May 1877, and also for the further reason, that the full consideration for said premises had been fully paid by said William J. Moore, prior to the said 29th day of January 1878, by work done by him under his said contract. That great and irremediable injury will result to, and be inflicted upon complainant, and the title to his property become clouded and unmarketable, if Taylor is permitted to proceed, and said sheriff is allowed to sell said real estate, as he advertises he will do. That the said defendant Taylor, well knowing of complainant’s title, as hereinabove set forth, and that the said Donald R. Corbin has had no interest whatever in or to said property since the 29th day of January 1878, has caused said real estate to be levied upon and condemned, and to be exposed for sale as aforesaid, with the express intention and purpose of compelling complainant to pay him, said Taylor, the judgment-debt of $110.36 due to him by said Donald R. Corbin, to avoid litigation, and save the title to complainant’s said property from becoming clouded and unmarketable.</p>

The appellant, in his affidavit or answer as it is termed, positively denies that he knew anything about plaintiff’s title, as set forth in the bill; and avers, that he believed then and believes now, that Corbin had an interest in the property levied on at the time the judgment was obtained. He also denies that he is <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>proceeding to sell “with the express intention and purpose,” charged in the ninth paragraph of the bill. The bill itself discloses the fact that, at the date of the judgment against Corbin, he claimed an interest in the lot to the extent of a part of the consideration therefor, which ho alleged had never been fully paid. If he was correct in this, the appellant had a right tó subject that interest, whatever it might be, to the payment of his judgment, by levying on and selling the same as the property of Corbin. It is alleged, however, in the bill, that the price of the lot had been fully earned before the judgment, was obtained, but this is not admitted. On the contrary, it is impliedly denied in appellant’s affidavit.</p>

Whenever such interest is alleged, the creditor is permitted to proceed with his execution; and if there be any question in regard to title, it may be raised and determined afterwards in an action of ejectment. The reason why the creditors’ execution will not be enjoined in such cases is, that to do so, would in effect withdraw, from the consideration of a jury facts which properly should be decided by them. In cases of disputed title to personal property, taken in execution, our interpleader act provides a special mode of proceeding, in which conflicting claims of ownership may be determined, if the sheriff or other officer charged with the execution of the writ sees fit to avail himself of the protection afforded by the act.</p>

This fact was a controlling element in the case. In Winch’s Appeal, supra, where the title of the wife was disputed, the court refused to restrain the creditor from proceeding with his execution against the alleged interest of the husband and thus preparing the way to test the title, if it became necessary. A somewhat similar principle was recognised in Reeser <em>v. </em>Johnson, 26 P. F. Smith 313.</p>
