B. was to keep certain pipes in repair and C. others, and B. was to see that the covenants made by A. should be kept. In a suit by G. against B. for breach of covenant, the court instructed the jury that B. was bound to supply water, whether the spring from which it was drawn kept up or not. <em>Held, </em>that this was error; that although the water of the spring had always been the source of supply of the house, yet if it failed from drought or other natural cause, it was no breach of any covenant express or implied for its supply.</p>

Ward and John O. Ward entered into an agreement whereby the former was “ to furnish and supply the Ward House, in Towanda borough (owned by John O. Ward), with spring water, so long as the said John O. Ward, his heirs or assigns, may desire to have the same furnished and supplied, said water to he conveyed and supplied <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>■with the same, and by and through the same pipes and faucets •which are now used for the same purpose, or by and through other pipes and faucets of the same dimensions.” Under this agreement John O. Ward agreed to keep in repair the pipes and faucets on his own premises, and O. L. Ward agreed to keep in repair the remainder. On July 6th 1871, a lease of the Ward House by John O. Ward was made to Koon &amp; Means, and was subsequently, in July 1874, assigned to J. O. Vance, the plaintiff.</p>

L. Ward in his agreement” * * * “ are kept by the heirs of C. L. Ward.” Vance took possession May 11th 1874, some little time previous to the formal assignment of the lease. The spring from which the' water was conveyed, as mentioned in the agreement between O. L. Ward and John O. Ward, was a half or three-quarters of a mile out of town, and had been the only regular source of supply of water to the house since the same was built. The claim of Vance for an insufficient supply of water arose in part from the fact that he had put water-closets in the house to the number of five, and had connected them with the water-pipes.</p>

    <p id="b501-10" data-blocks='[["BL_501.15",501,[226,1557,1167,283]]]'>But one question is presented: If the spring water which was supplied in the summer of 1871 was then sufficient for the use of the house, was Ward bound to keep up a supply equal to that whether the spring kept up or not ? The court charged that he was so bound, “ because Mr. Ward agreed to supply the house with spring water under that certain agreement between John O. Ward and O. L. Ward, dated January 19th 1866.”</p>

That such was the chief point respecting the water supply, is apparent in the testimony, yet there is evidence to which the instruction' complained of is applicable. Mr.Vance testifies : “ May 11th 1874, 1 went into possession. A very few days after, cleaned out the reservoir; it was quite a dry time, and Í had to draw water continually. Probably would not have had to draw water so quick, if it had not been for cleaning the reservoir.” Hence it cannot bo said, that if the instruction was erroneous it worked no injury to <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>the defendant. It enabled the jury to include damages when there was a deficiency by reason of failure in the spring.</p>
    <p id="b502-6" data-blocks='[["BL_502.4",502,[264,476,1171,807]]]'>The lessor covenanted that the house should be supplied with spring water in the same manner as then supplied under his agreement with C. L. Ward, the lessee to keep the pipes in repair inside the house, and the lessor those outside. He also agreed “ that the covenants made by C. L. Ward, in his agreement of January 19th 1866, should be kept. Here is an express stipulation in reference to water supply by the pipes then laid from the house to the spring, and in operation, and that the lessee should have its use during the term, “ to be furnished and supplied with the same, and by and through the same pipes and faucets which are now used for said purpose, or by and through other pipes and faucets of the same dimensions.” If the water failed because of drought, or other natural cause, which neither party could prevent, it was no breach of any covenant, express or implied, for its supply. The lessor did not undertake to lay pipes to other fountains, or furnish water in any other way than as supplied at the time of making the contract. He did not agree to furnish water in caso drought dried that spring. We are of opinion it was error to instruct the jury that he was bound to supply water, equal to the supply in 1871, whether the spring kept up or not.</p>
