The language is, that the secretary may sell. It simply permits him to make the sale with the assent of the legal representatives of the deceased member. The preceding part of the section requires a member, when he wishes to sell his seat, to submit the name of the proposed purchasers to a committee, and the transfer shall be made on the approval of two-thirds of the committee ; but when death occurs, the secretary may, without reference to a committee, on the request of the representatives of the deceased member, sell the seat.

His contention is that he was the equitable owner of the seat, and had title to what was received for it, and that the defendant had no right to apply the proceeds to debts due by Richards to other members, in pursuance of the terms of the constitution of the club. But why not ? Richards was the member of the board, the legal owner of the seat, and the plaintiff an entire stranger, unknown to the association. The members gave credit to each other in part, no doubt, upon the faith of the liability of a member’s seat to them for his debts. There is nothing unlawful or unreasonable in this regulation. The seat is not property in the eye of the law, it could not be seized in execution for the debts of the members. It is the mere creation of the board, and, of course, was to be held and enjoyed with all the limitations and restrictions which the constitution of the board chose to put upon it. Judgment affirmed.</p>
