      <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>At the trial, the plaintiff offered in evidence the Act of April 3d 1873, Parnph. L. 504, under the provisions of which the paving was done and the claim filed. In filing the claim the directions of the act were followed, and the charges were made therein in accordance with a foot frontage assessment. The defendants gave evidence to show that the materials used in the paving were not of a good character. One point of defence was, that the rubble-stone laid was not good. The plaintiffs, in rebuttal, offered in evidence a stone of which a witness said:. “ This is a sample of stone which is put in the street; it is exactly like those put down — is a fair specimen of them — and came from the quarry. It’s the same stone.” This was rejected, on the ground that it did not come out of the street itself. The defendants also gave evidence to show that the property which it was proposed to charge was rural property, and consisted of farm land.</p>

It is for you to say how far the absence of such testimony has a tendency to corroborate his side of the case. * * * It is a principle of law that, if a party fails or neglects to produce witnesses or samples which were in his power, the witnesses or samples would, if produced, have been against him. * * * Two or three years ago, the question in this case came up before the Supreme Court, and it said: ‘ You have no right to pass Acts of Assembly directing the paving of the streets, and directing that it shall be paid for by the frontage of that street, at the rate calculated upon the frontage of the street.’ This being the law, it becomes an important question for you to determine whether this lot was rural, suburban, or used for agricultural and grazing purposes. * * * Of course, it is something when the owner of a large lot of land like this shows that it had not been used for any other purpose than farm land, and that he has kept it in the character of a farm against all its surroundings. In addition, you are shown that the locality from Forty-second to Fifty-sixth street was unimproved land; that at that time there were fourteen squares on one of the most important streets, one of the most valuable streets in the city, unimproved. * * * Then the question you are to determine is, whether it is rural, suburban, or agricultural land. That you must ascertain from the uses to which it has been put. It has been uninterruptedly used for farming. This is corroborated by the assessor whom the city has appointed to investigate the character of the land for the purposes of <em>assessment; </em>and he tells you it is farm land.</p>

In ordinary cases the judgment of the authority imposing the special tax, under sanction of law, is relied on ; and the courts will sustain a charge thus made, if apparently made in the exercise of a sound discretion. The courts will, in such cases, assume, in favor of the legislature, that the special tax does actually represent an equivalent, and no more, of the special benefit: Stroud <em>v. </em>City, 11 P. F.

He swore that it was exactly like those put into the street; that it came from the same quarry and was the same stone. It was of the general character of the material used that the jury was to judge, and for this purpose a sample of the rock from which it was taken was just as good, if not better, than a block taken from the pavement. <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>Furthermore, it was error to tell the jury that the plaintiff might have produced specimens of the stone taken from the street, and that its not having done so was a circumstance that might weigh against it. The city had a right to rely upon evidence of the general character of the material as it appeared in the road-bed, and upon proof of the proper execution of the work, and that it did not have the stones dug up and produced in court was not a circumstance from which unfavorable inferences might be drawn. Certainly a mechanic or contractor is not obliged to tear up his finished work in order to present samples to a jury; such a rule as this would not only be novel and unreasonable, but often impossible.</p>

At the time of this street paving there were but about twenty-five houses between Forty-second and Fifty-sixth streets, and but three west of Forty-sixth, whilst immediately south and west of the property of the defendant the country was wholly occupied for farming and grazing.</p>
    <p id="b18-7" data-blocks='[["BL_18.5",18,[292,1390,1163,315]]]'>This completely rural character of the territory, in which the defendant’s lot is situated, protects it from the frontage rule of taxation. A rule of this kind, as applied to country property, is unequal, unjust and unconstitutional; and in thus saying we but repeat what has been said over and over again, in a long series of cases, commencing with the Washington Avenue Case, 19 P. F. Smith 852, and ending with Craig <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, 8 Norris 268.</p>
