Wood and others, who were judgment-creditors, objected on the ground, that said judgment contained usurious interest, but the auditor ordered it to be paid. Wood et ah, then filed an affidavit which set forth, that on the 6th of August 1870, M. W. Wheelock loaned to Cash, the defendant, §3000, and took the latter’s note therefor, which was entered up August 9th 1870 ; that Cash made payments to Whee-lock on said judgment up to August 6th 1873; that on the 10th of May 1875, Cash and H. L. Scott (who was a creditor and trustee of said Cash’s estate under a voluntary assignment for benefit of creditors) entered into an amicable revival of the above judgment with Wheelock for the sum of §3700, without any notice to petitioners ; the said note was not paid, but the amount of it was included in the above revived judgment. And petitioners aver, that on the said 10th of May 1875, there <em>was </em>but §2881.15 legally due upon said judgment; and that the same was revived for the sum of §818.85, more than it ought to have been; and that said revival is a fraud upon the rights of your petitioners, and that said revived judgment is void as to them. That at the time said Cash and Wheelock revived said judgment, they both well knew that the said Cash was insolvent; and that the revival of said judgment for more than was due, would hinder, delay and prevent your petitioners <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>from the collection of their judgment against said Cash. That petitioners were purchasers of the real estate which raised the fund for distribution, and claim, that said fund should be distributed to the payment of their several judgments, in preference to that of Wheelock; and, therefore, prayed that an issue should be directed to try the disputed facts.</p>

It was there held that the mere fact that a debtor has paid or agreed to pay in good faith, and in the usual course of business, more than six per cent, interest, is not enough to establish a fraud upon' creditors, and that the mere refusal of the debtor to contest the claim against him does not of itself amount to such fraud; and that it is only where an usurious contract is entered into collusively as a scheme to hinder and delay creditors that the latter have any standing to contest a judgment entered upon such usurious contract. The case referred to had not been decided when the case in hand was tried in the court below. Had it been the rulings of the learned judge would have been different, as the application of the principles announced in 4 Norris, makes an end of this case. There is nothing in it to show fraud and collusion in fact. No such fraud is even averred in the affidavit upon which the feigned issue was granted. It is not denied that when Cash gave the judgment-note of $3000 to Wheelock in 1870, and agreed to pay thereon interest at the rate of ten per centum, he was perfectly solvent. His insolvency occurred about the time of the revival of the judgment in 1875. <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>And even then there is no evidence that Wheelock knew of his insolvency. On the contrary, he swears that he believed he had abundant means to pay his debts at the time. The including of the §700 of extra interest, was in pursuance of the contract of the parties made in good faith years before. It contained no element of a collusive fraud, a fraud in fact to hinder and delay the creditors of Cash. There was error in awarding the feigned issue. The affidavit did not set out such facts as to justify it. There was also error in the portions of the charge contained in the fourth and fifth specifications. The defendant’s second point (seventh specification), should have been affirmed without qualification.</p>

This writ of error, however, was taken out by the plaintiff's below, who obtained a verdict in their favor to the extent of the usurious interest included in the revival of the judgment in Wheelock <em>v. </em>Cash. The effect of the verdict is to postpone said judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for the excess of interest only. The plaintiff’s contended and asked the court to instruct the jury that if the Wheelock judgment was tainted with fraud at all, it affected the entire judgment, and that the whole of it must be postponed. As the charge of the court was more favorable to the plaintiffs than they were entitled to, the judgment upon this writ of error must bo affirmed.</p>
