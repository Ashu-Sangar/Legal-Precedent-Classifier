It was also shown that the second mortgage was recorded and became a lien on the property before judgment was obtained on the first mortgage. The auditor says in his report: ‘ There can be no doubt that the case of Greene <em>v. </em>Tyler, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20361" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Wright 361">3 Wright 361</a>, expressly rules this question, unless it is overruled by subsequent decisions.’ In this we agree with him; but differ from him in thinking that it is overruled by any of the subsequent cases.

Smith 309, which vras principally relied on by the auditor, was the case of a purchaser questioning an usurious judgment. Mercur, J., expressly distinguishes that case from Greene <em>v. </em>Tyler, by saying that the lien of the second mortgage in Greene <em>v. </em>Tyler, attached before judgment was confessed on the first mortgage. In that respect Greene <em>v. </em>Tyler, and this case, are alike, with this difference, that in Greene <em>v. </em>Tyler judgment was confessed, and in this case judgment was upon two <em>nihils </em>for want of an appearance. Whatever rights the second mortgage-creditor had, had attached before the judgment on the first mortgage. Besides, an action on a mortgage is a proceeding <em>in rem; </em>and any one interested in the mortgaged premises, has a right to intervene <em>pro interesse suo, </em>with the same effect, and, in some <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>instances, with greater effect than the mortgagor, because he might be estopped by previous acts or declarations.

If a mortgagee may have an issue, what fact is more fit for him to allege, than, that the prior mortgage was usurious. Usurious contracts are not absolutely void; they are voidable only for the excess as between the immediate parties ; that is, for the excess over the principal and six por cent, interest. But if the debtor will not insist on his rights, or will combine with his creditors to give him a judgment for more than his just dues, it cannot he said that a subsequent mortgagee, whose lien attached before the judgment was confessed, is concluded by the debtor’s act: Greene <em>v. </em>Tyler, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20361" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Wright 361">3 Wright 361</a> ; Bachdell’s Appeal, 6 P.

That there is no allegation of fraud, and the only objection to Lennig’s judgment is, “ that there had been what is known as a bonus mortgage at the rate of four per cent, discount.” Hence, the sole question is, Can a second mortgage-creditor, where there has been no fraud, defeat distribution to so much of the judgment obtained on the prior mortgage as might have been prevented against the mortgagee, had he set up a defence of usury in the consideration ? This the auditor denied, and was overruled by the court on the authority of Greene <em>v. </em>Tyler &amp; Co., <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20361" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Wright 361">3 Wright 361</a>. That case originated prior to the repeal of the Act of March 2d 1723, was a feigned issue, awarded for what was deemed good cause, for trial of facts in dispute, and it was decided that a subsequent mortgage-creditor could attack a judgment founded on a prior mortgage, on the ground of usury. The meagre report furnishes no facts except what are stated in the opinion, and that reveals that the mere fact that usurious interest was included in the mortgage and judgment was held a fraud as to creditors. It is said, <em>“ </em>If a mortgagee may have an issue, what fact is more fit for him to allege than that the prior mortgage was usurious — that all the money is not legally demand-able upon it which is nominated in the bond ?” “ When creditors claim equities through their debtors, they are usually estopped by what the debtors do; but fraud never estops creditors. What Greene alleges is a fraudulent setting up of the prior mortgage for more than is due upon it. Call it usury or what you will, it is an attempt, in his view of the case, to take away from his lien, by virtue of the prior mortgage, more money than the mortgagees in that mortgage have a right to take.” Treating such fact as a fraudulent collusion against subsequent lien creditors, by all authority, they could attack the judgment collaterally. But the law of usury is not the same now as then.</p>

Under that statute, the receipt of money on account of an usurious contract was a consummation of the offence, from the consequences of which the party could not relieve himself by a subsequent release of the excess which was usurious: Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>Houston, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 115" data-case-ids="1856277" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0115-01">4 W. &amp; S. 115</a>.

In distributions it often occurred that judgments were reduced because of usury, and, in some instances, with the apparent, if not real, sanction of this court, as in Bachdell’s Appeal, 6 P. F. Smith 386, where it was done before an auditor. The real ground of such procedure was the same as the footing of the decision in Greene <em>v. </em>Tyler &amp; Co., namely, the giving and receiving of usury is a fraud upon subsequent lien creditors, said taking being unlawful. As recent as Duquesne Bank’s Appeal, 24 P. F. Smith 426, the plaintiff in a judgment was enjoined from collecting any part thereof, until he entered credit for the amount of usury therein, this court saying: “ The defence is one under a statute which lays its hands upon the usury as an illegal act; contrary therefore to equity also; and it becomes the duty of all courts to maintain the law.” Still later decisions, however, have settled “ that the more fact that a debtor has paid or agreed to pay in good faith, and in the usual course of business, more than six per cent, interest, is not enough to establish a fraud upon creditors, and that the mere refusal' of a debtor to contest the claim against him does not of itself amount to such fraud; and that it is only when an usurious contract is entered into collusively as a scheme to hinder and delay creditors, that the latter have any standing to contest a judgment entered upon such usurious contract:” Wheelock <em>v. </em>Wood, ante, p. 298. Referring to Greene <em>v. </em>Tyler &amp; Co. and Bachdell’s Appeal, the court say: “At that time the taking of more than six per cent, interest was unlawful, and subjected the lender to a penalty. It is not so now. The Act of 28th May 1858 has made a radical change in this respect.” “ It is not, therefore, now unlawful for a debtor to pay and a creditor to receive more than six per cent.” “ A man who has, in good faith, contracted to pay more than six per cent., has committed no violation of any law, and is not bound to repudiate his contract:” Appeal of Second Nat.
