Miller &amp; Co., owed the plaintiffs $1428.11, partly on book account and partly on a note for $1000 maturing Hovember 29th 1875. The plaintiffs drew on Miller &amp; Co. for $428.11, the excess of their claim over the note, and the draft came back protested, whereupon the plaintiffs wrote to them, threatening legal proceedings. E. G. Miller &amp; Co. sent the plaintiffs’ letter to the defendant Dock, who was .a joint owner with E. G. Miller, one of the firm of Miller <em>&amp; </em>Co., and one Mitchell, of certain lumber lands on Lick Run, on which they carried on the lumber business in partnership. Dock, -with plaintiffs’ letter in his hands, went to their store, and, as they testified, though he in his evidence denied it, said that Miller had sent him the letter; that he, Dock, had come to intercede for them ; that they were “ in tight papers,” and he did not want them pushed ; that he had money or other property of theirs in his hands, and he would sell it and pay the plaintiffs; that he would not give his <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>own note, but his word was as good as his bond; that he would not fix a time for payment, which might be next week, or not for thirty or sixty days; that there was no danger of the property being taken out of his hands by other creditors, for he had it so fixed that that could not be done; that the plaintiffs wore secure, and he would see them paid. Upon this, as the plaintiffs testified, they agreed not to push Miller without notifying Dock, and made a memorandum to that effect on the protested draft. Dock sent Miller $1000 to take up his note for that amount to the plaintiffs, which matured on the 29th of November 1875, and Miller received it, but did not pay plaintiffs’ note, and absconded. Plaintiffs subsequently sued Miller &amp; Co. on their claims and got judgments.</p>

      <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>To make Dock liable on such a promise it was necessary to show first that there was sufficient property of the debtor in his hands; second, that as between him and the debtor, he assumed to pay the debt out of the property; and third, that he had promised the creditor to appropriate the money to his use. Neither of the first two of these essentials was shown. There was not a particle of testimony that this lumber or any property or money of Miller had ever been put in Dock’s hands as trustee to pay Boyd &amp; Co., or with a view to its application to their debt. At the date of his alleged promise, Dock, as one of the partners of the Lick Run lumber firm, happened to have in his hands some of its lumber, with the right as between him and his partners to sell it and keep the money for his own use — that is, to reimburse himself for advances made for his partners. The promise of Dock was without any consideration whatever.</p>
