On February 17th 1876, he left these certificates with P. S. Peterson, a broker in Philadelphia, with instructions to sell the stock if it reached $64 y-per share. Burton at the same time left with Peterson a blank power of attorney to sell, assign or transfer the stock, such as is usually given to brokers. The stock never reached the price fixed for its sale, and having declined, and there being no prospect of a sale, Burton called several times during the summer of 1876, and requested that the certificates and the blank power of attorney should be returned to him. He was informed on these several occasions that the stock was in the firm-box in the vault of the Fidelity Trust Company. It appeared, however, that Peterson had, on February 18th 1876, pledged the stock to the Girard Life Insurance Company for an advance made to him individually. The stock was still in possession of said Girard Insurance Company when Peterson died insolvent on January 8th 1877. The evidence was conflicting as to whether the stock was pledged by Peterson for a personal advance, or as collateral security for an antecedent debt.</p>

The case seemed to be clear to us, and we directed the witnesses to appear before the master and correct the mistake. This they subsequently did, and because it affects the plaintiff’s case objection is made to the course pursued. That ah application like the present one ought not to be favored is admitted, but that the power to refer exists and can at any time be exercised by the court cannot be denied. That any one may be satisfied of the entire correctness of the principle, let him examine the standard authorities, and we think he will be satisfied. The general rule undoubtedly is, that the testimony once closed shall not be again opened; but the exception is as well defined as the rule itself, and has been frequently acted upon by courts of equity.

In the case before us it appeared that two reputable witnesses made a clear mistake in a portion of their testimony. It was evident either that the witnesses had not understood an important question which had been propounded, or that the examiner had made a mis<a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>take in recording the evidence. We have no doubt now that the examiner did not fall into error, and we are as clear that, unless both the witnesses have sworn falsely, they could not have understood the question or questions propounded, and had the case gone on to a hearing, when first before this court, we would have been called upon to decide it upon testimony evidently untrue.</p>
