O., a widow, died in 1859, leaving three minor children and possessed of certain real and personal property. In her will she bequeathed certain legacies and annuities, and appointed. II. her executor and trustee. In 1863 II., as “ executor and trustee,” petitioned the Orphans’ Court, alleging that the personal estate was insufficient to pay the legacies and annuities, and that they were claimed to be a charge on the real estate. The court issued citations and a number of parties interested filed answers. No answer was filed for the minor children, but an appearance was entered of record by the counsel of their guardian, which counsel also argued the question for some of the annuitants. A decree was made in accordance with the petition, and the real and personal estate of the decedent in charge of the guardian was transferred to II., the executor. H. paid the legacies and annuities in full, the taxes, and also the income tax, out of the funds in his hands. When the eldest child attained her majority II. filed his account and the children of decedent excepted to all credits for expenses in the Orphans’ Court proceedings in 1863, on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction, and to the payments on account of income tax <em>Held, </em>that the court had jurisdiction, as making the executor a party did not avoid the proceeding for want of jurisdiction if the legatees were in point of fact parties. <em>Held, further, </em>that the income tax was properly paid by the executor and trustee.</p>

A number of parties interested filed answers, but it did not appear that any was filed on behalf of the minor children of Mrs. Cox, although the docket entries which were put in evidence at the audit showed the. following entry on the margin: “Gr. M. Wharton, attorney for James Markoe, guardian of Cox’s minors et al.” The proceeding appeared to have been amicable, although there was evidence that the question had been argued adversely on behalf of the minors by the same counsel who represented some of the legatees and annuitants. The matter was proceeded in to final decree on October 31st 1863, whereby the legacies and annuities were adjudged to be payable out of and chargeable upon the above estate, real and personal, and Mr. Markoe, the guardian of the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>minor children, was directed to pay over to Mr. Hewson, the executor, all the real and personal property of Mrs. Cox, the decedent, in his possession or control.

He paid the legacies and annuities in full, paid the taxes, including the income tax, and all the expenses, and accumulated a surplus. Upon Mrs. Neill attaining her majority he filed his first account, and at the audit thereof the children of Mrs. Cox objected to all credits for expenses in the Orphans’ Court in 1863, and for counsel fees in the proceedings therein; to commissions charged on the real estate or its income; to the payment of legacies or annuities out of the real estate or its income, and to all payments of income tax.</p>

It is very true that it was held by this court, in Field’s Appeal, 12 Casey 11, that the proceeding in the Orphans’ Court, against lands charged with legacies, must be by the legatees themselves, and that executors are not proper parties. Yet evidently making the executor a party does not avoid the proceeding for want of jurisdiction if the legatees are in point of fact parties. The court has general jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and any error of the court in the proceeding does not make void the decree. From the will and codicil of Mrs. Cox, Charles Hewson was not only executor but also trustee, to receive and hold the property which was to constitute the fund from which not only the legacies but the annuities were to be paid, and he was therefore a proper party to 'institute the proceedings. We think, then, the decree of the Orphans’ Court was conclusive. The minor children of Mrs. Cox, these appellants, appeared by guardian, and submitted to the decision of the court. This dispenses with the necessity of considering whether' the annuities were by the will of Mrs. Cox charged on her real estate. The bill of review was not filed in time. We think it clear that the income tax was properly charged on and paid by the trustee, and was not a charge against the annuitants, and that the court were perfectly right in decreeing that the trustee was entitled to hold the estate for the payment of the annuities. The proper mode of proceeding to ascertain whether the balance in his hands is more than sufficient would seem to be under the Act of February 23d 1853, Pamph. L. 98.</p>

We have decided in Littleton’s Appeal the question of the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court in the proceedings of 1863, and came to the conclusion that the decree in that proceeding was a valid and binding adjudication of the main point in controversy in this case. The bill of review was too late in point of time. It is stated in Story’s Eq. Pl. 410, that such a bill will not lie after the time when a writ of error could bo brought to a judgment, for courts of equity govern themselves by the analogy of the law in regard to writs of error, and he cites numerous authorities. In New York it is held that a bill of review cannot be brought after the time allowed for an appeal: Boyd <em>v. </em>Vanderkemp, 1 Barb. Ch. R. 273.
