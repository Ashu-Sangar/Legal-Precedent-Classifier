II. died first, whereby the policy on his life became payable to the wife. She afterwards died and the money secured by the policy on her life was paid to the executors of her deceased husband. H. by his will devised and bequeathed to his wife “ all my estate both real and personal, of whatsoever kind and wheresoever the same may be at the time of my decease, for and during the time of her natural life, with full power and authority to appropriate to her own use such of the personal property as to her shall seem meet.” He further provided, “ after the death of my said wife, I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue or remainder of my estate, both real and personal, to my son John, his heirs and assigns for ever,” and in the case of the death of John before the death of his wife, without leaving issue, then to testator’s daughter Esther. John died before the wife. On a distribution of the funds in the hands of the executors of II., the executors of the wife claimed the amount of the policy secured on her life for the benefit of the legatees of the wife, alleging that they were entitled thereto under the provisions of II.’s will. The court below held that the wife had only a life estate, and no power of appointment to dispose of the proceeds of the policy of insurance, and rejected the claim. <em>Held, </em>that this was not error.</p>

A claim was presented on behalf of the executors of Jane Hardy to the proceeds of a certain life insurance policy for $2500. It appeared that both William and Jane Hardy had insured their lives in favor of each other. The present policy in question was payable at the death of Jane Hardy, to William Hardy, her husband, his executors, administrators or assigns. The proceeds were never in the possession of Jane, as they were not payable until after her death, and by the terms of William Hardy’s will, she had only a life interest in his estate, with full power to appropriate to her own use such of the personal property as to her should seem meet.

J., in an opinion, inter alia, saying: “ The single question presented is, to whom did the principal of the policy upon the life of the widow belong at the time of her death — whether to her or to the executor of her deceased husband ? In view of the law, as settled in Deginther’s Appeal, 2 Norris 837, we are of opinion, that the moment the widow died the policy became a part of her deceased husband’s estate, and to be disposed of according to the provisions of his will. By this, while he bequeathed his entire estate to his wife, yet it was only for life, with power to appropriate to her own use such portion a3 to her shall seem meet. This language standing alone would have given the wife the whole estate absolutely, but that was not the intention of the testator, as is evident from the subsequent clauses of the will. By these he bequeaths the residue of his estate to his son, and then by a codicil, in the event of his death without issue, to his only daughter. Testator, while he contemplated the probable necessity for the use of his entire estate by the widow for her maintenance, yet never intended she should have the power to dispose, by will, of any portion not used or appropriated by her. The residue remaining at her death he disposed of as his property. The policy of insurance was a part of the residue of his estate, and, as the same was not payable until after the death of the widow, and could not possibly be appropriated by her, the residuary legatee was consequently entitled to the proceeds.”</p>

He died first, whereby the policy on his life became payable to her. She after-wards died, and the money secured by the policy on her life was paid to the executors of her deceased husband. By her last will she devised this policy to Jane Stewart and Sarah Ann Stewart. On a distribution of the funds in the hands of the executor of William Hardy, the appellants claimed the amount paid on this policy for the benefit of the legatees of Jane Hardy. They claimed it under a clause in the will of William Hardy, which reads thus: “ I give, devise and bequeath unto my beloved wife, Jane, all my estate, both real and personal, of whatsoever kind, and wheresoever the same may be at the time of my decease, for and during the term of her natural life, with full power and authority to appropriate to her own use such of the personal property as to her shall seem meet.” In a subsequent clause, he declares, “ after the death of my said wife, I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue or remainder of my estate, both real and personal, unto my son, John Hardy, his heirs and assigns for ever.” By codicil, he provides, in case of the death of John, before the death of testator’s wife, Jane, without leaving lawful issue surviving, then devise over to testator’s daughter, Esther.</p>

      <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>We may concede under the authority of Deginther’s Appeal, 2 Norris 337, that when Jane died the amount of insurance on her life became a part of the estate of her deceased husband, and was to be disposed of according to his will. We are not, however, able to discover any authority for her to dispose of it by her will, or that will give it to her executors. Under the will of her husband she took during life only, with the additional power to appropriate to her own use such of the personal property as she might choose, and the residue and remainder were devised over. The property was not given to her absolutely, nor was she authorized to dispose of it by will. The evident intent was that she should have no more of the <em>eorjms </em>of the personal estate than she should elect to appropriate to her own use. That election and appropriation must necessarily have been made during her life to be for “her own use.” In so far as she did not thus appropriate it, it passed, on her death, to the other devisee named.</p>

He manifestly referred to such personal property as she could at any time reduce to her actual possession, and use, sell or convert the same so as to appropriate it, or the proceeds thereof, to her use and enjoyment. If, however, during her life, she had actually made any sale or transfer of the policy, thereby indicating an intention to appropriate it to her own use, a more difficult question would arise. But she did no such thing. It remained unchanged and unappropriated, and precisely in the same condition in which it had passed under the will of her late husband. The attempted devise which could have no effect until after her death, was not such an appropriation for her use as was contemplated by her husband’s will. The learned judge was entirely correct in holding that the residuary legatee under the will of John Hardy, was entitled to the proceeds of the policy.</p>
