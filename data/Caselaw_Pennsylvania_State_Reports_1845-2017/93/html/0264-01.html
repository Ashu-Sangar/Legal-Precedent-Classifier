At the trial, it appeared that the engine company was instituted February 20th 1752, and was incorporated by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, September 20th 1841. The relator joined the company as an active member in July 1864, and remained upon the active roll until May 1867, when, at his request, bis name was placed upon the absent roll, and he went to the state of Missouri. <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>In the autumn of 1866, the company adopted, among others, Section 16, of By-Law 17, providing, “That if any member shall neglect or refuse to pay his indebtedness, exceeding three dollars, after receiving notice in writing from the assistant secretary, the president shall erase his name from the roll unless a satisfactory reason be given to that officer for such neglect.” The relator left the city in the spring of 1867, and made no payment to the company until June 80th 1871, when he forwarded to the secretary the sum of $8.35, the amount-of his indebtedness from April 1866, until April 1871. On December 29th 1870, the councils of the city of Philadelphia passed an ordinance to create a Paid Fire Department, which substituted such fire department for the voluntary organizations theretofore existing, and after March 1871, the Hibernia Fire Engine Company ceased running to fires. At the stated meeting of May 26th 1871, an amendment to the bylaw, fixing the rate of dues was proposed, and at the stated meeting of August 25th 1871, vras adopted by a vote of 84 in favor of it, to 6 against, in accordance with by-law 32, authorizing amendments to be made by a vote of two-thirds of the members present. This amendment fixed the rate of dues at $2 per month, instead of 12J cents, as they had previously been.

In January or February 1872, another notification of his indebtedness, in the same amount, was mailed to him, containing the warning that unless it was paid by the next stated meeting his name would be dealt with in accordance with section 16 of by-law 17. To this an answer was received from the relator by the secretary, refusing to pay the amount and asserting that he was being unfairly dealt with. The secretary wrote in reply, assuring him that no wrong was being done, and informing him of the amount of property in the hands of the company and the number of members entitled to participate in its distribution. At the next stated meeting, February 23d 1872, the roll of delinquents was called; the secretary and assistant secretary reported to the meeting that notifications had been sent to the relator, his letter refusing to pay his indebtedness was read, and no one appearing to answer for him, the president erased his name from the roll. Some weeks afterwards, a former assistant secretary of the company received from the relator a post-office money order for $4.50, dated St. Joseph, Missouri, March 20th 1872, which he retained in his possession until the relator’s return to Philadelphia, when ho drew the money from the post-office and handed it to relator.

It did not propose to prove any object, its minutes show none, and none is suggested. Undoubtedly there was an object, but no court could conceive of one within the powers of the company.
