About Christmas 1871, while still a widow, she renewed the lease with Ziegler for the year commencing the following April, the rent agreed upon being $575. On the 23d of February 1872, she married Biery, the defendant, and continued to reside in the house as before — her husband living at his boarding-house in the same village, where he had resided for a number of years, but frequently visiting her and occasionally remaining with her over, night. She was not in good-health, and in July 1872, was taken by her husband to his boarding-house, where she stayed till October, when she was removed to her mother’s house, in which place she died November 30th 1872. The testimony shows that while she was living in Ziegler’s house after April 1872, she had a child born, which died soon after birth and was buried from said house, and that one of Biery’s children by a former wife was living with her for a short time Also, that defendant sent some articles of furniture to the house; that his wife’s goods remained in the house till January 1873, when he made sale of them; that in February 1878, he returned the key of the house to Ziegler, and took out letters of administration on her estate December 13th 1878.</p>

This was an attempt to compel the husband to pay the rent of a house which his wife had leased some weeks prior to his marriage to her. It appears that after the marriage the wife continued to occupy the demised premises, as she had occupied them for some time prior thereto. Her husband, however, did not live with her, at least not permanently; he visited her sometimes, and occasionally staid all <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>night. The court below held the husband liable for the rent, not because the landlord could recover against him upon the contract of lease with the wife made prior to the marriage, but for the use and occupation after marriage, on the ground of the husband’s legal obligation to support and maintain his wife.</p>
    <p id="b369-6" data-blocks='[["BL_369.4",369,[224,620,1171,466]]]'>The error of this ruling is palpable. The duty of a man to support and maintain his wife is well settled, and may be enforced by legal process in case of his refusal or neglect to do so. But he was a stranger to this contract. The lessee was in possession of the premises under a lease when he married her. The contract and liability were hers. He no more assumed the payment of her liability under the lease than he did of her other debts, if any existed. It is true she lived in and enjoyed the use of the house for some months after her marriage and until her death. In like manner, her clothing purchased before was worn and used after marriage. If uivpaid for the husband could not be held responsible for it.</p>
