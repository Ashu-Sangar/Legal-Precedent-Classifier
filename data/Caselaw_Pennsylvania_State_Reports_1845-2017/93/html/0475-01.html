Another lad who was attending the machinery called to him to bring to him the oil-can, and he left his post, and in taking the can fell into a pair of rollers breaking coal where he was severely injured. It appeared that the rollers were covered with a box upon the top of which was an opening covered by a plank which was displaced at the time of the accident, and was so often before with the knowledge of the injured boy. <em>Held, </em>that the provision in the Act of March 3d 1870, that all machinery where boys work shall be properly “ fenced off” was intended to mean properly protected, and that in providing this cover for the rollers the employer did his whole duty under the act. <em>Held, further, </em>that if the cover was unnecessarily removed without the fault or knowledge of the employer, through the negligence of one of the employees, there could be no recovery according to well-settled principles. <em>Held, further, </em>that the conduct of the boy presented a case of contributory negligence.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[267,487,1163,804]]]'>It appeared at the trial, that Edward Honor, the minor son of the plaintiff, was, in 1871, employed at the defendants’ coal breaker at Plymouth, Luzerne county, as a slate-picker. In breaking coal it is passed through rollers and broken into the various sizes required for use, and after being broken it is shot down chutes to storing places, whence it is loaded into the cars. Boys stand by the sides of the chutes, and, as the coal passes by, pick out the slate therefrom. This was the daily employment of young Honor, and while thus engaged, on the 15th of September 1871, at the lower portion of the breaker, there was just above him a pair of rollers called the “monkey-rollers.” His place as a slate-picker was about twenty feet below these rollers, and did not in any way expose him to danger from them. The lad, who was about thirteen years old, was engaged at his usual work, when a boy named Hobbs, who was attending the machinery above, called to him loudly to bring him the oil-can, which was by the stove near Edward to be kept warm. The latter seized the can and ran up rapidly towards Hobbs, when, just before he reached him, he stepped into the monkey-rollers and his leg was caught and crushed by them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[263,1291,1162,360]]]'>The opening over the small rolls was six inches wide, and two feet eight and a-half inches long; this opening was secured with a plank fitting into the opening, and which could not be removed except by lifting it up. When the plank was down there was entire security against any danger from the rolls. The plank was intended to be removed, if the rolls became choked, for the purpose of clearing them out. The plank was displaced at the time of the accident, as it frequently had been before, to the boy’s knowledge.</p>

In providing that the machinery in and about the mines and coal breakers “ shall be properly fenced off,” it evidently intended merely proper protection. Then, to protect the opening into which the plaintiff fell, a fence, in its literal sense, would not have been as efficient protection as the board used to cover the opening. In providing this cover, the employer did his whole duty under the act. If that cover was unnecessarily removed without his fault or knowledge, through the negligence of one of the employees, no other servant could recover according to well-settled principles.
