Barnes, in June 1875, was the owner of a farm situate in Bradford county, Pa., which some time previous he had rented to William May; and on the 29th day of June May was owing him, as he alleged, $200 for rent. Barnes, on the 29th day of June 1875, issued a landlord’s warrant, directed to L. T. Royse, a constable, instructing him to collect the above rent. Royse, on the 1st of June, made a levy on the personal property of May, and the latter waived an appraisement of the same. This property was left upon the premises of May, until the time of the sale, July 26th 1875, he consenting and agreeing to the arrangement, and on the 26th of July 1875, property enough was sold to pay the debt distrained for and costs. On August 24th 1875, May commenced this action of trespass <em>vi et armis </em>against Royse, the constable. The first and second counts of the declaration averred that May occupied certain premises as tenant of one Barnes, under a certain rent, of which rent two hundred dollars were in arrears, and that the defendant acting for Barnes, not regarding the statute in such case made and provided, but wrongfully and maliciously contriving and intending to injure and oppress the said plaintiff, had wrongfully taken and distrained goods (therein enumerated) to the value of $2000, &amp;c. The third count was in trover.</p>

In December 1875, upon motion of plaintiff, the court granted rule to show cause why the declaration filed in the case should not be amended.

Barnes testified that he leased the premises to May under a parol agreement; that the rent was equivalent to about $500 a year; that he had directed the landlord’s warrant to issue.</p>

The warrant was no protection to the constable unless rent was reserved in the agreement between May and B. O. Barnes. The burden is on the defendant to show that the relation of landlord and tenant existed between them, and the defendant, as bailiff of the landlord, must show that he did all things required by the Act of Assembly. [The court here read to the jury sect. 1 of the Act of March 21st 1872, Purd. Dig. 878, and after calling the attention of the jury to everything which the act required to be done, said:] The burden is upon the defendant to show that he did everything the act requires.

It was against a person who had acted as bailiff in distraining and selling goods under a claim of rent' due and in arrear. The declaration contained three counts.

The substantial cause of action under the original declaration was an excessive distress while the defendant in error was the tenant of Barnes, and while a sum specified was due and in arrear for rent. Every part of this was changed by the amendment. It substantially averred that <em>he </em>was not the tenant of Barnes; that he did not owe him any rent; that it was not a case of excessive distress, but one in which no right of distress, for any sum, existed.

It was not, therefore, under the statute giving double damages. Hence, it follows under the pleadings, it was error to fix the measure of damages at double the value of the property: Reese <em>v. </em>Emrick, 6 S. &amp; R. 286.
