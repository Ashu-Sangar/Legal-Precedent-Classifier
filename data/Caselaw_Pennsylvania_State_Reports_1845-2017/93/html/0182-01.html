That in May 1788, the said Peter Grubb, Jr., conveyed all his estate in said reservation to George Ege, who owned the Reading Furnace estate; and that the said George Ege, continued during his life to supply said furnace with ore taken from the said Cornwall ore banks, under said reservation; and that during his lifetime, the said Ege did not use the ore taken under said reservation, for any other purpose than the supply of the said Reading furnace; and that the said Ege, did thereby elect and determine the one furnace to be supplied under said reservation, from that time thenceforth for ever. That said Reading furnace was a cold blast charcoal furnace, requiring, when worked to its maximum capacity, fifty tons of ore per week — but using ordinarily much less. That it required two tons of Cornwall ore to make one ton of iron, and that the greatest capacity of furnaces built and worked by the best process then known was, as late as 1790, not more than twenty-nine tons of iron per week — and the average capacity not more than twenty tons of iron per week. That by improvements in the building and operating of furnaces, their capacity, when the bill was filed, was tenfold what it was in the year 1790. That the possible productive power of .furnaces, and their corresponding capacity for consuming ore, is indefinite and unascertainable, but that the amount of ore required for their supply in the past or present is easily capable of ascertainment. That among the causes of the increased productive capacity a-re improved machinery, the introduction of the hot blast, and the use of anthracite coal as a fuel. That the first of these causes was gradual, the second was not invented till about the year 1830, and the third -was first introduced in this country about the year 1839. That the legal effect of the reservation was to vest in said Peter Grubb, Jr., in fee simple, a right to dig, take and haul away, for the purpose of being converted into iron, such a quantity of iron ore as could be so converted by <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>one furnace, and that this quantity was to be determined by the capacity of one furnace then erected, or to be erected, and by said Peter Grubb, Jr., or by his heirs or assigns, elected or fixed upon as the furnace which should be supplied under said reservation, and that the quantity to be taken was at all times thereafter limited to the amount which by said furnace, at the time of said election, was capable of being converted into iron. That the defendants Brooke and Robeson own the Reading furnace, and the ore-right reserved in the deed of May 9th 1786, and that they have in their possession and control the books and accounts of said furnace from 1788 to the date of the filing of the bill, and that said books and papers will show what was the quantity of ore which has been used from the Cornwall ore banks for the supply of said furnace, under said reservation, and that said books and papers will show the extent of the right reserved, as ascertained and fixed by the election of the said George Ege, and by user from that time until the defendants Brooke and Robeson became the owners of the same. That the said Reading furnace was not, until the year 1845, capable of using more than two thousand tons of ore annually, but that in that year the defendants Brooke and Robeson pulled down the old Reading furnace, and in its place erected a new furnace, of larger dimensions, and with new appliances, wholly unknown until years after said reservation was made, by means whereof the capacity of the present Reading furnace has been made onejiundred and sixty tons of ore per week. That since the erection of said new furnace the said defendants, Brooke and Robeson, pretending that they have a right under said reservation to take as much ore as they can use in supplying a furnace of any size, have taken away a large quantity of ore in excess of what they are entitled to take, and that the books, papers and accounts of said defendants will enable them to state an account of the same. That said defendants, Brooke and Robeson, had built a second furnace, and claimed to take ore under said reservation for the supply of both; using one, however, when the other was out of blast, so that the consumption of ore should be continuous, and that the consumption of ore is less when there have to be suspensions for repairs; that such suspensions have always been known to be necessary, and were so especially in 1786, and necessarily entered into the estimate of the measure of an ore-riglit for the supply of one furnace, and that the defendants Brooke and Robeson have under their control books and papers which will show how often and how long have been the ordinary suspensions at the old Reading furnace for repairs which are usual and indispensable. That said defendants, Brooke and Robeson, under a pretended claim of right, by virtue of said reservation, have carried away ore from the Cornwall ore-banks and sold the s-ame, and that the books and accounts will show how much.</p>

That by the saving and exception in said deed there remained in Peter Grubb an estate in the premises conveyed, “ which was a right in gross, or at large, neither appendant nor appurtenant to lands, but annexed to the grantor’s person, to him, his heirs and assigns for ever; * * * that neither the deed nor the reservation required that Peter Grubb, his heirs or assigns, should become the owner of a furnace to enjoy it;” and that the measure of the quantity of ore which could be taken under it was the capacity of any furnace to be elected as a measure, and that such election was not to be made once, but at all times as often as the owners of the ore-right chose to make an election. That at the date of the reservation furnaces were known to be of different sizes and capacity, and it was well understood that they might be improved, both in their construction and mode of blowing, so as to increase the quantity of iron made and ore consumed. That after the execution of the deed of May 9th 1786, Peter Grubb supplied ore to the Bei'kshire Furnace (situated six miles east of the place where the Reading furnace was afterwards built), under an arrangement -with the owner or owners of said furnace; that on May 1st 1788, he conveyed the ore-right to George Ege, who erected the Reading furnace, and supplied it with ore under the ore-right, but did not elect it as a measure of the right, nor make the right appendant or appurtenant to it. That the defendants (Brooke and Robeson) have become owners of the ore-right and also of the Reading furnace estate; that they have erected thereon a larger furnace, using anthracite coal and furnished with hot blast; and that furnaces as now constructed require more ore and produce <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>more iron than either of the furnaces owned by Robert Coleman on May 9th 1786. That the defendants have the right from time to time to elect any one furnace as the measure of the ore-right, and to use the ore as they please; that they have not at any time taken from the ore banks more than sufficient for the supply of such furnace, although they have made sales of part of that quantity ; that they have taken less in any one year than the quantity to which they were entitled, and they claim the right to take so as to make up the deficiency ; and that for the supply of a furnace of approved construction, which they for the present elect as the measure of quantity, twenty thousand tons of ore are yearly required. That frequently ore fit to use has been exhausted at particular places ; that as the mining becomes deeper the quality of the ore deteriorates, and that the owners of the ore bank have sold ore contrary to an agreement between themselves, and that from these causes the “ paramount estate vested in these defendants ” is seriously impaired. That it was agreed by Robert Coleman, in his lifetime, and the owners of the ore-right, that the latter might take as much ore as they pleased from their own mine-holes. That it is true that the Reading furnace was a cold-blast charcoal furnace, worked by waterpower. That they are not informed and cannot answer whether the utmost capacity of the said furnace as used by George Ege was fifty tons per week ; but neither Ege nor the defendants ever took from the said ore banks the full quantity to which they are entitled, and defendants claim the right to make up the deficiency. Defendants admit that on the 9th of May 1786 cold-blast charcoal furnaces alone were used in Pennsylvania, but deny that the greatest average capacity of such furnaces was twenty tons of iron per week, or that it was believed to be impossible to produce a greater quantity. They admit that it takes about two tons of Cornwall ore to make one ton of metal. That since May 9th 1786, the construction of furnaces has been improved by enlarged boshes and increased height and by the hot blast; that the use of anthracite coal has been introduced, so that now, and for many years past, a much greater quantity of ore is required for a furnace than on the 9th of May 1786; and the defendants claim as the measure of their ore right a furnace of the best construction, and having the largest known capacity. That by reason of the better qualities of ore being exhausted by surface-mining, the use of anthracite coal and the hot-blast furnace had become a necessity to reduce the ore by reason of the increased quantity of sulphur and other foreign substances intermingled therewith. That by experiment it has been ascertained that a mixture of Cornwall ore greatly improves the quality of the iron ; that such mixture is necessary for salable iron, and that for the purpose of making such mixture, defendants claim the right to sell some or all of the Cornwall ore which they take for the supply of any one furnace of <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>the best construction. That the defendants have in their possession the books and accounts of the Reading furnace, but that the same do not fix the extent of the ore-right reserved in the deed of May 9th 1786. That it was never denied by Robert Coleman (the elder) and his successors that furnaces might be improved from time to time, or that the right of election under the ore-right extended to such improved furnaces. That defendants have built upon the Reading Furnace estate a new and improved furnace, of a capacity of about one hundred and fifty tons per week, and they claim to take ore sufficient for supplying a furnace of the best construction, and to use the same, or a portion thereof, at the furnace which they have built.</p>

If it be true, as is assumed by the plaintiffs (we think without sufficient grounds to warrant it), that neither of the parties contemplated the great improvements which have been made in the smelting of iron a'nd the operation of furnaces since the deed of 9th of May 1786, it would be manifestly inequitable (unless, indeed, the words of the deed require it, and present no other alternative) to put such a construction upon that instrument as would enable one of the parties to avail himself of these improvements while the other is precluded. If the plaintiffs may draw upon the ore banks, either for their own use or for sale to others, as they clearly may, to any extent rendered possible- by the increased capacity of furnaces throughout the country, and the consequently greatly increased demand for the ore, and the defendants may not supply their one furnace according to the same increased capacity, it must be manifest that the right reserved by Peter Grubb is immensely diminished in value by those changes in the condition of the business which neither party is said to have foreseen. For that right will, by reason of the greatly increased quantity drawn from the ore banks, and consumed and sold by the plaintiffs in consequence of those improvements, be exhausted at a much earlier day than it <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>otherwise would he. This consideration, while it may amount to a hardship, is of course no answer to the plaintiff’s claim, if that claim be supported by clear and unambiguous language in the deed. But if the words used do not necessarily lead to such a result, or if there be any ambiguity in the language used, it is a consideration of some weight in determining the true interpretation.</p>

The words of the reservation arc ‘ the right of digging, raising and hauling away a sufficient quantity of iron ore for the supply of any <em>one </em>furnace at the election of the said Peter Grubb, his heirs or assigns, at all times hereafter.’ It is not said in the deed ‘ any one furnace then built,’ nor ‘ any one furnace of the capacity of furnaces as then made and used.’ It would have been easy to have said this if this was intended. But the words are without any such limitation or qualification. The language used has a much broader sweep. It is ‘ any one furnace at the election of Peter Grubb, his heirs or assigns, at all times hereafter.’</p>

As is pointed out by the master, the same words had already been used for that purpose in the previous part of the same sentence, and there was no occasion to use them again in another part of the sentence for the same purpose. They had already said, ‘saving and excepting unto the said Peter Grubb, liis heirs and assigns for ever, the right <em>at </em>all times hereafter of entering and digging, &amp;c.’ When the phrase ‘at all times hereafter ’ is used a second time in the same sentence, it is used after the words ‘ at the election of the said Peter Grubb, his heirs or assigns.’ The phrase -was plainly intended to qualify those words, and not to qualify over again the words in the remoter part of the sentence. Such a construction as that contended for by the plaintiffs, appears to us to be a construction at once unnatural, ungrammatical and arbitrary. Undoubtedly, words may be transposed if it be necessary to do so, in order to give effect to the evident intent of the parties. Parkhurst <em>v. </em>Smith, Willes 332, cited by the plaintiffs, is an instance of this ; and in our own reports Mutter’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20314" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Wright 314">2 Wright 314</a>. But no rule of interpretation would justify us in transposing words to create an intent, which does not otherwise appear in the instrument, nor to destroy the natural sense which the words of the instrument and the connection in which they are used, plainly convey. We can see no warrant for taking <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>these words out of the position to which they have been assigned in the deed, by the parties themselves, and putting them somewhere else where they will mean something totally different, or where they would produce a meaningless tautology ; nor any warrant for dropping them out of the deed entirely. When the parties to this deed have said ‘any one furnace at the election of the said Peter Grubb, his heirs or assigns, at all times hereafter,’ we cannot see that they intended anything else than that which they have said, viz.: that Peter Grubb, and his heirs or assigns, should have the liberty of exercising that right of election at all times thereafter.</p>

It is of the nature of an election used in this sense that, when once made, it is final, and cannot be exercised again. But the word is not used in any such technical sense in this deed, but rather in the sense of ‘selection ’ or ‘ choice,’ and in no other sense. What the grantor, his heirs and assigns, are to do is, not to elect between two inconsistent rights (there is but one right), but to elect from time to time, the particular furnace with reference to which the right is to be exercised. What was reserved, was a perpetual right to take from the ore banks a sufficient supply for ‘any one furnace,’ and a perpetual right to select from time to time the one furnace to be supplied. It is as if the parties had said, ‘ the grantor excepts and reserves out of this grant to himself, his heirs and assigns for ever, the right at all times hereafter of entering, digging and hauling away, a sufficient quantity of iron ore for the supply of any one furnace, the said one furnace to be selected or designated by him, his heirs or assigns, at all times hereafter;’ that is, from time to time hereafter, as often as their interest or wishes may lead them to select or designate the one furnace which is to be supplied. ‘ At all times hereafter ’ means, as often as the grantor, his heirs and assigns, may choose to exercise the right of designating the one furnace to be supplied. These words are totally inconsistent with the proposition, that the right of designating the furnace to be supplied is exhausted by a single exercise of it. Such a proposition cannot be successfully maintained, without striking these words out of the deed in the place where they stand, and so making a new contract for the parties, instead of the one which they made for themselves. Looking at the whole deed, and at the particular words which are the subject of dispute, and gathering the intent from the natural sense of those words and the order in which they stand, we cannot see that any other meaning can, by any fair or legitimate method <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>of interpretation, be extracted from them, than that "which the master has found in them ; and it is needless to add anything further upon this point to the reasons which he has assigned with so much perspicuity and force, in his report, for the conclusion at which ho arrived.</p>

The designation may be changed from time to time, but not so as to enable the owners of the right to supply two furnaces alternately during the same general period of time, or so as to enable them to evade the restriction which is fastened upon the right.</p>

If any such supply remained on hand at any time unused by reason of the furnace being out of blast temporarily, it was their duty to have kept it on hand to go toward the supply of the furnace when work was resumed. Otherwise it is clear that the quantity to be taken from the ore banks to keep up the supply of the furnace when in blast again, would be increased by just the quantity they had sold.

Such furnaces were run by horse-power, and the blast was produced by wooden bellows which was applied through a single open tuyere. From the year 1800 to 1830 no furnaces in this country, using charcoal, could have produced more than from 1000 to 1200 tons of iron a year. The steam-engine was not applied to driving a blast in Pennsylvania until 1839, and anthracite coal was not used in the making of iron until 1840. Bituminous coal was not used until 1839. The hot-blast was not introduced into this country until about 1840. Manifestly it was a furnace of the capacity of existing furnaces, which was intended by the reservation in the articles of agreement. It was a right attached to and to be exercised in connection with a furnace just as the reservation in Grubb <em>v. </em>Grubb, 24 P. F. Smith 25, was a reservation attached to the Mount Hope furnace. It was to be exercised either at the John Patton furnace or some furnace to be <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>erected by Mr. Grubb.

    <p id="b197-6" data-blocks='[["BL_197.4",197,[249,578,1171,1231]]]'>The change in the language of the reservation in the deed from that in the articles of agreement was to enable Grubb to use it without first building a furnace. In other words, the purchaser would be in tbe unfortunate position of having paid his money for a right to supply a furnace without owning the furnace which was to bo supplied. Such a right, of course, would be unsaleable. It therefore became necessary to change, somewhat, the terms of the reservation, and to give a right for the supply of a furnace to be erected not only by Peter Grubb, but if he should die before lie disposed of it, by his heirs, or if he should sell it, by his assigns. The language of the grant was accordingly altered so as to provide for the supply of' a furnace to be erected by Peter Grubb, his heirs or assigns. It made no difference to Robert Coleman, who selected the furnace, or where it was situated, provided the amount of ore taken was the same. It is impossible that any two intelligent business men would come together, and for a fixed sum of money which was just about a sum, the interest of which would pay at the then rate for the ore that a furnace of the then known capacity would use, agree that for this consideration ore might be taken for all time to come, the annual amount of which should be left dependent upon what the possible future growth of the art of manufacturing iron might be anywhere in the universe. If it is said that these intelligent iron-masters must have “ believed in the certainty of progress, and that the furnaces of the future would consume more than the furnaces bf that day did,” we answer that while this is undoubtedly true, yet these men “ did not and could not foresee the introduction of anthracite blast furnaces, nor of new means of easy transportation by steam-engines and railroads.” That this is so has already been úidically ascertained: see Coleman’s Appeal, 12 P.

Of course the words “ at all times hereafter” are equally redundant, whether found immediately after the words “right, liberty and privilege,” or found in the latter part of the clause. It is said the effect of these words is to give a continuing right of election which may be exercised as often as the grantee or his heirs or assigns see fit. We contend they do not have that effect. They are appropriate words to give a single right of election to be exercised at any time in the future. They may have been intended to be read in connection with the words “ supply for any one furnace,” so that the deed would read “ for the supply of any one furnace at all times hereafter at the election,” &amp;c.

The underlying question in this, as well as the other appeals, is the proper construction of the reservation in the deed from Peter Grubb, Jr., to Robert Coleman. In this appeal the particular question is whether the appellees in whom are now vested the rights reserved by the said Peter Grubb, Jr., in said deed, are entitled to a full supply of ore for a modern furnace with all the recent improvements of the hot blast, the use of anthracite coal for fuel, of steam-engine for power, and with three tuyeres instead of one, or whether they are to be restricted to sufficient ore for the charcoal furnace as it existed at the time of the reservation ? The question is important as it affects the parties for the reason that the modern furnace will make ten times as much iron as the old charcoal furnace with its cold blast admitted by a single tuyere, the uncertain power of water, and the certain blowing out of the furnace in the fall, to enable the men to chop wood and make charcoal in the winter.</p>

In other words, they could change the furnace from time to time, as the exigencies of their business or their convenience might require. Both the master and the court below have so well vindicated their respective rulings upon this branch of the case that there remains little to add. We see no ambiguity in the reservation; nothing which extrinsic evidence is required, or <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>would be even permitted to explain. Where such is the case no more unsafe rule could be adopted than to search for a meaning of the parties that is not doubtful, and to write into their agreements matters which they have left out. It would have been very easy for Peter -Grubb and Robert Coleman, when they contracted in 1786, to have placed a fixed limit upon this reservation. They were both iron-masters and men of intelligence, and knew, or must be presumed to have known, just what they were about. They could have limited the supply to a fixed number of tons, or knowing as they did the capacity of the furnaces of their day, they could have agreed that the annual consumption of one of them at that time should be the maximum beyond which the reservation should not go. It is no part of our duty to speculate as to why they did not limit the amount of ore by a fixed standard; it is enough for us to know that they have not done so, yet, if it were necessary, it would not be difficult to find excellent reasons why they adopted a shifting standard. We must assume that in contracting they mutually contemplated future improvements in the manufacture of iron, or else deny them average intelligence. Prior to 1785 a marked advance had been made in England. Then Smeaton’s cylindrical blowing machine had already supplanted the rude wooden bellows, worked by water-power here up to and later than 1786. While it is true that the steam-engine was not applied to driving blast in Pennsylvania until 1839, yet it had been known in England many years before, and was in practical successful operation prior to 1785. So as to the use of mineral coal as fuel for making iron. It was not introduced here until 1839, but in England it had been used in blast furnaces since 1750. It may be that the great abundance and cheapness of wood in this country delayed for some time the introduction of mineral coal for such uses.</p>

This was a perpetual reservation, or at least for so long a time as the ore banks should remain unexhaustéd. This reserved to Peter Grubb, his heirs and assigns, a certain interest in the ore in common with the owners of the ore banks. At the time of the reservation other furnaces were being operated, in the same manner as the Berkshire furnace, and using the ore in substantially similar quantities. The ownership of the Cornwall ore banks had since that time become further subdivided by death and conveyances. Other furnaces have been constructed and all are being operated with the modern improvements, and are using a corresponding increased amount of ore. To allow them to thus increase the consumption, and yet to confine the heirs or grantees of Peter Grubb to the quantity consumed in the old charcoal furnace of 1786, would be a forced and arbitrary construction of the reservation, and instead of carrying out the probable inten<a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>tion of the parties would, in our opinion, be doing violence to any reasonable view of what they contemplated at the time. It is hut just to suppose they expected that Peter Grubb, his heirs and assigns, should operate this one furnace as other owners wore operating theirs. There was no essentia] diiference at the time of the reservation. Why should there be now ? It was manifestly the intention that the reservation should bo of a certain proportion of the ore. By allowing to the appellees the same improvements in the manufacture of iron as are enjoyed by the appellants this proportion can be maintained, and it can be done in no other way. These furnaces may be compared to so many candles, all lighted and consuming this ore at the same time. Peter Grubb’s candle burns no faster than the others, and while this is the case the appellants have no just cause of complaint. If the appellants may draw upon these ore banks without limit, with the use of all the modern improvements by moans of which the manufacture of iron is so rapidly multiplied, and yet hold the grantees of this reservation to the supply of the antiquated charcoal furnace, it is manifest the reservation itself is immensely diminished in value, and it is only a question of time, depending upon the extent of the ore banks, when it will be entirely defeated.</p>

White, deceased. The learned court below held that under the reservation of said deed of May 9th 1786, from Grubb to Coleman, 1. That the appellants are only entitled to a supply of ore for one single furnace selected, and cannot, while such furnace is undergoing repairs, use it in another furnace; 2. That the appellants must use the ore in the furnace so selected, and have no right to sell the same, or any part thereof, and that for ore so used they were liable to account to the appellees. A decree was accordingly made against Nathaniel Ferguson and the estate of the said William R. White, that they pay to the appellees the sum of $912.06, for ore used in Robesonia furnace No. 1, from June 5th 1867 to June 25th 1867, and a further decree against the same parties of $32,773.55 for ore used in Robesonia furnace, No. 1, from March 13th 1878, to May 24th 1874. So far as the above decrees were for ore used in Robesonia furnace No. 1, while No. 2 was undergoing repairs, we think they are correct. Regarding the words in the reservation “ a sufficient supply of ore for any one furnace” as a measure of quantity, we must interpret them to mean so much ore, and no more, as a given <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>furnace would use in the course of a year, taking into consideration the wear and tear, and the necessity of its going out of blast for repairs at stated periods. No furnace can continue in blast for ever; hence-when parties fix the capacity of a certain furnace as a measure of the quantity of ore, they must be presumed to have had in view the fact that every furnace must stop at times, not only for ordinary repairs, but for other accidents and contingencies to the business. The use of furnace No. 2 from time to time, pending repairs to No. 1, the selected furnace, was using more ore than any one furnace was capable of doing, and hence cannot be presumed to have been in the contemplation of the parties, as it certainly is not within the terms of the reservation. That portion of the decree, however, which charges the appellants with the ore used in Robesonia furnace No. 2 from December 31st 1873 to May 28th 1874 rests upon a different footing. During all of this last period, No. 1 was in repair, and could have been-put in blast. That this was not done was due to the belief of the appellants, as we gather from the offer of evidence rejected by the master, that they had a right to use No. 1 instead of No. 2. That they had no such right is manifest. If, however, there has been an honest mistake' here, the appellees have no right in equity to take advantage of it unless they can show they have been injured. They have not shown such injury. The appellants had the right to use the ore in No. 2; had they done so, the consumption of ore, according to the offer, would “ have been much larger than was consumed in No. 1.” It is true by using No. 1 for five months, it enabled the appellants to operate No. 2 just that much longer, without stopping for repairs, and to that extent, perhaps, the appellees may claim to have been injured. But this injury, if not ■within the rule <em>de minimis, </em>is capable of being defined in extent by the master, and may have been more than compensated by the lesser quantity of ore consumed by No. 1. The appellees must remember that they are appealing to the conscience of a chancellor, as well as seeking the enforcement of legal rights, and that before they can ask for a decree in their favor for this particular ore, they must show some equity which would make it unjust to withhold it. We are of opinion that the master ought to have heard and considered the evidence referred to in the seventh assignment of error, and to this extent we sustain this appeal. The right to sell ore will be considered in the next appeal.</p>

White, deceased, and of Sarah D. Robeson, executrix of Henry F. Robeson, deceased, No. 110, July Term 1878. — This appeal raises two questions distinct from those already discussed, viz., 1. The right of the appellants, or owners of the ore-right, to sell or dispose of the ore so-taken by them otherwise than in the supply <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>of the selected furnace, and 2.

    <p id="b207-6" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[197,581,1173,430]]]'>Upon the question of the sales of ore there is an obscurity as to the facts both in the history of the case and in the report of the master. Nor is any additional light thrown upon this subject in the opinion of the court. The learned judge says.: “With regard to the ore sold by Robeson and Brooke, in 1855 and 1856, it does not appear from the master’s report under what circumstances that ore was sold ; whether it was surplus ore remaining unused at the furnace or ore sold directly from the banks. It is perhaps immaterial, for as the defendants had no right to mine ore for the purpose of sale, neither could they sell what was mined for the supply of their furnace.”</p>

It is conceded they could not supply the elected furnace and at the same time sell additional ore from the banks. This would extend the reservation beyond its terms, and make it as broad as the grant itself. It would be using more ore than was requisite for the supply of one furnace. But the appellants claimed, and so aver in their answer, that a portion of the ore sold was to make up for the ores iised by them from other mines, and the schedules in their answers give the data upon which this claim is founded. If, as they assert, ores from other mines were mixed with the Cornwall ores, and so used in their furnace to improve the quality of the iron, they would have a right to sell a corresponding amount of Cornwall ore. To illustrate: If the selected furnace consumed ten thousand tons of ore in any one year, all of which the appellants were entitled to take under the reservation, and it was found that a better quality of iron could be obtained by the mixture of twenty per cent., say two thousand tons of other ore, they would have a right to exchange that number of tons of Cornwall ore for such purpose, or to sell the same and with the proceeds purchase the same quantity of other ores. This results from two causes : 1. The right to take a full supply for the selected furnace, and 2. Their right of dominion or absolute property in the thing taken. The reservation of the ore-right was not necessarily connected with the use of the furnace, except so far as it is necessary to measure the quantity. The appellants are under no obligation to operate the furnace which they may select; they are entitled to select a furnace, and to sell to the proprietor thereof a sufficient supply from the Cornwall ore hanks. They may not sell to different furnaces, nor more than a supply to the selected furnace, for that would exceed the reservation. But the ore when taken out under the reservation, and to the extent it authorizes, is as much the property of the appellants <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>as the ore remaining in the banks is the property of the appellees. 'To impose such a restraint upon the use and alienation of property as is here claimed by the appellees would require the clearest language in the deed. Yet there is not a word in that instrument to justify such a claim. The appellants have an absolute right of property in the ore the moment it is taken out of the banks, subject to the single qualification that it must pass through -some one furnace to be selected by them for the purpose of measuring the quantity. It therefore becomes of the highest importance to know under what circumstances th,e ore in question was sold, and for this purpose the case must go back to the master. The master finds sales by Brooke and Robeson from the Cornwall ore banks of over six thousand tons. The answer avers the use by appellants of other ores at the Reading furnace of over, one thousand tons. To this extent, at least, they were entitled to sell Cornwall ore. The claim of the appellants to make up the deficiencies of former years is not sustained. They cannot take in one year what they might have taken the previous year, but neglected to do so. The right, if not exercised, or only partially exercised, for any one year, is gone with the expiration of that year.</p>
