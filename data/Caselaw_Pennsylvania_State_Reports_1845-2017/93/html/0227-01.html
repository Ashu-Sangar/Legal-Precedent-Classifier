Prior to said date, the parties had agreed to a renewal of the note, and the plaintiffs sent a new one for same sum, payable May 5th 1877, which defendant received, and on the 2d of April sent the original note by mail to the plaintiffs. April 3d the plaintiffs did not open their bank for business and were insolvent. The defendant hearing of this, immediately charged the plaintiffs with the original note, credited them with $85, the discount on the new one, resulting in a balance due defendant, and tendered to the plaintiffs the new note, discount and collaterals. April 2d the plaintiffs gave to Weir and Hunter three checks amounting to $13,300, which were presented to defendant and payment refused; but it does not appear they were presented or that defendant had notice of them, till after the said tender and withdrawal of the credit.</p>

    <p id="b233-6" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[224,473,1182,1167]]]'>Justice and equity forbid that one man’s money shall be applied to the payment of another man’s debts. On this is based the right of a vendor to stoppage <em>in transitu, </em>which arises solely upon the insolvency of the buyer. Where a vendor has delivered goods out of his possession into the hands of a carrier for delivery to the buyer, if ho discovers that the buyer is insolvent, he may retake the goods, if he can, before they reach the buyer’s possession, and thus avoid having his property applied to paying debts due by the buyer to other people. It was long a mooted question whether the effect of this remedy of the vendor is a rescission of the sale, or a restoration of possession of the goods with the rights of an unpaid vendor ; but now it seems the better opinion that the contract is not rescinded. Although this remedy of a vendor which exists only before actual delivery of the goods into the buyer’s possession, cannot bo exercised in precisely the same mode by a lender of money or credit, yet, for similar cause, the lender ought to have as efficient remedy until the money is paid to or the credit is used by the borrower. The lender’s remedy may have the effect of a rescission of the bargain. Goods can be held subject to a lien for the price agreed upon, and, if disposed of for more or less than that, the buyer may have the gain or suffer the loss ; hut when a borrower has as little right to the money as a buyer has to the goods, it is impracticable to hold and dispose of the money with like result. Nor is there reason for so holding — the value of the goods may increase or diminish, whereby the buyer may be gainer or loser by his contract — -the value of money i's fixed. Insolvency takes the pith out of the borrower’s promise to pay, and if he has not yet received the money, he should not take it. He did not get the credit in view of his bankruptcy.</p>

To permit them to recover after their note, the foundation of their claim, is proved worthless, would be the grossest injustice.

They asked no information before taking the checks. No paper of any kind was given by defendant showing that the plaintiff's had right to draw or assign. Before presentment or notice of the checks, the plaintiffs’ insolvency was shown by a notorious act, and their right to draw was immediately denied by defendant. A vendor’s right of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>is defeasible in one way only, and that is where the goods are represented by a bill of lading, which is in the vendee’s possession with <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>the vendor’s assent, and is transferred to a third person who in good faith gives value for it.
