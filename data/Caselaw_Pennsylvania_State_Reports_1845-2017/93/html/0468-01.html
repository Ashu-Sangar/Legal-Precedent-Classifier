T. Rhoads, one of the defendant firm, applied to the plaintiff for §200, representing that he wished the same for the purpose of paying the men in the defendants’ employ, and thereupon the said amount was advanced by the plaintiff, and the sum was used by Rhoads for the purpose mentioned, he giving the plaintiff a note, of which the following is a copy:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b469-8" data-blocks='[["BL_469.6",469,[219,1017,1164,278]]]'>The referee in his report, inter alia, said: “ That a note given by one partner for a debt of the firm is not an extinguishment of the original debt, unless so agreed when the note was given, is too well settled to admit of argument. The burden of proof is upon the defendant to show that the note was taken in payment and satisfaction, and not as collateral security. See Mason <em>v. </em>Wickersham, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 100" data-case-ids="1856339" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0100-01">4 W. &amp; S. 100</a>; Tams <em>v. </em>Hitner, 9 Barr 441 — 8.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b469-9" data-blocks='[["BL_469.7",469,[222,1296,1165,603]]]'>“As the referee conceives, it makes no difference, in principle, whether the debt is an antecedent one or one that is created at the time the security is given. It is true that it has been held that if a partner borrow money and give his own security for it, it does not become a partnership debt by being applied to partnership purposes. It is treated as the discount of a note, and not the loan, and hence is not affected by the subsequent use to which the money is applied. See Graeff <em>v. </em>Hitchman, <a href="/watts/5/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Watts 454" data-case-ids="1844065" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0454-01">5 Watts 454</a>. But the presumption of the advance on the credit of the individual partner may be rebutted; and where, as in this case, at the time of obtaining the money, the reason for the loan and the uses to which it was to be applied were distinctly stated, and were understood by both the lender and the borrower, and the money was in fact so used, the inference is a fair one that the advance was on the credit of the partnership.”</p>
