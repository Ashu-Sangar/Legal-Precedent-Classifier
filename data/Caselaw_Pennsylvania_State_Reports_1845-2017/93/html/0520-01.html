Defendant who"was unable to read, and could simply write his name, signed a note and gave it to plaintiff. The note was given in 1863, and contained a confession of judgment and waiver of exemption. Judgment was entered thereon, and in 1868, and in 1873, defendant signed an amicable scire facias to revive with confessions of judgments of revival. In 1873, a third scire facias to revive issued and defendant was served, when he obtained a rule to show cause why the original judgment should not be opened and he be let into a defence. The rule was made absolute, and at the trial defendant testified that he had no knowledge that the confession of judgment and the waiver of exemption were contained in the original note; that these portions were not read to him when he signed the noté, which he supposed to be simply a promissory note. And further, that he signed it with an understanding that the plaintiff should examine his books to ascertain what defendant owed him, and that the note should stand for whatever balance was fo'und to be due. He also testified that the authority to revive was signed by him without any knowledge of its import and upon an express understanding that the books were to be examined. <em>Held, </em>that while the mere fact of the revivals might have been a circumstance entitled to some consideration with the jury in deciding as to how much weight should be attached to defendant’s testimony, yet if the original judgment was obtained by fraud and misrepresentation, and the subsequent revivals were a continuation of the fraud, they could not add anything, to the validity of the original judgments.</p>

Defendant still urged him to hunt up the books, and Koons went to look for them a second, and even a third, time, and that each time said, he could not find the books; that finally he said to defendant that if he would put his name to the note he would hunt up the books, and, as quick as he found them, ho would let him know, and he would look the account over, and if it was not right he would make it right; that defendant thought the balance largely in excess of what he owed Koons; but, being an ignorant man, and not able to read, and merely able to scratch his name, he had no written memorandum with which to show that Koons was in error; that Koons read over the note to defendant, but only read .the upper portion of it, which made it read like a simple promissory note; that Koons remarked to him, “ I will not ask you to sign a tight note, or one of those cut-throat notes, as they call them: it is nothing but a common note;” that defendant then signed the note, and heard nothing further in regard to it until the amicable scire facias to revive was brought to him, and that ho signed it without the least knowledge of its contents, and upon the renewed assurance that the books of Koons were to be examined and a settlement made, and that he signed the second scire facias under like circumstances; that he was never informed, and never knew, that there was a judgment against him until the third scire facias was <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>served on him.

This portion of the charge, standing alone, looks like error, but an examination of the whole charge as applied to the facts of the ease, shows that it was not. The defendant, an ignorant man and unable to read, had signed a judgment note in favor of plaintiff for an alleged indebtebness to William Koons, dated March 2d 1863, for $501.75. The note contained a waiver of inquisition and all exemption laws, as well as the declaration that it was “for debt before the 4th day of July 1849.” There was evidence to go to the jury that the note was obtained by fraud ; that at most it was hut a cautionary note ; that the amount due, if anything, was subsequently to be settled by an examination of William Koons’s books, the defendant having kept no account except in his head, and that Koons (the real plaintiff) in reading it to the defendant had suppressed a material part. The judgment entered on this note was revived by amicable scire facias, signed by the defendant in 1868, and again in 1873. After the second revival upon the application of the defendant, the original judgment was opened, and he was let into a defence. The question now under discussion relates to the effect of the revivals upon the original judgments. As to the first revival, the learned judge instructed the jury in his general charge, as follows: “ Again, if after the judgment had been thus given, say for five years, as is alleged on the part of the defendant, and then a renewal was taken by Mr. Koons, or by some one for him, to Henderson Monroe, and the latter signed it, as he said he did, upon the distinct understanding that the books were to be examined and the basis of the actual indebtedness ascertained, then the revival could not have given additional validity to the original debt.” This instruction vras not complained of, and it is referred to now only as it bears upon the charge in relation to the second revival, and which forms the subject of the 4th assignment. The portion of the charge referred to is as follows : “ If at the time the second revival was taken, Mr. Monroe was induced to sign it, as he says, that he might get a statement out of Mr. Koons, the fact that he executed the second revival gives no additional validity to the original judgment.” If the original judgment was obtained by fraud and misrepresentation, and the subsequent revivals were hut a continuation of such fraud and misrepresentations, it is difficult to see how such revivals could add any<a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>thing to the validity of the original judgment. The mere feet of the revivals might have been a circumstance entitled to some consideration with the jury in deciding as to how much weight should be attached to the defendant’s testimony, but no such point is involved in this assignment. If the defendant’s story is believed the revivals could not add to the validity of the original judgment for the reason that they were obtained by fraud, and fraud vitiates everything it touches.</p>
    <p id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[249,692,1167,244]]]'>5. The portion of the charge embraced in this assignment is not error when read in its connection with the general charge. The remark of the court had reference only to the contradictory statements of William Koons on the one side, and Henderson Monroe on the other. As between them it was, as the court stated, purely a question of credibility.</p>
    <p id="b526-7" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[1035,935,332,39]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
