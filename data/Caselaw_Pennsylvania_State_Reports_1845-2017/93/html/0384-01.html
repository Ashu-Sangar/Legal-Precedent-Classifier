Deponent cannot say whether or not she actually did sign the said note, but on or about that time she did sign with her mark a paper brought to her by the said plaintiff, which may have been the said note, and the circumstances connected with the signing of said paper are as follows: Deponent owned a farm and mill property near Doylestown for many years past, and still owns the same, having until within two months resided on the mill property; that she is now past seventy years of age, and has been for more than two years last past, and still is, totally blind, and for the past two or three years has had repeated attacks of sickness, which has more or less confined her to her bed and to her room for long periods qf time; that for many years past the said plaintiff, out of kindness to deponent, as he professed, has attended to the col<a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>lection for deponent of the rent of the farm and mill property, which, together, aggregated about $950 a year; that deponent in October last had a severe attack of illness, from which she had little or no hope of recovery, and was confined to her bed; that on or about the 16th of October last past deponent was visited by said plaintiff, who said to her that she ought to compensate him for his many services to her, and to sign a note for some amount to him ; deponent replied that she desired to do what was right in the matter, and trusted to him; whereupon plaintiff prepared a paper for deponent to sign, which she did sign with her mark. And deponent further says, that at the time of said signing she was in a very weak condition, and did not expect to recover; that she retained no recollection of the contents of the paper, if she knew' it at the time, beyond the fact that she had signed something for plaintiff; that on her partial recovery, a few weeks afterward, deponent sent for her brother, in Philadelphia, to make inquiries concerning the paper she had so signed, which resulted in finding the said judgment-note on which judgment had been entered the same day as its date. And deponent further says, that she is not indebted to the plaintiff' for any such sum as named in said note, nor in any other amount, unless it is for money advanced by plaintiff in and about the repair of her farm property, which, in any event, does not exceed one or two hundred dollars, but as to the details of which deponent has no knowledge, nor unless deponent is indebted to plaintiff for commissions for the collection of the farm rent; but, as to this, deponent is not aware of whether he deducted the same or not, but Believes she is not so indebted, as plaintiff always gave deponent to understand that there were no commissions due him; but the only positive knowledge deponent has of any debt due by her to plaintiff is the amount of a note for $180, dated April 1st 1876, for money then advanced by plaintiff to deponent, and also a sum of money advanced at various times in small amounts, not exceeding in the aggregate the sum of $50.”</p>

To which she replied, “ that she wished to do what was right in the matter, and trusted to him.” Whereupon he prepared a note for her to sign, “which she did sign with her mark.” She further says that she retained no recollection of the contents of the paper, beyond the fact that she had signed something for him, but ascertained after-wards that it was the note on which judgment had been entered. This is virtually an admission that the note was given in consideration of the services referred to. She then speaks of her indebtedness to him; and says, in substance, that while she may have been indebted for money advanced in and about the repair of her property and for commissions on rents collected, the only positive knowledge she had of any debt due him was a note of §180, dated April 1st 1876, for money loaned, and a further sum, not exceeding in the aggregate $50, advanced at various times in small amounts.

In the absence of a replication or traverse of the answer, or any testimony tending to rebut the bona fides of the transaction as therein detailed, the court was clearly right in discharging the rule.

Nearly six months elapsed between the filing of the answer and the hearing. Ample time <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>was thus afforded in which to file a replication and take the testimony of the subscribing witnesses and others.
