The defendants in their answer denied that they had any knowledge of any such incorporated society, but averred that defendants were the duly constituted officers of an incorporated society with which plaintiffs had been associated as members up to a certain time, when they refused to attend its meetings. It appeared from the report of the master, to whom the ease was referred, that in 1866, an unincorporated society had been formed in which both plaintiffs and defendants were members, and that in 1872, said society had been duly incorporated by a decree of the Court of Common Pleas. No minute of the adoption of this charter appeared in the books of the company, but there was a minute of a reference of it back to the attorney who obtained it, for corrections. It appeared also that-this charter was handed down with the other papers of the society by one president to another as they were successi vely installed. The master also found that, in 1875, a new constitution was prepared and declared carried, although not approved by three-fourths of the members present, as required by the constitution of the unincorporated society, and that said new constitution materially changed the objects of the society. It was under this new constitution the plaintiffs made their claim as set forth in the bill. <em>Held, </em>that there was sufficient evidence of the adoption of the charter without a formal minute thereof, and that therefore the bill must fail. <em>Held, further, </em>that even if the charter had not been adopted, the new constitution not having been adopted in accordance with the provisions of the existing constitution of the society, was illegal and of no effect.</p>

That there exists in the United States an organization known as the German Roman Catholic Central Association, which is composed of certain local associations throughout the said states. The said 'Central Association, at a general meeting held in Cincinnati, Ohio, in May 1875, adopted and prescribed a constitution for the several local associations within its organization, by the provisions of which, the said local associations are placed wholly subject to the control and domination of the priests connected with them. ■ That, on the said 8th of June 1875, the Rev. P. C. Nagle, priest in charge of the St. Nicholas Catholic congregation of the city of Wilkesbarre, came into the meeting of the said St. Nicholas Mutual Assistance Association, and proposed the adoption of the constitution as aforesaid prescribed by the said Central Association, by this society, in place of the charter and organization under which they had theretofore been acting. This was acceded to by the plaintiffs, but refused by the defendants, who declared that they would keep up their said former organization and charter. Whereupon, the plaintiffs and their associates withdrew from the said incorporated society, and have not since acted therewith, although duly notified by defendants and their associates that they would continue the organization under the charter aforesaid, which they have ever since done.' And we, the said defendants, are duly elected and acting officers of the said incorporated association, and as such have been placed in possession and control of the property of said association, and all our acts in and about such property have been done simply in carrying out and discharging the duty devolving upon us as such officers. And we further answer that it is true that the notes and assets of the said association were, at least in part, acquired while the plaintiffs, or some of them, were members aforesaid; but we deny that when they thus wilfully abandoned the said association, they had any right to take any of the assets thereof with them, and make them the property and assets of another organization. And we further aver that the notes mentioned in complainants’ bill, and the appendix thereto, are the sole and peculiar property of the said St. Nicholas Mutual Assistance Association, incorporated as aforesaid, and that complainants, by abandoning the said association, abandoned all right and title to said property and assets, both individually and collectively, as any other organization, and that complainants have at this time no right, title or property of any kind, in the said notes and assets, either legal or equitable.”</p>

The pastor of that church was permitted to attend the meetings of the society and to make motions, but had not the right to vote. Any alteration or amendment of the constitution required the agreement of three-fourths of the “present members.” <em>A </em>majority could amend the by-laws. In the spring of 1872, according to the requirements of the constitution and by-laws, the society resolved to be incorporated in the name of “ The St. Nicholas Mutual Assistance Association,” or, in German, “ St.- Nicholas Verein,” and prepared articles of incorporation, setting forth the objects of the association to be substantially the same as those of the previous society. The association was to be located in Wilkes-barre ; and it was provided that “ none but citizens of this Commonwealth can become members of this association,” and did not <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>require that they should be active members of the aforesaid church of Wilkesbarre.</p>
    <p id="b483-6" data-blocks='[["BL_483.4",483,[245,517,1163,640]]]'>In May 1872, the articles, and a petition of members, were presented to the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne county, and were directed to be filed and published. At the October Term following, a decree of incorporation was made. The validity of the charter is denied by reason of its alleged departure from the instructions given to the committee which prepared it. In the record of the decree on the continuance docket, and in the recorder’s office, and also in the certificate attached to the charter, each show's the name was originally written “ The St. Nicholas Mutual Assistance Association, called Wyoming Vereinbut in each of them the word “Wyoming” had been cancelled by drawing a line through it, and the words “ St. Nicholas” written over. It does not appear by what authority the word Wyoming was written or afterwards changed. It is further objected that the minutes of the society do not show any vote taken on the question of accepting the charter.</p>
    <p id="b483-7" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[248,1158,1165,804]]]'>The master, however, found as facts, that the charter was handed to the president of the society in December 1872, or in January 1873, and the bill of the attorney was approved and paid. In March and April following complaint was made that it was not correct. The objections appear to have been that the name was wrong; that it required members to be citizens of the Commonwealth, and did not require members to fulfil their obligations to the church of Wilkesbarre. It was therefore resolved that the charter be handed to counsel for correction. And it was so handed. In June following it was resolved that the committee who had been instructed to hand it to counsel, “ care that the charter would be returned into the hands of the society.” At the next monthly meeting it was brought in and handed to the president. Thenceforth until the close of the year 1874, this charter, with the other papers of the society and key to the desk were handed by each president to his successor as they were severally installed, as a part of the ceremony. Thus, for a year and a half after the charter had been returned to the association, it remained in the hands of the proper custodian thereof, and manifestly was accepted and recognised as the charter of the organization.</p>

Nor do we think the fact, that in January 1875, and again in March, objections were made to a president by reason of his not having performed his duty to the church, under the original constitution, sufficient to rebut the presumption of previous acceptance and ratification. If this conclusion be correct, it is fatal to the bill. If- however, we should <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>concede this charter to be invalid, then the constitution of the original society remained in force. That required the agreement of three-fourths of the “ present members” to change or amend it. It is only by virtue of an amendment that the appellees could maintain this bill. They claim the society adopted the general constitution of the “ Central Society.”- If that pretended amendment or adoption is invalid, they have no standing to take the funds out of the hands of the minority who adhere to the society from which the others have seceded, If the appellees have, contrary to the constitution and government of the society to which, they all belonged, severed their' connection therewith, they cannot' invoke the aid of a court of equity'to take the property of the society from those who adhere to the organization, objects and government of the society: Sutler <em>v. </em>Reformed Dutch Church, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20503" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Wright 503">6 Wright 503</a> ; Schnorr’s Appeal, 17 P.

The master has found there were at that time about 180 or 185 active members of the society. About 85 of which were present at the meeting. Before the question was put to the meeting on the adoption of the constitution, one of the appellants arose and protested against it, and produced a paper signed by more than 50 members of the society, declaring they would not accept the proposed constitution. When the vote was taken, about 50 or 55 members voted in favor of the adoption of the “ Central constitution,” and that the negative of the question was not put. Thus it appears that three-fourths of all the active members did not agree to the change, and less than one-third of them voted for it. Three-fourths of the members present did not vote in its favor: and more than the number requisite to defeat it, who were present and desirous of voting against it, were not given an opportunity to so vote. Hence, the very constitution under which the appellees claim to have acted was disregarded, and the master has found their action “was revolutionary.” It therefore follows there was no legal adoption of the “ Central constitution.” He further found the ¿attempt was to make a radical change in the obj-ects of the society. We think the correctness of this conclusion is too clear to need argument. The changes are to the objects o.f the society, and the forms of government. Reference will be made to some of them. Previously, it “was practically a mutual aid society only. The change was to make it a religious society, although retaining a mutual aid feature. The sectarian object was made fully equal to the mutual aid object. The question is not whether such a change may not have been beneficial. It is a question of power. Less than three-fourths of those present had no power to change the constitution. Whether the minority acted wisely or unwisely <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>is a question which we cannot review. They had a legal right to hold the appellees to an observance of the constitution, and still retain their fealty to the church. The new constitution greatly enlarged the powers of the pastor. Thus, the names of the candidatos must be submitted to him, and if he objects that the candidate does not fulfil his duties as a Catholic, the name must be withdrawn until the impediment is removed. If the society fail to exclude a member for certain reasons specified, the priest may move his exclusion. He has precedence over all other members in addressing the society. The names of officers elected must be reported to him. On request, the minutes must be submitted to him for inspection, and must not contain anything contradictory “to the prescriptions of the diocese.” Members “must send their children to a Catholic school if possible.” Thus, the power of passing on the qualifications of its members is practically taken from the society and given to the pastor, and he becomes the governing power of the society. The new constitution is radically so different, that it could not be adopted without the concurrence of three-fourths of the members present. It follows, therefore, the learned judge erred in reversing the conclusion of the master, and in decreeing otherwise.</p>
