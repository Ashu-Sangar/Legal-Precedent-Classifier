Whereupon, on motion of counsel for garnishees, the court, Allison, P. J., made absolute the rule to dissolve the attachment, in an opinion, saying : “ The words of the constitution of the stock exchange show that the seat, or right of membership, is property, since it is held as security for payment of debts due members of the board.

By the terms of the constitution of the stock exchange, which forms the contract between that institution and the owners of seats therein, it is provided that “ any member shall - have the right to sell his membership subject to the following conditions.” This provision of itself determines that it is property; the fact that the seat is the subject of purchase and sale, that it may be transferred from one person to another, conclusively establishes that it is not a mere personal right. In fact the point has been recently decided in the United States Supreme Court, in Hyde <em>v. </em>Woods, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20U.S.%20523" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 U.S. 523">4 Otto 523</a>, where the learned judge, who delivered the opinion of the court, speaks of a seat in the San Eran cisco Stock and Exchange Board, subject to conditions similar‘to those attached to the one in question.</p>

The policy of the law is certainly opposed to exempting the property of a debtor from execution. The only question therefore remaining to be considered is, whether the conditions annexed to ownership are such as to defeat this natural implication. The effect of these provisions is simply to render the seat a pledge in the hands of the stock exchange, as security for liability of the owner to that body and the other members of it; and it is by reason of this effect that under the Act of Assembly the seat is the subject of attachment-execution: Act of June 16th 1836, Purd. Dig. 630, pl. 32,</p>

The constitution does not say that a member shall be entitled to the proceeds of a seat. It distinctly says that “ the proceeds of the seat, if sold, shall belong to its owner’s creditors who are members of the stock exchange;” and the only property that the member can have at all is the balance of the proceeds, if any such exists. There may never be any balance; then there will never be any money due the retiring member, and no debt <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>which can possibly be attached. The seat has not been sold. Clearly, then, there is no balance of money due, no debt owing to the debtor. Have the members of the stock exchange any of his property, any goods or chattels pawned or pledged with them ? The record discloses none. Has he any right of action under any contract ? No ; the only contract that exists is one by which they mutually agree that for each other’s benefit they will trade in certain ways and with certain people, and the contract has not yet been broken; there is not, therefore, even a right to damages for breach of contract. The decision of the lower court is in keeping with the line of decisions: Evans et al. <em>v. </em>Wister, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.N.C.%20181" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 W.N.C. 181">1 W.

It is a mere personal privilege, perhaps more accurately, a license- to buy and sell at the meetings of the board. It certainly could not be levied on and sold under a fi. fa. The sheriff’s vendee would acquire no title which he could enforce, nor is it within either the words or the spirit of the Act of June 16th 1836, sect. 35, Pamph. L. 767, providing for attachment on judgment. Whether the proceeds of the sale of the seat in the hands of the treasurer of the board, and payable to the defendant, according to the regulations and by-laws of the board, could be thus reached is an entirely different question.
