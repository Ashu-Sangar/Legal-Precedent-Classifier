The complaint, itself, which is a part of the record returned on certiorari, shows that the demise of the premises was for one year, at a monthly rent of $45.84, and that the said rent was due on the first day of July 1879. The magistrate, however, in reciting the complaint, states that it was an annual rent of $540 from the first day of May 1879, which is the aggregate amount of $45.84 per month. The court below, upon the argument, stated that it was an inference of law from this, that no rent was due until the end of the term. How can this be so when it appears from the magistrate’s transcript that the rent was in arrear and unpaid, from which it naturally follows from the very meaning of the terms that it was due.</p>

As a necessary practice, therefore, and as a universal custom in the city of Philadelphia, the party against whom the magistrate decides obtains a transcript of the magistrate’s record, and either appeals or removes the record by certiorari, accordingly as the transcript shows a good cause of action, or otherwise. This was done in this cause, and as the transcript discovers no good cause of action, showing no rent due until May 1st 1880, a certiorari was taken.</p>

It was also proved by a witness of the lessee that there were not sufficient goods on the premises to satisfy the rent in arrear.

The general finding is in the very words of the statute and a full compliance with the law. It is not necessary that all the facts should be set forth in detail in the finding: McKeon <em>v. </em>King, 9 Barr 213.
