On January 11th 1879, a petition was presented to the register by one Emma Tholey, setting forth that she was the lawful wife of the decedent in his lifetime, and is now his lawful widow, and, as such, entitled by law to administer upon his estate; that letters of administration thereon had been improvidently granted to said Mary Geiger, and therefore prayed that said letters be revoked, and letters of administration granted unto her, the petitioner. After a hearing before the register, the letters granted to said Mary Geiger were revoked, and new letters of administration granted to the alleged widow of the decedent.</p>

J., delivering the opinion, said: “We have carefully examined and considered the testimony taken under the appeal, and from that of the person claiming to be the widow alone, it clearly appears that no marriage contract was ever entered into between herself and the decedent. She admits that no actual marriage ever took place, but rests her claim upon decedent’s declarations made to her privately, and in the absence of witnesses, about three years prior to his death, that ‘ he will claim me as his wife, take care of me and the children.’ The claimant also, before the death of decedent and afterward to a number of witnesses, admitted that she was not his widow, and had never been married to him. That a meretricious relation existed between the parties cannot now be doubted, although it was unknown to the relatives and friends of the decedent, who were under the belief that the claimant was his landlady or housekeeper, and although he at times spoke of and introduced her as his wife, and at other times denied that he was married, and he supported her and her children by a deceased husband, yet in view of the declarations and admissions of the claimant, which were against her interest, and therefore must be taken as true, we can arrive at no other conclusion than that no such marriage as can be recognised by the law existed between decedent and her who now claims as his widow.</p>

If it were not so, there would be no reason for the recognised distinction between civil and criminal cases. The admissions of the defendant even in a criminal case, are admissible to prove an actual marriage. When, however, we have the testimony of one of the parties as to the terms of the contract, and that shows that there was no contract by words <em>in presentí,, </em>all other evidence on the subject is of no importance. Here the appellant testified, that the decedent had said to her privately, and in the absence of witnesses, “ he will claim me as his wife, take care of me and the children.” This certainly was no contract of marriage. Bicking’s Appeal, 2 Brewst. 202, was a case quite as strong as this of cohabitation, partial report, conduct and admissions of the man, and yet it was not held by this court sufficient to establish a marriage. We are of opinion, that upon the evidence, the decree of the learned court below was right.</p>
