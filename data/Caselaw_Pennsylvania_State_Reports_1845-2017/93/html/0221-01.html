The action of the board was not the more addition of a new street to an old plan under the third section of the Act of June 6th 1871, but a complete revision of the plan under the, second section of said act. And in the words of that section the “said confirmation” should be “final and conclusive without appeal.” The proviso to the third section does not apply to the whole act, for if it does, it destroys the whole purpose of the act as expressed in the first section, and repeals by implication the declaration at the close of section second. The purpose of the act was to withdraw the consideration of plans, which is purely a matter of engineering, from lawyers unskilled in that science, and to give it to surveyors, skilful in their profession. One section of an act will not repeal another unless they are plainly inconsistent. Implied repeals are not favored. Applying these principles of construction to the Act of 1871, we need only consider the clause giving the appeal to be what it purports, a proviso to the third section only, and not to the second and third sections; thus the whole act will stand. Not a word need be rejected as surplusage; still less need we reject a whole clause as repugnant to the rest of the act.

In this respect, it is claimed on the part of the city, that the Act of 1871 made a radical change in the law, and that such was a principal object. The first assignment of error is to the decision of the court, that an appeal could be taken from the confirmation of a plan of surveys made by the board of surveyors.</p>
    <p id="b224-9" data-blocks='[["BL_224.11",224,[263,1545,1169,519]]]'>By the first section of the act the board'of surveyors are “invested with full authority to examine, and finally confirm or reject all plans of surveys or revision of the plans of the city of Philadelphia, when the same have been made by the direction of the select and common councils of the said city and the second section provides for notice and hearing, “ and that upon the confirmation of any plan of surveys and regulations by the said board of surveyors, the seal of the board shall be affixed thereto and attested by the presiding officer; said confirmation to be final and conclusive without appeal.” Stopping here the act is too plain for interpretation — it means but one thing, and that is expressed in direct and simple terms — there can be no appeal from the" confirmation by the board.</p>

Unless this be very clear it cannot <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>be admitted. The third section enacts, that no street shall he added to a confirmed plan until it shall have been approved hv the hoard of surveyors as to location, width and grades; Provided, that an appeal may he taken to the Court of Quarter Sessions within three months after said board shall have finally confirmed any plan as aforesaid. If there be a subject to which this proviso giving the right of appeal may properly refer, it cannot be extended to one expressly declared to bo without that right: City of Erie <em>v. </em>Bootz, 22 P. F. Smith 196. The proviso is immediately related to the enactment for adding a new street to a confirmed plan, and its application to that subject requires no forced construction. The words “ shall have finally confirmed any plan as aforesaid,” may not be the most apt for designation of a plan, as affected by the addition óf a street, yet they can be so understood, while if referred to the “plans of survey or revision of plans,” the subject of the first and second section, an important part, which is evidently a main object of the statute, is abrogated. Every rule of interpretation demands that the statute be so construed that the whole may, if possible, stand. We are of opinion that there is no insuperable obstacle in the way of giving effect to every part of this act, and that one of its clearly expressed intendments is, that the confirmation of a plan of survey, under the provisions of the first and second sections, shall be final.</p>
