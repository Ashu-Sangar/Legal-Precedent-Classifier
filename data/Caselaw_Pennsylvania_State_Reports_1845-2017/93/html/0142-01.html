The making of a gift to procure the saying of masses for the soul of a devisor, was one of the superstitious uses prohibited by the statute of 1 Edw. D. 6, c. 14. But a superstitious use can hardly be said to exist in this country, where in the absence of any state religion there can be no standard of orthodoxy: Methodist Churches <em>v. </em>Remington, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20224" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts 224">1 Watts 224</a>.

Thomas Plumer defines a charitable use in these words: ‘ Where the donor appropriates a gift, either to charity or some public purpose, such as the repair of bridges, ports and havens, not operating in any manner to the benefit of himself:’ Melick <em>v. </em>The Asylum, 1 Jac. C. C. 180. But the best definition of what constitutes a charitable purpose is that of Binney, adopted by the court in Price <em>v. </em>Maxwell, 4 Casey 23, and in other cases.</p>

Smith 396, which arose under this act, the court expressly admitted that the evident intention of the testator was to avoid the statute, but it nevertheless gave effect to his gift.</p>

The Act of 1855 was meant to save men from the force of solicitation addressed to them under the sanction of religion in the near view of death; but as that act is in derogation of the absolute right of all men to control the disposition- of their own property, it should be strictly construed. It has been the practice to award a moderate sum in payment of the services of mass in- cases when the decedent is of the Catholic faith, as a part of the funeral expenses, if the testator’s belief in the continued efficacy of these prayers leads him to devote the property to securing them after death. One should be careful that under cover of the statutes intended to protect him from imposition, we do not hinder him in the exercise of what he may regard as a religious duty. It is easy to imagine cases in which the testator might leave the bulk of a large estate to the church in payment of masses for the repose of his soul. But it must be remembered that the fund can never be divested for the benefit of the church from its original purpose, and that, on the first attempt at diversion, equity will intervene and raise another trustee to administer it according to the intention of the donor: Schnorr’s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith 138. The exceptions to the adjudication are sustained, and the accountant is ordered to pay to St. Mary’s Catholic Church the sum of $649.79, for the purpose and in accordance with the will of the decedent.”</p>

It is to be expended in masses for the benefit and repose of his soul. While this may not be regarded as a charitable use within the accepted meaning of the word, it is certainly in every proper sense of the term, and according to the obvious intendment of the act, a religious use. In the denomination with which the testator appears to have been identified the mass is regarded as a prominent part of the religious service and worship. According to the Roman Catholic system of faith there exists an intermediate state of the soul, after death and before final judgment, during which guilt incurred during life and unatoned for must be expiated; and the temporary punishments to which the souls of the penitent are thus subjected may be mitigated or arrested through the efficacy of the mass as a propitiatory sacrifice. Hence the practice of offering masses for the departed. It cannot be doubted that in obeying the injunction of the testator and offering masses for the benefit and repose of his soul the officiating priest would be performing a religious service, and none the less so because intercession would be specially invoked in behalf of the testator alone. The service is just the same in kind whether it be designed to promote the spiritual welfare of one or many. Prayer for the conversion of a single impenitent is as purely a religious act as a petition for the salvation of thousands. The services intended to be performed in carrying out the trust created by the testator’s will, as well as the objects designed to be attained, are all essentially religious in their character.</p>
