But if she should die without making such disposition, then in trust for my two daughters, Mary McKeen and Emeline Bent, and their heirs and assigns for ever; and it is my will and request that the said Edward pay off the ground-rent and mortgage on the before-mentioned premises, that the same may be free from encumbrance at the time my said daughter may be entitled to receive the rents thereof, as aforesaid, or as soon afterwards as he may be able to discharge the same.”</p>

The expression “ heirs of the body ” is, to be sure, the apt expression, but the particular estate is given as a, sole and separate use, and consequently is not technically sufficient to create an express entail. Can a fee tail be implied ? There are two circumstances which may rebut the presumption of an implied entail: that the estate is intended to determine upon 1. A failure of children only. 2. A failure of heirs within a given definite time : Smith on Executory Interests 301. The failure in our case is to happen within a definite time, viz.: the death of the equitable life-tenant. The words are, “ but in case the said Henrietta should not marry, or marry and have no such issue,” then over. These words, if they do not mean that the contingency was to depend upon herself not bearing, at any time before her death, children, who (or whose heirs) should survive her, mean absolutely nothing. If the failure of issue might occur in a century from the creation of this alleged entail, the words above used would be irrelevant.</p>

    <p id="b212-5" data-blocks='[["BL_212.4",212,[279,505,1169,322]]]'>These words would be conclusive that the object of the trust was simply a trust against coverture, even if the duties of the trustees had been active: Yarnall’s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith 335; Ogden’s Appeal, Id. 501; affirmed in Williams’ Appeal, 2 Norris 377, And Miss Armstrong being neither married nor in contemplation of marriage*at the death of the testator, a trust against coverture cannot be sustained : Smith <em>v. </em>Starr, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%2062" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Whart. 62">3 Whart. 62</a>; Hammersly <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%2062" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Whart. 62">Id. 126</a>; McBride <em>v. </em>Smyth, 4 P.

The estate is first given to her for life and the remainder expressly limited to the heirs of her body : Bender <em>v. </em>Fleurie, <a href="/grant/2/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Grant 345" data-case-ids="227670" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0345-01">2 Grant 345</a>; Taylor <em>v. </em>Taylor, 13 P. F. Smith 486 ; Linn <em>v. </em>Alexander, 9 Id. 43. This case is clearly distinguishable from Ingersoll’s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>In that case there was an active trust — the trustees were to receive and pay over the income to the <em>cestui que trust. </em>In our case there is no such duty, nor are any other duties imposed which require the trustees to hold the property. In Ingersoll’s Appeal (throwing the trust out of the question) there was a gift of a fee simple; this was undisputed, for the testator died after the Act of 1855, Purd. Dig. 620; the court decided that the limitations over did not reduce this to an estate tail, and, not being too remote, were valid by way of executory devise, and could not be defeated by any act of the first taker. • In our case the first estate given being a fee-tail, the limitation over, whether on a definite or indefinite failure of issue, is a contingent remainder.</p>

Its language substantially is, in trust that the trustee shall permit Henrietta to receive the rents thereof for her sole use during her life ; and the intent of the trust is declared to be, that the property shall not be liable to the contracts or control of any husband she may thereafter have. No care or duty was imposed on the trustee in regard to the management or protection of the property, nor as to the collection or payment of the rents. He had no active duties to perform. It was a dry trust. The purpose was to create a separate use in Henrietta. She was <em>sui juris. </em>She took the whole beneficial interest devised to her. Her estate, as well as that given in remainder, were both legal, for the trust was executed under the statute: Physick’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20128" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="14 Wright 128">14 Wright 128</a>; Nice’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20128" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="14 Wright 128">Id. 143</a>; Ogden’s Appeal, 20 P.

The mere fact that on a certain contingency, which might never happen, the trustee was directed to execute a conveyance after her death to her devisees, did not change the dry character of the trust and make it active: Bradley’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20Leg.%20Int.%2038" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="36 Leg. Int. 38">36 Leg. Int. 38</a>. Still further, Henrietta was neither married nor contemplating marriage at the death of the testator. She never married. The expressed purpose of the trust being solely to protect against any husband she might have, it cannot* be sustained. A separate use for a woman cannot be created unless she is covert, <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>or is in immediate contemplation of marriage: McBride <em>v. </em>Smyth, 4 P.

It was given to her for life, and the remainder expressly limited to the heirs of her body lawfully begotten. These are the proper and technical words to create an estate tail.
