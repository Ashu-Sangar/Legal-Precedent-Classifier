Hull, with five others, are the owners in fee-simple of a tract of land in Blakely township, Luzerne county. That by articles of agreement bearing date 5th of July <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>1858, the coal in and upon said tract of land was leased to Abel Barker, Lewis Pughe and Edward Jones, and that by virtue of a deed of assignment bearing date the 12th of April 1864, the right, title and interest of said Barker, Pughe and Jones became vested in the president, managers and company of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company. That in and by virtue of an article of agreement between the said company, party of the one part, and the above-named William H. Hull (together with the five other parties, tenants in common as aforesaid), parties of the other part, bearing date the 8A of September 1867, it was agreed that the said company should mine and remove from the land of the said Hull and others, at least one hundred thousand tons of coal in each and every subsequent year, and should pay for the same at the rare of sixteen cents per ton for one class or grade of coal, and at the rate of twelve and one-half cents per ton for another class or grade. And it was in the same articles further agreed, “ That if the said canal company, after the year 1869, fail to take out and pay for, in any one year, 100,000 tons, the royalty or rent shall be calculated upon 100,000 tons, the amount paid for the then current year deducted and interest allowed upon the balance, such interest to be continued until the deficiency upon which the interest was based shall have been mined and taken out.” And it is further agreed upon as fact, that the said canal company have, during a portion of the time between the years 1869 and 1875, failed to take out the amount stipulated for, to wit: 100,000 tons each year, and that there is due to the said William D. Hull the sum of about $6000, more or less, as his proportion of the royalties for coal, which should have been taken out of said tract of land by the said company, but which they have not yet taken out, and upon which they have, during the past two years, paid interest to the said defendant, Hull. It is also agreed as being true that in the regular assessment for taxes for the year 1875, in the township of Blakely, the said William H. Hull was assessed (inter alia) upon the sum of $6000 money at interest, the same being the money to be paid to the said Hull as royalty, when the coal shall have been taken out, as stipulated for. And it is further agreed as true that the said tract of land is regularly assessed as coal land, the value of the coal still in the ground being considered in said assessment, and that upon the assessment of $6000, as above, a tax of throe mills for state purposes has been levied, amounting to the sum of $18.' If the court he of the opinion that the said sum (as above stated) of $0000 is liable to assessment for state taxation, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiff. But if not, then judgment to be entered for <em>the </em>defendant.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b504-7" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[246,793,1170,728]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>This is a case stated to determine whether $6000 due to the defendant under a coal lease, and drawing interest by the 'terms of the lease, is liable to taxation for state purposes, the land from which the coal is to be taken being also taxed. The money in question is included within the terms of the Act of Assembly making property liable for state taxes. That the real estate is also held taxable for county purposes, which may include in its value the same amount, is no reason why the state should not receive its proper tax on this money at interest. It is possible, the county assessment is too high, but the proper remedy for that is appeal. Even if the case stated presented a clear charge of double taxation (which it does not), the property is no more free from the grasp of the law than real estate and the mortgage upon it, which are held liable to the same tax. Upon the principles recognised in Carbon Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Carbon County, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20251" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Wright 251">3 Wright 251</a>, and Lackawanna Iron &amp; Coal Co. <em>v. </em>County of Luzerne, 6 Id. 424, it is adjudged that the defendant is liable for this tax. Judgment is therefore entered for the plaintiff upon the case stated.”</p>

While the contract uses the term “ interest,” the payments thereby designated are simply a compensation, bonus or penalty for the failure to mine and pay for the stipulated quantity of coal. The use of the word “interest” pre-supposes the existence of a principal sum — an indebtedness out of which it arises.</p>
