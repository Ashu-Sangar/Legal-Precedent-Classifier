On September 8th 1874, the city surrendered its charter, and accepted the provisions of the act entitled “An Act dividing the cities of this State into three classes,” <em>he., </em>approved May 23d 1874. In the year 1875, the Avater commissioners of the city passed a resolution providing for the extension of the water-pipes of AllentoAvn. In pursuance of said resolution, during the year 1875, the water-pipes were laid along Walnut street in front of the premises of the defendant, and the number of feet of main pipe laid through said street was filed in the department. At the same time the clerk of the said department made out a list of the OAvners of all the houses, lots and buildings on each side of said street, and charged each of said owners such rate per foot as had been fixed by ordinance. The tax was then placed in the hands of the city treasurer for collection, and the names of such persons as had not paid the tax within six months were handed over by the city treasurer to the city solicitor, who, in January 1876, had said amount of taxes registered against the parties who had refused to pay. On March 8th 1876 a scire facias was issued by the city solicitor, upon which scire facias judgment was entered May 6th 1876. On April 29th 1876, the court granted a rule on plaintiff to show cause why the writ of scire facias, sur lien No. 1011, should not be quashed. On July 3d 1876, the court (Judge Longaker then presiding) quashed all the <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>proceedings had upon said scire facias. On the 13th of January 1879, a rule was granted upon the plaintiff to show cause why the lien for the tax should not be stricken off; and July 8th 1879, a rule was taken by the present city solicitor to show cause why lien should not be amended as per petition filed. The rule to amend and the rule to strike off the lien were argued together, on October 10th 1879. On the 24th of October 1879, the court, Albright, P. J., made the rule to strike off the lien absolute, and discharged the rule, in an opinion, inter alia, saying:</p>

It would have been equally convenient to have provided, that the books in the proper office of the city government, should furnish the information as to whether or not certain charges had been paid. It is hardly necessary to multiply arguments on this point. The claim filed in the prothonotary’s office, is enforcible by an action of debt or by scire facias, as in the case of a mechanic’s lien. If the proceeding is by sci. fa. it is a proceeding <em>in rem. </em>But so far as the record of this claim is concerned, where is the thing which is proceeded against ? Nothing can be included in a scire facias except what the record shows; that is, the matters contained in the claim filed. The levari facias must follow the sci. fa., or it must command the levying of the debt from the land or a portion thereof, which the record shows is subject to the said debt.</p>

If the claim is for “water-frontage tax,” it may be designated by that name as the act provides. If these matters are briefly noted in the claim, the registration will furnish at least constructive notice to purchasers and subsequent encumbrancers of the nature, extent and duration of the lien. One of the remedies given is a proceeding purely <em>in </em>rem, by scire facias, as in the case of mechanics’ claims. To make this available, it is necessary that the property against which the lien is sought to be enforced should be designated with such certainty as to enable the sheriff to execute the levari facias ; but it is unnecessary to conform strictly to all the requisites of a mechanic’s lien. The name of the contractor or material-man need not be given, nor is a bill of particulars, &amp;c., necessary. In Pittsburgh <em>v. </em>Cluley, 16 P. F. Smith 449, it was said that the mechanics’ lien act furnished only a general and not a specific rule of proceeding. The special act under consideration in that case required the lien to be “filed in the same manner as mechanics’ liens,” and authorized writs of scire facias and levari facias to “ be issued thereon as in the case of mechanics’ liens,” <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>and yet it was there shown to be unnecessary, and in some respects impossible, to conform to all the requirements of the mechanics’ lien law. The municipal corporation act contains no such binding directions as to how the claim shall be registered, nor does it require that it should be even in the form of a mechanic’s claim. It simply directs that' the claim shall be registered, and provides that one of the remedies for its collection may be “ by scire facias, as in the case of mechanics’ claims.”. The manner of assessing or charging water-frontage tax is specially prescribed, as we have seen. The amount of the claim against each particular lot is thus fixed and determined, and hence it is unnecessary to set forth the particulars in detail. The claim, however, should be stated with such certainty and precision as to answer the purpose of notice, and at the same time support the proceeding that is authorized as one of the remedies for enforcing payment.</p>
    <p id="b336-6" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[259,980,1173,678]]]'>The court was clearly right in holding that the claim as registered was defective and insufficient to support a scire facias, &amp;c.; but under the ninth section of the Act of April 21st 1858, Purd. Dig. 70, pi. 5, which the court properly held to be a general law, we think it was amendable, and an amendment should have been allowed. That section provides, " that municipal claims for taxes, liens, public assessments or charges may be amended at any time before or at the trial, on notice given the defendant under rule of court, <em>Provided, </em>that if made on the trial, a continuance may be granted by the court on the application of the defendant.” Such acts as this should be liberally construed, and while amendments are not a matter of ri'ght, they should be allowed where it can be done without prejudice to intervening rights. So far as appears there were none in this case. The assessment of water-frontage tax against the defendant’s property, which was no doubt made as directed by the act, would furnish all the data necessary for the amendment.</p>
