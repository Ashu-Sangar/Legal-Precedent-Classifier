Five or,six terms had intervened. The defendants have not been served at all, but because the scire facias was served on Scott, who was named as'assignee of Cash, and terretenant, it is claimed by the authority of Silverthorn <em>v. </em>Townsend, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20263" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Wright 263">1 Wright 263</a>, that the plaintiff had five years in which to prosecute his writ and recover his judgment of revival; and that the alias and service on the other terre-tenants was but a proceeding commenced within the time prescribed by the Act 26th March <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>1827. The whole recovery in that case is based upon <em>the </em>fact of the service of the writ on the terre-tenant. Judgment might have boon taken against him without an alias. The alias was necessary only to obtain judgment against the defendant. It is true it was not issued until more than seven years had passed after the rendition of the original judgment, but was a prosecution of the first writ. Judge Strong said, ‘ it is to be observed, that the terre-tenant was notified of the first writ before the expiration of the five years from the time when the judgment was first entered. The case therefore differs from Westmoreland Bank <em>v. </em>Rainey, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%2030" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts 30">1 Watts 30</a>, where there was no service at all upon the first writ. An alias five terms thereafter, was held too late in that case, partly, if not principally, because there was a return of nihil to the first. In this case there was a partial service, and the sole purpose of the second writ was to call in the judgment-debtor, that a revival might be adjudged against him, as well as the terre-tenant.’ Judge Agnew stated the case more briefly in Fulton’s Estate, 1 P. F. Smith 209. ‘ In the Westmoreland Bank <em>v. </em>Rainey, <a href="/watts/1/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Watts 26" data-case-ids="1838068" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0026-01">1 Watts 26</a>, it was decided that the issuing of a sci. fa. within five years, but to which the return was nihil, and an alias did not issue for five terms, nor until five years had expired, did not continue the lien. If the return had been <em>tarde venit, </em>or if an effective service on the first writ had been made on tho terre-tenant, as was held by our brother Strong, in Silverthorn <em>v. </em>Townsend, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20263" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Wright 263">1 Wright 263</a>, the lapse of time before issuing the alias would not have postponed’.’ Whatever therefore may be said that Westmoreland Bank <em>v. </em>Rainey, was decided under the second section of the Act 26(,h March 1827, and the Act 23d March 1829, the Supreme Court seem to regard it as establishing the rule just stated. This rule, I think, is decisive of this case; for there was no partial nor effective service of the first writ. The case stated, shows that Scott was the assignee of Cash for the benefit of creditors. He was not a purchaser; had no title to the land, except as naked trustee. Calling and serving him as terre-tenant did not place him in that relation. The return to the first writ therefore, was, in effect, nihil. No terre-tenants had been named in it, and it was not until nearly twenty months thereafter that the alias was issued, in which they were named. At that time six years and eight months had elapsed since the judgment was entered, and McIntyre’s deed had been on record five years and five months. Practically, if terre-tenants are not named in the scire facias, the plaintiff must direct the sheriff on whom to serve the writ. Doing neither, until so much time had elapsed, I think the lands of the terre-tenants were discharged from the lien. * * * Silverthorn <em>v. </em>Townsend decided that a plaintiff had five years, as his sci. fa. was sued out, to prosecute it to judgment, qualified, however, with the fact that it was served on tho terre-tenants in time. It exploded the dicta that it must be prosecuted in a year and a day, or it would <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>be held to be an abandonment.
