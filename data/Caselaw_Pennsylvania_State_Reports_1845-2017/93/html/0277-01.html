M. paid certain assessments for the formation of this fund. In 1877 a further amendment was adopted by the Exchange, wherein it was provided “ that any suspended member who shall have failed for three months to pay in full all gratuity dues and assessments, shall forthwith cease to be a full member for the purpose of” participation in the gratuity fund. M. failed to pay his regular quarterly dues for the several quarters from March 31st L877 and ending June 30th 1878 ; also the annual sums payable to the gratuity fund December 1st 1877, and the several asssessments due from him to the gratuity fund by reason of the deaths of members which occurred on the 7th of August and 9th of September 1877, and in August 1878. On the 6th of August 1878 he was suspended for the non-payment of his regular quarterly duos. In April previous he had become insane, and in November 1878 he died. <em>Held, </em>that having subscribed to the constitution and by-laws, and the amendment of 1877 having been made in accordance therewith, he could not be permitted to question its validity, and was bound thereby. <em>Held, further, </em>that having failed to pay his dues and assessments for the benefit of the gratuity fund, he ceased to be a full member for the purposes of said fund. With his loss of full membership his right to the gratuity fund fell with it during his life, and there was nothing to transmit to his representatives.</p>

The plaintiff sought to recover under a right claimed to have existed in her father James J. MacDowell at the time of his death. In 3865, he became a member of the stock exchange. An amendment to the constitution was adopted ’ in 1875, for the benefit of all full members of the stock exchange who, in addition to all other payments, which under the by-laws he was required to make, should at the time of his admission pay to the trustees a sum specified, and the like sum annually on the first day uf each December, and on the death of any full member a certain other specified sum. The fund thus to be created was styled the “ Gratuity Fund.” It was provided that -within thirty days after the death of any full member, the nominee, widow, child or children, or legal representatives of those who were full members at the time of their death should be paid a gratuity of two thousand dollars. It was also declared that a full member for this purpose should be construed to mean a member owning a seat in the stock exchange whether suspended or otherwise.

It <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>declares “ that any suspended member who shall have failed for three months to pay in full, all gratuity dues and assessments, shall forthwith cease to be a full member for the purposes of” interest in the gratuity fund, but might be restored to such full membership by a favorable report of the. standing committee “ on payment of all arrears of gratuity dues and assessments.”</p>

The right of MacDowell in this gratuity fund was grafted on his existing membership in the stock exchange. The same power that created it could, in the manner prescribed, modify its enjoyment. It is conceded That all the forms required by the constitution and by-laws to amend the constitution were duly observed in the adoption of the amendment in November 1877. He was not then under any mental disability. If not then present he could have been had he so desired. He in no manner dissented therefrom. Having then voluntarily refrained from participating in the amendment, and not dissenting therefrom, we do not see how he could afterwards have denied its full effect. Nor could his dissent have relieved him therefrom. Having subscribed to the constitution and by-laws, and the change having been made in accordance therewith, he could not be permitted to question its validity. He could not enjoy the benefits of the fund without performing his part towards creating it. It was a fund kept separate from all other sources of revenue, and could be supported only by the payment of the several sums and assessments especially appropriated <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>thereto. The case stated admits that from the time his dues began to be in arrear in 1877, he continued indebted until his death, and “ during this time his attention was frequently called to the fact of his indebtedness by the secretary and treasurer of the exchange.” He was liable to suspension for failing to pay his regular quarterly dues. For this he was suspended, after repeated notice of his delinquency. Thereafter, in the words of the constitution, he “ failed for three months to pay in full all gratuity dues and assessments,” and “forthwith ceased to be a full member for purposes” of this fund, and was so found by the referee.</p>

He was in default in the payment of five separate quarterly dues; of two assessments to the gratuity fund; and of one annual dues to the same fund before he was committed to the hospital. Subsequent mental incapacity did not relieve him from the effect of previous neglect and refusal to discharge his legal and just duty. With his loss of full membership, under laws existing when he became a member, his right to the gratuity fund fell with it during his life, and there was nothing to transmit to the plaintiff.</p>
