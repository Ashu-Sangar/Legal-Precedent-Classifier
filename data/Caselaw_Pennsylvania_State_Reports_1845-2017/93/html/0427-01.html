In an action by a father to recover damages for the death of his son by the alleged negligence of a railroad company, the defendant requested the court to charge that the plaintiff, being about to drive a team, with two mules and a horse on the lead, across a railroad track, with a loaded wagon, where trains were running propelled by steam, having placed his son, seven years of age, on the lead horse, over which he (the father) had no control, was guilty of negligence in placing his son in such a dangerous position, and cannot recover for the loss of the life of his son or his horse killed by the passing train ; which the court answered: “ This point, assumes a fact, the existence or non-existence of which is a question for your determination, to wit: That the plaintiff placed his son on a horse over which he had no control. This is for you, and we cannot assume it. If it were true it would be strong evidence of negligence. It is for you to find, under all the evidence in the case, whether there was negligence either on the part of the plaintiff or of his son, who was killed, which contributed to the'production of the accident. If there was such contributing negligence, the plaintiff cannot recover.” <em>Held, </em>that the assumption in the point forbade its affirmance, and that it could have been well refused without any qualifying remarks. <em>Held, further, </em>that there was error in the remark that if the assumed facts were true, it would be strong evidence of negligence, for on the verity of the facts as assumed, without reference to other proofs, the plaintiff was guilty of negligence, and as it was not certain that this error did the defendant no harm, the judgment must be reversed.</p>

His team consisted of a hay wagon, two mules and a horse on the lead. In going to the stable, he had to cross the track of the defendant’s railroad, which at this point runs through a well-built up portion of the town. He had crossed the track along this road driving the two mules, and bad sent his son with the horse by another road which passes under the railroad track, but which at that time was impassable for wagons. The son was a strong and very intelligent lad about seven years old, and who was accustomed to assist his father in various ways. While the plaintiff was loading the manure at the stable, the lad brought the horse up and geared him to the wagon, and when his father was ready to start, he jumped on the horse’s back and the team started off. There was no line attached to the horse, the boy on his back controlling him by the bridle, while the father walked by the side of the near mule, and taking him by the bridle thus directed the movements of the team. There is an incline on either side of the railroad track at the point of the crossing, and at the foot of this, about sixty feet from the track, the plaintiff stopped the team. Erom this point the track is only visible a few feet in a westerly direction, the view being obstructed by the houses, but at about ten to twelve feet from the track the view in <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>the same direction is unobstructed for about four hundred and sixty-eight foot, and from the middle of the track the view is clear for 1500 feet. The crossing is made of planks laid down between the rails and making an even surface. When plaintiff stopped his team, he proceeded alone to the middle of the track, and stood there looking in both directions and listening for about a half minute, and not seeing or hearing a train, he called to the boy to come on, and plaintiff • walked back to his usual place and took the near mule by the bridle.» At the moment when the horse reached the first rail of the track, the plaintiff heard a train approaching. He shouted and jerked the mule back, but the horse had gotten on the track, was struck by the east-bound train, and instantly killed. The boy was thrown on the truck of' the engine in front of the boiler, and died a few hours after the accident from his injuries. There was a conflict of evidence as to the speed of the train. One witness testified that both he and the plaintiff shouted, but that within three seconds from the time the train was in sight the accident occurred. It was alleged on the part of the plaintiff, that the speed of the train was in excess of that allowed by the ordinance of the borough. The evidence as to the rate of speed varied from eight to twenty-five miles an hour. The testimony was equally conflicting as to whether the whistle of the engine was blown or its bell rung.</p>

The declaration joins a claim for damages under the statute for an injury causing death, the damages for which belong to two persons, with a cause of action at common law, for the loss of a horse and funeral expenses of a child belonging to one person ; and the verdict is for a gross sum, and is expressly found by the jury to be for “$2176, for horse and funeral expenses included,” without designating the proportions for each, upon which no judgment can be entered. 4. There is a misjoinder of parties and causes of action, and a verdict for a gross sum upon which no judgment can be-entered. 5. There is a judgment for a gross sum for causes of action, which as stated in the declaration, belong to different parties, without designating which part belongs to each, upon which no judgment can be entered.</p>

Is there such error here ? The wrong complained of in the <em>narr. </em>is negligence resulting in, 1. The killing of the plaintiff’s minor son, whereby he lost his services and was put to expense in taking care of and burying his body ; 2. The killing of his horse. When the jury was about to be empanelled it was agreed by the parties <em>‘ </em>that this action shall.be tried in the same manner and with the same effect as if Linda Bock, wife of plaintiff, had been a party plaintiff thereto, and that the recovery, if any is had, shall include all her demands against the defendant, and that she shall be concluded by the ver<a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>diet should it be in favor of the defendant.’ We do not regard this as making the wife a party to the suit. We look upon it rather as an agreement that the entire damages should be determined and recovered in the suit by the husband, and that in consideration thereof the defendant should not thereafter be molested by any claim by or for the wife. But suppose we consider the agreement as placing her as a party plaintiff on the record? How does this render an error apparent on its face ? The effect would be to j oin her as a plaintiff on every count and upon every statement of ownership or claim. Instead of a separate cause of action in the husband for separate injuries to him, we should have a statement of a joint cause of action for injury to joint property in the horse, joint expenses in the burial of the son, and joint loss by reason of his death. The declaration would still be a consistent whole. There would be nothing there to show the several items if the demand were in different rights. The error, if any, in this respect, would be on the trial and not on the face of the record. We see nr reason why the common-law claim for the loss of the horse, and the statutory claim for the loss of the son, may not be joined in the same declaration. They are of the same nature, admit of the same pleas and are followed by the same judgment: 1 Ch.

It was earnestly argued that the testimony authorized the co.urt to assume the fact. Perhaps, in all the farming and mining portions of the state, there i's not a judge or juror who would say a man could have no control of the lead horse unless he has a line on him. Be this as it may, it is not a question of law for the court to say. Where there is no line there is no control. The point could have been well refused without qualifying remark, and had it been there would have been no cause for complaint. Its assumed facts are but a fraction of the story, and the part omitted shows the plaintiff’s care before his attempt to cross the track, and that he was caught too suddenly for escape. In the light of the evidence, the court could not say the plaintiff was negligent, unless it is negligence in itself for a teamster to cross a railway track with his little son riding the lead horse — a proposition which has not been advanced. Excepting one remark, the instructions to the jury were accurate, adequate and applicable to the proofs, enabling them to intelligently dispose of the questions submitted.
