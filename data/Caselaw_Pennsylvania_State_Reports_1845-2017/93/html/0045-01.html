      <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>The opposite construction violates the law of perpetuity. See our statute against Trusts of Accumulation (18th April 1853, sect. 9; Purd. Dig., p. 1245), restricting them to one life, that of testator or donor, and twenty-one years. And in Hillyard <em>v. </em>Miller, 10 Barr 326, the court, Gibson, C. J., say: “The rules against perpetuities and trusts of accumulation are the same, the mischief being the same.” Piad Mrs. Ebbs survived the child Florence Phillips, the trust till her death would have been one of accumulation, as there would have been no one to take meanwhile. The limitation over was not to take effect till the death of Mrs. Ebbs should determine the ultimate donees; and, as she might have lived till after the death of Florence Ebbs plus twenty-one years, it comes within the decision (Davenport <em>v. </em>Harris, <a href="/grant/3/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Grant 164" data-case-ids="229131" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0164-01">3 Grant 164</a>), that future estates limited on a life estate and twenty-one years, not <em>sure </em>to take effect within that time, are void. The limitation over was to such persons as would have been entitled had Mrs. Ebbs died possessed thereof after the death of her daughter Florence without surviving issue. This limitation was void for uncertainty as to the persons to take under such <em>deseriptio personarum; </em>and uncertainty of meaning determines the construction in favor of descent by law: Lipman’s Appeal, 6 Casey 184.</p>

And, as was said in Morris <em>v. </em>Stephens, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20200" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Wright 200">10 Wright 200</a>, a grantor cannot “expect the courts to substitute their certainty .for his uncertainty.”</p>

How is it possible to assert that a limitation to take effect at furthest on the death of a grantee in a deed, is a perpetuity ? The argument seems to rest on the possibility (upon the assumption that Mrs. Ebbs’s actual death is the period for vesting), that there may be an interval between the contingency happening and <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>that event, and that the statute relating to accumulations prohibits this.

The property is in a trustee, and the court cannot give it to one who under no possible circumstances is entitled because of an uncertainty whether A., B. or C. may be the proper persons. Florence Ebbs Phillips was to be entitled to a conveyance only on attaining twenty-ono. As she died at the age of ten, it is difficult to see how her administrator can be entitled. It is for the persons who may thus be entitled either to litigate, or combine and settle the difficulty among themselves ; and this record shows they have done so by consenting to the decree that has been made.</p>

It declares the trust to be for the separate use of Florence during her life, then in trust for her children living at the time of her death, and the issue of such as should be deceased to be conveyed to them as they shall respectively attain twenty-one years of age. The provision which follows has given rise to this controversy : “ And in default of such children or issue attaining twenty-one years of age, then in trust for such person or persons as would have been entitled to the said property or securities had the party of the first part (the said Elizabeth Ebbs, the grantor) died possessed thereof after the death of the said Florence Ebbs without issue her surviving.” There is no uncertainty as is contended in this limitation over. It was not necessary to wait for the death of Mrs. Ebbs to ascertain who would be her next of kin, or who would have been entitled had she died possessed thereof after the death of Florence, without issue her surviving. It is not like a limitation of real estate to the heirs of a person living, where tlie rule <em>nemo est hceres viventis </em>might create a difficulty. The next of kin of a person is ascertainable at any period which may be named for the vesting of a fund or estate. The words “ attaining twenty-one years of age” apply to both classes — children living at the death of Florence and the issue of deceased children. When, therefore, the only child of Florence who survived her died under twenty-one, the limitation over took effect to the persons who were then the next of kin of Mrs. Ebbs. There was no violation of the rule against perpetuities, no possibility that the estate could have been tied up for a longer period than a life or <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>lives in being and twenty-one years after. When tbe deed was executed Florence of course was in full life, and the ultimate limitation could not reach beyond twenty-one years after her death. At that period the absolute estate must vest in the persons at that time the next of kin of Mrs. Ebbs, whether she was then living or dead. The intention is very plain that Mrs. Ebbs did not mean this fund to pass to any who were not of her blood. There was nothing in the provision of the deed which was contrary to law. The intention of a deed is as much the governing rule of construction as in a will, except that the former still requires formal words of limitation to make an estate of inheritance in conveyances of real estate.</p>
