It is critical to note that in both <em>Scalise </em>and <em>Frazier </em>the injured employee (or his widow) filed suit against the third-party tortfeasor.

F.M. Venzie, </em><a href="/pa/301/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="301 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="1126454" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0315-01">301 Pa. 315</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%2090" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="152 A. 90">152 A. 90</a> (1930), this procedure affords the employer/insurer a means to vindicate its right to recovery of payments made because of injuries caused by a third-party tortfeasor in situations where the injured employee elects not to bring suit in his or her own capacity. <em>See also </em>7 West’s Pa. Prac., Workers’ Compensation § 12:13 (3d. ed.) (endorsing “use practice” as a means by which the employer/insurer may assert its subrogation right by bringing an action “on behalf of the injured employee.”). However, ultimately, I find myself in agreement with the view expressed by Chief Justice Saylor in his Dissenting Opinion that the manner in which Liberty Mutual captioned the instant proceeding, “as subrogee of George Lawrence,” is not fatal to its claim, as it is the functional equivalent of bringing this proceeding in the capacity of a “use-plaintiff.”</p>

Beane, </em><a href="/pa/541/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="541 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="470766" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0449-01">541 Pa. 449</a>, <a href="/pa/541/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="664 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="470766,7862380" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0449-01,/a2d/664/0096-01">664 A.2d 96</a>, 100 (1995) (“The equitable doctrine of subrogation places the subrogee in the precise position of the one to whose rights he is subrogated.”). Consequently, for the reasons expressed by Chief Justice <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>Saylor, I view Liberty Mutual’s complaint, although not expressly styled as such, to be of the type which our Court sanctioned in <em>Scalise, </em>and I deem Liberty Mutual’s status in this litigation to be that of a “use-plaintiff,” because it is asserting the legal claims of an injured individual in a civil action, as if it were that person. <em>Cf; Grubnau v. Centennial Nat. Bank, </em><a href="/pa/279/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="279 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1083471" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0501-01">279 Pa. 501</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.%20142" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="124 A. 142">124 A. 142</a> (1924) (use-plaintiffs right to maintain an action is wholly dependent on the right of the actual injured plaintiff to maintain such a suit).</p>
    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[211,784,1148,406]]]'>I raise an additional point, however, which I believe bears emphasis. In my view, it is critical that the actual plaintiff— here, the injured employee — be served with a copy of the subrogee’s complaint so that the employee may, if he or she desires, retain counsel and actively participate in the action. Such service ensures the injured employee may actively prosecute all claims he or she may possess, and not leave the conduct of the litigation solely in the hands of the subrogee.</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[208,1211,1149,914]]]'>Indeed, I deem this requirement to be particularly important in cases such as this, inasmuch as a workers’ compensation subrogee is precluded by 77 P.S. § 319 from recovering any damages in excess of what it paid to the injured employee in workers’ compensation benefits. Consequently, the subro-gee has no incentive to pursue claims for additional damages which the injured employee might ordinarily seek in his or her own capacity. Giving an injured employee notice of a subro-gee’s suit is essential, as it allows the injured employee to actively participate in and direct the scope and course of discovery, trial preparation, or the conduct of settlement negotiations in the proceeding where the final fate of his or her claims is irrevocably decided. To be sure, as Chief Justice Saylor notes, were Liberty Mutual’s instant action to be litigated to final judgment, any subsequent action brought by Lawrence would be barred under the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>Dissenting Opinion (Saylor, C.J.), at 481-82, 113 A.3d at 1241-42.</p>

However, in my view, such a wholly discretionary process is insufficiently protective of the important fundamental rights of the injured employee at stake in these situations. It seems to me the better practice, then, is to require the subrogee to provide notice to the injured employee upon commencement of its action as use-plaintiff. Requiring such notice would also be consistent with the principle reaffirmed by the majority that there should be no splitting of an injured employee’s cause of action against a third-party tortfeasor, in order to ensure that the injured employee may still prosecute all causes of action in the manner he or she sees fit, even if the subrogee commences suit <em>first.</em>

Additionally, I would direct the Committee to address suitable service requirements when these types of actions are commenced by a subrogee, in order to ensure that the subrogor, whose claim the subrogee is litigating, receives adequate notice and the opportunity to participate in the action.</p>
