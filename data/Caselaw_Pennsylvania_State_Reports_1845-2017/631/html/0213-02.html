      <em>Mazzetti, </em>which the Superior Court relied on for the proposition that § 9721(a.1) permits the imposition of intermediate punishment even when there is a mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration, dealt with the discrete issue of “whether the Commonwealth’s waiver of application of the school zone mandatory minimum sentence, under 18 Pa.C.S. § 6317, at the original sentencing precludes the Commonwealth from subsequently seeking its application following the revocation of probation.” <em>Mazzetti, </em>at 60 (footnote omitted).

      <em>Hansley </em>involved the RRRI Act, under which a defendant initially sentenced to a minimum state sentence, if determined by the sentencing court to be eligible, is released on parole before the minimum sentence’s expiration. The issue in <em>Hansley </em>was whether the RRRI Act applies to defendants sentenced to mandatory minimum terms required by the drug trafficking sentencing provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 6317 and 7508. Although we held the RRRI Act applies to such defendants, we noted that when the General Assembly drafted the Act, it simultaneously amended certain Sentencing Code provisions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> thereby evincing its awareness of the Act’s effect on mandatory minimum sentences and its desire that the Act work in conformity with existing sentencing statutes. <em>See Hansley, </em>at 1190. No such intent is manifest in the Sentencing Code with respect to § 7508 itself; the only reason § 7508’s mandatory minimum provision was held not to apply in <em>Hansley </em>was because the defendant received an RRRI Act sentence along with the mandatory minimum sentence under § 7508, which is not the case here. An RRRI Act minimum sentence is imposed “ ‘in addition to a minimum sentence,’ not instead of the minimum sentence.” <em>Id., </em>at 1189 (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>61 Pa.C.S. § 4505(c)(l)-(2).

Here, such classification is likewise “mutable” — in <em>Hans-ley, </em>we assumed § 7508 was the special provision, but it can be viewed as both special (pertaining to drug offenses) and general (prescribing mandatory minimum sentences). Therefore, we decline to use such nomenclature or employ a "general vs. special” analysis, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1933, when a reading of the statutes <em>in pari materia </em>resolves the issue.</p>

Given the material ambiguity and Section 9763’s integral interrelationship with the County Intermediate Punishment program established by the General Assembly, I support the Superior Court’s approach in construing “specific[ ] authorization]” under Section 9721(a.1) according to the only eligibility criteria which exist, as provided under the legislative county intermediate punishment scheme. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9802 (defining “eligible offender” in terms broad enough to include Appellee).
