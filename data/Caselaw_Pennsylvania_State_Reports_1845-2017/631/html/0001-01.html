The following is a summary of the facts pertinent to the issues now raised. After a domestic dispute that resulted in Harrisburg <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>police escorting Appellant from his wife’s apartment during the afternoon of February 1, 2000, Appellant returned to the premises in the early morning hours of February 2, having spent much of his time in the interim drinking alcohol with friends. Because he had been repeatedly phoning and leaving confrontational messages during that time, Appellant’s wife had left her apartment and another resident of the apartment, Duana Swanson, had alerted the Harrisburg police.</p>
    <p id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.4",68,[284,749,1147,900]]]'>When Appellant returned to the apartment, he assaulted Ms. Swanson, stabbing her in the chest with a knife. The police arrived to find Ms. Swanson in a prone position on the floor with Appellant straddling her, holding the knife. The officers commanded Appellant to drop the weapon, but Appellant replied “shoot me” and waved the knife at them. Appellant then stood up and retreated down a hallway to a bedroom. There, he picked up his wife’s fourteen-month-old son (by another man), held the knife to the baby’s neck, and again told police to “shoot me.” Appellant refused police commands to drop the weapon and release the baby. He retreated further down the hallway to a stairwell, where he slit the baby’s throat with the knife, killing him. Harrisburg Police Officer William Vernouski, who had followed Appellant to the stairwell, witnessed the killing. Officer Vernouski shot Appellant, and he was taken into custody. Appellant was charged with murder and attempted murder, among other crimes.</p>

Appellant told his attorneys that he wanted to present a defense of innocence and maintained, among other things, that Officer Vernouski had killed the child. Appellant maintained that the Commonwealth’s case against him was the result of a police conspiracy and cover-up, and he asked counsel to defend the charges against him accordingly. When counsel advised Appellant that the facts did not support such a defense, Appellant told counsel that he wanted to represent himself. Counsel filed a motion to withdraw, advising the court that Appellant wished to represent himself. On January 29, 2001, during a hearing on the motion, the court conducted a lengthy and thorough colloquy with Appellant. The court then granted the motion, permitted Appellant to proceed <em>pro se </em>and appointed Appellant’s former attorneys as standby counsel.</p>

As of August 1, 2002, the first day of trial, the Superior Court had not ruled on the petition, and thus jury selection commenced. Appellant inquired of potential jurors whether they could conclude that the police had engaged in a conspiracy or in other misconduct if facts were presented to substantiate those claims. He asked potential jurors if they would be “willing to accept the possibility that a law enforcement officer may get on the stand and lie?” N.T. Jury Selection, at 69. Appellant probed potential jurors for any negative biases they might have had toward Muslims or <em>pro se </em>litigants.

To that end, Appellant presented the testimony of his own expert witness in forensics and crime-scene investigation, who described the blood patterns at the scene. The court had previously granted Appellant’s <em>pro se </em>request for DNA testing, and at trial, the Commonwealth stipulated to the' findings contained in the DNA report showing that genetic material from someone other than Appellant and the baby had been recovered in the stairwell in which the incident occurred. In addition, in an apparent effort to potentially establish diminished capacity, Appellant presented the testimony of several persons with whom he had been drinking in the hours before he had returned to the apartment.

Standby counsel then reiterated a request “for funds on behalf of the Defendant to obtain a psychologist for the penalty phase,” a request that had previously been denied. N.T.

Thus, Appellant’s first four issues assert that Appellant raised an issue of material fact in his PCRA petition that he was (1) legally incompetent to stand trial, (2) incompetent to waive his right to counsel pretrial, (3) incompetent to waive his right to present mitigation evidence during the penalty phase, and (4) incompetent to represent himself.

With respect to Appellant’s <em>pro se </em>motion alleging a double jeopardy violation, for example, the trial court noted that although the motion was frivolous, it nonetheless, “demonstrated to this [c]ourt that [Appellant] at least understood the concept of double jeopardy and how it [might] ultimately [aid] in his defense.” Memorandum Order at 2, n.2. The double jeopardy claim was indeed frivolous, based as it was on an allegation that Appellant had been tried by a jury of his peers while incarcerated at Dauphin County Prison, but frivolous claims are not uncommon when defendants untrained in the law represent themselves. Nor, unfortunately, is it unusual to see fanciful or absurd claims raised by <em>pro se </em>litigants. The act of filing a frivolous motion, whether alleging double jeopardy or otherwise, does not necessarily suggest incompetence any more than it suggests a lack of legal training. And, this is particularly so where the trial court had the benefit of a report and finding of competency in the report from MSH and the court’s own observation.

Thus, Appellant’s adherence to his claim of innocence did not prove the need for a competency evaluation. This is even more so given the record evidence of Appellant’s handling of his own representation, during which he filed pre-trial motions and a pre-trial appeal, actively participated in voir dire, performed direct- and cross-examination of witnesses, and testified on his own behalf. Indeed, Appellant attempted at trial, albeit unsuccessfully, to show that the blood stains at the scene, including the blood stains in the stairwell and on his clothing, precluded an inference that he had killed the baby. These record circumstances show that, at the time of trial, he was not substantially unable to understand the nature or object of the proceedings against him or to participate and assist in his defense. Accordingly, we hold that the amended petition in this matter did not raise a material fact requiring an eviden-tiary hearing on the competency claims.

Appellant relies upon bare statistical evidence, focusing on the Commonwealth’s strikes in isolation, with no account of the effect that his own peremptory challenges had upon the jury pool. “A raw lack of racial or gender equivalency in a party’s use of peremptory challenges alone does [not] prove purposeful discrimination in jury selection, much less discrimination so overt that trial counsel was obliged to object.” <em>Sepulveda, </em><a href="/pa/618/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="165" data-cite="55 A.3d 1108" data-case-ids="3901111,7312684" data-case-paths="/pa/618/0262-01,/a3d/55/1108-01">55 A.3d at 1132</a>.

Appellant made no claim that attorney Ferguson was involved in his prosecution, but argued that by virtue of his employment, attorney Ferguson would have known that Appellant’s trial strategy included attempts to show that the Commonwealth presented perjured police testimony. He then argues that such alleged knowledge proves a conflict adversely affecting attorney Ferguson’s performance on direct appeal.

This is not the first time the FCDO has sought to expand <em>Brown </em>and, as noted by the Per Curiam Opinion, the Court unfortunately has reviewed unpreserved challenges to the very different claim of competency to waive the right to counsel on at least two other occasions, broadly stating that a majority of the Court has agreed that competency claims are not subject to the waiver provision of the PCRA. <em>Spotz, </em><a href="/pa/616/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="257" data-cite="47 A.3d 63" data-case-ids="4208456,7312412" data-case-paths="/pa/616/0164-01,/a3d/47/0063-01">47 A.3d at 79, n. 6</a>; <em>Spotz, </em><a href="/pa/610/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="258" data-cite="18 A.3d 244" data-case-ids="4201975,7280594" data-case-paths="/pa/610/0017-01,/a3d/18/0244-01">18 A.3d at 262, n. 10</a>.

But, it is now crystal clear what the FCDO is up to: it dresses up other defaulted claims in the garb of “incompetence” in an attempt to get the defendant out from under his knowing and voluntary decision to represent himself. I remain of the belief that the decisions in <em>Brown </em>and <em>Spotz </em>should be prospectively overruled.</p>

The Court correctly rejects appellant’s arguments and disposes of these twin frivolous issues, based upon the pre-trial findings by the Mayview State Hospital psychiatrist, the trial record, the contemporaneous evidence, and the trial court’s first-hand observations.</p>

Appellant made the decision to represent himself at trial and he raised no objections in this regard. Appellant was both presumed to be competent to stand trial, and was actually found to be competent. That contemporaneous competency determination subsumed appellant’s lesser-included claims of incompetency for specific purposes now forwarded retrospectively by the FCDO. These claims are plainly waived under the PCRA; nothing in <em>Brown </em>supports a judicial negation of the legislative judgment embodied in the PCRA; and appellant forwards no developed argument as to why the legislation should be ignored. These claims should be identified and dismissed as frivolous.</p>

Appellant now alleges direct appeal counsel ineffectiveness in litigating the claim (Claim III). Appellant avers that “there are readily identifiable reasons why the trial court’s colloquy was inadequate to sustain a waiver of counsel.... Appellate counsel, however, failed to bring those specific deficits to this Court’s attention.” Appellant’s Brief at 54. Appellant cites this Court’s observation on direct appeal that he did “not identify, let alone elaborate upon, any information or right that the court failed to explain to him” in support of his challenge to the colloquy. <em>Blakeney, </em><a href="/pa/596/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="259" data-cite="946 A.2d 645" data-case-ids="4088729,4088960,8382171,8382246" data-case-paths="/pa/596/0509-01,/pa/596/0510-01,/a2d/946/0645-01,/a2d/946/0645-02">946 A.2d at 656</a>. Indulging a typical FCDO tautology, appellant also argues that appellate counsel should have known that appellant’s waiver was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary because, of course, appellant was incompetent at the time he waived his right to the assistance of counsel. This claim likewise is frivolous. Although dressed up as an attack on appellate counsel’s failures on direct appeal, appellant is actually challenging the failure to object at trial to an allegedly deficient colloquy. By choosing to represent himself, appellant alone is responsible for that trial level default, and there <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>is no cognizable claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness: this is just more FCDO obstruction and smoke screen.</p>

Although inartfully phrased, appellant’s apparent intention in this claim is to argue that the jurors’ alleged bias was not discovered until after the trial, and could not have been previously raised, and, for that reason the claim is not waived. I would hold that this sort of claim — premised upon a collateral attack upon the honesty and integrity of members of the jury — is not cognizable under the PCRA. The cases appellant cites speak to the jury selection process, and involve preserved challenges. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Brief at 81. None of those cases remotely suggested that a cognizable constitutional claim arises from a party’s later collateral attacks upon jurors. Moreover, even if such a practice were someday deemed proper, the “new” information the FCDO alleges about the two jurors does not remotely demonstrate juror “bias” in a constitutional sense. This issue plainly is frivolous.</p>

Both requests were granted (at a time when the Court was less attuned to the FCDO’s obstructionist agenda in capital cases).
