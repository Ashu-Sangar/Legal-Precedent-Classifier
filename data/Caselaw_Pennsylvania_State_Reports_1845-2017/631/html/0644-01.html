This is because, as these cases consistently recognize, an individual who is in custody is subject to the inherently coercive pressures attendant to that situation and its concomitant deleterious effect on the individual’s ability to exercise free will and to make truly voluntary decisions. By contrast, in non-custodial situations, there is no danger that, in responding to police questioning, the compulsive pressure created by the circumstances of detention will lead to an involuntary waiver by the individual of his or her Fifth Amendment rights. This is consistent with the high Court’s oft-expressed opinion that an individual who is not in custody possesses the freedom to terminate police questioning at any time, and, thus, can avoid the type of “police badgering” the high Court was concerned with preventing through the <em>Miranda-Edwards </em>line of cases. <em>See, e.g., Montejo, </em><a href="/us/556/0778-01" class="citation" data-index="203" data-cite="556 U.S. 778" data-case-ids="3653776" data-case-paths="/us/556/0778-01">556 U.S. at 795</a>, <a href="/us/556/0778-01" class="citation" data-index="204" data-cite="556 U.S. 778" data-case-ids="3653776" data-case-paths="/us/556/0778-01">129 S.Ct. 2079</a> (“When a defendant is not in custody, he is in control, and need only shut his door or walk away to avoid police badgering.”).</p>

Its third example— invocation of <em>Miranda </em>rights at a preliminary hearing, which is conducted post-arrest — frequently involves non-custodial situations where the individual invoking such rights has been <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>released on bail or his or her own recognizance at the time of the hearing.

Although questioning individuals taken into custody remains a vital tool in solving crime, it is by no means the only means to do so, especially in light of substantial advances in modem forensic science. <em>See, e.g., </em>Professor Marcy Strauss, <em>"The Sounds of Silence: Reconsidering the Invocation of the Right to Remain Silent Under Miranda," </em><a href="/citations/?q=17%20Wm.%20%26%20Mary%20Bill%20Rts.%20J.%20773" class="citation" data-index="274" data-cite="17 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts.

Moreover, an individual who has requested the assistance of counsel to deal with interrogation may still, at any time, reconsider that request and approach police to discuss the case with them even if counsel has not been provided. <em>See Edwards, </em><a href="/us/451/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="277" data-cite="451 U.S. 477" data-case-ids="6187603" data-case-paths="/us/451/0477-01">451 U.S. at 484-85</a>, <a href="/us/451/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="278" data-cite="451 U.S. 477" data-case-ids="6187603" data-case-paths="/us/451/0477-01">101 S.Ct. 1880</a>. Furthermore, and importantly, once counsel has been provided, police are free to renew their request to speak with the individual, and he or she may, after consultation with that attorney, agree to speak with police with the attorney present. Assuring access to counsel requested by an individual in custody merely serves to confirm that any statements given during a subsequent custodial interrogation are, in actuality, the product of a free and voluntary choice. <em>See Miranda, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="279" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. at 470</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="280" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. 1602</a> ("If the accused decides to talk to his interrogators, the assistance of counsel can mitigate the dangers of untrustworthiness.”).</p>
