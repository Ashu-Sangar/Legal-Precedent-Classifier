In particular, the Union highlights that the Local Board only became the fiscal agent for WIA-funded activities in November 2009 because the County designated it as such, and the <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>Local Board only went forward with its plan to seek competitive bids after receiving approval from the County. Additionally, the Union observes that the Local Board communicated to bidders that any provider selection would be subject to approval by the County. In all these dealings, the Union maintains, the Local Board evidenced that it understood and accepted that it was acting on behalf of the County, and that the County was in overall control of the situation. The Union contends that the County, as well, manifested its intention that the Local Board would act on its behalf, again, primarily by designating the Local Board as its fiscal agent. Thus, the Union asserts that all three elements of common-law agency were satisfied. <em>See Scott v.

The court concluded that the borough had not committed an unfair labor practice by failing to bargain because a third party — the district justice — was responsible for reduced overtime (and, thus, reduced overtime pay). In reaching this decision, the court explained that, although the district justice accommodated the borough’s request, he could have ignored the request without consequence to himself; hence, the change in practice was attributable to the district justice and not the borough. <em>See <a href="/a2d/731/0670-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="731 A.2d 670" data-case-ids="11667234" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/0670-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/731/0670-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="731 A.2d 670" data-case-ids="11667234" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/0670-01">at 674</a>. Likewise, the PLRB argues, the Local Board is an independent third party because its members do not serve at the pleasure of County officials and can only be removed for violating conflict of interest rules— meaning that the County lacked power to force the Local Board to award the work in question to County employees. Along these lines, the PLRB proffers that the Local Board is similar to a municipal authority, which is not an agent or representative of the municipality that created it, but is an independent agency. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In this regard, the PLRB suggests that, if the Union believes that the Local Board lacked authority to enter into the contracts without the County’s approval, it should not seek a remedy with the PLRB based on allegations against the County.

The County also disputes the Union’s contention that the elements of an agency relationship were present, suggesting that any such claim is undermined by the actions of the County and Local Board and the statutory framework.

Second, these aspects of the enactments indicate that it is the local workforce investment board that is, in the first instance, meant to be involved in provider selection.

Throughout her testimony, Ms. Petrilla used the term "fiscal agent” to describe the status that had attached, first to the County Agency, and then to the Local Board. In context she appears to have intended the term to subsume the concept of a local grant subrecipient per subsections 2832(d)(3)(B)(i)(II) and 501(c)(2). The WIA and WDA do not define "fiscal agent” or clearly delineate the phrase as a concept distinct from that of local grant subrecipient. If anything, the acts often appear to use the terms interchangeably. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202832" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 2832">29 U.S.C. § 2832</a>(d)(3)(B)(i)(II); 24 P.S. § 6250.501(c)(2).
