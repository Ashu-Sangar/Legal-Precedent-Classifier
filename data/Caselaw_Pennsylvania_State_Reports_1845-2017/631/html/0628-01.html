The Property Owners, on the other hand, took the position that the exclusion was unclear, and coverage should be deemed to be negated only upon injury to an employee of the specific insured seeking coverage.

Windt, 3 Ins. Claims and Disputes § 11:8 (6th ed.2014) (framing the different lines of authority).

Notably, the <em>PMA </em>Court took pains to solidify the position that the term "the insured,” as used in an employers' liability exclusion, consistently encompasses named insureds. <em>See, e.g., PMA, </em><a href="/pa/426/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="426 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="1908628" data-case-paths="/pa/426/0453-01">426 Pa. at 456</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20548" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="233 A.2d 548">233 A.2d at 550</a> (“ ‘The insured’ ... merely has been interpreted as the language dictates, to include the named insured.”). Accordingly, although the <em>PMA </em>Court forcefully denied that it had equated the terms "the insured” and "any insured,” <em><a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20548" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="233 A.2d 548">id.</a> </em>(" ‘The insured' has <em>not </em>been interpreted to mean ‘an insured’ or ‘any insured.'"

We have framed the above proposition in terms of a general rule, because other indications and contextual cues appearing in an insurance policy may serve to render the meaning of "the insured” more apparent.

Notably, in this regard, these decisions are consistent with the majority view that such exclusion encompasses liability for injuries to family members of the named insured, regardless of whether the tortfeasor also is an insured under the salient vehicle liability policy. <em>See generally </em>Steven Plitt, Daniel Maldonado, Joshua D. Rogers, and Jordan R.

Appellant also argues that the umbrella policy provided a specific avenue to afford protection to the Property Owners, namely, the creation of an "insured contract" serving as an express exception to the employer's liability exclusion. <em>See </em>Complaint, Ex. C, Employer’s Liability Exclusion (rendering the clause inapplicable to "liability assumed by the insured under an ‘insured contract’ ’’). We disagree with Appellant’s position, however, to the degree to which it suggests that such prescription alleviates the ambiguities arising from the remaining text of the exclusion.</p>

In this regard, it is self-evident both that an insurance company legitimately would wish to focus upon the narrowest avenue of benefits relative to claims asserted by employees of a named insured (i.e., workers’ compensation insurance), whereas, a lessor just as appropriately would seek to enjoy protection against the broadest range of claims (to include those asserted by employees of the lessee). Appellant's "double payment” argument downplays both this diversity in the interests present and the potential impact of an employer's subrogation rights relative to workers' compensation payments. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 671.
