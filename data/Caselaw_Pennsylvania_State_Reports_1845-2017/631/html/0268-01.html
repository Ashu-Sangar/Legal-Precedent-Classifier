In August 2007, Appellee Wayne Harrison entered into a lease with Appellant Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corporation, per which Cabot obtained the exclusive right to explore oil-and-gas resources on Mr. Harrison’s property. In exchange, the company agreed to pay an initial bonus plus a one-eighth royalty on oil or gas successfully produced from the land. The instrument carried a “primary term” of five years, <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>but it also provided for an extended term “as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced ... in paying quantities from the premises[.]” <em>See generally T.W.

Via an amended complaint, the Harrisons centered the litigation upon their contention that the company had fraudulently induced Mr. Harrison to enter into the lease via an agent’s representation that Mr. Harrison would never receive any more than $100 per acre as a threshold bonus payment from a gas producing company. The Harrisons asserted that they subsequently learned of other landowner-lessors receiving higher payments.</p>

In support of this request, Cabot alleged that the cloud upon the lease created by the Harrisons’ suit had prevented the company from “prudently tak[ing] any steps to develop or commence operations on [Harrison’s] leasehold as allowed by the Lease.” Petition for Certification of Question of Law in <em>Harrison v.

In support of this position, the company pointed to other jurisdictions which have adopted such approach. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>
    <p id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[186,1181,1146,358]]]'>Cabot also filed a motion requesting certification to this Court. <em>See </em>Supreme Court Internal Operating Procedures § 8.

    <p id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.6",329,[185,1563,1148,303]]]'>Presently, Cabot grounds its position squarely on the principle that a party to a contract is entitled to the benefit of its bargain. <em>See, e.g., Ferrer v.

Indep. Oil &amp; Gas Ass’n, Marcellus Shale Coal., Chief Oil <em>&amp; </em>Gas, LLC, and Sw. Energy Prod. Co. [hereinafter the “Industry <em>Amici </em>”] at 3 (“While Pennsylvania was home to <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>the first oil well in the United States more than 150 years ago, advances in technology and discovery of the promise of the shale gas plays have dramatically increased the impact of the oil-and-gas industry in Pennsylvania in the last decade.”). According to the company, disparities in lease remunerations exist due to various factors, often depending upon the timing of lease consummation (particularly given the evolving knowledge relative to Marcellus Shale); the developing state of the technology; and fluctuating market conditions. Cabot suggests that such differences have incentivized some landowner-lessors to wrongfully contest the validity of oil-and-gas leases in hopes of securing the freedom to pursue more lucrative arrangements.</p>
    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[277,997,1147,1074]]]'>The problem facing oil-and-gas-producing companies, Cabot contends, is that such lease-validity lawsuits forestall drilling and well development, given the multimillion dollar investments attending such operations. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 16 (“It would be essentially impossible for a producer to place such an investment at risk while there remains pending a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the producer’s interest in the property.”); <em>accord </em>Brief for the Industry <em>Amici </em>at 6 (“[T]he expense of drilling generally, and especially for wells in unconventional formations such as the Marcellus Shale, is too great for any reasonable production company to go forward with drilling while there is a pending lease challenge.”). The result, the company indicates, is that producers are deprived of the full benefit of their bargains by meritless lease challenges. For these reasons, Cabot encourages this Court to follow the mainstream approach of other jurisdictions which have treated a meritless lease challenge as a repudiation and applied equitable remedial principles. <em>See supra </em>note 1. Indeed, the company highlights, this principle has become essentially one of black-letter law, as reflected in several prominent treatises in the field.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In particular, the company references the expectation remedy available to redress contractual breaches. <em>See, e.g., Ferrer, </em><a href="/pa/573/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="573 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="197228" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0310-01">573 Pa. at 340-41</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="825 A.2d 591" data-case-ids="197228,9116489" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0310-01,/a2d/825/0591-01">825 A.2d at 609</a>. Additionally, Cabot contends, Pennsylvania law provides that a party repudiates a contract, and thus effectuates an essential breach, when he makes an unequivocal statement that he will not perform in accordance with his agreement. <em>See, e.g., Jonnet Dev. Corp. v. Dietrich Indus., Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/316/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="316 Pa.

They may invest millions of dollars in drilling and completing a well only to find that it is defective or “dry” and therefore must be plugged and abandoned. Companies may spend millions of dollars acquiring gas leases that they later abandon because of unfavorable market or regulatory conditions. They may choose not to develop leased acreage because greater profits are to be had by drilling somewhere else. They also may choose not to invest in production while a lease challenge proceeds, but such business judgments are commonplace and do not warrant shifting the risk of litigation from multimillion-dollar corporations to small landowners such as Mr. Harrison.</blockquote>

Notably, several of the decisions cited by Cabot did involve some actual refusal by lessors to surrender possession of leasehold premises. <em>See, e.g., Bingham, </em><a href="/mont/148/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="148 Mont. 209" data-case-ids="5242141" data-case-paths="/mont/148/0209-01">420 P.2d at 841-42</a> (explaining that lessors had refused rentals and were unwilling to accept drilling by the lessee pursuing an equitable extension and concluding that the lessors therefore had "repudiated the lease by their various actions”), <em>cited in </em>Brief for Appellant at 24; <em>Muller v. Leyendecker, </em><a href="/sw2d/697/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="697 S.W.2d 668" data-case-ids="9980045" data-case-paths="/sw2d/697/0668-01">697 S.W.2d 668</a>, 672 (Tex.Ct.App.1985) (“[P]laintiff on several occasions peaceably demanded entry into and rightful possession of his lease premises. However, defendants refused plaintiffs’ possession of the leased premises.”), <em>cited in </em>Brief for Appellant at 22, 38. Certainly, this is not true of all (or even perhaps the majority) of the cases cited by Appellant. <em>See, e.g., Greer, </em><a href="/citations/?q=25%20N.E.2d%20805" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="25 N.E.2d 805">25 N.E.2d at 810</a> (“It has been suggested that [the lessee] could have proceeded to drill without regard to the suit and should not be permitted to claim the benefit of an estoppel unless it was actually prevented by court order or otherwise. In the cases from foreign jurisdictions this was not required, and when the great loss the lessee might suffer by successfully drilling a well and then losing title to the land is considered, we do not think that it should be required.”). Our point here is that the cases, factually at least, are not homogenous, and that some of the factual scenarios presented may reflect a repudiation and, thus, could yield the potential for redress upon the application of Pennsylvania law.</p>
