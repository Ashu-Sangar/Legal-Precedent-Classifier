Nevertheless, our analysis circles back to the centrality of the concept of an “owner” to CASPA. Where there is no “owner” for purposes of CASPA — because a “person” did not commission the construction in the first instance, 73 P.S. § 502 (defining “owner” in terms of a <em>person </em>with an interest in real estate) — there also <a id="p691" href="#p691" data-label="691" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*691</a>can be no “contractor” under the statute, given that a “contractor” must be engaged by an “owner.” <em><a href="/pa/625/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="93 A.3d 806" data-case-ids="4216924,4217332,6939251,6939306" data-case-paths="/pa/625/0563-01,/pa/625/0562-01,/a3d/93/0806-01,/a3d/93/0806-02">Id.</a> </em>Whether by intention or oversight, the Legislature simply did not design CASPA to apply independently to subcontracts in scenarios in which the foundational contract resides outside its boundaries. Thus, although we do not discount that the policy of CASPA would seem to be served by applying it to the present circumstances, such application is too disharmonious with the statutory mechanics to support the extension.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Moreover, we believe that our present reference to the relevant principle of narrow construction is salutary in terms of affording broader guidance, particularly given that several federal district courts have construed general terms to encompass the Commonwealth in a context in which there is no specific evidence that the Legislature intended such a construction. <em>See, e.g., Scandale, </em><a href="/f-supp-2d/455/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="455 F.
