    <blockquote id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.6",355,[237,665,1103,521]]]'>(1) Given the extensive impact the Superior Court’s published opinion could have on the lower courts and prosecution offices in situations where a defendant initiates a statutory summary appeal from a Magisterial District Judge’s <em>sua sponte </em>finding of guilt on an uncharged, lesser-included offense, should this Honorable Court grant review because the purpose for double jeopardy protections are not implicated, or implicated minimally, when the defendant appeals his conviction for a trial <em>de </em>novo?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b355-7" data-blocks='[["BL_355.7",355,[237,1222,1103,258]]]'>(2) Should this Honorable Court exercise its supervisory authority over the Superior Court’s erroneous discharge of defendant and remand his case for sentencing on the lesser-included offense he appeals and necessarily was found guilty of committing?</blockquote>
