Relating to the latter conviction, Claimant was sentenced to sixty days in the Keystone House Arrest Program (from November 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012) with the condition that if he failed to comply, he would serve sixty days in the York County Prison. Claimant was also required to attend reemployment eligibility assessment classes via CareerLink.

Claimant appealed the finding of disqualification and, on January 14, 2013, a hearing was held before a referee for the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (UCBR). At the hearing, testimony was presented from Judy Will, an investigator for the Internal Audit Division of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (Department), and Claimant. Will testified that the Department interpreted Section 402.6 as disqualifying a claimant who has been convicted of a crime and incarcerated, regardless of whether the claimant was under house arrest, in a halfway house, or any other place “in lieu of’ prison.</p>

Claimant emphasized that he was sentenced to intermediate punishment through a county program in lieu of incarceration, and relied upon provisions of the Sentencing Code, Sections 9721 (sentencing generally) and Section 9763 (sentence of county intermediate punishment), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9721 and 9763, which define a sentence of county intermediate punish<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>ment as an alternative to a sentence of total or partial confinement in a correctional institution, and set forth various conditions a court may attach to a sentence of county intermediate punishment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Thus, the UCBR contends, there is no distinction warranting disparate treatment between a workers’ compensation case and an unemployment compensation case for purposes of determining whether house arrest constitutes “incarceration.” It acknowledges that house arrest is an alternative sentence to confinement in prison pursuant to the Sentencing Code, but submits that such distinction is not dispositive of whether house arrest should be considered “incarceration” under Section 402.6 of the UC Law.</p>

Claimant further points out that in <em>Henkels </em>cfe <em>McCoy Inc., </em>the only authority of this Court relied upon by the UCBR, the claimant was denied workers’ compensation benefits because his probationary sentence subjected him to involuntarily commitment to a psychiatric hospital, and, thus, his loss of earnings did not result from injury, but rather from his criminal sentence.

Claimant further discounts the UCBR’s argument that Section 402.6 was a legislative response to the Commonwealth Court’s holding in Greer (the pre-Section 402.6 case that permitted an incarcerated claimant on work release to obtain unemployment compensation benefits) as the Legislature’s adoption of Section 402.6 occurred 18 years after <em>Greer </em>had been decided.</p>

The UCBR also responds that Claimant's view of the Legislative comments on Section 402.6 is unduly restrictive, and disputes his contention that the concerns were limited only to incarcer<a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>ated prisoners on work release. It submits there is little distinction between an individual confined in a prison who is eligible for work release and one confined in a home with electronic monitoring who is permitted to leave for work.

After serving ten days of the sentence in a prison facility, appellant was transferred by the prison warden into an electronic home monitoring program without the knowledge or consent of the trial court. Appellant spent twenty-six days in the home monitoring program and subsequently filed a petition seeking parole, which the trial court denied on the basis that appellant had served only ten days of the mandatory thirty day minimum sentence in prison. This Court was tasked, therefore, with determining whether a defendant’s time spent on house arrest could be credited towards his mandatory minimum sentence for driving under the influence (DUI).</p>

Appellant asserted that his home confinement did not amount to “official detention” for purposes of the criminal offense of escape. While acknowledging this Court’s holding in <em>Kriston </em>as well as the stark differences between home confinement and confinement in a prison setting, this Court nevertheless found that a sentence of home confinement following a conviction constituted “official detention” for pur<a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>poses of the escape statute. This Court explained that <em>Kri-ston </em>“dealt with the question of whether various different settings were sufficiently prison-like to entitle an individual who spent time in them to credit under the Sentencing Code against a mandatory sentence of incarceration,” but did not address the separate question of whether, “in spite of the amenities and nonrehabilitative temptations present in the home, an offender ... who is restricted to his home ... is subject to detention.” <em>Wegley, </em><a href="/pa/574/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="829 A.2d 1148" data-case-ids="588059,9103032" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0190-01,/a2d/829/1148-01">829 A.2d at 1151-1152</a> (internal citations omitted).
