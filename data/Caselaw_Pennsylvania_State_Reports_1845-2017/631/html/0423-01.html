The questions on remand involved two allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The PCRA court, after holding a hearing on February 21, 2014, rendered an opinion in which it resolved these issues against Appellant Rasheed Simpson, and, thus, denied him relief. With the remand proceedings now complete, we now may also consider the issue of whether Appellant is entitled to relief based on the cumulative prejudicial effect of all of the alleged errors he has set forth. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the PCRA court properly resolved the ineffectiveness claims before it, and we conclude that Appellant is not entitled to relief on his claim of cumulative prejudice. Thus, we affirm the order of the PCRA court and dismiss all of Appellant’s claims.</p>

This right is violated where counsel’s performance “so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.” <em>Commonwealth v. Rios, </em><a href="/pa/591/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="591 Pa. 583" data-case-ids="3014692" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0583-01">591 Pa. 583</a>, <a href="/pa/591/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="920 A.2d 790" data-case-ids="3014692,8325303" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0583-01,/a2d/920/0790-01">920 A.2d 790</a>, 799 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). In Pennsylvania, courts apply a three-pronged test for analyzing whether trial counsel was ineffective, derived from our application in <em>Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d at 975</a>, of the performance and prejudice test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland, </em><a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">466 U.S. at 687</a>, <a href="/us/466/0668-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="466 U.S. 668" data-case-ids="6204802" data-case-paths="/us/466/0668-01">104 S.Ct. 2052</a>. The <em>Pierce </em>test requires a PCRA petitioner to prove: (1) the underlying legal claim was of arguable merit; (2) counsel had no reasonable strategic basis for his action or inaction; and (3) the petitioner was prejudiced — that is, but for counsel’s deficient stewardship, there is a reasonable likelihood the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. <em>Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d at 975</a>.

Additionally, and relevant to both issues before us, to obtain relief for counsel’s failure to effectively impeach a witness, a petitioner must satisfy the three-pronged test set forth in <em>Pierce. </em>Furthermore, regarding the failure to procure a witness’s testimony, a petitioner must demonstrate: (1) the witness existed; (2) counsel was either aware of, or should have been aware of, the witness’ existence; (3) the witness was willing and able to cooperate with the defense; and (4) the defendant was prejudiced by the absence <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>of the witness’ testimony. <em>See Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[278,870,1147,840]]]'>The first claim which we remanded to the PCRA court for supplemental review was whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Rasheema Washington — who was the only eyewitness who testified as to the events surrounding the kidnappers bringing the murder victim to her apartment, Appellant’s presence with the victim that evening, and his presence during a telephone conversation with the victim’s family — with evidence of motive and bias against Appellant. In sum, Appellant contends that his trial counsel knew that Washington had been in a sexual relationship with Appellant, accused him of impregnating her and infecting her with a sexually transmitted disease, and that she claimed that she would get back at him someday; that counsel failed to cross-examine Washington on the basis of this evidence; and that, had counsel properly cross-examined Washington, her impeachment would have resulted in his acquittal.</p>

Further, Thompson relayed that Washington was obsessed with Appellant, hated him, and wanted to get him killed. Appellant also testified at the hearing and, consistent with Thompson, explained that Washington accused him of giving her a sexually transmitted disease and that she swore she would get back at him. Additionally, when Washington told Appellant that she was pregnant with his child, and Appellant advised her to get an abortion, Washington allegedly broke down and was upset that he did not want to father a <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>child by her. When Washington discovered that Appellant had a son by another woman, Appellant offered that she stated, “I swear you going’ [sic] pay for what you did to me one day.” N.T., 2/21/14, 67. Furthermore, Appellant testified that he told trial counsel of Washington’s bias and motive to lie, and that counsel should call Thompson as a witness.

Washington acknowledged that she had a sexual relationship with Appellant, but explained that it had ended by November 1992, before the 1993 murder at issue in this case, and years before her testimony against Appellant at his 1997 trial. Indeed, Washington stressed that, at the time she gave a statement to police inculpating Appellant, she was in a romantic relationship with her daughter’s father, “Malik,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and had no romantic interest in Appellant. Washington offered that she was not angry with Appellant and did not threaten him or hope that he would die. Further, she denied being pregnant with Appellant’s child and maintained that she never told him that she was pregnant by him or that she suffered from a sexually transmitted disease due to sexual relations with Appellant. Finally, Washington explained that she delayed providing information to the police as co-defendant Malik Bowers (a different person than her boyfriend <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>Malik) was very close to her and she did not want to incriminate him.</p>

Specifically, the PCRA court credited the testimony of Washington which established that her sexual relationship with Appellant ended by November 1992; that she was not pregnant with Appellant’s child; that <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>she did not threaten Appellant; that she did not have a sexually transmitted disease; and that she did not tell anyone that Appellant gave her a sexually transmitted disease. The court reasoned that her testimony was further boosted by Appellant’s trial counsel’s September 12,1996 note in which he recorded that Appellant described Washington as a friend and a potential witness. Conversely, the PCRA court found Thompson’s testimony to be incredible and that it was fabricated to aid Appellant. Further, the court concluded that Thompson was never proffered to trial counsel and that counsel had no reason to believe Thompson would be useful as a witness. Similarly, the PCRA court determined that Appellant’s testimony, including the above allegations of bias and revenge on the part of Washington, was not credible. The PCRA court, however, did find that Appellant, 14 months after describing Washington as a friend, and one month prior to trial, did tell his trial counsel that he had engaged in sexual relations with Washington and had given Appellant a sexually transmitted disease, that Washington had a daughter that might be his, that Washington told Appellant the child was his, and that she was upset when their relationship ended.</p>
    <p id="b489-5" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[215,1448,1147,783]]]'>Thus, the PCRA court initially concluded that there was no factual basis for Appellant’s assertions. Further, the PCRA court determined that, because trial counsel died, the reason for his not confronting Washington at trial would never be expressly established. The court opined, however, that trial counsel may have refrained from challenging Washington as he had no extrinsic evidence to corroborate Appellant’s allegations or because Appellant had initially informed counsel that Washington was a friend and possible defense witness. The court further reasoned that an uncorroborated attack on a witness involving her sexual practice, venereal disease, abortion, and related matters certainly could have offended jurors.

The court explained that, if Washington had credibly testified at trial, as she did at the PCRA hearing, without any extrinsic evidence to contradict Washington, there was not a reasonable basis that challenging Washington’s testimony would have affected the outcome of the trial. According to the court, the fact that Appellant did not ask trial counsel to call Thompson as a witness is corroborated by Appellant’s repeated assertions of satisfaction with counsel’s representation.

Thus, Appellant stresses that Washington’s credibility is not relevant to whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call Thompson to testify or failing to impeach Washington at trial with the information regarding her bias against Appellant. Rather, according to Appellant, what is important is that Appellant told trial counsel prior to trial that Washington’s testimony could be impeached with Thompson’s testimony, yet counsel failed to investigate and impeach Washington with Thompson’s testimony. Appellant further asserts that trial counsel informed him that he did not have funds to pay for a private investigator, but argues that such investigation would cost nothing.

Appellant also explains that he did not tell trial counsel about his turbulent relationship with Washington months before trial, but instead described her as a friend and possible witness earlier, because he was surprised to learn at trial that Washington was incriminating him and that he had been trying to protect her from involvement as an accomplice. Thus, according to Appellant, upon learning that Washington was lying to police, he realized the importance of divulging to counsel the full scope of his relationship with Washington and her motivation to incriminate him. Finally, Appellant maintains that he was prejudiced by trial counsel’s ineffectiveness, as, had counsel presented Thompson’s testimony at trial, he would have been able to paint a different picture of Washing<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>ton and, due to counsel’s ineffectiveness, the jury was prevented from hearing anything about their troubled relationship and her possible motive and bias against him.</p>
    <p id="b492-5" data-blocks='[["BL_492.4",492,[269,485,1148,1748]]]'>In response, the Commonwealth initially argues that Thompson’s proffered testimony is inadmissible hearsay and cannot serve as the basis for relief. Further, the Commonwealth highlights the PCRA court’s crediting of Washington’s testimony that she harbored no ill feelings towards Appellant; that their relationship had ended well before the night of the murder; that she did not accuse Appellant of fathering her child or giving her a sexually transmitted disease; and that she never threatened him or vowed to retaliate against him. Additionally, the Commonwealth offers that Washington did not seek out the police after the victim was murdered because: she considered Appellant’s co-defendant Malik Bowers to be family and did not want to implicate him; she was worried that she would be implicating herself in the crime, as the kidnappers brought the victim to her apartment; and she was afraid of what would happen to her on the streets if she went to the police and told them all that she knew. Further, the Commonwealth asserts that our Court has made it clear that the PCRA court may pass on witness credibility at a PCRA hearing, and that such determinations should be given great deference by reviewing courts. <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/600/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="600 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="4194238" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0329-01">600 Pa. 329</a>, <a href="/pa/600/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="966 A.2d 523" data-case-ids="4194238,8158876" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0329-01,/a2d/966/0523-01">966 A.2d 523</a>, 539 (2009). Here, the Commonwealth maintains it was necessary for the PCRA court to pass on the credibility of Washington, as well as Thompson and Appellant, in determining whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Washington’s testimony, and most importantly, whether Appellant was prejudiced by counsel’s not confronting Washington. Indeed, the Commonwealth stresses it was proper for the PCRA court to find Appellant’s assertions incredible, as only after Appellant learned that Washington was incriminating him in the murder did he convey their troubled relationship to counsel and suggested a motive for Washington to lie.</p>

Related thereto, the Commonwealth submits that, in light of the compelling evidence of Appellant’s guilt, Appellant cannot show a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different had trial counsel questioned Washington regarding her purported bias and motive to lie. Specifically, the Commonwealth emphasizes Aloyisius Stanley Hall’s testimony that the kidnapper who spoke with him on the telephone and who referred to the earlier robbery of Hall responded affirmatively when asked if it was “Rasheed” on the line, and threatened to kill the victim if the kidnappers did not received $20,000 in 15 minutes. According to the Commonwealth, even if trial counsel had cross-examined Washington with her alleged bias against Appellant — in which case Washington would have denied having any vendetta against Appellant as she did during the PCRA court hearing — Appellant cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that the jury would have acquitted him of the victim’s murder.</p>

First, we find that the record amply supports the court’s finding that Washington credibly testified that she was not biased against Appellant and, <em>inter alia, </em>did not communicate to Appellant that she was pregnant with Appellant’s child, that Appellant had given her a sexually transmitted disease, or that she would seek revenge against him. Further, we find that the PCRA court’s legal conclusions regarding Appellant’s claim of ineffectiveness are free from legal error. Specifically, while Appellant claims that the credibility of Washington’s testimony is for the jury, and not the PCRA court, he misunderstands the import of the court’s role in making credibility determinations. Beyond resolving the veracity of the underlying factual foundation for the claim, Washington’s credibility goes to the question of prejudice. The PCRA court’s finding that Washington credibly testified strongly supports its conclusion that Appellant failed to meet his burden of establishing that, but for the ineffectiveness of trial counsel, the outcome of <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>the proceedings would have been different. As noted by the PCRA court, there was significant other evidence in the form of Hall’s testimony that Appellant was the murderer. Moreover, the court rightfully stressed the minimal value that any cross-examination of Washington would have had concerning the outcome of the trial, even if trial counsel had cross-examined Washington with her alleged bias against Appellant, as Washington would have credibly denied having any vendetta or bias against Appellant, as she did during the PCRA court hearing.</p>
    <p id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.4",494,[271,864,1148,1211]]]'>As to Appellant’s claim that trial counsel failed to call Thompson as a witness to rebut Washington’s testimony, the PCRA court found that Thompson was never proffered as a witness to trial counsel and that counsel had no reason to believe that he would be helpful as a witness. This credibility determination by the PCRA court in disbelieving Appellant’s assertions is supported by the record. Thus, on this basis alone, Appellant’s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to present Thompson as a rebuttal witness does not entitle him to relief, as he fails to satisfy the reasonable basis prong of the <em>Pierce </em>test — i.e., that counsel had no reasonable strategic basis for his inaction. In any event, there is no reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different with Thompson’s testimony, as the court found his testimony to be incredible and fabricated to assist Appellant, who was his longtime friend. Thus, we agree with the PCRA court, with respect to both of Appellant’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, that he failed to meet the <em>Pierce </em>prejudice prong — i.e., he did not demonstrate to a reasonable probability that the jury would have acquitted him of the victim’s murder had trial counsel cross-examined Washington with her alleged bias against Appellant and had offered Thompson as a witness.</p>

Officer Slavin’s notes of the incident identified the members of the returning party as co-defendant Bowers, Washington, Thompson, Will Shepard, and the driver, Medeya Clark. Bowers refused to cooperate with officers and was subsequently arrested.</p>

In any event, the Commonwealth argues that Thompson’s testimony was incredible, as he had been a friend of Appellant’s family for nearly 30 years, came forward eight years after his friend Appellant was convicted of murder, and that it would not be surprising for Appellant, who was a fugitive in a murder case, to offer a fake name — “Will Shepard” — when confronted by police. Further, the Commonwealth adds that there was already evidence rebutting Washington’s assertions offered at trial in the form of Officer Slavin’s notes, which indicated that Appellant was not present with the others outside the movie theater. The Commonwealth submits that, in light of trial counsel’s passing, his extensive experience as a capital criminal defense attorney<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> is highly relevant and casts doubt upon Appellant’s claims of ineffectiveness.

Appellant filed a Motion for Leave to Clarify/Correct the Record on October 7, 2014 regarding the alleged misstatement of the PCRA court as to the timing of Washington's statement to police, to which the Commonwealth did not file an answer. We hereby grant Appellant’s motion. Further, Appellant attempts to raise further claims which he asserts arose on remand through an Application for Leave to File Supplemental Claims Raised on Remand, filed on August 25, 2014. In his application, Appellant asserts the PCRA court violated his constitu<a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>tional rights by improperly denying his request, in light of the passing of trial counsel, to call an expert in capital cases to speak to the prevailing norms of capital practice. As we have resolved these issues on grounds to which the expert testimony requested by Appellant would be inapplicable, we hereby dismiss Appellant's application on this basis as moot. Further, Appellant claims that trial counsel’s handwritten notes, while authentic, were not properly admitted by the Commonwealth at the remand hearing, and that the PCRA court violated his constitutional rights in granting the Commonwealth’s subsequent post-hearing motion to reopen the record to admit these notes. Appellant argued before the PCRA court that the Commonwealth failed to demonstrate that its motion was timely, that the notes were relevant, or that trial counsel normally kept handwritten notes in his cases. Further, Appellant maintained that the notes were cumulative, and, thus, inadmissible. In admitting the notes, we find no abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth v. Montalvo, </em><a href="/pa/604/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="604 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="4196743" data-case-paths="/pa/604/0386-01">604 Pa. 386</a>, <a href="/pa/604/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="986 A.2d 84" data-case-ids="4196743,7291294" data-case-paths="/pa/604/0386-01,/a2d/986/0084-01">986 A.2d 84</a>, 94 (2009) (finding the admission of evidence is at the discretion of the court and such determination will not be reversed absent a showing that the trial court clearly abused that discretion). Moreover, we note that Appellant asserts the objectionable notes are cumulative of other notes in the record and so conclude that, even if trial counsel’s handwritten notes were improperly admitted into the record, such admission constituted harmless error. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hairston, </em><a href="/pa/624/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="624 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="4078545" data-case-paths="/pa/624/0143-01">624 Pa. 143</a>, <a href="/pa/624/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="84 A.3d 657" data-case-ids="4078545,7267403" data-case-paths="/pa/624/0143-01,/a3d/84/0657-01">84 A.3d 657</a>, 671-72 (2014). Thus, we hereby deny Appellant’s application.</p>
