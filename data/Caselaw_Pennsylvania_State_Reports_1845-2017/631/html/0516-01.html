In 1995, Milton and his common law wife, Miriam Ascencio (“Miriam”), moved from Puerto Rico to York County, Pennsylvania. The couple frequently fought, and, around March 1998, Milton moved out of the couple’s apartment. On the evening of April 18,1998, Miriam was seen at a local bar with a friend, Nelson Lugo a/k/a Manuel Santana (“Nelson”). At some point during the evening, Miriam and Nelson left the bar and walked to Miriam’s apartment. Later that evening, Vincent Rice, Miriam’s next-door neighbor, was awakened sometime after 11:30 p.m.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> by the sound of breaking glass on the common porch he shared with Miriam. Rice reported hearing Milton shout “open the door,” after which he heard additional noises coming from the apartment. The following day, April 19, 1998, Rice looked through the window of Miriam’s apart<a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>ment and observed a man lying on the floor; at this point, he summoned the police.</p>
    <p id="b575-4" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[207,428,1149,786]]]'>When the police arrived at the scene, they observed that one pane of a four-pane window in the door to Miriam’s apartment was broken; the broken pane was the closest to the door lock. Upon entering the apartment, the officers discovered Nelson’s body in the kitchen and Miriam’s body in the bedroom. Nelson had defensive wounds on his hands, his fingers were nearly severed, and he had a lipstick inserted in his mouth. Nelson’s autopsy revealed that he died from a stab wound to the chest. Miriam had a broken nose, stab wounds to her eyes, and her head was nearly severed from her body. She was naked from the waist down, and her underwear was around her face. She was lying with her head on a pillow, and a high-heeled shoe was found under her buttocks. Miriam’s autopsy revealed that she died from sharp force and blunt force injuries to her head and neck.</p>

Of the items that contained traces of human blood, two of the items contained traces of blood which did not belong to either victim: a white cloth bag found on a sofa bed near Miriam’s body, and a kitchen window blind. The blood on both of those items was determined to belong to Milton Montalvo. Milton Montalvo’s blood also was found on glass that remained in the broken window pane, and a hair collected from Nelson’s hand was determined to belong to Milton Montalvo. There was no blood, hair, or fiber evidence that linked Appellant to the scene of the murders.</p>

Ultimately, he was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary, and, on February 14, 2000, he was sentenced to death. Approximately two months before Milton was arrested, Detective Roland Comacho, purportedly based <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>on a statement given to him by Esther Soto, sought and obtained an arrest warrant for Appellant, charging him as a possible accomplice or participant in the murders. Appellant remained a fugitive until 2002, at which time he was discovered living under an assumed name, with an altered appearance, in Hudson County, New Jersey. Appellant was extradited to York County to stand trial, at which he was represented <em>pro hac vice </em>by Francis Cutruzzula, Esquire.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Frank Arcuri, Esquire served as local counsel.</p>

Trial, 3/13/03, at 421. The Commonwealth further posited that the victims’ different injuries demonstrated that two different weapons were used — a knife and some other blunt object — and, therefore, that there must have been two assailants.</p>

Morrell also heard Milton shout that he had seen someone go into Miriam’s apartment. Morrell recounted that, approximately 20 minutes later, he heard a woman’s voice say “call the police, call the police,” <em>id. </em>at 603, and then he fell asleep. Morrell testified that, 20 minutes after he fell asleep, he heard <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>“noise on the floor and on the walls and something being dragged.” <em>Id.</em>

Patricia stated that she saw Milton at the apartment at approximately 9:30 p.m., but that Milton left at around 10:00 p.m. N.T. Trial, 3/13/03, at 483.

Esther testified that, on the afternoon of April 18, 1998, Milton visited the grocery store she operated with her husband at the time, Miguel Soto (“Miguel”). Esther testified that Milton used the store’s telephone to call Miriam about unemployment checks she had received in the mail, that an argument ensued, and that she heard Milton shouting at Miriam over the telephone. As Milton was shouting at Miriam, Appellant entered the store and approached Milton. According to Esther, after Milton ended his telephone call, she heard him tell Appellant that he wanted to kill Miriam.

At the penalty phase of trial, the jury found two aggravating circumstances — that Appellant killed Miriam during the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(6), and Appellant had been convicted of another murder committed either before, or at the time of, the offenses at issue, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(ll).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The jury also found two mitigating factors — that Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(1), and Appellant was a good worker, attended church, and was a good son to his mother, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(8) (the “catch-all” miti-gator).

In that there were more than 10 expert, lay, and other witnesses who testified at the PCRA hearings, including those noted above, <em>see supra </em>note 7, the lack of any credibility determinations by the PCRA court is particularly problematic in the instant case. Thus, we are constrained to remand this matter to the PCRA court. We recognize that, as Judge <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>Dorney is no longer on the bench, the matter must be assigned to another judge. Further, we acknowledge that the judge to whom the matter is assigned will not have the benefit of having presided over Appellant’s PCRA hearings. Thus, for those claims the assigned judge is unable to resolve on the existing record, the judge is authorized to conduct additional hearings, and admit evidence, as necessary. <em>Peoples, supra; Beasley, supra; Williams, supra.</em>

Miguel was instructed by PennDot personnel to go to the Lancaster City Police Department, where he was met by Detective Comacho and another officer. Detective Comacho interviewed Miguel, and, upon "figuring out that he had some sort of connection to Milton,” asked Miguel "what information ... he had about the homicide.” <em>Id. </em>at 200. According to Detective Comacho, Miguel stated that his wife, Esther, "also had information around,” and the detective told Miguel he needed to speak with Esther. <em>Id. </em>At that point, Detective Comacho drove to Miguel's store, where he took possession of Miguel’s van and placed it in the city garage. Detective Comacho reiterated to Miguel at that time that he "needed to talk to Esther.” <em>Id. </em>at 201. Several days later, Esther went in for an interview with Detective Comacho.</p>
