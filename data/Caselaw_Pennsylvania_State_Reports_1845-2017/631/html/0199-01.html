    <p id="b256-9" data-blocks='[["BL_256.9",256,[278,1172,1147,687]]]'>I respectfully dissent from the majority’s summary disposition of this case on the allocatur docket. The Court’s Internal Operating Procedures require that “[a] <em>-per curiam </em>order granting allowance of appeal and reversing an order of the lower court must cite to controlling legal authority or provide a full explanation of the reasons for reversal.” Supreme Court IOP § 6(B). The rule is plainly intended to provide litigants with a reasonably developed explanation as to why the Court is exercising its discretion to disturb the status quo attained in an as-of-right direct appeal. In this regard, the majority’s mere citation to a general legal principle, without any attempt to explain how that principle applies to the particular facts under review, is facially deficient.</p>
