    <blockquote id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[255,700,1102,466]]]'>(1) Did the Commonwealth Court exceed the scope and standard of appellate review by ignoring binding Pennsylvania Supreme Court precedent and reversing a PLRB final order where the PLRB did not clearly err in holding under the existing terms of the PLRA, that absent a cessation of work by employes of a neutral employer, there must be threats, intimidation, force, coercion or sabotage to find a violation of Section 6(2)(D) of the PLRA?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b511-7" data-blocks='[["BL_511.7",511,[254,1198,1102,366]]]'>(2) Did the Commonwealth Court exceed the scope and standard of appellate review where the PLRB did not err as a matter of law in concluding that the Borough violated Section 6(l)(a) and (c) of the PLRA by disciplining the union president because of his non-threatening, non-coercive letter to IAFF members concerning a labor dispute?</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b511-10" data-blocks='[["BL_511.10",511,[254,1991,1101,357]]]'>(4) Did the Commonwealth Court err in reversing the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board’s final order by failing to abide by prior, relevant precedent, overruling <em>sub silentia </em>a controlling decision of this Court, and effectively creating a new violation of the PLRA where this Court has determined one does not and cannot exist?</blockquote>
