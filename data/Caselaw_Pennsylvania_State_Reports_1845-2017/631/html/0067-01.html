Appellant was thereafter sentenced to death, and this Court affirmed his judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant subsequently filed a timely petition for collateral relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546. After affording Appellant notice of its intent to dismiss his PCRA petition without conducting an evidentiary hearing, the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (“PCRA court”) dismissed Appellant’s petition, holding there were no genuine issues of material fact and no meritorious issues. Appellant has now filed in this Court a direct appeal from the PCRA court’s order denying him collateral relief. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>

The evidence presented at trial established that in the early morning hours of August 6, 2006, Scott Wertz and Malcom Eddinger were working as plainclothes police officers for the Reading Police Department when they noticed a large crowd forming in a parking lot adjacent to the street. The officers received a radio broadcast a few moments later, indicating there was an altercation at that location. The <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>officers then heard what they believed to be a firecracker or small caliber gunshot. While they initially remained in their unmarked vehicle waiting for uniformed officers to arrive, the officers exited after they heard three or four gunshots fired from a large caliber gun.</p>
    <p id="b133-4" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[176,591,1148,1103]]]'>Believing the shooter was a man in a blue polo shirt, later identified as Appellant, Officer Wertz began to follow him. Officer Eddinger joined the pursuit. At one point, Officer Wertz stood face-to-face with Appellant for a few seconds, leading Officer Eddinger to believe that the two men exchanged words. Appellant continued to run, and Officer Wertz gave chase. Notably, he never drew his weapon. Officer Eddinger followed behind them in the middle of the street. He did not hear Officer Wertz direct Appellant to stop or identify himself as a police officer, but did see Appellant look over his left shoulder. Immediately thereafter, Officer Eddinger heard two gunshots, and observed two muzzle flashes. Both Appellant and Officer Wertz fell to the ground. Officer Eddinger, who was approximately twenty feet away when Appellant fired the shots at Officer Wertz, apprehended Appellant who was lying on the street where he had fallen, and found a gun underneath him. The location where the shooting occurred was approximately forty yards away from the large crowd who had previously gathered. Four spent shells fired from Appellant’s gun were recovered from the crime scene.</p>
    <p id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[176,1727,1146,629]],["BL_134.1",134,[290,314,1144,192]]]'>Officer Wertz was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. His gun was found strapped inside his holster, which was attached to his belt, and his badge was found in his police vehicle. An asp baton used in law enforcement was also found in close proximity to where Officer Wertz’s body lay. An autopsy identified the cause of death as two gunshot wounds, one penetrating the left side of Officer Wertz’s chest, and the other striking him in the area below the pelvic diaphragm. Chemical testing revealed that the shot to the chest had been fired from approximately four feet away, while the other shot had been fired when the muzzle of the weapon was either touching or was within three inches of Officer Wertz’s cloth<a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>ing. The Commonwealth’s theory was that this forensic evidence demonstrated that Appellant first shot Officer Wertz in the chest, which caused him to fall toward Appellant, who then fired a second time.</p>
    <p id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[287,539,1147,782]]]'>At trial, Appellant was represented by Attorneys Jay Nigri-ni and Richard Reynolds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Commonwealth’s primary witness was Officer Eddinger, who testified regarding the parking lot surveillance, the subsequent chase of Appellant, the shooting of Officer Wertz, and Appellant’s apprehension. The Commonwealth also presented the testimony of jailhouse informant, Jason Ott, who provided prison officials with a written statement that Appellant confessed to him in prison that he shot a police officer and would “get away with it” because there were fifty or sixty people at the scene. Although not included in his written statement to police, Ott further testified at trial that Appellant told him someone shouted that cops were coming; thereby suggesting that Appellant may have known that the man chasing him was a police officer.</p>
    <p id="b134-5" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[286,1346,1145,679]]]'>Prior to Ott’s testimony, Appellant had executed a written waiver of conflict of interest and engaged in an oral colloquy, acknowledging that Appellant’s trial counsel, Attorney Nigrini, had previously represented Ott in criminal proceedings. Due to the purported conflict of interest, Appellant’s co-counsel, Attorney Reynolds, cross-examined Ott at trial, bringing to light that he was imprisoned due to a parole violation involving false reports to police. Attorney Reynolds also elicited testimony suggesting that Ott’s parole violation case had been continued several times due to Appellant’s upcoming trial, although Ott denied having any plea agreement with the Commonwealth and affirmatively stated that he received no benefit in exchange for his testimony against Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b134-6" data-blocks='[["BL_134.6",134,[285,2051,1144,147]],["BL_135.1",135,[175,315,1150,841]]]'>Appellant testified on his own behalf, alleging that he had fired his weapon in self-defense. According to Appellant, an unidentified Hispanic man had pointed a gun toward him and <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>his friends while in the parking lot, which led Appellant to fire his weapon in the air four or five times to “break everything up.” Appellant indicated that, moments later a different man (Officer Wertz) ran toward him, who never identified himself as a police officer and did not direct Appellant to stop. Appellant explained that he thought the man chasing him may have been connected to the armed Hispanic man and believed that the man intended to shoot him. Hence, Appellant fired his weapon at the man. Appellant stated that he learned that the man was a police officer only after he shot him when he heard someone say “police officer down.” On cross-examination, Appellant admitted he had no license to carry a gun, that he had stolen the murder weapon, that he intended to cause serious bodily injury or death to the man chasing him, and that there was nothing preventing him from continuing to run from his pursuer.</p>
    <p id="b135-5" data-blocks='[["BL_135.4",135,[175,1181,1148,837]]]'>After having been instructed on the various degrees of murder, manslaughter, and the affirmative defense of self-defense, the jury did not credit Appellant’s claim of self-defense, and convicted him of first degree murder, aggravated assault, firearms not to be carried without a license, and possessing instruments of crime. Following the penalty phase of trial, the jury found that two aggravating circumstances, namely, that the victim was a police officer who was killed in the performance of his duties, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(1), and that Appellant created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense, <em>id., </em>§ 9711(d)(7), outweighed the mitigating circumstance of “any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense,” <em>id., </em>§ 9711(e)(8) (“catchall mitigator”), and returned a verdict of death.</p>

As noted, this Court affirmed Appellant’s judgment of sentence of death on direct appeal. <em>Rivera, supra. </em>Initially, we held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Appellant’s conviction of first degree murder. Considering that Appellant admitted to <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>shooting Officer Wertz, the pertinent inquiry became whether the Commonwealth disproved his claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Critical to our analysis was Section 505 of the Crimes Code, which provides that the “use of force upon or toward another person is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 505(a). Section 505 further provides, in relevant part, that the use of deadly force is not justified unless the actor believes that it is necessary to protect himself against death or serious bodily injury; nor is it justified if the actor “provoked the use of force against himself in the same encounter” or “knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating.” <em>Id., </em>§ 505(b)(2)(f), (ii).</p>
    <p id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[283,1117,1147,520]]]'>We concluded that the Commonwealth disproved Appellant’s claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt because it presented undisputed evidence that Officer Wertz never drew his weapon during the chase, and never exerted “unlawful force” under Section 505(a). Thus, Appellant was not justified in responding to Officer Wertz’s chase with deadly force. We emphasized that while the jury had the prerogative to credit Appellant’s testimony that he reasonably believed Officer Wertz possessed a weapon and was going to shoot him, the jury did not do so.</p>
    <p id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[282,1661,1146,410]]]'>Turning to the remaining requisites of justification in Section 505(b)(2), we further held that the evidence, when viewed in the proper light, demonstrated that Appellant’s use of force was not justified because he was the aggressor in that his firing of a weapon in the crowded parking lot served as the catalyst for the tragic events that followed, and Appellant acknowledged on cross-examination that he could have avoided the use of force by retreating safely.</p>
    <p id="b136-7" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[281,2096,1148,253]],["BL_137.1",137,[176,307,1148,680]]]'>This Court on direct appeal also rejected Appellant’s weight of the evidence claim, which alleged that the trial court should have reweighed the evidence to conclude that Appellant was guilty of unreasonable belief voluntary manslaughter, otherwise known as “imperfect self-defense,” instead of first degree <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellant argued that he did not know that his pursuer was a policeman, and believed reasonably, albeit mistakenly, that the victim (Officer Wertz) possessed a weapon and posed a threat to his life. The Commonwealth, however, pointed out the inconsistencies in Appellant’s trial testimony as demonstrated by the following disparate reasons he proffered to explain why he shot Officer Wertz: (1) he thought he was going to be shot; Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”) Aug. 7, 2008, at 622; 665; (2) he wanted to get the man to stop chasing him; <em>id., </em>at 623; (3) he fired his gun by accident and was not thinking when he pointed the gun back and fired; <em>id., </em>at 634; and (4) he intended to cause serious bodily injury or death to his pursuer. <em>Id. </em>at 636-37.</p>
    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[175,1012,1149,938]]]'>Finding no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in denying Appellant’s challenge to the weight of the evidence, this Court declined Appellant’s invitation to substitute our judgment for that of the fact finder. Moreover, we emphasized that an imperfect self-defense claim is imperfect only in the sense that the actor held an unreasonable, rather than a reasonable, belief that deadly force was necessary; the remaining principles of justification in Section 505 still had to be satisfied, including that the defendant was not the aggressor in the encounter and did not violate a duty to retreat safely. <em>Rivera, </em><a href="/pa/603/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="983 A.2d 1211" data-case-ids="4197501,7294605" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0340-01,/a2d/983/1211-01">983 A.2d at 1225</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

Because we concluded that Appellant did not satisfy the remaining requisites for justification as the evidence demonstrated that he was the aggressor in the encounter and could have avoided the necessity of using such force by retreating safely, we held that Appellant’s claim of imperfect self-defense was unsupportable, effectively rending meritless his challenge to the weight of the evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

It emphasizes that trial counsel elicited testimony during the direct examination of Appellant, as well as during the cross-examination of Officer Eddinger and Detective Harold Shenk, that Officer Wertz was in plainclothes when he chased Appellant, that he did not orally inform Appellant that he was a police officer or display his badge, and that Officer Wertz’s actions did not comply with police procedures. Trial counsel also highlighted these facts in his closing argument. The Commonwealth maintains that trial counsel was under no obligation to produce expert testimony to duplicate the abundance of testimony already presented, particularly where the jury could comprehend, without an expert, whether Appellant knew he was being chased by a police officer. Moreover, the Commonwealth asserts, trial counsel pursued a reasonable strategy in providing Appellant’s direct testimony, rather than presenting an obscure expert to address the intricacies of police procedure. Finally, the Commonwealth argues, Appellant was not prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to call a police procedure expert because such testimony would have been duplicative and, at best, would have merely highlight the substantial testimony already presented.</p>

The court concluded that counsel need not hire an expert to convey the same information to the jury. The PCRA court further held there was no arguable merit to Appellant’s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present the testimony of Maurice Holmes and Santos Rivera because their testimony would have been cumulative of Appellant’s own testimony that he never exchanged words with Officer Wertz during the encounter.

Regarding the mental health mitigation evidence, the Commonwealth argues that trial counsel provided his penalty phase expert, Dr. Tepper, with essentially the same information concerning Appellant’s life history and medical background as was given to Appellant’s post-conviction expert, Dr. Blumberg.

Appellant presented to the PCRA court several documents allegedly suggesting that an agreement may have existed between Ott and the Commonwealth.

The Commonwealth disputes that the District Attorney’s October 11, 2006 letter established an agreement between Ott and the Commonwealth because a probation condition is not a benefit to a probationer, but rather a burden, as it constitutes an additional condition. We conclude that the record supports the PCRA court’s finding that Appellant’s evidentiary proffer in support of the existence of an agreement is speculative. Further, we are satisfied that an evidentiary hearing is not warranted on this claim.

It contends the discovery request is likewise meritless because it failed to identify any existing exculpatory document.
