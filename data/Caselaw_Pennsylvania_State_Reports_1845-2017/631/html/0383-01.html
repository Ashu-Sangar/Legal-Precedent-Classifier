In her initial submission, Attorney General Kane highlighted that no statute on record in the Commonwealth authorizes the appointment of a special prosecutor for an investigating grand jury. Further, she observed that the power to investigate and prosecute is reposed in the executive branch. In particular, Attorney General Kane noted that, under the Investigating Grand Jury Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> local district attorneys and the Attorney General or her designee are the only officials authorized to serve as an “Attorney for the Commonwealth.” 42 Pa.C.S. <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>§ 4542.

C.S. §§ 9312, 9315. It is Attorney General Kane’s position that the Independent Counsel Authorization Act would have applied in the instant circumstances, had the enactment not expired according to its own terms. In the absence of such statutory authority, Attorney General Kane contends, the judiciary lacks the power and prerogative to appoint a special prosecutor. Along these lines, Attorney General Kane refers to the legislative history of the Independent Counsel Authorization Act, and, in particular, supportive comments of the Honorable Albert H. Masland during his term as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, to the effect that: “I truly believe that this measure is essential to us, and without it, <em>there really is nothing to take its place.” </em>Pa. <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>House Legislative Journal, June 10, 1997, at 1247 (emphasis added).</p>

Additionally, in open court at the March 11, 2015 oral argument session, there were discussions among several of the Justices and the special prosecutor of the aforementioned hearing. In particular, this Justice questioned the special prosecutor regarding the holding of an <em>ex parte </em>hearing.</p>

Eschewing this historic system of checks and balances, and the traditional approach to the investigation of alleged breaches of confidentiality in grand jury proceedings, the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (“OAJC”) instead seemingly embraces a novel extension of the courts’ appointment powers. In so doing, it has <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>unnecessarily blurred the traditional lines of demarcation of power between the executive and judicial branches of our government and has given largely unfettered power to a judicial special prosecutor. In my view, this approach upends the historic bipartite functioning of grand jury proceedings by vesting the traditionally separate roles of advocate prosecutor and neutral supervising judge in one branch of government. In contrast, the appointment of a special master, a process currently embraced by our Court, preserves and fully vindicates the integrity of the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings and accords respect to the enumerated powers of our sister branches of government.</p>

First, there is no contest as to the importance of conducting grand jury proceedings in secrecy, and that such secrecy is indispensable to the functioning of the grand jury. Second, it is beyond dispute that those who breach the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings should be punished for such violations. Third, there is little question that a judge overseeing a grand jury may appoint an individual to conduct inquiry into allegations of violations of the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, including the provision of a staff, the review of existing transcripts and physical evidence, the compelling of testimony and the production of documents, and the issuance of a final report including findings and reasoning for such findings. <em>In re Dauphin County Fourth Investigating Grand Jury, </em><a href="/pa/610/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="610 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="4202557" data-case-paths="/pa/610/0296-01">610 Pa. 296</a>, <a href="/pa/610/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="19 A.3d 491" data-case-ids="4202557,7280869" data-case-paths="/pa/610/0296-01,/a3d/19/0491-01">19 A.3d 491</a> (2011).</p>

For example, in <em>Smith v.

In doing so, we reasoned that the county judge authorizing the grand jury was not assigned to grand jury matters; that the district attorney denied that he was unable to perform his job; that there were mechanisms for the intervention of the Attorney General; and, most critically, that the authority granted to the special prosecutor was unprecedented and overly broad. In finding the actions by the lower tribunal to be illegal, we stressed that “there is no public office in Pennsylvania known as Special Prosecutor.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20135" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="185 A.2d 135">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20135" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="185 A.2d 135">at 149</a>.

Important for purposes of this matter, and contrary to the OAJC’s implication, no question of the ability of a “special prosecutor” to utilize a grand jury, and to prosecute to the full extent of the law, was remotely present in <em>Dauphin County. </em>Rather, what was at issue was the authority of the court to appoint a “special prosecutor” to investigate and gather information — no <em>prosecutorial </em>power <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>was granted to this special prosecutor and none was implicated. After a careful reading of the opinion, it is clear that the title “special prosecutor” was a misnomer, as observed by Justice Baer in his Concurring Opinion, and that the fact-gathering and reporting position appointed by the Court was more akin to a special master. Indeed, in that decision, our Court made reference to two other instances involving investigations of breaches of grand jury secrecy where a “special prosecutor” was appointed, but those too were only for the purpose of investigation and the submission of reports and recommendations. <em><a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20135" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="185 A.2d 135">Id.</a> </em>at 504-509 (citing <em>In re County Investigating Grand Jury VIII, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203985351" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="2005 WL 3985351">2005 WL 3985351</a> (Pa.Com.FL filed Oct. 25, 2005) and <em>Castellani v.

In that case, the Dauphin County District Attorney sought to impanel a grand jury regarding alleged improprieties involving applicants for a slot machine license and approval of that license by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. Subsequently, the subject of the grand jury proceedings alleged that protected information regarding the grand jury had been disclosed through media sources. After the issuance of a presentment against the license applicants, and various proceedings and appeals, our Court remanded the matter for the appointment of a special prosecutor to conduct inquiry into the alleged breach of confidentiality. Upon the conclusion of his investigation, the special prosecutor issued a report finding the source of the information disclosed to newspaper reporters could not be determined with certainty, in part due to the reporters’ assertion of privilege under the Shield Law, which protects them and their sources.</p>

    <p id="b471-11" data-blocks='[["BL_471.11",471,[217,2264,1145,94]],["BL_472.1",472,[273,315,1146,353]]]'>The OAJC finds authority for this order based on a constellation of statutes. Specifically, it looks to Section 4549 of the <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>Investigating Grand Jury Act, which places responsibilities on judges to maintain the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, 42 Pa.C.S. § 4549(b); the ability of a judge to bring alleged offenses to the attention of an investigating grand jury, 42 Pa.C.S. § 4548(a); and a supervising judge’s general powers required or incidental to the exercise of jurisdiction, 42 Pa.C.S. § 323.</p>
    <p id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.4",472,[274,695,1148,882]]]'>In my view, those statutes do not support such authorization and appointment powers. First, it is unexceptional that a supervising judge is responsible for the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings, that persons participating in such proceedings are sworn to secrecy, and that they “shall be in contempt of court if they reveal any information which they are sworn to keep secret.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 4549(b). Furthermore, an investigating grand jury has the power to inquire into crimes, such powers of inquiry include the use of the investigative resources of the grand jury to obtain initiation of civil and criminal contempt proceedings, and such offenses may be “brought to the attention of such grand jury by the court or by the attorney for the Commonwealth,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 4548(a). However, in relying on this latter reference to the court’s power, the OAJC conflates bringing a potential crime to the attention of the grand jury and actively prosecuting before it.</p>
    <p id="b472-5" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[271,1608,1147,625]]]'>Moreover, and of critical relevance to the matter before us, by the Act’s express terms, it is only an “attorney for the Commonwealth” who may be directed by the grand jury to prepare a presentment which is then submitted to the grand jury for a vote. 42 Pa.C.S. § 4551. Importantly, an “attorney for the Commonwealth” is specifically and clearly defined as the district attorney of the county where a <em>county </em>investigating grand jury is empaneled, or the Attorney General where, as here, a <em>statewide </em>investigating grand jury is at issue. 42 Pa.C.S. § 4542. There is no mechanism under the Investigatory Grand Jury Act by which the court, or an appointee thereof, may obtain a grand jury presentment.</p>
    <p id="b472-6" data-blocks='[["BL_472.6",472,[274,2257,1144,96]],["BL_473.1",473,[218,314,1145,360]]]'>Thus, in my view, the Investigatory Grand Jury Act does not expressly, or impliedly, provide a supervising judge with <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>the power to appoint an individual to act as a “special prosecutor” who is not an “attorney of the Commonwealth,” or for that individual to use the grand jury process to obtain a presentment and to prosecute such proceedings. In approving such appointment here, the OAJC has disrupted the bipartite nature of grand jury proceedings, allowing a court to act <em>both </em>as neutral supervisor and executive prosecutor.</p>
    <p id="b473-4" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[218,699,1147,895]]]'>Finally, I disagree with the OAJC’s conclusion that the general powers of the courts forms a basis for such appointment power. Section 323 speaks in broad terms, including the power to issue “every lawful writ and process necessary or suitable for the exercise of its jurisdiction,” and for the enforcement of any order the court may issue, as well as “all legal and equitable powers required for or incidental to the exercise of its jurisdiction.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 323. Yet, it is questionable whether our inherent powers may usurp or vitiate express statutory limitations on the functioning of the grand jury. 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 4548; 4551. Indeed, a review of the entire Investigatory Grand Jury Act reflects the distinct role of the executive, as prosecutor charged with guiding the grand jury process, and the role of the judiciary, as a neutral, responsible for supervising the proceedings. Moreover, any such inherent power should be viewed in the context of traditional powers and roles.</p>
    <p id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[217,1620,1147,737]],["BL_474.1",474,[278,313,1141,150]]]'>In sum, the historic structure of grand jury proceedings, our case law, the operation of the Investigating Grand Jury Act, as well as a considered avoidance of separation of powers concerns if at all possible, indicate the judiciary does not have the authority to appoint an individual to act as a prosecutor before the grand jury and use the grand jury process to obtain a presentment, and to facilitate a criminal prosecution. By contrast, I believe that a judge overseeing a grand jury may authorize an individual — a special master — to conduct inquiry into alleged grand jury confidentiality breaches, to issue findings and a report, and to remedy any breach through contempt proceedings. Accordingly, in this matter, it is my opinion that the supervising judge did not have the authority to grant the special prosecutor <em>prosecutorial </em>powers, and <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>therefore the presentment is without authority. As a result, I dissent from the majority’s contrary conclusions in this regard.</p>
    <p id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[275,485,1151,1259]]]'>Nevertheless, due to the circumscribed nature of the writ by which Attorney General Kane has sought <em>relief </em>— quo <em>warran-to </em>— I conclude she is not entitled to relief. A <em>quo warranto </em>action historically has been the sole and exclusive method to test title or right to public office. <em>Spykerman v. Township of Chester, </em><a href="/pa/491/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="491 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="1765644" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0470-01">491 Pa. 470</a>, <a href="/pa/491/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="491 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="1765644" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0470-01">421 A.2d 641</a>, 648 (1980). Yet, the writ is limited. Critically, a <em>quo warranto </em>action is addressed to “preventing a continued exercise of authority unlawfully asserted, rather than to correct what has already been done under the authority.” <em>Id.; see also State Dental Council and Examining Bd. v. Pollock, </em><a href="/pa/457/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="457 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="477656" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0264-01">457 Pa. 264</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20910" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="318 A.2d 910">318 A.2d 910</a>, 913 (1974). Indeed, “[t]he gravamen of the complaint is the right to hold and exercise the powers of the office in contradistinction to an attack upon the propriety of the acts performed while in office.” <em>Spykerman, </em><a href="/pa/491/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="491 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="1765644" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0470-01">421 A.2d at 648</a>. In this respect, it is intended to address <em>public, </em>not <em>private </em>injury. <em>Bd. of Revision of Taxes, City of Philadelphia v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/607/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="607 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="4198084,4198800" data-case-paths="/pa/607/0104-01,/pa/607/0104-02">607 Pa. 104</a>, <a href="/pa/607/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="135" data-cite="4 A.3d 610" data-case-ids="4198084,4198800,7288020,7288112" data-case-paths="/pa/607/0104-01,/pa/607/0104-02,/a3d/4/0610-01,/a3d/4/0610-02">4 A.3d 610</a>, 627 (2010) (“A complaint in <em>quo warranto </em>is aimed at the right to exercise the powers of the office, which is a public injury, rather than an attack upon the propriety of the actions performed while in office, which would be a private injury.”) Therefore, a complaint in <em>quo warranto </em>addresses the continued exercise of authority, not past conduct.</p>

With respect to her challenge to the special prosecutor, Attorney General Kane claims that the supervising judge unlawfully and unconstitutionally exceeded his authority in appointing a special prosecutor for the grand jury and asks that the appointment be deemed to be invalid and quashed, and for a ruling that the special prosecutor had no authority to hold such public office.

That is, the supervising judge’s appointment of the special prosecutor <em>as a special master </em>was proper, and, the judge had the authority to grant certain investigatory powers to him. <em>See Dauphin County. </em>However, the granting and exercise of power beyond that recognized by this Court in <em>Dauphin County </em>was improper, and I would enjoin the special prosecutor from exercising such <em>prosecutorial </em>powers in the future.</p>
    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[213,1048,1154,736]]]'>With respect to her challenge to the presentment, the Attorney General seeks a ruling that “no legitimate report or presentment can issue from this Investigating Grand Jury.” Memorandum of Law in Support of Attorney General Kathleen G. Kane’s Quo Warranto Action, 12/23/14, at 13. However, a presentment has been issued, and, as made clear above, such retrospective relief, seeking to unwind the acts previously taken by the special prosecutor, is beyond the scope of the limited nature of an action in <em>quo warranto. See City of Philadelphia; Spykerman. </em>Thus, even though, in my view, the use of the grand jury and the issuance of the presentment were beyond the authority of the special prosecutor, there is no current remedy available through an action in <em>quo warran-to.</em>
