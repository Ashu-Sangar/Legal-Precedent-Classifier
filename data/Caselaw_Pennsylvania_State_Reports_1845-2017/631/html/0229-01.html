The Election Code, enacted in 1937, initially permitted voting with paper ballots or mechanical lever voting machines. 25 P.S. §§ 2961-71 (ballots); 25 P.S. §§ 3001-18 (voting machines). In 1980, the General Assembly amended the Election Code to allow the use of electronic voting systems, which include optical scanners, punch card <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>systems, and DREs. 25 P.S. §§ 3031.1-3031.22 (electronic voting systems). Optical scanners (akin to standardized testing methods) and punch card voting allows voters to mark selections on a paper ballot that is subsequently scanned and counted by an automatic tabulation device. In contrast, DREs display an electronic ballot on a screen and allow an individual to vote using a button, dial, or touch screen. The DREs at issue do not produce a contemporaneous paper record of an individual’s vote, but store each vote on internal memory. However, all of the DREs at issue are capable of printing the vote data at the close of the election; some DREs print on full sheets of paper while others print on thermal paper, which is commonly used for printing receipts. In addition, electronic vote data can be removed from the DRE on external memory devices, such as flash drives and memory cards, and connected to a different electronic system to tally the votes.</p>

In addition, Appellants relied on studies conducted by other states that reveal security vulnerabilities in the DREs at issue. The Secretary’s expert, Dr. Michael I.

While Appellants contended this provision requires a DRE to produce a contemporaneous paper record at the time a vote is cast, the Commonwealth Court construed the phrase “provide for a permanent physical record” to refer to the DREs’ ability to generate such a record upon demand.

The majority criticized Appellants for failing to identify which specific DREs use thermal paper and emphasized Appellants had not challenged Dr. Shamos’s opinion that the legibility of thermal paper will exceed the twenty-two month federal ballot retention requirement if kept from direct exposure to heat. Moreover, the majority found the DREs’ electronic data are also sufficiently permanent, but did not resolve the issue of whether such data constitutes a <em>'physical </em>record as the parties did not dispute that every DRE at issue is capable of providing printed records.</p>

Although it recognized the validity of this concern, the Commonwealth Court majority found Appellants’ assertion that the Election Code requires software-independent voting to be inconsistent with the 1980 amendments authorizing the use of voting systems that <em>only </em>register votes electronically.

Reasoning that this provision merely requires that a sample of ballots be counted, not produced, by another device, the Commonwealth Court found a statistical recount can be performed on a DRE that is capable of printing records that can be counted manually. The <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>Commonwealth Court also discounted Appellants’ claim that the statistical recount provision requires an audit to assess whether the DRE captured correct voter intent. Instead, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that this provision requires a simple retally of a statistical sample of the votes. The Commonwealth Court reiterated that the Election Code does not require software-independent vote records as several provisions authorize systems which only register votes electronically and differentiate between electronic voting systems that use paper ballots and those that do not use paper ballots. <em>See </em>25 P.S. § 3154(e)(4) (providing for the recanvassing of votes for districts using electronic voting systems without paper ballots); 25 P.S. § 3262 (same).</p>

The Commonwealth Court noted that 25 P.S. § 3031.18 clarifies that the recount procedure in Section 3261 is reserved for electronic systems utilizing paper ballots and provides that other types of electronic systems shall be assessed under Section 3262 (allowing officials to recanvass voting machines by examining the registering counter without unlocking the machine against voting).

Judge McCullough also argued that electronic data does not constitute a <em>physical </em>record of each vote cast. In addition, Judge McCullough also questioned whether records printed on thermal paper are sufficiently “permanent,” crediting the testimony of Appellants’ expert who claimed thermal paper can become unreadable in a matter of weeks if not stored properly.

    <p id="b302-7" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[278,1075,1146,641]]]'>Appellants argue the Commonwealth Court erred in granting Secretary summary relief on Count I as the DREs violate the Election Code by failing to provide for a permanent physical record of each vote cast. In the definitional section of the 1980 Election Code amendments permitting electronic voting, the Legislature defined an “electronic voting system” as “a system in which one or more voting devices are used to permit the registering or recording of votes and in which such votes are computed and tabulated by automatic tabulating equipment. <em>The system shall provide for a permanent physical record of each vote cast.” </em>25 P.S. § 3031.1 (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b302-8" data-blocks='[["BL_302.7",302,[277,1762,1149,578]]]'>Appellants begin by emphasizing their belief that electronic data are not “physical” records as such data is composed of subatomic particles that are not perceptible through the senses. Appellants also claim electronic data cannot be considered “permanent” as such records are in an alterable state until the polls close at the end of the election. Lastly, Appellants challenge the Commonwealth Court’s finding that electronic data constitute a “record of each vote cast” as the DREs’ recording process is dependent on software which may be flawed or corrupted; thus, Appellants allege that one cannot be certain if the electronic data reflects voter intent.</p>

Appellants argue that the records printed at the end of the election are not meaningful records, as they merely report electronic data that may have been altered without detection. If this Court finds the phrase “provide for a record of each vote cast” to be ambiguous, Appellants claim that their interpretation is supported by the statute’s legislative history in which they allege the members of the General Assembly expressed a distrust of computers and intended this requirement to operate as a safeguard to provide a recountable record of votes.</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.4",303,[179,1371,1147,794]]]'>In response, the Secretary contends that the DREs’ electronic records constitute permanent physical records. Although not definitively decided by the Commonwealth Court, the Secretary claims the DREs’ electronic records are “physical” as they can be preserved for later use on removable memory cards and can remain intact for many years. With respect to the electronic records’ permanency, the Secretary supports the Commonwealth Court’s assessment that this requirement signifies that vote records need not last forever but must be retained for a sufficient period of time to permit recounts, recanvassing, and litigation. Moreover, the Secretary rejects Appellants’ suggestion that vote records must be software-independent as the General Assembly specifically authorized the use of voting systems that only record votes electronically.</p>

      <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>The Secretary also agrees with the Commonwealth Court’s finding that the DREs’ printed records constitute permanent physical records of each vote cast. As the Code requires that an electronic voting system “provide for” such records, the Secretary finds this provision encompasses a DRE’s ability to generate records on demand, defining the phrase “provide for” as “to make it possible for something to be done.” Secretary’s Brief, at 17 (citing Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary). Although Appellants argue the printed records are simply copies of flawed electronic data, the Secretary contends this indirect attack fails for the same reasons as their direct attack on electronic data as the Legislature specifically authorized devices that only record votes electronically. If this Court finds the permanent physical record requirement ambiguous, the Secretary urges this court to give weight to her interpretation as the governmental officer charged with applying the Election Code’s provisions. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(8). In addition, the Secretary urges this Court to consider the consequences of adopting Appellants’ interpretation of the language in question to decertify the DREs in use and leave a majority of the counties in the Commonwealth without a voting system. While Appellants suggest that counties should replace DREs with optical-scan systems in which a paper ballot is counted by an electronic device, the Secretary argues that such a “solution” would pose the same issues as use of the DREs and may not be economically feasible.</p>

However, while Appellants attempt to read this requirement into Section 3031.1, the plain language of the statute provides otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[177,1350,1150,1002]],["BL_306.1",306,[280,309,1144,203]]]'>Appellants cannot point to any provision in the Election Code requiring an electronic voting system to print a paper ballot for each individual voter to view. On the contrary, the plain language of Section 3031.1 states that an electronic voting system shall <em>“provide for </em>a permanent physical record.” 25 P.S. § 3031.1 (emphasis added). While the Oxford Dictionary defines the word “provide” as “to make available for use or supply,” it separately defines the phrase “provide for” as “to make adequate preparation for (a possible event).” Oxford Dictionaries, http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/ american_english/provide#provide_13. As the addition of the preposition “for” brings an anticipatory meaning to the phrase, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that Appellants’ interpretation of the permanent physical record provision to be a contemporaneous requirement would render the word “for” to be mere surplusage. <em>See Commonwealth v. Lobiondo, </em><a href="/pa/501/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="501 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1782462" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0599-01">501 Pa. 599</a>, 603, <a href="/pa/501/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="501 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1782462" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0599-01">462 A.2d 662</a>, 664 (1983) (presuming that “every word, sentence or provision of a statute is intended for some purpose and accordingly must be given <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>effect”). Thus, the Legislature’s selection of the phrase “provide for” is consistent with the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation requiring DREs to have the “ability to generate or supply the required records on demand.”</p>
    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[277,535,1147,1253]]]'>Moreover, other Election Code provisions show the Legislature contemplated and authorized electronic voting systems that would register votes during an election without paper ballots. Section 3031.1 broadly defines “ballot” as “ballot cards or paper ballots upon which a voter registers or records his vote <em>or the apparatus by which the voter registers his vote </em>electronically_”25 P.S. § 3031.1 (emphasis added). Similarly, Section 3031.1 defines “voting device” as “either an apparatus in which paper ballots or ballot cards are used in connection with an implement by which a voter registers his votes with ink or other substance or by punching, <em>or an apparatus by which such votes are registered electronically </em>.... ” <em><a href="/pa/501/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="501 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1782462" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0599-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis added). In addition, as discussed more fully in the next issue, the Legislature set forth different full recount procedures for electronic voting systems that operate with or without paper ballots. If we were to accept Appellants’ contention that the Legislature intended that electronic systems must provide voter-verified ballots, this interpretation would render meaningless provisions in which the Legislature specifically discussed voting systems that do not use paper ballots to register votes, leading to an absurd result. We presume the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable, but intends for the entire statute to be effective and certain. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922.</p>

Even though Appellants have raised a valid concern about DRE security, this assertion does not affect our finding that the Legislature clearly authorized electronic voting systems that do not utilize paper ballots. While WPAT technology may offer additional security against election fraud, Appellants should direct their claims to <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>the Legislature, which is better suited to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of WPAT DREs and examine policy considerations that would arise from requiring voter-verified paper ballots. Although Appellants laud paper records as a panacea to voting fraud, even paper ballots are not a completely secure system without risk as there are many opportunities for tampering to occur from the time a voter casts his or her ballot until the time a winner is declared. Appellants also seem to assume there would be no practical problems in attempting to implement a contemporaneous paper record requirement while preserving voter privacy and election security.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> As the certified DREs are able to print individual vote records at the close of an election, the DREs produce a permanent physical record of each vote cast as contemplated by Section 3031.1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Thus, the Commonwealth Court correctly granted the Secretary summary relief on Count I of Appellants’ Petition for Review.</p>

Appellants again take issue with the Commonwealth Court’s finding that the Election Code does not require software-independent vote records, accusing the Commonwealth Court of implicitly repealing the statistical recount requirement for electronic voting systems in Section 3031.17. As portions of the 2004 amendments pertaining to full recounts provide that <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>electronic voting systems utilizing paper ballots must be subject to a full recount and any other type of electronic voting system be subject to a recanvass (25 P.S. § 3031.18, § 3154(e)), Appellants suggest that this distinction shows that electronic voting systems are incapable of performing any recount, including a statistical recount.</p>

The Secretary distinguishes the statistical recount provision from full recounts required by other Election Code provisions, claiming that while a statistical recount is automatically conducted on a small random sample of ballots at the close of every election, full recounts are only performed in the event of discrepancy in the voting results or a request by voters to ensure against fraud or error. The Secretary claims the purpose of the statistical recount is different; a “ ‘statistical recount’ seeks merely to determine whether the original tabulation was performed correctly ... [and] is not designed to be a forensic examination into whether a voter’s intent was properly recorded by the machine.” Secretary’s Brief, at 29. Moreover, the Secretary rejects Appellants’ claim that the Commonwealth Court implicitly repealed the “statistical recount” requirement by finding that the 2004 amendments authorized electronic voting systems that do not use paper ballots to register votes.

Election officials can conduct a statistical recount on the DREs at issue by printing the requisite percentage of vote records for a manual count or removing the electronic data on external media devices to use a different electronic device to recount the results. The purpose of the statistical recount, or any random sampling, is to ensure that the small random sample taken is representative of the voting results of the entire population. This provision gives officials a simple method to assess whether the tabulating element of the DRE is working properly without having to print out all the votes cast at every election.</p>

Since the Election Code’s original enactment, the Legislature has consistently used the terms recount and recanvass to acknowledge that distinct procedures are more suitable to conduct full recounts on voting systems with different technology; ballots may be recounted and voting systems that do not use ballots may be recanvassed. This concept is demonstrated in 25 P.S. § 3261 and 3262 (both sections addressing “Recounts”), which set forth full recount procedures to be conducted in the event of fraud, error, or a proper voter request. The two sections contain nearly identical language except for the procedures in which the recount is conducted; while Section 3261 requires districts employing paper ballot voting to “open the ballot box ... and cause the entire vote to be correctly counted,” Section 3262 mandates that voting machines be “recanvassed” by examining the registering counters that record the vote totals. 25 P.S. § 3261-62.

While Appellants claim traditional paper ballots and optical scan voting are preferable alternatives, they fail to acknowledge that such systems are also vulnerable to tampering as paper ballots can be easily destroyed or altered by an individual intending to manipulate the election result. Moreover, paper ballots may fail to accurately record voter intent as a result of mechanical or human error that leads to the invalidation of votes, in cases where ballots have not been completed in a correct and comprehensible manner, contain an overvote or undervote based on the number of permitted selections in an election, or contain markings that cannot be read by an optical scanner.

This requires something more that the mere counting of the votes. It involves the exercise of judicial functions to decide whether certain votes shall be counted or not.” This argument ignores the differences in technology offered by paper ballots and electronic voting. While election officials conducting a manual recount of paper ballots may examine the ballots for markings that may not clearly demonstrate voter intent, a DRE touchscreen does not record <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>ambiguous indicia of voter intent that can be reviewed during a manual recount. <em>See Wexlerv.

Rutgers has been litigating a similar lawsuit in New Jersey to challenge the use of electronic voting systems that do not produce voter-verified ballots, claiming that DREs’ vulnerability to tampering make them inherently insecure and unreliable. Most of Rutgers's brief refers to the use of one particular DRE, the Sequoia AVC Advantage, in New Jersey elections. Rutgers relies on expert testimony and evidence never entered into the record before the Commonwealth Court. As correctly asserted by the Secretary, consideration of such evidence by this Court would be improper since this evidence was never made part of the official record. <em>McCaffrey v.
