    <p id="b388-9" data-blocks='[["BL_388.8",388,[276,929,1145,253]]]'>In this appeal by allowance involving alleged medical negligence, we consider whether a doctor may introduce evidence that the patient was informed of and acknowledged various risks of surgery, although the complaint does not assert a cause of action based on a lack of informed consent.</p>
    <p id="b388-10" data-blocks='[["BL_388.9",388,[276,1213,1144,529]]]'>Appellee, Maria Brady, had a lengthy history of foot problems. By 2007, both of her feet were in pain due to toe deformities. Appellee’s podiatrist, William Urbas, D.P.M., successfully treated toes on her left foot with surgery; he then turned his attention to her right foot. Regarding that foot, one of Appellee’s primary complaints pertained to a hammertoe condition of her second toe (next to the big toe). This deformity caused the middle of Appellee’s second toe to rise above the plane of the foot, which in turn caused rubbing and pain when Appellee wore shoes.</p>
    <p id="b388-11" data-blocks='[["BL_388.10",388,[277,1764,1147,584]],["BL_389.1",389,[207,310,1148,411]]]'>To address this condition, Dr. Urbas performed a total of four operations between March 2008 and January 2010. Before each surgery, he explained the risks and complications that could occur, and Appellee signed a consent form acknowledging her awareness of these possible outcomes. The first surgery entailed removing approximately one centimeter of bone from the proximal phalanx of the second toe in an effort to straighten the toe. The parties agree that Dr. Urbas was not negligent as to that surgery. Unfortunately, however, this first operation did not finally alleviate Appellee’s condition because, in the post-operative timeframe, certain internal tis<a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>sues contracted, pulling the toe upward once again. Dr. Urbas eventually performed three more surgeries, each involving, among other things, the removal of additional bone material with the expectation that the foot would, over time, generate soft tissue to fill the gap and provide flexibility. Nevertheless, Appellee’s pain persisted and, in the end, her toe was less stable and significantly shorter than it had been initially.</p>
    <p id="b389-5" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[207,745,1148,413]]]'>In August 2010, Appellee consulted a different podiatrist, Dr. Harold Schoenhaus, who performed a bone-graft operation which returned the toe to approximately ninety percent of its original length. This procedure also had the effect of restoring some of the toe’s stability and substantially reducing the pain. Appellee testified that she was pleased with the outcome of Dr. Schoenhaus’ surgery and that she returned to all levels of activity.</p>
    <p id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[207,1191,1147,671]]]'>In December 2010, Appellee filed a complaint against Dr. Urbas, alleging that he negligently treated her toe in the three follow-up surgeries performed after March 2008. She averred that she could not have reasonably discovered the harm she suffered until after the fourth surgery because “Dr. Urbas’ advice, assurances and recommendations ... lulled [her] into a false sense of security and concealed the true nature of [her] condition[.]” Complaint at ¶ 18. As to the alleged negligence, Appellee asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that Dr. Urbas failed to determine the cause of her original toe condition, and recommended and performed procedures that were counter-indicated. <em>See id. </em>at ¶ 22.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Notably, the complaint did not include a cause of action for lack of informed consent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellee argued that such evidence was not relevant to whether Dr. Urbas performed within the appropriate standard of care. Further, she maintained that the probative value of this evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. Dr. Urbas responded that the risks and complications of surgery would be relevant to Appel-lee’s credibility as a witness and to her state of mind at the time of the surgeries, and that the evidence of consent would not be used to prove or disprove informed consent. The trial court denied the motion and permitted admission of the consent-related evidence.</p>

At various other points during the trial, Appellee’s consent to surgery and her knowledge of the risks involved were discussed.</p>

While [the plaintiff] or any other patient may consent to risks, she does not consent to negligence. Knowledge by the trier of fact of informed consent to risk, where lack of [informed consent is not an issue, does not help the plaintiff prove negligence. Nor does it help the defendant show he was not negligent. In such a case, the admission of evidence concerning a plaintiffs consent could only serve to confuse the jury because the jury could conclude ... that consent to the surgery was tantamount to consent to the injury which resulted from that surgery. In effect, the jury could conclude that consent amounted to waiver, which is plainly wrong.</blockquote>

Relatedly, he proffers that his testimony regarding his views prior to the surgery as to possible outcomes and complications lent credence to his position at trial that he met the standard of care, as the injuries occurred from the procedures’ known complications rather than negligence. He further notes that the parties centrally disagreed about the necessity of the three follow-up surgeries, and that Appellee alleged in her complaint that he had given her assurances which “lulled [her] into a false sense of security.” Thus, he argues that his testimony was needed to rebut such allegation and, again, to demonstrate that the injuries Appellee suffered stemmed from ordinary risks associated with the operations.</p>

She maintains that consent evidence only serves to confuse jurors because they might conclude that consent to the surgery was consent to the injury. Appellee posits that the jurors in the present trial appear to have labored under this misconception, as they clarified that their purpose in requesting the consent sheets during deliberation was to see what Appellee had agreed to. As well, Appellee reasons that, where, as here, the form contains an extensive list of risks and complications, allowing the jury to consider it presents an unduly high obstacle to recovery for medical negligence. Ap-pellee finally takes issue with Dr. Urbas’ argument that the Superior Court failed to apply the proper standard of review or evidentiary balancing test. She indicates that the record reflects that Dr. Urbas used the consent forms and related testimony, not as evidence of adherence to the standard of care or lack of causation, but to show that Appellee understood and accepted the risk of her injuries — thereby demonstrating that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the introduction of such proofs.</p>

Along these lines, <em>Schneider </em>recognized that an assumption-of-the-risk defense may be available in such cases, so long as there is evidence that the plaintiff expressly consented to any particular risks associated with the unconventional or experimental treatment. <em>See Schneider, </em><a href="/f2d/817/0987-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="817 F.2d 987" data-case-ids="1670957" data-case-paths="/f2d/817/0987-01">817 F.2d at 995-96</a>.
