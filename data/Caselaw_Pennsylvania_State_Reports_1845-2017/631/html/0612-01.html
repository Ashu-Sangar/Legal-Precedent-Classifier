Consequently, he was not licensed to practice law at the time he circulated his nomination petitions. He listed his occupation as “lawyer,” he said, because he understood the definition of “lawyer” as found in the Oxford English Dictionary to include someone who studied the law.

As noted by the court below, the Oxford English Dictionary defines a “lawyer” as “[a] person who practices or studies law; an attorney or a counselor.” The same dictionary, however, defines a “profession” as “[a] paid occupation, especially one that involves prolonged training and a formal qualification,” and assigns a principal definition to “occupation” as “[a] job or a profession.” A “job,” in turn is defined as “[a] paid position of regular employment.” In accordance with these definitions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the “occupation or profession of lawyer” for purposes of a nomination petition would comprise not only completion of prolonged training in law school but also acquisition of a formal qualification to practice law, which, in this Commonwealth, entails receiving a license to practice.</p>

This point is perhaps best exemplified in Rule 5.3, “Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistance,” which addresses the responsibilities assumed by lawyers who employ or retain “nonlawyer assistance” in their practices. Insightful for our purposes is that Rule 5.3 designates law students as “nonlawyers,” regardless of their learned status and years of intense legal training.

Our restrictive standard of review as cited above permits us to revisit this aspect of the court’s decision if, <em>inter alia, </em>it is unsupported by substantial evidence. The court predicated its inference of the candidate’s intent on two findings of fact: first, that Mr. Beyer sincerely believed he could properly call himself a lawyer, and, second, that he clarified any potentially misleading aspect to his petition when the opportunities to do so arose. We discern the first predicate regarding the candidate’s beliefs to be beside the essential point of whether he knew his petition as worded would likely mislead electors, and we discredit the second as belied by the substantial evidence of record.</p>

This is the critical point, as it was in this manner that his conduct met the scienter requirements for petition invalidation as expressed in <em>Baldwin </em>and its progeny. Specifically, responding to electors who observed “[s]o, you’re a lawyer?” with “[o]h, you know, I haven’t passed the bar yet but I plan on taking it next year” reflected an understanding that his usage of the term did not fit within society’s general idea of what a lawyer is. Indeed, his prepared response was the functional equivalent of an admission that he was not yet a lawyer as most electors would understand the term, and would not become one until such time that he passed the bar examination. Apparent in his own testimony, therefore, was his appreciation that electors would likely expect more of a “lawyer by occupation or profession” than having simply graduated law school. The Commonwealth Court seems to have identified this concern when it found the Candidate used the term “lawyer” to “enhance his stature” among electors. <em>In re Beyer, supra </em>at 12. To the extent the candidate knowingly used the term to suggest a professional status he had yet to attain, we agree. Mr. Beyer, through his statement of occupation, implied credentials material to the office of legislator that he simply did not yet possess.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Yet, he persisted in circulating a nomination petition that he knew could mislead in this respect.</p>

Every presentment of a petition for signature, therefore, represented an opportunity for Mr. Beyer to identify clearly his occupation, and the candidate knew his petition would likely promote misinformation on that very point.

We have recognized that section 977 permits a court, in its discretion, to amend material defects made without the intention to mislead.

Beyer from the primary ballot for the Democratic Party nomination for the Office of Representative in the General Assembly for the 131st Legislative District. <em>In re Nomination of Michael Beyer, </em><a href="/pa/625/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="625 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="4217156" data-case-paths="/pa/625/0341-01">625 Pa. 341</a>, <a href="/pa/625/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="91 A.3d 1231" data-case-ids="4217156,6969946" data-case-paths="/pa/625/0341-01,/a3d/91/1231-01">91 A.3d 1231</a> (2014).</p>
    <p id="b683-6" data-blocks='[["BL_683.6",683,[211,704,1151,1000]]]'>To reiterate, I find it reasonable for this Court to rule prospectively that a candidate may only designate his occupation or profession as “lawyer” on nomination papers after he or she has graduated from law school, passed the bar exam, and is in good standing as an active member of the Pennsylvania Bar. However, at the time Candidate Beyer filed his nomination papers, neither a majority of this Court nor the Commonwealth Court had ever made such an express declaration. Notably, the opinions the majority finds persuasive in support of its determination that Candidate Beyer intentionally made a material misrepresentation are concurring opinions of Former Chief Justice Castille in <em>In re Rankin, </em><a href="/pa/583/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="583 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="687697" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0038-01">583 Pa. 38</a>, <a href="/pa/583/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="874 A.2d 1145" data-case-ids="687697,687737,8959806,8959833" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0038-01,/pa/583/0037-01,/a2d/874/1145-01,/a2d/874/1145-02">874 A.2d 1145</a> (2005), and <em>In re Nomination Petition of Guzzardi, </em><a href="/pa/627/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="627 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="4353084" data-case-paths="/pa/627/0001-01">627 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/627/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="99 A.3d 381" data-case-ids="4353084,6915474" data-case-paths="/pa/627/0001-01,/a3d/99/0381-01">99 A.3d 381</a> (2014). These cases, however, involved election matters where the candidate was not removed from the ballot based on any misrepresentation of the candidate’s occupation. Thus, in my view, they cannot serve as affording candidates clear notice of what constitutes the occupation of “lawyer” for purposes of the Election Code.</p>
    <p id="b683-7" data-blocks='[["BL_683.7",683,[210,1727,1150,624]],["BL_684.1",684,[273,303,1146,99]]]'>In the instant case, the Commonwealth Court made a specific factual finding that Candidate Beyer had no intent to deceive the electorate by listing his occupation as “lawyer,” but rather believed that he was a lawyer because he had studied law and graduated from law school. The Commonwealth Court further relied upon Candidate Beyer’s candor in a newspaper interview, where he acknowledged readily that he was a recent law school graduate who had not yet taken the bar exam. Absent intent to deceive the electorate or a violation of a clear legal directive prohibiting him from representing his occupation as a “lawyer” upon graduation from law school, I cannot join the majority’s holding that Candidate <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>Beyer committed a knowing and material misrepresentation warranting the striking of his name from the ballot.</p>
