On appeal from his judgment of sentence, he challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction, contending that he had no direct supervision of the children he was found to have endangered. The Superior Court agreed, and reversed his conviction. On the Commonwealth’s appeal, we reverse the Superior Court, concluding that there is no statutory requirement of direct supervision of children. Rather, that which is supervised is the child’s welfare. Under the facts presented at trial, Appellee was a person supervising the welfare of many children because, as a high-ranking official in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, he was specifically responsible for protecting children from sexually abusive priests.</p>

He served as a parish priest for eight years before becoming the Dean of Men at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in 1984. In January 1991, Appellee was appointed Associate Vicar in the Office of the Vicar for Administration in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. As Associate Vicar, one of Appellee’s responsibilities was to assist Monsignor James Molloy by taking notes when they met with people regarding the sexual abuse of a minor by a member of the clergy, and, consequently, Appellee learned how to interview sexual abuse victims and record their allegations against a priest. N.T. 5/23/2012 at 183-85. In June 1992, Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua appointed Appellee Secretary for Clergy for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, where he served for twelve years, until June 2004.</p>

N.T. 5/23/2012 at 201, 220. Although he could only independently remove a priest from a parish if that priest admitted that he had abused someone, N.T. 5/23/2012 at 77, it was Appellee’s responsibility to make recommendations about assignments to the Cardinal, who had the ultimate decision making authority. For example, Appellee could make recommendations to place a priest on administrative leave or restrict a priest’s ministry by, for instance, prohibiting contact with the public or with children. In this respect, Appellee characterized protecting children as the most important part of his job, and explained that he worked “for” the children of the Archdiocese. N.T. 5/24/2012 at 56.</p>

This discovery caused Appellee to become concerned that there were other priests in active service against whom allegations of abuse had been asserted, and accordingly prompted him to conduct a comprehensive review of the Secret Archives to check for incidents of child sexual abuse among all priests in active ministry within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.</p>

This report identified 35 priests in active service with previous complaints of sexual abuse of minors. Appellee placed each of these 35 priests on one of three lists: three priests were identified as “pedophiles;” 12 priests as “Guilty of Sexual Misconduct with Minors;” and 20 were included on a list entitled “Allegations of Sexual Misconduct with Minors with No Conclusive Evidence.” N.T. 5/16/2012 at 182-98.

Appellee had investigated allegations into Rev. Avery’s conduct, and memorialized his understanding of these allegations with notations to Rev. Avery’s Secret Archives file indicating “alcoholism and action with same minor three times,” and “action occurred more than five years ago.” As will be discussed more fully below, the information contained in Rev. Avery’s Secret Archives file revealed that he had built a trusting relationship with this minor, R.F., in his church, groomed R.F. -with attention outside of the religious context, and, on several occasions, supplied R.F. with alcohol and engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct.</p>

Avery’s Secret Archives file contained a letter written by R.F. on March 31, 1992, to Appellee’s predecessor as Secretary for Clergy, Monsignor Jagodzinski, regarding his sexual abuse by Rev. Avery in the 1970s when R.F. was an adolescent. R.F. indicated that he wrote the letter out of concern for “other adolescent boys” who may also have been abused by Rev. Avery. N.T. 4/25/2012 at 38. R.F. attached a copy of a letter he had previously written to Rev. Avery in which he recounted the bond that had been formed between them when R.F. was around 11 years old, in the sixth grade, and Rev. Avery was the assistant pastor at St. Philip Neri Parish in East Greenville, and how Rev.

R.F. provided further details regarding how Rev. Avery had victimized him at a young age. Specifically, when R.F. was an altar boy he helped Rev. Avery serve Mass at St. Philip Neri. He described Rev. Avery as very charismatic, popular with young people, and active with the youth in the parish. Outside of church, Rev. Avery gave R.F. his first beer at age 12, and took R.F. and other boys from the parish to his home in New Jersey, where he supplied them with alcohol. There was a loft in Rev. Avery’s New Jersey home with several beds where the boys would sleep, and Rev. Avery would join the boys in the loft to -wrestle with them. According to Appellee’s notes of his interview with R.F., during two or three such encounters, Rev. Avery’s hand “slipped to [R.F.’s] crotch.” N.T. 3/26/2012 at 255.</p>

Avery continued this pattern of inviting him to participate in seemingly innocuous activities, and then groping him when vulnerable. By the time R.F. was 15 in 1978, Rev. Avery had been transferred from St. Philip Neri, but maintained contact with R.F. by telephone and invited him to parties where Rev. Avery was the disc jockey; a particular avocation of Rev. Avery’s, and, notably, one that brought him into contact with multiple young men. Eventually R.F. began to assist Rev. Avery at parties. At a college party where R.F. helped Rev. Avery disc jockey, Rev. Avery supplied R.F. with alcohol, resulting in him becoming sick a few hours later, vomiting in the bathroom, and passing out in a hallway. Rev. Avery took R.F. back to the rectory where he resided, and encouraged R.F. to sleep in Rev. Avery’s bed. When R.F. awoke several hours later, Rev. Avery’s hands were inside R.F.’s shorts. In June 1981, when R.F. was 18, Rev. Avery invited him on a ski trip to Vermont. Rev. Avery, R.F., and his brother (J.F.) shared a hotel room. In the night, Rev. Avery joined R.F. in bed, and again molested him after <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>he had fallen asleep, massaging his penis until it became erect and R.F. ejaculated.</p>

Avery had committed these offenses against R.F. after church officials had gone out of their way to accommodate Rev. Avery: when Rev. Avery was assistant pastor at Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Chester, Pennsylvania, a church official had suggested in a memorandum to the Cardinal that Rev. Avery be appointed to St. Philip Neri to “avoid another breakdown” (the details of which are apparently unknown), which prompted Rev. Avery’s gratitude to the church official for accommodating his “euphemistically speaking, predicament.” N.T. 3/26/2012 at 228. Rather than utilizing his transfer to St. Philip Neri as an opportunity to focus on his priestly obligations, however, Rev. Avery had instead engaged in the grooming behavior and sexual molestation of R.F. described above.</p>

Appellee assured R.F. that the Archdiocese’s “order of priorities is the victim, the victim’s family, the Church, and the priest himself.” N.T. 3/26/2012 at 259-60. Appellee met with Rev. Avery a week later on October 7, 1992, regarding R.F.’s allegations. Although Rev. Avery initially denied R.F.’s account and expressed shock that R.F. was in counseling for this issue, Rev. Avery confirmed many of the details R.F. had provided, including that he took kids to his house in New Jersey and “would roughhouse with the boys ...,” and that he shared a bed with R.F. on the ski trip to Vermont, but stated that if he touched R.F. in the night, it was “accidental.” N.T. 3/27/2012 at 10-11.</p>

Avery claimed he had consumed too much alcohol to remember any details about that night, but admitted that it could be that something happened while he was intoxicated, and he did not remember.

Avery touching R.F. while wrestling, placing his hands inside R.F.’s shorts, massaging R.F.’s penis during the trip to Vermont, and did not mention that Rev.

Because supervision is routinely accomplished through others, the Commonwealth argues that the statute is broad enough to cover the conduct of individuals who may not personally encounter the children, such as school principals or day care managers, as long as the other elements of the EWOC statute are met. Under the facts presented, the Commonwealth argues that Appellee endangered the welfare of children, including D.G., by breaching his undisputed duty to prevent priests whom he knew to be a danger to children and who were under his supervision from sexually molesting them; in other words, his supervision of Rev.

Moreover, the requirement of supervision is not limited to only certain forms of supervision, such as direct or actual, as the Superior Court held. By its plain terms it encompasses all forms of supervision of a child’s welfare. Respectfully, the Superior Court disregarded this plain language when it attempted to modify it with the qualifiers of direct or actual supervision of children. Further, as the Commonwealth correctly argues, supervision is routinely accomplished through subordinates, and is no less supervisory if it does not involve personal encounters with the children. Like Appellee, school principals and managers of day care centers supervise the welfare of the children under their care through their management of others.

Avery be made associate pastor at a parish with a grade school. When Cardinal Bevilacqua rejected this recommendation, Appellee found a chaplaincy for him that included housing away from children, but, at Rev. Avery’s request, Appellee petitioned Cardinal Bevilacqua to allow Rev. Avery to live instead in the rectory of St. Jerome’s Church, a parish with a grade school and where D.G. was to become an altar boy.</p>

Although Father Graham was purportedly assigned to help monitor Rev. Avery, he did not understand himself to be Rev. Avery’s supervisor. Other priests in the rectory believed Rev. Avery was there because of overwork. Appellee did not warn parishioners of St. Jerome’s about Rev. Avery, and informed his former parishioners that his departure was for health reasons.</p>
