        "text": "Justice BAER.\nWe granted allowance of appeal to determine whether Section 319 of the Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cWCA\u201d), 77 P.S. \u00a7 671, confers on employers or their workers\u2019 compensation insurers a right to pursue a subrogation claim directly against a third-party tortfeasor when the compensated employee who was injured has taken no action against the tortfeasor. Based on established precedent, the Superior Court held that Section 319 does not permit employers/insurers to commence an action directly against the third-party tortfeasor, and affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of preliminary objections in favor of the tortfeasors. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm.\nThe record establishes that on December 13, 2009, George Lawrence (\u201cLawrence\u201d), while in the employment of Schneider National Inc. (\u201cSchneider\u201d), suffered a work-related injury when he slipped and fell in a parking lot leased by Domtar Paper Company, and allegedly owned and maintained by Commercial Net Lease Realty Services, Inc., Commercial Net Lease Realty Trust, Commercial Net Lease Realty, Inc., National Retail Properties, Inc., and National Retail Properties Trust (collectively \u201cAppellees\u201d). As a result of this injury, Schneider\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cLiberty Mutual\u201d), paid Lawrence $33,929.23 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\nDesignating itself the subrogee of Lawrence in the caption \u201cLiberty Mutual Insurance Company, As Subrogee of George Lawrence,\u201d Liberty Mutual filed a praecipe for writ of summons against Appellees on December 9, 2011, seeking to recover the amount it paid Lawrence in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Notably, Lawrence did not file suit or pursue settlement with Appellees; nor did he either assign his cause of action to Liberty Mutual or join in Liberty Mutual\u2019s suit against Appellees.\nIn its subsequent complaint, Liberty Mutual alleged that Lawrence\u2019s work-related injuries were caused by Appellees\u2019 negligent ownership and maintenance of the parking lot in which Lawrence slipped and fell. Liberty Mutual contended it was entitled to recover from Appellees by virtue of Section 319 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 671, which provides that where a compensable injury is caused by a third-party tortfeasor, the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employee against the third-party tortfeasor to the extent of compensation benefits paid under the WCA. Appel-lees filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to the complaint, contending that in the absence of an injured employee electing to file a suit in his own right, a workers\u2019 compensation carrier has no independent ability to bring a subrogation claim directly against a third-party tortfeasor.\nThe trial court granted Appellees\u2019 preliminary objections. Based on the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Reliance Insurance Company v. Richmond Machine Company, 309 Pa.Super. 430, 455 A.2d 686 (1983), the trial court explained that only the injured employee has the right of action against a third-party tortfeasor and not the employer/insurer. Emphasizing that the cause of action against the third-party tortfeasor exists for one indivisible wrong, the trial court held that the employer\u2019s/insurer\u2019s right of subrogation under Section 319 of the WCA must be achieved through an action brought in the name of or joined by the injured employee. Trial Court Opinion at 2 (citing Moltz v. Sherwood Bros., Inc., et al, 116 Pa.Super. 231, 176 A. 842, 843 (1935) (holding that the right of the employer/insurer to subrogation against a tortfeasor must be achieved through a single action brought in the name of the injured employee, either by joining the employer or insurance carrier as a party plaintiff or as a use plaintiff)); Scalise v. F.M. Venzie & Co., et al., 301 Pa. 315, 152 A. 90 (1930) (holding that Section 319\u2019s mandate that the employer is \u201csubrogated ... to the extent of compensation payable\u201d does not mean that the sole right to recover from the tortfeasor is in the employer; rather, the right of action against the tortfeasor remains in the injured employee and suit is to be commenced in his name).\nIn the case at bar, the trial court found that Lawrence had not sued Appellees, did not assign his cause of action against Appellees to Liberty Mutual, and was not joined or named in Liberty Mutual\u2019s suit. Instead, Liberty Mutual merely identified its status as subrogee of Lawrence in its independent action against Appellees. Accordingly, pursuant to the aforementioned cases, the trial court concluded that Liberty Mutual had no right to sue Appellees independently for Lawrence\u2019s alleged damages.\nLiberty Mutual filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court, asserting, inter alia, that Section 319 the WCA provided an absolute right to subrogation for benefits paid to Lawrence, and that it should not be denied that right because Lawrence declined to bring an action against Appellees. Apparently overlooking that the instant action was not brought in Lawrence\u2019s name, Liberty Mutual relied on language in Scalise, supra, where this Court stated that the employer \u201cis not to be denied his right of suit because the employee does not sue, but may institute the action in the latter\u2019s name.\u201d Scalise, 152 A. at 92.\nOn September 27, 2013, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order granting preliminary objections. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Domtar Paper Co., 77 A.3d 1282 (Pa.Super.2013). It rejected Liberty Mutual\u2019s contention that Section 319 of the WCA, along with the above-referenced language from Scalise, conferred upon it a right to pursue separately its subrogation claims against Appellees when Lawrence, as claimant, took no action of his own. The Superior Court deemed Liberty Mutual\u2019s reliance on Scalise to be misplaced because Scalise did not hold that Section 319 provides insurers the right to sue third-party tortfeasors independently. The court viewed the language stating that an employer \u201cis not to be denied his right of suit because the employee does not sue\u201d as ambiguous and inconsequential to the central holding of the case, wherein this Court affirmed the right of an injured employee to bring suit against a third-party tortfeasor, notwithstanding the subrogation rights conferred on the employer/insurer by Section 319 of the WCA. Liberty Mut., 77 A.3d at 1287 (quoting Scalise, 152 A. at 92).\nRelying on cases decided after Scalise, particularly Moltz and Reliance, the Superior Court explained that Pennsylvania courts strongly disfavor splitting causes of action between subrogors and subrogees and have held that such is not permissible in the context of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. See Moltz, 176 A. at 843; Reliance, 455 A.2d at 689-90. Accordingly, the Superior Court agreed with the trial court that an employer\u2019s right of subrogation conferred by Section 319 must be asserted through an action brought in the name of the injured employee either as a party plaintiff or use plaintiff. The Superior Court summarized its position as follows: \u201c[Sjection 319 does not provide employers with the ability to bring suit directly against a third-party,\u201d but instead \u201c[t]he action against the third party tortfeasor must be brought by the injured employee ... i.e. the employee-victim must sue, and the employer\u2019s carrier is subrogated to the employee\u2019s claim.\u201d Liberty Mut., 77 A.3d at 1288-89 (quoting Whirley Indus., Inc. v. Segel, 316 Pa.Super. 75, 462 A.2d 800, 802 (1983)) (emphasis in original).\nAs noted, we granted allocatur to address whether Section 319 of the WCA confers on employers or their workers\u2019 compensation insurers a right to pursue a subrogation claim directly against a third-party tortfeasor when the compensated employee who was injured has taken no action against the tortfeasor. This inquiry presents a pure question of law, over which our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. See Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus. v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, 611 Pa. 10, 23 A.3d 511, 514 (2011). Given that the underlying decision dismissed the case on preliminary objections, we further observe that \u201cthe standard of review for preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer is limited; the question presented by the demurrer is whether, on the facts averred, the law says with certainty that no recovery is possible.\u201d Bilt-Rite Contractors, Inc. v. The Architectural Studio, 581 Pa. 454, 866 A.2d 270, 274 (2005).\nLiberty Mutual argues that the unmistakable language of Section 319 of the WCA requires that the employer/insurer be subrogated to the rights of the injured employee, thereby affording it the right to sue the third-party tortfeasor directly. Otherwise, it contends, the plain meaning of \u201csubrogation\u201d is changed to signify only reimbursement. Such interpretation, Liberty Mutual submits, is contrary to this Court\u2019s description in Frazier v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Bayada Nurses, Inc.), 616 Pa. 592, 52 A.3d 241 (2012), that subrogation in the context of Section 319 means \u201c[stepping] into the shoes of the claimant to recover directly against a third-party tortfeasor.\u201d Id. at 248. It maintains that it was acting within this paradigm (i.e., in the shoes of Lawrence), when it filed the suit as subrogee, and did not seek to file an \u201cindependent\u201d action against Appellees beyond its subrogation interest.\nFailing to discern any distinction between commencing an action as a subrogee of an injured employee and naming or joining the injured employee in the action, Liberty Mutual reiterates the argument rejected below that this Court in Scalise sanctioned employer\u2019s/insurer\u2019s direct suits against third-party tortfeasors by stating that \u201c[t]he employer is not to be denied his right of suit because the employee does not sue, but may institute the action in the latter\u2019s name.\u201d Id. at 92.\nAdditionally, Liberty Mutual posits, the Superior Court erred by interpreting that court\u2019s decision in Reliance as precluding an employer/insurer from commencing an action directly against a third-party tortfeasor when the injured employee has not filed suit. To the contrary, it asserts, Reliance only stands for the proposition that an employer/insurer, subrogated to the rights of the employee, cannot commence an action against a third-party tortfeasor when the applicable statute of limitations has expired on the employee\u2019s underlying claim. Thus, in Liberty Mutual\u2019s view, Reliance is not germane to the question presented herein.\nLiberty Mutual further maintains that the Superior Court\u2019s decision frustrates two of the three purposes behind Section 319 of the WCA, namely, to ensure that an employer does not pay for the negligence of a third-party tortfeasor, and to prevent a third-party tortfeasor from escaping liability for his wrongful act. See Gillette v. Wurst, 594 Pa. 544, 987 A.2d 430, 436 (2007). It observes that the Superior Court\u2019s ruling allows Appellees to escape liability for their negligence, and forces Liberty Mutual to compensate Lawrence for his losses in direct contravention of the stated purposes of Section 319.\nAppellees respond that the Superior Court interpreted the relevant appellate case law correctly when it held that Section 319 does not permit employers/insurers to sue a third-party tortfeasor directly where the injured employee declined to sue in his own right or has not otherwise recovered from the tortfeasor. They contend that the Superior Court\u2019s decision is consistent with Scalise, citing this Court\u2019s observation that \u201c[t]he right of action remains in the injured employee.\u201d Scalise, 152 A. at 92. Moreover, Appellees argue that the language in Scalise suggesting that an \u201cemployer ... is not to be denied his right of suit because the employee does not sue,\u201d which this Court later quoted in Frazier, is dictum in both cases. They point out that, unlike the instant case, the claimants in Scalise and Frazier filed an action against the tortfeasor, and the issue was not whether the employer/insurer could sue the tortfeasor independently. Appellee\u2019s con-elude that the dictum in Scalise and Frazier does not justify the dramatic expansion of an employer\u2019s subrogation rights conferred by Section 819.\nAppellees further contend that the Superior Court\u2019s decision is consistent with jjost-Scalise Superior Court case law clarifying that an employer seeking subrogation must first show that the injured employee has made recovery against a third party by way of verdict, award, or settlement. In particular, Appel-lees cite the Superior Court\u2019s subsequent decision in Moltz, which held that the \u201cright of action [in the context of workers\u2019 compensation subrogation] is for one indivisible wrong\u201d which \u201cabides in the insured,\u201d and, accordingly, \u201c[t]he employer\u2019s right of subrogation must be worked out through an action brought in the name of the injured employee, either by joining the employer as a party plaintiff ... or as a use plaintiff.\u201d Moltz, 176 A. at 843.\nNext, as did the courts below, Appellees rely on Reliance, where the Superior Court held that for an employer/insurer to enforce its subrogation rights, it must proceed in an action brought on behalf of the injured employee within the statute of limitations applicable to his claim, and may only recover by way of verdict, award, or settlement to the injured employee. Reliance, 455 A.2d at 690. To further support their position, Appellees cite language from Whirley, where the Superior Court, elaborating on its holding in Reliance, stated: \u201c[t]he action against a third-party tortfeasor must be brought by the injured employee ... i.e. the employee-victim must sue, and the employer\u2019s carrier is subrogated to the employee\u2019s claim.\u201d Whirley, 462 A.2d at 802.\nAppellees contend that Liberty Mutual has failed to cite a single Pennsylvania appellate decision, which permits an employer or its compensation insurer to proceed directly against a third-party tortfeasor when the injured employee who received workers\u2019 compensation benefits did not first sue in his own right. Appellees observe that in Scalise and Frazier, the employer/compensation insurer did not pursue subrogation under Section 319 until after the injured employee either filed suit or reached a settlement with the alleged tortfeasor.\nAppellees also argue that Section 303(b) of the WCA, codified at 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(b) and entitled \u201cExclusiveness of remedy; actions by and against a third-party ... \u201d, lends support to their argument that employers/insurers are precluded from pursuing subrogation under Section 319 when the injured employee chooses not to seek recovery from the third-party tortfeasor. Section 303(b) reads in relevant part:\nIn the event injury or death to an employee is caused by a third party, then such employe[e], his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin and anyone otherwise entitled to receive damages by reason thereof, may bring their action at law against such third party....\n77 P.S. \u00a7 481(b). Appellees contend that Section 303(b) clearly places the right to bring a third-party suit in the injured employee and not the employer/insurer. If the legislature had intended to grant employers/insurers the right to sue the third-party tortfeasor directly when the injured employee refused to do so, Appellees assert that it would have specifically provided for that right under Section 303(b).\nFinally, Appellees observe that, in contrast to Pennsylvania\u2019s WCA, various workers\u2019 compensation statutes from other states delineate a right for employers/insurers to sue the third-party tortfeasor directly when the injured employee has not filed suit. See N.Y. Workers\u2019 Comp. Law \u00a7 29 (McKinney); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 34:15-40; 19 Del.Code Ann. \u00a7 2363; Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 418.827. Appellees note that these workers\u2019 compensation statutes protect the interests of injured employees by requiring the employer/insurer to wait a specified period of time from the date the statute of limitations begins to run before asserting its subrogation rights, and by further requiring the employer/insurer to give the injured employee notice before it commences a suit against the third-party tortfeasor. Appellees argue that in the absence of a statutory scheme similar to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Michigan, the rights of injured employees will be harmed if an employer/insurer is permitted to proceed directly against a third-party tortfeasor without the consent or cooperation of the injured employee. Accordingly, Appellees would have this Court affirm the Superior Court\u2019s holding and leave workers\u2019 compensation reform to the General Assembly.\nWe begin our analysis, as we must, with the language of Section 319, which states that when an employee is injured by the tortious conduct of a third party, the employer who has issued compensation benefits \u201cshall be subrogated to the right of the employe[e] ... against such third-party.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 761. In construing this provision, we are guided by case law interpreting Section 319. Because the parties are focused on our 1930 decision in Scalise, we examine that case first.\nIn Scalise, a claimant\u2019s widow collected workers\u2019 compensation death benefits, and later commenced a negligence action against the third-party tortfeasor. The third-party tortfeasor demurred, raising the inverse of the argument raised by the tortfeasors herein, ie., that because Section 319 subrogates the employer to the extent of compensation payable, only the employer has the right to sue the tortfeasor in subrogation, leaving the injured employee no cause of action against the tortfeasor.\nThis Court rejected the tortfeasor\u2019s contention, holding that \u201c[t]he right of action remains in the injured employee; suit is to be brought in his name.... \u201d Scalise, 152 A. at 92. The Court further commented that to recover monies to which it is subrogated by Section 319, \u201cthe employer may appear as an additional party plaintiff; ... or, as use-plaintiff, [or] may intervene for the purpose of [its] protection.\u201d Id. The Court went on to say, as relied upon by Liberty Mutual, that \u201c[t]he employer is not to be denied his right of suit because the employee does not sue, but may institute the action in the latter\u2019s name.\u201d Id.\nThis language in Scalise was recently cited by the Court in Frazier, supra. In Frazier, an employer filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim petition against an employee who had sustained a work injury, collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and obtained a judgment against the third-party tortfea-sor, namely the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA). In its claim petition, the employer sought to recover from the employee its subrogation interest in the judgment that the injured employee obtained from SEPTA. While the Court ultimately held the employer\u2019s claim for reimbursement of compensation benefits was barred by sovereign immunity, we stated, in dicta, that the employer\u2019s right to subrogation permits it to \u201cstep into the shoes of the claimant to recover directly against a third-party.\u201d Id., 52 A.3d at 248. We further reiterated the following language employed in Scalise:\n[Njormally in subrogation, the right of action lies in the injured employee, and the action for subrogation against the third-party tortfeasor is brought in the employee\u2019s name. Nonetheless, an \u201cemployer ... is not to be denied his right of suit [in subrogation] because the employee does not sue [the third-party tortfeasor], but may institute the action in the latter\u2019s name.\u201d\nFrazier, at 248 n. 10 (quoting Scalise, 152 A. at 92) (alterations in original).\nContrary to Liberty Mutual\u2019s contentions, however, this jurisprudence does not establish that Section 319 confers on an employer/insurer the statutory right to bring suit directly against a third-party tortfeasor to recover workers\u2019 compensation paid where the injured employee has not sought recovery from the tortfeasor. It is critical to note that in both Scalise and Frazier the injured employee (or his widow) filed suit against the third-party tortfeasor. Thus, the Court was not faced with the present issue of whether the employer/insurer can sue the tortfeasor directly when the injured employee has not. Rather, our decisions in Scalise and Frazier reaffirm that the right to sue a third-party tortfeasor lies in the injured employee and suggest, in dicta, that the employer/insurer could seek to enforce its subrogation right by filing an action against the tortfeasor in the name of the injured employee. Even if this language is an accurate statement of the law, in this case, Liberty Mutual did not file the action against Appellees in the name of Lawrence, as required, but rather sued Appellees in its own right, simply noting its status as a subrogee.\nAs noted cogently by Appellees, it is the Superior Court\u2019s decisions, rather than this Court\u2019s pronouncements in Scalise or Frazier, that have spoken to the issue raised herein, and have consistently held that an employer/insurer has no independent right to sue a tortfeasor in the absence of the injured employee. An early case that involved a similar issue is the 1935 Superior Court decision in Moltz, supra. There, an employee was injured in a car accident during the course of his employment due to a third-party tortfeasor\u2019s negligence and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. The employee thereafter sued the tortfeasor, recovering a substantial judgment. The insurance carrier was not named in the injured employee\u2019s suit against the tortfeasor, although it did provide the tortfeasor with notice of its subrogation interests.\nBecause the insurance carrier was never reimbursed for the amount of compensation it paid to the injured employee, it filed an action directly against the tortfeasor in an effort to enforce its rights as subrogee. The trial court found in favor of the insurance carrier, and the Superior Court reversed on the ground that the insurance carrier had no independent right to sue the tortfeasor. It held that only one action could be brought against a third-party tortfeasor for damages arising from the tort, and that the employer\u2019s right of subrogation \u201cmust be worked out through an action brought in the name of the injured employee, either by joining the employer as a party plaintiff or as a use plaintiff.\u201d Moltz, 176 A. at 843 (internal citations omitted). The court emphasized that the tortfeasor\u2019s wrongful act is single and indivisible and can only give rise to one liability. Id. Finally, the Superior Court noted that the mere giving of notice to the tortfeasor did not relieve the employer or insurance carrier from acting with reasonable diligence to protect its claim, nor did the notice allow for a second cause of action for which the injured employee had already recovered a judgment. Id.\nIn 1983, the Superior Court expressed the same sentiment in Reliance, supra. In that case, an employee collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits after he was injured during the course of his employment due to defective machine parts that were manufactured and supplied negligently by the alleged third-party tortfeasors. The injured employee did not take action against the tortfeasor in his own right. More than two years after both the injury and the payment of benefits, the workers\u2019 compensation insurer sued the tortfeasors. The insurer contended that the tortfeasor\u2019s negligence caused the employee\u2019s injuries, and, therefore, sought indemnification/contribution for the benefits it paid to the employee.\nThe tortfeasor filed preliminary objections, which the trial court sustained in part. Significantly, the trial court certified for interlocutory appeal the issues of whether Section 319 of the WCA is the exclusive means by which an employer/insurer may recover the amount paid in workers\u2019 compensation benefits; whether the employer/insurer has a common law right of action for indemnity/contribution against the third-party tort-feasor; and, whether the two-year statute of limitations on personal injury actions applies to an employer\u2019s/insurer\u2019s action for contribution or indemnity.\nThe Superior Court held that the statutory remedy in Section 319 of the WCA provided the exclusive means for an employer or its insurer to recover amounts it paid in workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an injured employee, and that there was no common law right of action for indemnity/contribution against the third-party tortfeasor. Reliance, 455 A.2d at 688, 690. Citing Scalise and Moltz, the court explained that the injured employee holds the right of action against the tortfea-sor, and that the legislature, in enacting Section 319, has seen fit to permit an employer or insurer to recover in subrogation when a third party\u2019s negligence has resulted in the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and where the injured employee has recovered compensation from the third party. Id. at 689. The court emphasized the indivisibility of the cause of action against the tortfeasor, and that the employer\u2019s/insurer\u2019s right to subrogation must be achieved \u201cthrough an action brought in the name of the injured employee, either by joining the employer as a party plaintiff ..., or as a use plaintiff....\u201d Reliance, at 689 (quoting Moltz, 176 A. at 843) (citations omitted).\nApplying such law to the facts presented, the Reliance court held that the employer/insurer did not establish that the party from whom it sought reimbursement (ie., the tortfeasors) was, in fact, liable for the injured employee\u2019s injury. Id. at 690. It stated that \u201c[o]ur appellate courts have not hitherto construed [SJection 319 as providing the employer or its insurer with a cause of action against a third party in its own right.\u201d Id. The court found no reason to interpret Section 319 any differently where the liability of the alleged third-party tortfeasor has not been determined, and where the statute of limitations for personal injury actions, which applied to the employee\u2019s cause of action against the tortfeasor, has barred the action. Id.\nFinally, in Whirley, supra, the Superior Court again confirmed that any action against a third-party tortfeasor must be brought by the injured employee as the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier has no independent cause of action against the tortfeasor under Section 319. There, an employee was injured by a tortfeasor and received both workers\u2019 compensation benefits and full satisfaction of all claims against the tortfeasor. As a result of the workers\u2019 compensation paid to employee, the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier increased the premiums charged to the employer by $22,451. Employer subsequently filed an action in trespass directly against the tortfeasor, not to recover the amount paid to the injured employee in workers\u2019 compensation benefits, but rather to recover the amount of increase in insurance premiums that it contended was attributable to the tortfeasor\u2019s negligence in causing the employee\u2019s injuries. The trial court sustained the tortfeasor\u2019s demurrer, and the Superior Court affirmed.\nRelevant herein, the Superior Court acknowledged that \u201c[t]he action against the third party tortfeasor must be brought by the injured employee.\u201d Id. at 802. Based upon the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Reliance, the court pointed out that an employer\u2019s insurance carrier had no independent cause of action for indemnification/contribution from the negligent party who caused the insurance carrier to pay the injured employee benefits. Id. It echoed that the subrogation rights afforded by Section 319 are the exclusive remedy against third-party tortfeasors and that the injured employee must sue the tortfeasor and then the employer\u2019s insurer is subrogat-ed to the employee\u2019s claim.\nLiberty Mutual offers no persuasive reason why this Court should stray from the Superior Court\u2019s precedent in Moltz, Reliance, and Whirley, which is consistent with this Court\u2019s ruling in Scalise that the right of action against the tortfeasor is indivisible and remains in the employee who suffered the entire loss in the first instance. We emphasize that in Pennsylvania, courts disfavor splitting causes of action, and have frequently remained true to this maxim in the context of workers\u2019 compensation subrogation. See City of Philadelphia v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., 337 Pa. 1, 10 A.2d 434, 435 (1940) (citing the rule against splitting causes of action, this Court held that the city of Philadelphia, as a partially subro-gated employer, could not enforce its subrogation rights against a third-party tortfeasor in a separate suit when the injured employees already instituted trespass actions against the third-party tortfeasor and recovered favorable verdicts); Spinelli v. Maxwell, 430 Pa. 478, 243 A.2d 425, 427-28 (1968) (again citing the rule against splitting causes of action, this Court held that a subrogor-employee, who executed a subro-gation receipt authorizing his subrogee-employer to pursue recovery from a third-party tortfeasor on his behalf, was precluded from instituting a later trespass action against the third-party tortfeasor for personal injuries suffered in the same accident). Preventing the employer/insurer from asserting an independent cause of action against the tortfeasor eliminates the possibility that the third-party tortfeasor could be exposed to multiple suits filed by both the employer and the injured employee, and will preserve the preferred rights of the injured employee who retains a beneficial interest in the cause of action against the tortfeasor.\nAccordingly, we reaffirm that the right of action against a third-party tortfeasor under Section 319 of the WCA remains in the injured employee, and that the employer/insurer\u2019s right of subrogation under Section 319 must be achieved through a single action brought in the name of the injured employee or joined by the injured employee. Because Lawrence did not commence an action against Appellees, was not named in the action filed by Liberty Mutual, and did not join the action filed by Liberty Mutual, the Superior Court properly affirmed the grant of Appellees\u2019 preliminary objections.\nAccordingly, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nFormer Chief Justice CASTILLE and former Justice McCAFFERY did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustices EAKIN and STEVENS join the opinion.\nChief Justice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\nJustice TODD files a dissenting opinion.\n. Section 319 states, in its entirety, as follows:\nWhere the compensable injury is caused in whole or in part by the act or omission of a third-party, the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employe[e], his personal representative, his estate or his dependents, against such third-party to the extent of the compensation payable under this article by the employer; reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other proper disbursements incurred in obtaining a recovery or in effecting a compromise settlement shall be prorated between the employer and employefe], his personal representative, his estate or his dependents. The employer shall pay that proportion of the attorney\u2019s fees and other proper disbursements that the amount of compensation paid or payable at the time of recovery or settlement bears to the total recovery or settlement. Any recovery against such third person in excess of the compensation theretofore paid by the employer shall be paid forthwith to the employefe], his personal representative, his estate or his dependents, and shall be treated as an advance payment by the employer on account of any future instal-ments of compensation.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 671.\n. Only National Retail Properties, Inc. and National Retail Properties Trust defended the claims filed by Liberty Mutual. For the remainder of this discussion, all references to Appellees will pertain to these two parties and the arguments they present.\n. In addition to preventing third parties from escaping liability for their negligence and ensuring that the employer, presumably innocent of negligence, in the end pays nothing, Section 319 further serves the purpose of preventing the claimant-employee from obtaining double recovery for the same injury. Gillette, 937 A.2d at 436; Dale Mfg. Co. v. Bressi, 491 Pa. 493, 421 A.2d 653, 654 (1980). There is no double recovery here as Lawrence never sought recovery from Appellees.\n. The Pennsylvania Association for Justice filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of Appellees, echoing many of the same arguments raised by Appellees.\n. The court noted that at the time of the appeal, case law interpreting provisions of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle No Fault Act, 40 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1009.101 et seq., excluded employers of victims of motor vehicle accidents from subrogation rights afforded by Section 319 of the WCA. Whirley, 462 A.2d at 802-03.\n. The Superior Court went on to hold that the tortfeasor's demurrer was correctly sustained because an increase in an employer's premiums following an automobile accident was not reasonably foreseeable by a driver; the premium increases resulted from a concurrence of circumstances; and the economic harm was too remote from the cause in fact to be attributable to the driver. Id. at 804.\n. Alternatively, Liberty Mutual argues that the rules of civil procedure should be liberally construed so as to treat the caption listing itself as the subrogee of Lawrence as the functional equivalent of \"George Lawrence For the Use of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.\u201d See Pa.RX.P. 126 (stating the rules of civil procedure \"shall be liberally construed,\u201d and that the court at any point \"may disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties\u201d). It maintains that there is no substantive difference between a case captioned \u201cfor the use of\u201d and one captioned \"as subrogee of\u201d and any technical defect in its pleading should not preclude it from proceeding in its action against Appellees.\nThe National Association of Subrogation Professionals (\"NASP\u201d) filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of Liberty Mutual, wherein it asserts that confusion has developed regarding the proper manner to bring a \u201cfor use\u201d proceeding in Pennsylvania within the context of workers' compensation subrogation claims. Acknowledging that use-practice is a style of action employed infrequently in Pennsylvania, NASP requests that this Court enter a specific finding regarding the most appropriate language to be employed in the caption of a subrogation action brought by the employer on behalf of and in the name of the injured employee. The Pennsylvania Self-Insured Association also filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of Liberty Mutual, raising similar arguments.\nWe decline amici\u2019s invitation to clarify the appropriate practice method for pursuing a \"use\u201d action as such question is outside the confines of this appeal. The factual predicate of the case before us did not involve \"for use\u201d language and the grant of allocatur does not encompass such issue. Moreover, through this opinion, we do not address or alter any prior practice regarding an employer/insurer suing the third-party tortfeasor through the device of a \"use plaintiff\u201d or joining the injured employee in its action against the tortfeasor.",

        "text": "Chief Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nI would find that the caption as stated effectively makes the injured employee the use plaintiff. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\nThe majority notes that a workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier has no right to bring suit against a third-party tortfea-sor in its own name primarily because actions arising from tortious conduct are unitary and may not be divided. See Majority Opinion, at 478-80, 113 A.3d at 1239-40. To my mind, these observations are not particularly controversial, having been established in this jurisdiction for many years. See, e.g., Spinelli v. Maxwell, 430 Pa. 478, 481, 243 A.2d 425, 427 (1968) (reaffirming the single-cause-of-action rule for injuries arising from one tort); Scalise v. F.M. Venzie & Co., 301 Pa. 315, 320, 152 A. 90, 92 (1930) (observing, in a workers\u2019 compensation setting, that any civil action against the tortfea-sor remains invested in the injured employee, albeit the employer may bring an action in the employee\u2019s name if the employee opts not to sue). Therefore, it seems to me that the more significant question for purposes of this appeal is whether the common pleas court properly dismissed the complaint in view of the specific wording of the caption.\nIn the complaint, the plaintiff was captioned as, \u201cLiberty Mutual Insurance Company, as subrogee of George Lawrence, Plaintiff.\u201d Notably, use of the phrase, \u201cas subrogee of,\u201d is a particularized means of bringing suit in the name of the use plaintiff. As such, there was little danger that the cause of action might be divided since any subsequent action brought directly by Mr. Lawrence would have been barred under the doctrine of res judicata. Thus, by denominating itself as the subrogee of the injured party, Liberty Mutual filed a complaint of the type endorsed by this Court in Scalise. Indeed, Liberty Mutual made this very argument in opposing Domtar Paper\u2019s preliminary objection. See Plaintiffs Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Preliminary Objections to Plaintiffs Complaint at 4; see also Brief for Appellant at 28 (renewing the argument). In my view, the common pleas court should have credited the argument and overruled Dom-tar Paper\u2019s preliminary objection.\nEven insofar as one might argue that this Court\u2019s decisional law only specifically endorses phraseology along the lines of \u201cfor the use of,\u201d \u201cto use of,\u201d or \u201cin the name of,\u201d common pleas courts may, in the interests of justice, disregard formal defects that do not affect the parties\u2019 substantial rights. See Pa.R.C.P. 126. Presumably, then, the court could have \u2014 and in my view should have \u2014 permitted Liberty Mutual to amend the caption\u2019s wording accordingly so that it would not lose its subrogation rights, which this Court has described as \u201cabsolute.\u201d Winfree v. Phila. Elec. Co., 520 Pa. 892, 394, 554 A.2d 485, 485 (1989); see also Scalise, 301 Pa. at 320, 152 A. at 92 (\u201cThe employer ... is not to be denied his right of suit because the employee does not sue, but may institute the action in the latter\u2019s name.\u201d).\nAlthough the majority acknowledges this possibility, it elects to bypass the argument primarily on the grounds that the allocatur grant does not encompass it. See Majority Opinion, at 480-81 n. 7, 113 A.3d at 1240-41 n. 7. I note, however, that the question framed for review is very broad: \u201cDoes Section 319 of the Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 671, allow the employer/insurer to step into the shoes of the insured employee to subrogate against the tortfeasor?\u201d Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Domtar Paper Co., 625 Pa. 521, 92 A.3d 809 (2014) (per curiam). In fact, subrogation by its very nature involves stepping into another party\u2019s shoes. See, e.g., Frazier v. WCAB (Bayada Nurses, Inc.), 616 Pa. 592, 603, 52 A.3d 241, 248 (2012) (\u201cIn subrogation, the insurer stands in the shoes of the insured in attempting to recover what is rightfully owed to it from a third-party tortfeasor.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Black\u2019s law Dictionary 1654 (10th ed.2014). Therefore, it is not apparent why reaffirming the established precept that an employer or insurer may only bring an action against a third-party tortfeasor in the name of the injured party falls within the question\u2019s scope, but the dispositive issue concerning the proper manner of captioning a complaint brought in the subrogor\u2019s name falls outside of it. Since the majority does not address the merits of the dispositive issue, Liberty Mutual is effectively put out of court as by now the two-year limitations period has expired.\nAccordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n. Some jurisdictions express this principle by observing that a subrogee insurance company is in privity with its subrogor. See, e.g., Geico Ins. Co. v. Graham, 14 N.E.3d 854, 861 (Ind.Ct.App.2014) (\"A subrogee is in privity with its subrogor under the res judicata doctrine.\u201d (quoting Ohio Dep\u2019t of Human Servs. v. Kozar, 99 Ohio App.3d 713, 651 N.E.2d 1039, 1041 (1995))); Travelers Ins. Co. v. Royal Ins. Co., 65 Mass.App.Ct. 1115, 841 N.E.2d 287, 2006 WL 223854, *2 (2006) (\"The privity of the relevant parties here to the original action is undisputed: as subrogee of Peabody, the plaintiff stands in the shoes of the subrogor in whose name the original action was brought.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).\n. To the degree Mr. Lawrence\u2019s rights might be compromised by Liberty Mutual\u2019s action \u2014 since Liberty Mutual was only subrogated to the amount it paid Mr. Lawrence \u2014 the court could have required his joinder as an additional plaintiff.\n. The precept that a party initiating an action in the common pleas court should not be placed out of court due to a non-fatal defect in the filing was delineated in this Court's recent decision in Burke ex rel. Burke v. Independence Blue Cross, 628 Pa. 147, 103 A.3d 1267 (2014). See id. at 160-62 & n. 9, 103 A.3d at 1275-76 & n. 9. Although Burke involved an improvident appeal from a quasi-governmental agency, the same principle logically applies to a complaint filed in the common pleas court\u2019s original jurisdiction and is consistent with the focus of Rule 126.\nIt may also be noted that, in Burke, as here, the issue accepted for review centered on the statute in question and did not expressly inquire into the proper judicial response to a pleading defect. See Burke ex rel. Burke v. Independence Blue Cross, 620 Pa. 598, 71 A.3d 249 (2013) (per curiam) (reciting the issue as: \u201cDid the Pennsylvania General Assembly intend to deprive families of children with autism of the right to appeal insurance denials to court!,] while granting that right to insurance companies?\u201d). Thus, Burke is analogous to this matter and I am unable to discern a persuasive reason why Liberty Mutual should be treated differently than the plaintiff in Burke.",

        "text": "Justice TODD,\ndissenting.\nI agree with the majority, to the extent it preserves the right of an employer or its insurance company, as subrogee of an injured employee, to bring suit in the name of the injured employee in the capacity of a \u201cuse-plaintiff.\u201d As we recognized in Scalise v. F.M. Venzie, 301 Pa. 315, 152 A. 90 (1930), this procedure affords the employer/insurer a means to vindicate its right to recovery of payments made because of injuries caused by a third-party tortfeasor in situations where the injured employee elects not to bring suit in his or her own capacity. See also 7 West\u2019s Pa. Prac., Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 12:13 (3d. ed.) (endorsing \u201cuse practice\u201d as a means by which the employer/insurer may assert its subrogation right by bringing an action \u201con behalf of the injured employee.\u201d). However, ultimately, I find myself in agreement with the view expressed by Chief Justice Saylor in his Dissenting Opinion that the manner in which Liberty Mutual captioned the instant proceeding, \u201cas subrogee of George Lawrence,\u201d is not fatal to its claim, as it is the functional equivalent of bringing this proceeding in the capacity of a \u201cuse-plaintiff.\u201d\nThe effect of Liberty Mutual instituting suit \u201cas subrogee of George Lawrence\u201d was to indicate that it was \u201cstanding in the shoes\u201d of Lawrence, and, thus, was asserting Lawrence\u2019s rights in the suit, and not suing in its own capacity. See, e.g., Johnson v. Beane, 541 Pa. 449, 664 A.2d 96, 100 (1995) (\u201cThe equitable doctrine of subrogation places the subrogee in the precise position of the one to whose rights he is subrogated.\u201d). Consequently, for the reasons expressed by Chief Justice Saylor, I view Liberty Mutual\u2019s complaint, although not expressly styled as such, to be of the type which our Court sanctioned in Scalise, and I deem Liberty Mutual\u2019s status in this litigation to be that of a \u201cuse-plaintiff,\u201d because it is asserting the legal claims of an injured individual in a civil action, as if it were that person. Cf; Grubnau v. Centennial Nat. Bank, 279 Pa. 501, 124 A. 142 (1924) (use-plaintiffs right to maintain an action is wholly dependent on the right of the actual injured plaintiff to maintain such a suit).\nI raise an additional point, however, which I believe bears emphasis. In my view, it is critical that the actual plaintiff\u2014 here, the injured employee \u2014 be served with a copy of the subrogee\u2019s complaint so that the employee may, if he or she desires, retain counsel and actively participate in the action. Such service ensures the injured employee may actively prosecute all claims he or she may possess, and not leave the conduct of the litigation solely in the hands of the subrogee.\nIndeed, I deem this requirement to be particularly important in cases such as this, inasmuch as a workers\u2019 compensation subrogee is precluded by 77 P.S. \u00a7 319 from recovering any damages in excess of what it paid to the injured employee in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Consequently, the subro-gee has no incentive to pursue claims for additional damages which the injured employee might ordinarily seek in his or her own capacity. Giving an injured employee notice of a subro-gee\u2019s suit is essential, as it allows the injured employee to actively participate in and direct the scope and course of discovery, trial preparation, or the conduct of settlement negotiations in the proceeding where the final fate of his or her claims is irrevocably decided. To be sure, as Chief Justice Saylor notes, were Liberty Mutual\u2019s instant action to be litigated to final judgment, any subsequent action brought by Lawrence would be barred under the doctrine of res judicata. Dissenting Opinion (Saylor, C.J.), at 481-82, 113 A.3d at 1241-42.\nChief Justice Saylor observes that, to avoid harm to the ability of Lawrence to be fully and fairly compensated, the trial court could have required that he be joined as a party. Id. at 482 n. 2, 113 A.3d at 1242 n. 2 (\u201cTo the degree Mr. Lawrence\u2019s rights might be compromised by Liberty Mutual\u2019s action \u2014 since Liberty Mutual was only subrogated to the amount it paid Mr. Lawrence \u2014 the court could have required his joinder as an additional plaintiff.\u201d (emphasis added)); see also Pa.R.Civ.P. 2232 (providing that \u201cat any stage of an action, the court may order the joinder of any additional person who could have joined or who could have been joined in the action and may stay all proceedings until such person has been joined\u201d (emphasis added)). However, in my view, such a wholly discretionary process is insufficiently protective of the important fundamental rights of the injured employee at stake in these situations. It seems to me the better practice, then, is to require the subrogee to provide notice to the injured employee upon commencement of its action as use-plaintiff. Requiring such notice would also be consistent with the principle reaffirmed by the majority that there should be no splitting of an injured employee\u2019s cause of action against a third-party tortfeasor, in order to ensure that the injured employee may still prosecute all causes of action in the manner he or she sees fit, even if the subrogee commences suit first.\nDue to the fact that these types of \u201cfor use\u201d suits by a subrogee remain viable, as confirmed by our decision in the instant matter, and because, as amici, the National Association of Subrogation Professionals and the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, have highlighted, there is a dearth of guidance in the caselaw and under our Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the proper captioning of these suits, I would refer this question to the Supreme Court\u2019s Civil Procedural Rules Committee for study and recommendations. Additionally, I would direct the Committee to address suitable service requirements when these types of actions are commenced by a subrogee, in order to ensure that the subrogor, whose claim the subrogee is litigating, receives adequate notice and the opportunity to participate in the action.\nIn sum, because I agree with Chief Justice Saylor that the manner in which Liberty Mutual captioned its complaint is not fatal to the claim, I dissent.\n. In the present action, although there is no indication in the record that Liberty Mutual, as subrogee, served Lawrence with a copy of the complaint, any issue regarding this lack of service was not raised in the lower courts, and, thus, is not preserved for our review in the present appeal.",
