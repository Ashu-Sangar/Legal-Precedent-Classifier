The issue, as stated by petitioner, is:\nWhether the Commonwealth Court erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of the school district and denying summary judgment in favor of the furloughed teachers with respect to the teachers claim under subsection (b.l) of the Transfer of Entities Act, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1113 et seq., where the Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that the furloughed teachers had no future reemployment rights under the Act effectively renders subsection (b.l), added through legislative amendment in 1991, to be meaningless and inconsistent with the School Code read in pari materia[?]",
