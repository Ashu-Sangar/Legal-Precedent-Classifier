    <p class="summary" id="b174-12" data-blocks='[["BL_174.11",174,[299,940,1153,1005]]]'>The interest of the insured which was covered by the policy was that of owner in fee of the propérty. As the grantee received no title or interest of any value, the basis of his loss is the true value of the property insured: Foehrenbach v. Title &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/pa/217/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="217 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="953668" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0331-01">217 Pa. 331</a>. The plaintiff, however, can recover nothing beyond the face of his policy, and his damages are confined to the actual loss sustained. If he paid $34,000 for the property and the farm had no value beyond the amount so paid, his loss is represented by the consideration paid. Only one-third of the consideration was paid and the balance is represented by a mortgage given by Mr. Henry. Plaintiff claims as part of his loss, this one-third of the consideration which he paid in cash. He had the use of the farm, and we do not see how he can claim as part of his loss, the taxes and interest on his investment, unless he furnishes us with an account of the income of the farm. If the income exceeded the sum paid out for taxes, interest and expenditures, he sustained no loss on this branch of his claim. We cannot assume that the use of the farm has no value.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b174-13" data-blocks='[["BL_174.12",174,[300,1963,1148,419]],["BL_175.2",175,[175,350,1153,315]]]'>The claim for damages for the excess of the market value of the farm over the price paid, is disputed not because the item is not a proper element of damages, but because no such excess in fact it is averred can be shown. The averments of the affidavit of defense are not as specific upon this point as they should be, but an allegation that the sum of $1,050 per acre is a full price for the farm is in effect an averment that such price is its market value. When we say that an owner received a <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>full price for his property, we mean ordinarily that he sold it at its fair market value. When an affidavit of defense discloses facts sufficient to indicate a good defense we are not in the habit of entering judgment without an opportunity to file a supplemental affidavit. This question of market value is eminently one for the jury and not for the court.</p>

The decree being interlocutory, no injury can result to the complaining suitor other than delay of final judgment. Besides, it is doubtful, whether the act of assembly authorizing these appeals has not, on the whole, aggravated delay.”</p>

In such cases it is useless to insist on a reversal.”</p>
