This duty of the employer is a direct personal and absolute obligation resting upon him from which nothing relieves but performance. It cannot be delegated by the superior to an inferior, however he may be designated, so that the latter’s omission to give the warning becomes the act of a fellow servant, for which the superior would not be responsible; but the employer, of course, is not liable on this principle unless he or an authorized inferior puts the employee upon the dangerous job.</p>

In that case, if you find that authority, he would be in that respect what the law designates a vice principal. If, however, you do not find this fact of McGraw’s authority, you must conclude that in giving the direction he acted not as a vice principal representing the defendant and making the defendant responsible, but as a <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>fellow servant for whose failure to warn or instruct the defendant would certainly not be responsible.”</p>

This was due to certain statements appearing in the printed argument of counsel for appellant, said to be supported by the testimony in the case, and by this we understood that the supporting testimony was undisputed. The averments of counsel for appellant, said to be supported by the testimony in the case, are that Sturtz proceeded to the upper wheel and by climbing over the belt line and crawling on his stomach succeeded in getting the most of his body within the box <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>incasing the upper wheel; that the upper belt wheel was in-cased, fenced in and closed up in a box, and to reach it it was necessary for the plaintiff to leave his place of employment, walk a distance of fifty feet, crawl over the belt line, then crawl on a beam and, lying flat, reach his arm into the box where the wheel was located, and, in the small space of a few inches, attempt to apply grease by the paddle or sheet iron; and that it was only with the greatest difficulty that he was able to crawl into the place where the injury happened. On the ease as presented to the jury upon the testimony of the injured appellee and his witnesses, the situation was by no means that appearing in the foregoing statements of counsel for appellant. The belief of the jury, fully justified by the testimony — the recital of which will serve no useful purpose — was that a few minutes before the young man was injured the belt was sticking on the wheel; that his boss, McGraw, authorized to direct him, ordered him to grease it; that he understood McGraw to mean that the upper belt wheel should be greased; that instead of crawling on his stomach to the point where he greased the wheel, he proceeded up a walk alongside of the belt for a distance of twenty-five or thirty feet, got on a log and from it, at a point about two feet away from the wheel, greased the same; that the place where he was working and the work itself were dangerous; that no warning or instruction had been given him ; that he was inexperienced in the work he was directed to do and knew nothing of its danger, which was not so obvious as to affect him with knowledge, relieving the employer from warning or instruction.</p>

It is only in clear cases where the facts and inferences to be drawn from the testimony are free from doubt, and but one conclusion is deducible that the court may not permit a jury to reach a different one: Iseminger v. York Haven Water &amp; Power Co., <a href="/pa/206/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="206 Pa. 591" data-case-ids="931904" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0591-01">206 Pa. 591</a>. <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>The court below fully vindicated the propriety of the submission of the case to the jury in the opinion denying a motion for judgment for the defendant n. o. y., and on that opinion the judgments for the appellees are affirmed.</p>
