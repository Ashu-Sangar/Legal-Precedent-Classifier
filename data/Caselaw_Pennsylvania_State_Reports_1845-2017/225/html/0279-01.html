Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., much reliance is placed by counsel for the plaintiffs on three peculiarities of expression in the act of 1850. These are, first, the use of words alluding to the preferred stock thereby authorized as representing a definite part of the company’s aggregate capital stock; second, the limitation of the preference by the words, ‘until the holders of such additional stock shall have been paid ten per cent per annum;’ and third, the employment of the word ‘participate’-as applied to the right of the holders of the common stock to receive dividends from the company’s profits. These points of difference are but -(¡rifling and constitute no sound distinction between the essential terms of the two contracts under comparison. With respect to the use of the word ‘participate,’ it is enough to say that it probably refers here to the sharing of the profits of the corporation among the holders of the common shares themselves rather than to the distribution between the two classes of stockholders. The words which serve to limit the preference of the additional shares, viz., ‘until the holders of such additional stock shall have been paid ten per cent per annum,’ imply nothing different from what is implied by the words ‘ before any dividend shall be paid or set apart on the common stock’ contained in clause (a) of the resolutions of the American Iron and Steel Manufacturing Company, above quoted. The words ‘amount of capital stock represented by said additional stock,’ in the act of 1850, are devoid of the significance ascribed to them. They are merely a clumsy paraphrase of the expression ‘par value’ which the draftsman of the act probably regarded as too colloquial a term for use by the legislature.’ ”</p>

In discussing this feature he says: “Has there grown up any usage in the company at variance with the rights of the preferred stockholders as ascertainable from a fair reading of the resolutions under which the preferred shares were issued? The plaintiffs assert that there is such a custom, and in support of their statement, point to the dividends paid on the common stock during the first sixteen months of the company’s existence, which aggregated $1.25 per share on the common stock, a return of more than eighteen per cent per annum on the sum paid in <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>on this stock, while during the same period the holders of preferred stock accepted without murmur dividends at the yearly-rate of five per cent on their shares. The effect of this evidence is entirely overcome, however, by the consideration that the dividends paid on the common stock yielded less- than two per cent on its par value. It is to be assumed that before the holders of preferred stock could claim more than the five per cent dividends that they received, the holders of the common stock were entitled to receive a dividend of the same percentage on the par value of their shares. To refuse them this right would be unjust. True it is that they had paid in only ten per cent of the amount of their subscriptions, and that the company had the use of but a comparatively small part of what they were obligated to pay in if called on, but the com-' pany enjoyed the credit of having such a resource as the unpaid subscriptions to its stock, and the common stockholders had at risk in the venture not only what money they had paid in, but all for which they were still liable. It was proper, therefore, that the par value of their stock should be taken as the basis of their share in the company’s profits, and until they received more than five per cent per annum on that basis (which they never did prior to 1905), the holders of preferred stock had no reason to complain.” This conclusion commends itself to us.</p>
    <p id="b317-3" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[159,1650,1160,530]]]'>With reference to this subject, the present chief justice in Kane v. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/199/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="199 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="922875" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0205-01">199 Pa. 205</a>, said (p. 207): “Cotemporary construction of a contract by acts of the parties is entitled to very great weight, but it ought to appear with reasonable certainty that they were acts of both parties, done with knowledge, and in view of a purpose at least consistent with that to which they are now sought to be applied.” In our view, these requirements are not met in the present case. Further, it should be noted, that the rule invoked applies only to contracts that are ambiguous, and where the intention is doubtful.</p>

The practical interpretation of the parties is to be regarded, however, only when the contract is ambiguous. If clear and free from ambiguity, the intention shown upon its face, if written, must be followed, though contrary to the practical interpretation of the parties, and even if such practical construction has been acquiesced in for a long period of time.”</p>
