    <p class="syllabus" id="b58-10" data-blocks='[["BL_58.11",58,[301,1314,1150,723]]]'>In a grade crossing case the evidence for the plaintiff tended to show that at the time of the accident, plaintiff was driving a spirited team hitched to a wagon, and that he stopped 110 feet from the track, and looked and listened, but seeing and hearing no trains he started on, seated well back in the wagon, and that his horses were struck when on the second track. At the point where he stopped plaintiff could see 1,153 feet. Between this point and the track was situated a building which obstructed the view. The witnesses for plaintiff testified in effect that in passing the building before a view of the tracks could be had, the horses would be on the tracks. The testimony on this subject was, however, not in entire harmony. There was also proof that the train was running at a high rate of speed, and without warning signals. There was also evidence that there was a curve at the angle of the intersection of the road and track, and that this angle was acute. <em>Held, </em>that the case was for the jury and that a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.</p>

This crossing is on an extensively traveled thoroughfare, it being the main highway leading from Wyalusing borough to several towns and an extended thickly settled area of country south of the Susquehanna river. Plaintiff approached the crossing from the south driving a spirited team hitched to a wagon upon which he had been drawing baled hay, and stopped, as he states, from 100 to 125 feet from the tracks (the place indicated by actual measurement is 110 feet), took off his ear laps and mittens and looked and listened for approaching trains. He started on and upon reaching the crossing at the second track his horses were struck by the locomotive, but were not sufficiently over the crossing at the time as they approached from the south to be seen by the engineer from the north side of the train, which was moving west.</p>

Beyond that was an embankment about seven feet high dotted with trees, etc. He states that no train was in sight, no warning signals heard, and “if there had been a train he could have seen it.” He then proceeded toward the railroad. Between the point where he stopped and the tracks, obstructing the view eastward, was a lumber office sixteen by thirty-two feet. The northeast corner of this office is nearest the railroad track, its distance from <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>the southern rail of the west-bound track, where the accident occurred, being about forty-three feet.</p>

The railroad line is on a curve at and in the vicinity of this crossing, which the plaintiff approached from within the circle, and easterly from the crossing the curve is to the southeast and seems pronounced because of the acute angle at which the highway intersects it, and the testimony as to just how far the track can be seen from the highway easterly immediately after passing the lumber office, the side from which the train injuring the plaintiff came, is not in entire harmony.</p>

Bull, a surveyor, is to the effect that the office building, as stated, is sixteen by thirty-two feet, with the end toward, but not square with the street, and fifty-six feet distant from its center. From the north side of the building at the front to the first rail of the track in line with the building is seventy-one feet, and from the northeast corner of the office building to- the railroad track, in line with the rear of the building, is forty-three feet and four inches; but this northeast corner of the office building diagonally to the track, is somewhat nearer. He states that from the crossing one can see to the whistling post, and gives it as his opinion, that after passing the office building a few feet, or ten feet from the right of way line, a view of probably 300 feet can be had down the track, and when from twelve and one-half to fifteen feet from the east-bound track, the view extends to the whistling post.</p>

Schwoerer, the plaintiff, testifies in direct examination that at the point where he stopped, which was the usual stopping place for travelers, he had a view of the track and could see if a train was coming from the crossing eastward for 1,000 or 1,500 feet, and this notwithstanding the location of the office and box cars, which he claims were there (although a number of witnesses testify that they were on the switch on the opposite side of the track); that after passing the office he could not get a view of the track at all, and on redirect examination, that after passing the office building to a point where <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>he was able to see east any distance at all — 200,300 or 400 feet —his horses would be on the track and that at the place where he stopped, 110 feet from the track, there was nothing to obstruct his view at all. On recross-examination, he states that when he got by the lumber office his horses’ feet would be on the east-bound track, about nine feet from the west-bound track, before he could see. He also testified that he was looking both up and down with his horses under control, but that they began to rear up and plunge when he got to the track and the cars struck him.</p>
