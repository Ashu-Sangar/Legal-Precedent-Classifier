On August 5, 1907, the board of viewers appointed to assess the damages due to him filed a report, awarding the sum of $310,326.69 as compensation for the taking of his property. Crow and the city both appealed from this award. On June 10, 1908, it was agreed by the parties that the appeals should be withdrawn, the city being willing tó pay the amount of the award, on receipt of releases from all the claimants to the fund. The trustees in bankruptcy applied for payment of award to them, but this was refused, as the city had received notice of the claims of the plaintiffs and the Third National Bank. At a meeting of the creditors of Crow’s bankrupt estate held June 20, 1908, at the office of Richard S. Hunter, the referee in bankruptcy, it was agreed by the trustees of the bankrupt estate, the plaintiffs and the Third National Bank (the referee in bankruptcy approving the agreement) that the amount of the award should be paid by the city of Philadelphia to the Land Title &amp; Trust Company, in full discharge of all claims against the city arising out of the taking of the land, and that the Land Title <em>&amp; </em>Trust Company should insure a title in fee simple to the city. It was further agreed that out of the funds paid to the said company the sum of $70,000 should be set apart to meet the amounts claimed by the plaintiffs and the Third National Bank, and that a suit should be instituted against it for the recovery of the said amounts. An express stipulation of the agreement was that payment to the said. Land Title &amp; Trust Company should be without prejudice to the rights of the trustees in bankruptcy, the Third National Bank or the appellants under the assignment to them. Patton declined to join in this agreement without the consent of the appellants and the Third National Bank, and, such assent having been given, he formally concurred in the agreement. On June 26, 1908, the city paid the amount of the award, less $12,589.31 previously paid on account, by delivering to the attorneys for the trustees of Crow’s estate and to' Patton, his attorney, a warrant drawn to the order of the Land Title &amp; Trust Company for the balance due. Upon receiving this warrant the attorneys for the trustees and Patton formally directed the <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>clerk of quarter sessions to enter satisfaction upon the award. In this suit, brought by the plaintiffs to recover the amount due them, held by the Land Title &amp; Trust Company, the rule for judgment for an insufficient affidavit of defense, filed by the trustees in bankruptcy, was discharged, and from the refusal of judgment there has come this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b333-3" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[161,690,1165,1116]]]'>If, by the agreement of March 5, 1907, Crow had merely appointed Patton his agent to collect the compensation to be paid to him by the city, the agency would admittedly have been revocable; but it was much more than such an agency. The power of attorney was not only for the purpose of collecting money for Crow, but for others to whom he had assigned portions of the fund. The power did not concern merely the interest of Crow, but was executed by him as a means of effectuating a purpose necessary to protect the rights of the appellants. It was, therefore, not revocable either by him or by his trustees in bankruptcy: Blackstone v. Buttermore, <a href="/pa/53/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="53 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1004720" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0266-01">53 Pa. 266</a>. “Where a letter of attorney forms a part of a contract, and is a security for money, or for the performance of any act which is deemed valuable, it is generally made irrevocable in terms, or if not so, is deemed irrevocable in. law.. Although a letter of attorney depends, from its nature, on the will of the person making it, and may, in general, be recalled at his will; yet, if he binds himself for a consideration, in terms, or by the nature of his contract, not to change his will, the law will not permit him to change it:” Hunt v. Rousmanier, <a href="/us/21/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="8 Wheat. 174" data-case-ids="6136577" data-case-paths="/us/21/0076-01">8 Wheat. 174</a>.</p>

By it Crow authorized Patton to receive for him from the city, not a portion of the compensation to be paid to him, but all of it, to be distributed by Patton in accordance with the terms of the agreement. This was an. equitable assignment to Patton, as trustee, of the whole fund, and, if so, he became a trustee for the creditors named in the agreement. As we view the case, the question of a partial assignment of the fúnd is not involved. The city was bound.to pay, it all to Patton, and his receipt for the same would have been <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>a complete discharge. His duty, after getting the money, was distribution as trustee for the cestuis que trustent, among whom are the appellants.</p>
    <p id="b334-4" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[296,533,1151,963]]]'>As the payment of the award to the Land Title &amp; Trust Company was made under an express stipulation that it should be without prejudice to the rights of the appellants under Crow’s assignment to them, their rights are unaffected by such payment, and the Land Title &amp; Trust Company holds the fund in trust for Patton as the trustee for those who would be entitled to receive it from him if it had been paid to him. Whatever judgment could have been recovered against him by the appellants, if the money had been paid to him and he had refused to pay them, they are now entitled to against the custodian of the fund, holding it for exactly the same purposes as those for which he would have held it, if paid to him. It is well contended by counsel for appellants that, if the trustees in bankruptcy could not collect from Patton any greater sum than that which belongs to Crow under the resulting trust and which he could have collected, they certainly cannot collect the same from the Land Title &amp; Trust Company.</p>
    <p id="b334-5" data-blocks='[["BL_334.5",334,[295,1504,1150,637]]]'>The right of the appellants to a portion of the whole award equitably assigned to Patton having been a fixed, vested one more than four months prior to the institution of the bankruptcy proceedings to adjudge Crow a bankrupt, his trustees cannot interfere with that right. On March 5, 1907, the appellants acquired a valid lien upon the fund to be paid by the city for taking Crow’s property, and their subsequent enforcement of that lien is not an illegal preference under the act of congress: Owen et al. v. Brown, 120 Fed. Repr. 812. There is a clear distinction between the bald creation of a lien within four months and the enforcement of one previously acquired: Thompson v. Fairbanks, <a href="/us/196/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="196 U.S. 516" data-case-ids="8292951" data-case-paths="/us/196/0516-01">196 U. S. 516</a>.</p>
    <p id="b334-6" data-blocks='[["BL_334.6",334,[296,2151,1149,259]]]'>The order of the court refusing judgment is reversed, and the record is remitted with direction that judgment be entered against the Land Title &amp; Trust Company for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, unless other legal or equitable cause be shown why such judgment should not be entered.</p>
