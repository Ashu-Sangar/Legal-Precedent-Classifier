Hughes, the testator, left to survive him three children, and three grandchildren, the latter being children of a daughter, Margaret Lamoreaux, who died previous to the time of making his will. He had taken to raise when she was sixteen months a girl named Annie Griffith, and he always treated her precisely as he did his own daughters; she addressed him as father and his wife as mother, and he spoke of her as his daughter.

    <p class="summary" id="b111-7" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[191,903,1154,638]]]'>It is well-settled rule of law that a bequest to children, where there are childreh to take, does not include grandchildren unless it be the apparent intention of the testator, clearly disclosed by his will, to provide for the children of a deceased child: Hunt’s Estate, <a href="/pa/133/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="133 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="812898" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0260-01">133 Pa. 260</a>. There is nothing in this will which by necessary implication permits a construction differing from the ordinary rule of law, and we find that the grandchildren are not comprehended in the word “children,” and consequently they do not share in the bequests to his children of the money in bank. They, however, will take of testator’s estate, not disposed of by his will, the same share their mother would take if living.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b111-8" data-blocks='[["BL_111.7",111,[186,1553,1157,521]]]'>For Annie Griffith it is contended that the will of testator, in which he speaks of her as his daughter and his adopted daughter, operates as a deed of adoption under Act of April 2, 1872, P. L. 31. Whether the will is in compliance with that act we need not say, for it is held in Carroll’s Estate, <a href="/pa/219/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="219 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1002744,1002762" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0440-01,/pa/219/0440-02">219 Pa. 440</a>, that in Pennsylvania there is no authority for the proposition that a child may be adopted by parol. We have no evidence of her adoption by decree of court, and we must, therefore, conclude that she was never legally adopted by testator.</p>

He makes devises to her as “Annie Griffith, an adopted daughter,” and as “my daughter, Annie Griffith.” These words are merely descriptive of the person <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>intended; they did not, in fact, make her a daughter or an adopted daughter, for she was neither: Line’s Estate, <a href="/pa/221/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="221 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="956141" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0374-01">221 Pa. 374</a>. There being children of his blood to take, no necessity arises to extend the term beyond its natural import: Hunt’s Estate; <a href="/citations/?q=133%20Pa.%20267" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="133 Pa. 267">133 Pa. 267</a>. The language employed by testator in his revoked will, if it is evidence of his intention, does not sustain her contention. It follows that Annie Griffith is not to share in the distribution of the money in bank, nor does she share in the part of testator’s estate which passes under the intestate laws.</p>
