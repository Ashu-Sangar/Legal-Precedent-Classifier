In such a case the injured person assumes the risk of the employment. He has no standing to complain that the electric company did not give him instructions as to danger, since it was not to the company, but to his own employer that he was bound to look for instructions.</p>

They were there working, for some weeks before the accident, which is the subject of this suit,- occurred, the plaintiff having been there about three weeks. On the evening of December 12, 1906, the chief electrician of the company, under orders from its superintendent, told the foreman of the carpenters of some work he wanted done. On the morning of December 13, 1906, the foreman took the plaintiff into a room, and, while he was engaged in measuring for the work, he came in contact with some of the appliances or wires there, and was severely injured by an electric shock. It is for these injuries that he seeks to recover damages in this action. The room in which the accident occurred was a dangerous place, and prior to the accident no one, unless accompanied by an electrician, was permitted to go into it. The foreman who had charge of the plaintiff admits that he knew that it was a dangerous place, though it did not appear that either he or the plaintiff were instructed as to the dangers by a representative of defendant company.</p>

The fact that he was working at the defendant company’s plant for thi’ee weeks before the accident occurred, justified the defendant in assuming that he had not only common knowledge, but that he had acquired knowledge of the dangers of such wires from experience, and is an additional reason to excuse it from instructing him of them. That the wires and connections were there, was apparent to him. He therefore, we think, assumed the risk of his employment and cannot recover because of the failure of the defendant to properly instruct him. Additional cases to sustain this position recently decided are: Nelson v. Street Railway Company, <a href="/pa/207/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="207 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="933594" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0363-01">207 Pa. 363</a>; Simmons v.

He was not lent to the defendant company as his counsel contends, and. the cases cited by him, show that an employee is lent to another employer, only when he is placed there in his control and subject to his orders. The plaintiff in this case was not at the defendant’s power plant in the control or subject to the orders of the defendant or of its superintendent, but was there under the orders and in the care and control of the contractor’s foreman. Whatever orders to do work were given' by the defendant’s representative, were not given to the plaintiff but to the foreman of the contractor, who selected the man or men who was to do it, and directed him or them in doing it. When the plaintiff was selected to work in the room where the accident occurred, which was a dangerous place, the defendant company was not aware of his selection to do that work. It was an act with which it had nothing to do, and not knowing that he was going there to work, it would be exacting entirely too much of it to require that it should have instructed him as to the dangers. But the plaintiff had a right <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>to assume that the contractor’s representative knew whether of not the place he was taking him to work was a dangerous one, and he says he did know it, and that he would properly instruct him, if it was not obvious and subject of common knowledge, or of such knowledge which his employer’s foreman knew he had acquired during the weeks which he had been employed in and about the place. It was a duty which his employer, and not the defendant, owed to him.</p>
