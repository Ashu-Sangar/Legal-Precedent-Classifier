After careful consideration the referee is of the opinion that the motion should prevail. Under the Bradford county reference Act of April 6, 1869, P. L. 725, a trial before a referee is conducted in the same manner as a trial by the court with a jury, and it' would be a fair general statement to say that the referee has all the powers of a judge in such trial, including the power to enter nonsuit in a proper case. If the plaintiff on his own evidence is not entitled to recover he ought not to ask the. defendant to go to the expense of producing witnesses and trying a case already lost. If the referee state findings of fact and conclusions of law upon the plaintiff’s own showing the plaintiff certainly ought not to complain of not having a full trial. Holding, therefore, that a referee has the power, in a proper case, to enter a nonsuit, I have carefully examined the evidence and have stated' findings of facts and conclusions of law, the controlling conclusion being that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action.</p>

Naugle against the township of Nescopeck by reason of the township authorities failing to keep a public road in proper condition so that <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>Naugle could at all times pass and repass along the same with the products of his mills and farm. By reason of being unable to travel this road Naugle claims he was greatly damaged. We may concede at once that had the creek been bridged and the road kept in good condition the Naugle property would have been much more desirable as a business place and farm and consequently much more valuable. But when we attempt to charge this loss on the township several important questions present themselves. Is it mandatory on a township to bridge every stream crossed by a public road? No law to that effect has been produced. It is well known that all over the state many streams of water on cross roads and roads where there is little travel are crossed by public roads at fords. Where so crossed it is the duty of the municipality to keep the ford in good condition as a part of the public road, but travelers must take notice of high water and if inconvenienced thereby have no right to claim damages from the municipality. By the high water between Kingston and Wilkes-Barre many people have been very seriously inconvenienced at times, yet there has never been a suggestion that any municipality is liable in damages. So in this case with Mr. Naugle'. No doubt he has been seriously inconvenienced by high water, but the resulting loss cannot be charged to the township. If he had occasion to cross the stream many times his inconvenience and resulting loss would be great, but there would be no more reason for charging it on the township.</p>

In this case I can readily understand how the expense of building two bridges over this stream so near together would be entirely disproportioned to the ability of the township in view of any demand of public travel. Mr. Naugle does not contend that the general public travel would be greatly benefited by such bridges, but rather contends that his property would be greatly benefited and enhanced in <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>value by affording him convenient access at all times. Suppose no road at all led to the Naugle farm and by proceedings in the quarter sessions one should be laid out and ordered opened but the township authorities should wholly neglect to open it. Could Naugle as a private citizen in his individual right compel the township authorities to open the road so that his land might be benefited?</p>

To ascertain his damages we must necessarily determine that some right has been infringed. Mr. Naugle’s early life was spent on this farm, and he bought it twenty years ago with full knowledge of its situation. He erected and improved his planing mill, feed and sawmill and cider mill, and now complains that he could not do business because the township authorities. failed to keep the public road in repair. It was testified that $250 would have put the road in good repair including the fords, and it seems strange that Mr, Naugle would suffer the loss he claims when it could have been so easily avoided even if done at his own expense. The substantial gist of his complaint is that the township would not erect bridges over this creek at the fords so that he could at all times cross with the products of his mills and farm, his children could cross to attend school and the high water and winter isolation of his place be thus overcome.</p>

The fact that a man by choice or necessity locates along a stream does not of right give him a road or bridge the most convenient way out at public expense. When Mr. Naugle bought his farm and improved his mills he knew the conditions and situation and ought not to complain that the township should build bridges to make his mills and farm profitable. Were it the law that a township must build bridges whenever a landowner desired to enhance the desirability or value of his property I apprehend the burden of taxation would soon be very grievous. As before remarked the gist of the complaint is the failure of the township to put the fords in such condition that access to the Naugle farm could be had at all times. This could only be done by bridging.</p>
