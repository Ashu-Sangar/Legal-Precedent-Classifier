Suppose the funds are exhausted, and under the contract the work stops, how are they to be supplied? When will the building be finished? Suppose the work goes on, the board in good faith believes it can raise available funds and it fails; the builder “shall then be entitled to be paid on an estimate of the architect in full for all work then done and material furnished by him;” if there are no funds available, is there any question of his right to recover, and may it not be the full amount of this contract price?</p>
