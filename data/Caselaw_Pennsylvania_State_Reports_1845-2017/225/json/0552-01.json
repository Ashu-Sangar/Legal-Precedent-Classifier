        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Potter,\nThis was an action of assumpsit in which it was sought to recover upon an article of agreement, signed by seven persons, who stipulated to make payment of a certain sum of money to one J. B. Shiffer, within a period of three years. Some time after the execution of the paper, Shiffer asked E. H. Hughes, who was familiar with the handwriting of the signers, to attest the signatures, and this he did, without the knowledge or consent of the signers. Upon the trial the court below held that the addition of the attestation was a material alteration which destroyed the validity of the instrument, and judgment of compulsory nonsuit was entered. The correctness of this position is questioned by this appeal. Counsel for appellant concede the fact of the alteration of the paper after its execution, without the knowledge or consent of the obligors, and they frankly admit that the general rule of law in Pennsylvania is, that the addition of the name of a witness to the signatures of a paper, after its execution, without the. knowledge or consent of the obligors, is a material alteration, which renders the paper inadmissible in evidence. Such a rule was laid down by this court in Marshall v. Gougler, 10 S. & R. 164, and was followed in Henning v. Werkheiser, 8 Pa. 518; Foust v. Renno, 8 Pa. 378, and other cases.\nIt is also a general principle of law that: \u201cAn altered instrument is so far vitiated that no recovery can be had on its original or altered terms. It cannot be considered as void for the unauthorized change and valid in other respects, but is void altogether:\u201d 2 Cyc. L. & P. 182, sec. c. It is further true that: \u201cThe vitiating effect of an alteration cannot be obviated by afterward attempting to restore the instrument, as by erasing words unauthorizedly inserted, especially after an attempt to recover upon the instrument in its altered form. This rule seems especially applicable in favor of one who is subject to no liability but that created by the instrument:\u201d 2 Cyc. L. & P. 182, sec. d.\nBut while admitting the general rule, counsel contend that the circumstances of this case take it out of the usual order. In support of -this position, they allege that the use plaintiff, Gertrude I. Heeley, was an innocent purchaser of the agreement from the executors of the payee. But we cannot find that any evidence was offered to show any such fact. The assignment of the agreement is embodied in plaintiff's statement, and it does not show the consideration, if any, which was paid, but it does show that she was one of the heirs of J. B. Shiffer, entitled to a one-third interest in his estate, and presumably the assignment was made on account of her interest in the estate. It was made when payment under the terms of the instrument was long overdue. The agreement was not a negotiable instrument, and the assignee would therefore take it subject to any defense which could be set up against the assignor. The authorities are against the position taken by counsel for appellant. Thus, in 3 Page on Contracts (1905), sec. 1529, it is said: \u201cA material alteration avoids the written contract. Thus a material alteration of a contract, though with the consent of the other parties thereto, releases a surety thereon. . . . Any material alteration releases a party who does not consent thereto no matter -how many other parties have consented. This is so whether the alteration is fraudulent or innocent. ... A material alteration avoids a contract not only as to the party making it, but as to an innocent transferee, such as a bona fide assignee who is not an indorsee. A negotiable instrument which has been altered materially is unenforceable; even in the hands of a bona fide holder without notice who takes it for value and before maturity.\u201d Kountz v. Kennedy, 63 Pa. 187, is cited in justification of the claim to disregard the alteration of the paper. But Kountz v. Kennedy has not been followed in subsequent cases. In Fulmer v. Seitz, 68 Pa. 237, Justice Agnew said (p. 242): \u201cIt is supposed that the case of Kountz v. Kennedy, 63 Pa. 187, is opposed to this view, and it is cited as authority against it. That case is a very close one, and was decided doubtingly on its peculiar, circumstances. One of our number (Justice Sharswood) expressly dissented, and I gave my own assent with hesitation.\u201d And in Craighead v. McLoney, 99 Pa. 211, Chief Justice Sharswood, after referring to Kountz v. Kennedy, said (p. 214): \u201cMy own opinion is that the courts have gone far enough in permitting writings to be tampered with.\u201d\nIn the cases of Hartley v. Corboy, 150 Pa. 23 (29), Gettysburg Nat. Bank v. Chisholm, 169 Pa. 564 (573), and Citizens' Nat. Bank v. Williams, 174 Pa. 66 (70), this court declined to follow Kountz v. Kennedy. In the latter case Justice Green said (p. 71): \u201cThe tendency of all our recent decisions is to hold parties more strictly responsible for alterations of any kind particularly in the case of negotiable instruments, and we do not think that the ruling in Kountz v. Kennedy should be extended a single step beyond its own peculiar facts.\u201d\nThe second contention of appellant, that the receipt written upon the agreement in the handwriting of J. L. Polen, one of the obligors, operated as a ratification of the altered contract, we do not consider tenable. In any event, the action of Polen would affect himself only. The offer of evidence does not show whether the receipt was indorsed before or after the attestation clause was added, but if it was made afterwards it would not be sufficient to give life to a contract which had been made void by the act of the obligee.\n\u201cSubsequent assent to a material change of a written instrument is a waiver of the right to rely upon the alteration as a defense to an action brought upon the instrument. But a ratification by one of several who are parties to the instrument as originally written binds him only, and not those who do not assent:\u201d 2 Cyc. L. & P. 172. And in the same text-book it is further stated that: \u201cIn order that any acts may be construed as a ratification of an alteration, the particular act must be done with full knowledge of the alteration. . . . The party must have knowledge in fact, and it is no answer to say that he had means of knowledge:\u201d 2 Cyc. L. & P. 175.\nIn the present case, it does not appear that there was any offer to show knowledge of the alleged payment, upon the part of anyone but Polen. We see no merit in any of the assignments of error; they are therefore overruled, and judgment is affirmed.",

The addition of the name of a witness to the signatures of a paper, after its execution, without the knowledge or consent of the obligors, is a material alteration, which renders the paper inadmissible in evidence.\n2. An altered instrument is so far vitiated that no recovery can be had on its original or altered terms. It cannot be considered as void for the unauthorized change and valid in other respects, but is void altogether.\n8. Any material alterations of a writing releases a party who does not consent thereto, no matter how many other parties have consented. This is so whether the alteration is fraudulent or innocent. It avoids the contract not only as to the party making it, but as to an innocent transferee, such as a bona fide assignee who was not an indorsee.\n4. Subsequent assent to a material change of a written instrument is a waiver of the right to rely upon the alteration as a defense to an action brought on the instrument; but a ratification by one of several who are parties to the instrument as originally written binds him only, and not those who do not assent.\n5. Where the name of a witness to the signatures of a contract is added after the execution of the contract, and without the knowledge or consent of the obligors, the contract is wholly void for a material alteration, and a suit cannot be maintained upon it although a copy of the agreement is attached to the statement of claim without the attestation, and the signers themselves are called to prove their own signature.\nArgued April 13, 1909.\nAppeal, No. 369, Jan. T., 1908, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Luzerne Co., Oct. T., 1905, No. 282, refusing to take off nonsuit in case of Frank E. Shiffer, surviving executor of the estate of J. B. Shiffer, deceased, to use of Gertrude I. Heeley, v. James H. Mosier et al.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Potter and Elkin, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on a written instrument. Before Lynch, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the suit was brought on an agreement in writing signed by seven persons. The copy of the agreement attached to the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim showed no attesting witness.\nWhen E. H. Hughes, a witness for plaintiff, was on the stand, plaintiff\u2019s counsel made the following offer:\nWe now offer in evidence the paper marked \u201cfor identification, plaintiff\u2019s exhibit \u2018A,\u2019 \u201d being the agreement a copy of which is affixed to the plaintiff\u2019s statement and on which this suit is brought. The affidavit of defense not denying the signatures of the paper by the defendants under the court rules it is not necessary to prove them.\nDefendants\u2019 counsel: We object to the paper because it is not the paper declared upon, the paper offered in evidence has a subscribing witness thereto and the witness must be called to establish the signatures of the obligors as the law requires.\nPlaintiff\u2019s counsel: We want to add to the offer so as to get it on the record. The affidavit of defense and court rule No. 19, sec. 1, p. 34.\nThe Court : It appears that the instrument sued upon is identical with the one offered in evidence excepting that the copy of the one sued upon and attached to the statement in this case has no subscribing witness. The paper now offered in evidence has this in addition \u201cwitness to the seven signatures, E. H. Hughes.\u201d The effort on the part of counsel for the plaintiff seems to be to avoid proving the execution of the paper offered in evidence in the ordinary way. The objection is sustained, exception noted and bill sealed for plaintiff. [2]\n\u201cQ. I believe you testified that you were a clerk in this People\u2019s Bank in 1894? A. Yes, sir.\u201d\nPaper marked \u201cFor identification, plaintiff\u2019s exhibit \u2018A,\u2019 \u201d shown witness.\n\u201cQ. I show you the words \u2018witness to the seven signatures, E. H.

[3]\nPlaintiff\u2019s counsel: I offer in evidence the paper marked \u201c for identification, plaintiff\u2019s exhibit \u2018A,\u2019 \u201d with that explanation of the attestation clause, showing why it was not copied in the declaration, why it was left out of the declaration.\nDefendant\u2019s counsel: We object to that until the paper is properly proven.\nThe Court: Objection sustained, exception noted, bill sealed for the plaintiff. [4]\nPlaintiff\u2019s counsel: We now ask the court to allow the attestation clause, the words, \u201cwitness to the seven signatures, E. H. Hughes,\u201d to be stricken out or canceled on the paper marked \u201cplaintiff\u2019s exhibit 'A\u2019 for identification.\u201d\nDefendant\u2019s counsel: We object to that.\nThe Court: It appears that Mr. Hughes, the witness, by' procurement of Mr. Shiffer, -in the absence and without the assent of the other obligors or redelivery put his name to this instrument. We think, under these circumstances, and under the cases cited, that the plaintiff would have no right to cancel the name of Mr. Hughes as a witness to the instrument, that would be practically sustaining the instrument.\nObjection sustained, exception noted, bill sealed for the plaintiff. [5]\nPlaintiff now stipulating that the words \u201cwitness to the seven signatures, E. H. Hughes\u201d are by her canceled so as to restore the paper in the same condition that it was in when it was executed, offers the paper as originally executed in evidence.\nDefendant\u2019s counsel: We object to the plaintiff striking out the attestation clause for the reason that the obligee in the bond fraudulently procured the said attesting witness to attach his name to said paper as a subscribing witness in the absence of the other obligors in the bond and without any request on their part for the alleged attesting witness to so subscribe his name.\nThe Court: It appears in the argument at bar that suit had been previously brought upon this instrument in this court and that the case was brought into trial and that the plaintiff in that case took a voluntary nonsuit. Now, this action was brought in assumpsit and the same instrument which was then declared upon is. now offered in evidence. The objection is sustained, exception noted, bill sealed for the plaintiff.

Mosier, being the first of the signatures to that paper. Please examine it and state whether that is your signature.\u201d\nDefendant\u2019s counsel: We object for the reason that the paper has attached to it on its face a subscribing witness and it appearing that the witness attached his name as a subscribing witness to the paper after its execution by the fraudulent procurement of the obligee in the bond in the absence of and without the request or assent of the obligors, the question is objected to as being immaterial and irrelevant.\nThe Court: The objection sustained, exception noted, bill sealed for the plaintiff.
