Freeport and Local 538 were parties to a collective bargaining agreement that terminated on August 3, 1977. Negotiations for a new agreement proved unsuccessful and on August 4, 1977, Local 538 began to picket at Freeport’s place of operations. The strike continued through to November 19, 1977, the date on which an agreement was finally reached. During the strike, there were repeated incidents of violence, which resulted in personal injuries to Freeport employees who had continued to work and extensive damage to Freeport’s equipment and property.</p>

Punitive damages in the sum of $500,000 were awarded to Freeport against IBT only.

On that day, Smetanick attempted to drive a truck to Freeport Brick Company while being followed by members of Local 538 and Robison. The strikers, including Ray Baker, Charles Peart, Gary Griffith, and Jack Robison, would use their vehicles to slow down the truck’s movement by veering into the truck’s path and by passing the vehicle and then slowing the speed of their cars. The following day, Smetanick was harassed by Gary Griffith who flashed a hand gun from the picket line and threatened to blow Smetanick’s head off. Smetanick was then followed while operating his tractor-trailer by Raymond Baker and Peart who attempted to block access to his destination with their vehicle.</p>

He indicated that approximately two dozen strikers were blocking the entrance to the Freeport terminal. Once it began to get dark, the strikers began throwing rocks and several were shooting projectiles from slingshots. Smetanick recognized Baker, Robison, Peart, and Griffith among the strikers. He did not observe Baker with a slingshot, but did see Robison with one. Baker sighted Smetanick and pointed in his direction, but Baker was too far away for Smetanick to hear what he was saying. The incident ended when the police were called. Windows of the terminal had been smashed and equipment was damaged by the projec<a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>tiles. As a result of that incident, criminal charges were filed against Robison and Griffith, leading to convictions.</p>

The terminal manager, Raymond Condy, testified that strikers threatened to beat him, that marbles or bearings were fired towards him, and that police intervention was necessary to enable him to leave a loading place. The police escorted him to the boundary limits of the town where the load was picked up. When he arrived at his destination, three of the picketers tried to enter the cab of the truck. He locked the doors and radioed for assistance on his CB. While waiting for the sheriff to arrive, he observed picketers placing objects underneath the wheels of the trailer. When it was safe to do so, he examined the area and found approximately 8 to 10 jack-like objects made of six-penny nails welded together. At his request, he was escorted to the county line by the sheriff, only to be met again by picketers. A projectile was fired from a slingshot which resulted in damage to the vehicle. Several tires were flattened due to spikes.</p>
    <p id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.6",583,[215,1420,1147,622]]]'>Condy testified that he saw Robison again at the terminal in late August. He went to assist a driver who had been stopped by pickets and feared for his life because of threats by the strikers that if delivery was attempted, they could not be responsible because he had unsafe equipment which might blow up. When Condy arrived, more than one-half of the 15-20 strikers dispersed. Several, including Robison and Griffith, stayed to harass him. After being threatened that he would be beaten and that they were going to put him in a coffin and bury him, he contacted the police who sent a patrol car that remained while the vehicle was unloaded.</p>

Condy was gathering hoses and heard something hit the front of the truck. He found that the front windshield had been smashed. After taking a photograph of the damage, he went to the back of the truck, returning to find that Robison’s stick was pro-<a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>trading from the radiator. He left the terminal and went back to his pickup truck, discovering that he had four flat tires. The tires had been knifed or ice-picked.</p>

Robison had threátened to harm Condy and his wife during telephone calls to his residence. One evening while Condy was patrolling a terminal parking lot during the strike, a car drove by on the highway. An exploding device was thrown from the car. A police car driving behind the vehicle gave chase and stopped the vehicle. The driver was Robison. The device that had been thrown was found to be welded spikes tied to an M-80 firecracker. The shrapnel from the device hit cars, but did not harm Condy. After being released from jail, Robison continued to threaten Condy over the phone.</p>

Although the perpetrators of each incident could not always be specifically identified, the testimony established that the nature and method of the destruction were repeated. One witness, Roger Alwine, a Freeport mechanic who was a member of Local 538, testified that during the strike, another picketer told him of a device he had created to puncture tires. He was later shown a sample of the device — which was the jack-like device used to destroy tires during the strike. Alwine also testified that after the strike had settled, another Freeport driver who was a Local 538 member admitted having burned the Freeport truck.</p>

One driver, James Morrison, testified that when he attempted to pick up a load on August 29, 1977, picketers pulled a car in front of the entrance to the plant as he entered the driveway. He recognized Peart and Griffith, but at the time did not know the person who was shouting obscenities at him, who then <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>climbed onto the truck, opened the door, and started to punch him. Morrison learned later that this was Robison. As Morrison grabbed a wrench to hit Robison, Griffith climbed into the truck and pulled the wrench out of his hand. The windshield of the truck was broken, the tires were flattened, and dirt was put into the fuel tank.</p>
    <p id="b585-4" data-blocks='[["BL_585.5",585,[254,657,1149,574]]]'>Morrison also testified that he encountered Robison a week later when he went into a bar located across from Freeport’s New Eagle terminal. Robison offered to buy him a drink, but the bar closed. At another bar, Robison apologized for beating him up, assuring him it was not personal. Robison indicated that it was his job and that he was just doing his job. Subsequently, Robison was charged with simple assault and criminal mischief in connection with the Morrison incident. He pled guilty and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one to two years and ordered to make restitution.</p>
    <p id="b585-5" data-blocks='[["BL_585.6",585,[256,1269,1147,528]]]'>Roger Alwine testified that at one of the union meetings held during the strike, the Morrison incident was addressed by Raymond Baker.

He also concluded that the evidence established that the destruction of property and incidents of personal violence began at the inception of the strike and continued throughout the length of the strike. The trial court also concluded that Raymond Baker, an officer of Local 538, and other Local 538 members actively participated in the vandalism and violence. Despite the repeated incidents of violence, Local 538 made no attempts to discourage such conduct, but in fact encouraged it. While the actions of the various individuals as cited above were abhorrent, the record fails to disclose any evidence connecting IBT to the individual incidents of violence. With regard to IBT, the <em>actual </em>knowledge and assent under section 206h of the Pennsylvania Act is simply lacking.
