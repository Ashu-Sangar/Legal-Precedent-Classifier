The appellant argues that DPW incorrectly interpreted the regulations and guidelines governing cost accounting and erroneously attributed to appellant a proportional share of the interest income of its parent corporation, thus reducing appellant’s reimbursable interest expense. We granted allocatur to review what appears to be a lack of uniformity in similar cases previously decided by Commonwealth Court.</p>

They are designed to apply whether the separate parts of the organization are separately incorporated or not. The manual provides for a separate cost accounting from each provider. It also provides rules requiring a provider to account for certain transactions by a home office which may properly be allocated to the provider.

    <blockquote id="b571-5" data-blocks='[["BL_571.8",571,[253,1146,1106,247]]]'>Interest expense reduced by investment income, except when the investment income is derived from gifts or grants which are restricted by the donor and which are accounted for separately from other funds, will be recognized.</blockquote>
    <p id="b571-6" data-blocks='[["BL_571.9",571,[210,1419,1148,576]]]'>State Manual § IV(D)(10)(e). Northwood correctly points out that the state manual makes no reference to related party or home office investment income. The provision only calls for the set-off of the provider’s <em>own </em>interest income against its <em>own </em>interest expenses. Northwood claims that neither the language of the manuals nor the cases interpreting that language call for the offset of home office interest income against a provider’s allowable interest expense if the home office incurs no interest expense specifically allocable to the provider. Three arguments are asserted in support of this position.</p>
    <p id="b571-7" data-blocks='[["BL_571.10",571,[211,2014,1148,202]],["BL_572.1",572,[240,329,1147,632]]]'>First, Northwood argues that the pertinent set-off provision is that of the state manual because it differs from that of the federal manual. We reject this argument. The regulations declare that the provisions of the state manual <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>govern when there is a difference between the state and federal manuals. 55 Pa.Code § 1181.65(d)(1). The context of that regulation, however, makes it clear that <em>both </em>manuals are to govern the program, and only when the manuals <em>conflict </em>does the regulation come into play to implement the state provision. In this case, the two manuals are not in conflict. The state manual does not address the question presented by this case and is therefore inapposite. The federal manual goes beyond the state manual in providing detailed cost accounting procedures for complex organizations. The state manual being silent, the federal provisions apply.</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[236,985,1149,888]]]'>Second, Northwood argues that the federal manual offset rule applies only when the home office incurs interest expense which is properly allocable to the provider. This argument is not persuasive. The federal manual provides rules for set-offs in the most complex of situations — where the provider has both interest income and interest expense, and the home office has both interest expense which is allocable to the provider and interest income. The application of the set-off rule is not contingent on the existence of allocable expense at the home office level or interest income at the provider level. Rather, it aims to prevent the charging of needless interest costs to the government by attributing to each provider in a chain its ratable share of the home office investment income. This precludes complex organizations from compartmentalizing income in exempt pockets and interest expense in pockets which allow for interest reimbursement.</p>

Northwood relies primarily on <em>Chateau Convalescent Center v. Department of Public Welfare, </em>90 Pa.Cmwlth. 426, <a href="/citations/?q=495%20A.2d%20659" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="495 A.2d 659">495 A.2d 659</a> (1985), and <em>Tressler Lutheran Service Associates, Inc. v.

The issue was whether the interest income to the related party was allocable to Chateau to offset its reimbursable interest on capital indebtedness. Commonwealth Court held that the income to the related party was not allocable to Chateau, stating: “Nowhere in the Manual [for Allowable Cost Reimbursement] is it stated that investment income to a party related to a care provider under the [Medical Assistance] Program is to be deemed income to the provider.” <em>Chateau, supra, </em>90 Pa.Cmwlth. at 430, <a href="/citations/?q=495%20A.2d%20659" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="495 A.2d 659">495 A.2d at 661</a>.</p>

      <em>Tressler </em>was a case in which a charitable corporation owned and operated five nursing homes. Commonwealth Court required Tressler, the provider in question, to offset its allocable share of the home office investment income against Tressler’s interest expense. The court held:</p>

Had the <em>Chateau </em>court applied the federal regulations, it, too, should have required the interest income of the related party to offset the interest expense of Chateau. There is no reason why a different result should occur when separate corporations function in the relationship of home office and care provider; the federal manual does not make <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>a distinction on the basis of corporate structure. Moreover, such a distinction is inconsistent with the rationale underlying the cost-related reimbursement scheme. That rationale is to require accounting by providers without regard to their legal status as corporate or noncorporate entities, and to apply uniform cost accounting rules for complex organizations without regard to their legal form. It has the effect of preventing the improper public underwriting of private capital investments which might otherwise be accomplished through creative accounting procedures.</p>
    <p id="b574-4" data-blocks='[["BL_574.5",574,[248,842,1145,306]]]'>In this case, Commonwealth Court properly applied the state and federal regulations governing cost accounting by Medicaid care providers even though it extends the rule in <em>Tressler </em>beyond the single-corporate-entity rationale stated therein.
