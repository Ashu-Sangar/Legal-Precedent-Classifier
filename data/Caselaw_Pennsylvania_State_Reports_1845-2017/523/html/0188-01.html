Blackstone, Commentaries 361. While it is expected that conflicts may arise where the judge has the duty to disqualify himself in the appropriate case, this obligation should not be used as a guise for the judge to avoid difficult or unpleasant decisions. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Danyo, </em><a href="/f-supp/441/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="441 F.

Drawing the balance, “nice, clear and true”, between the obligation to dispose of the matters that come before the court and the duty to disqualify in those instances where the jurist’s impartiality might be legitimately questioned is often diffi<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>cult. The fact that a party has promptly raised an objection asserting a conflict may well be the factor that ultimately determines the court’s decision in this regard.

Its responsibility to interpret and develop the law of this Commonwealth mandates that its full membership be available and participate in all matters that come before that Court. A state as diverse in cultures, interests and ethnic stock as this Commonwealth increases the importance of assuring that the questions before this Court receive the reflective judgment enriched by the varied perspectives of its members that participate in reaching that judgment. The expression of concurring and dissenting views assures a more complete exposition of the reasons underpining the judgment and aids in evaluating the wisdom of the majority position. Quite frequently the dissenting view today becomes the majority view of the future. Thus this Court was structured so that, except for good cause, the full complement of the Court should participate in the judgments of this Court. Failure to recuse, standing alone, is not a basis for collateral attack upon a jurist.</p>

The second assessment is of lesser importance because “appearances” are not justice.
