    <p id="b262-11" data-blocks='[["BL_262.12",262,[240,1432,1149,632]]]'>The facts are that on May 1, 1977, Price Rogers entered Lankenau Hospital for the treatment of a broken leg. Dr. John J. Dowling, Lankenau’s Chief of Orthopedic Surgery, and Dr. Lawrence Naame, a third year resident on rotation from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, treated Mr. Rogers. Dr. Dowling recommended surgery which was scheduled for the following day. Dr. Dowling ordered the application of a plaster splint pending the surgery. Unlike a cast, a splint covers only part of an injured limb. Its application immobilizes the injured limb so as to prevent complications from, for example, the broken bone interfering with circulation.</p>

There Dr. Dowling held up the injured leg while both physicians applied the insulation and the plaster wrap so as to form a splint on its underside. Mr. Rogers complained of a sensation of warmth. Dr. Dowling assured him this was to be expected. When the splint began to harden, Dr. Dowling lowered the leg and left the room to arrange for Mr. Rogers’ admission into the hospital. Mr. Rogers complained to his wife, who was in the holding room, of a burning sensation. She applied ice to the uppermost part of the splint, at the top of her husband’s thigh, and left the room to locate Dr. Dowling. She found him, informed him of her husband’s complaints, and accompanied him back to the room. At that point, Mr. Rogers simply requested anesthesia should future painful procedures be required.</p>

The jury returned a verdict against Johnson &amp; Johnson only on the malfunction theory by answering affirmatively to that question and to the question of the malfunction’s having caused the plaintiffs’ harm. The jury <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>did not answer or consider the question regarding a failure to warn.

Thus, the malfunction theory strict liability claim of such a plaintiff must fail in that he has failed to present a jury question as to the existence of a defect which is an essential element of his cause of action.</blockquote>

      <em> </em>A plaintiff presents a <em>prima facie </em>case of strict liability by establishing that the product was defective and that the product caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>Sherk v. Daisy-Heddon, </em><a href="/pa/498/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="498 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="1776285" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0594-01">498 Pa. 594</a>, 598, <a href="/pa/498/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="498 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="1776285" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0594-01">450 A.2d 615</a>, 617 (1982). In most instances the plaintiff will produce direct evidence of the product’s defective condition. In some instances, however, the plaintiff may not be able to prove the precise nature of the defect in which case reliance may be had on the “malfunction” theory of product liability. This theory encompasses nothing more than circumstantial evidence of product malfunction. <em>See MacDougall, </em><a href="/pa-super/214/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="214 Pa.

It thereby relieves the plaintiff from demonstrating precisely the defect yet it permits the trier-of-fact to infer one existed from evidence of the malfunction, of the absence of abnormal use and of the absence of reasonable, secondary causes. <em>See Thompson, </em><a href="/pa-super/325/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="325 Pa.

The notes of testimony reflect plaintiffs’ fleeting reference to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s negligence in failing to test its product after manufacturing it. N.T. 1/25/84 at 70. The jury also heard deposition transcripts ostensibly supporting this claim. These depositions do not appear in the record and, therefore, this evidence has played no part in the conclusion we reach. We note that Johnson &amp; Johnson has not argued that this evidence of post-manufacturing negligence mandates a different outcome.</p>

        <em>. </em>Having carefully reviewed the record we must reject Johnson &amp; Johnson’s characterization of the plaintiffs’ case as one which actively pursued a claim of medical malpractice. Although plaintiffs’ counsel referred to medical malpractice in his opening and closing statements, he assiduously avoided arguing this theory as one espoused by the plaintiffs. Moreover, his <em>in camera </em>references to this claim could not, and did not, affect the plaintiff's ability to recover on a malfunction theory. <em>See infra </em>at 755, n. 6. Similarly we reject Johnson &amp; Johnson’s typification of the plaintiffs’ expert testimony eliminating medical malpractice. We find this evidence to be more than merely conclusory. The opinion as to the cause of Mr. Rogers’ burns reflected in-depth knowledge of the evidentiary and discovery facts upon which the expert founded his ultimate conclusion of due care, that is, the absence of malpractice.</p>

Interestingly enough, the Superior Court did not address the issue of the trial court’s having denied the hospitals’ motions for nonsuit at the close of the plaintiffs’ case. Since the plaintiffs abandoned their medical malpractice claims and presented no evidence in support thereof, the trial court erred in failing to grant the motions for nonsuit as to these claims. Such error, however, would not preclude the plaintiffs from proceeding to the jury with their malfunction theory.</p>

Despite this disclaimer, the decision essentially requires a plaintiff to hurdle two summary dispositions, first, a compulsory nonsuit at the close of the plaintiff’s case-in-chief and, second, a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence. We believe that if a plaintiff’s malfunction evidence suffices to overcome a compulsory nonsuit, then the evidence presented by the defense to establish reasonable, secondary causation constitutes an issue to be resolved by the jury.</p>

The majority, in what could be said to be a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>approach, holds that so long as the plaintiff presents a case-in-chief free of secondary causes which justify an inference of defect in the product, the case may be sent to the jury on the “malfunction theory” regardless of whether evidence is admitted negating the very essence of the theory. In my view, sending the malfunction case to the jury without first allowing the defendant to move for a ruling on whether, as a matter of law, the defendant’s evidence of secondary causation negates the plaintiff’s claim of malfunction is error. Not providing for a legal determination of whether the plaintiff negated defendant’s evidence of secondary causes (a legal requirement of stating a malfunction case) before sending the malfunction claim to the jury deprives the defendant of his right to <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>challenge whether the plaintiff has even stated a cause of action.</p>

Once the plaintiff has established this, he has stated a prima facie case and his evidence will withstand a motion for non-suit.</p>
    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.6",270,[232,819,1155,579]]]'>The defendant, however, may put in evidence that the malfunction was caused by secondary causes separate and apart from any alleged defect in the product. If the defendant produces such evidence, the plaintiff then must negate it, <em>for the survival of his cause of action depends upon his establishing that nothing outside of the product itself caused the malfunction, </em>since if a “secondary cause” created the malfunction, the product itself was not defective and the products liability claim would fail. In other words, a malfunction-theory plaintiff must negate evidence that secondary causes were responsible for the malfunction.</p>

It is my view that the problem of determining whether a malfunction-theory plaintiff has negated secondary causes is analogous to deciding whether to grant a motion for a directed verdict; in both cases the proper inquiry for the court is whether the plaintiff put on evidence which, if believed, negates the claim made on the other side, here that there is evidence of secondary causes of the malfunction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
