Public Utility Commission, </em><a href="/pa-commw/116/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="116 Pa. Commw. 512" data-case-ids="1372457" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/116/0512-01">116 Pa.

The PUC order was issued on January 5, 1987 authorizing Apollo Gas Company (Apollo), appellant herein, to provide natural gas service to an Eljer Plumbingware (Eljer) manufacturing plant in Ford City, Pennsylvania. The Peoples Natural Gas Company (Peoples) claims that Apollo lacks authority under its certificate of public convenience to provide gas service to Eljer.</p>
    <p id="b456-6" data-blocks='[["BL_456.7",456,[239,1065,1148,571]]]'>Peoples sells natural gas in Ford City and surrounding areas. It has been engaged in that pursuit since 1938, when a certificate of public convenience authorizing it to sell gas in those areas was issued. Another company with gas service rights in the same region was PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG). In 1971, PPG agreed to sell its natural gas wells and pipelines to Apollo, contingent upon Apollo’s agreement to supply the gas needs of PPG’s manufacturing plant in Ford City as well as the needs of a PPG plant and a Columbia Cement Company plant in Creighton, Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b456-7" data-blocks='[["BL_456.8",456,[236,1668,1147,680]]]'>As a condition of the sale, Apollo was required to furnish documentary evidence of its right to provide the gas service in question. Accordingly, Apollo filed with the PUC an application for a certificate of public convenience. The application stated that Apollo did not currently furnish service in Ford City and that approval from the PUC was required in order to fulfill the condition upon which PPG was willing to sell its gas facilities. The application also stated that the approval being sought was limited to the right to furnish gas to the aforementioned plants and not to the general public. In response, on April 5, 1971, the PUC issued a certificate of public convenience which provided as follows:</p>
    <p id="b457-4" data-blocks='[["BL_457.4",457,[284,307,1105,415]]]'>

    <p id="b457-7" data-blocks='[["BL_457.7",457,[243,1018,1147,567]]]'>In 1985, Apollo agreed to provide gas service to Eljer in Ford City. Eljer then constructed a gas line to connect to Apollo’s pipeline there. Peoples filed a complaint with the PUC and subsequently obtained a preliminary injunction preventing Apollo from furnishing gas service to Eljer pending adjudication of the complaint. Peoples had been supplying gas to Eljer, and was aggrieved by the potential loss of its customer. Peoples claimed that Apollo’s certificate of public convenience, supra, would be violated if Apollo were permitted to provide the gas service in question.</p>
    <p id="b457-8" data-blocks='[["BL_457.8",457,[243,1610,1148,742]]]'>A PUC ruling upon Peoples’ complaint ensued. The PUC interpreted Apollo’s certificate of public convenience as allowing Apollo to provide service to Eljer. The certificate was construed as allowing any number of additional customers to be supplied by Apollo, without prior approval by the PUC, so long as Apollo did not hold itself out to the general public as ready and willing to supply any and all consumers who desire service. An appeal was taken to the Commonwealth Court, whereupon the PUC’s order was reversed. <em>Peoples Natural Gas Co. v. Public Utility Commission, </em><a href="/pa-commw/116/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="116 Pa.

      <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>It is well settled that the scope of judicial review in PUC cases is quite limited. In the absence of an error of law or violation of constitutional rights, an order of the PUC must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Barasch v. Public Utility Commission, </em><a href="/pa/507/0561-02" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="507 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1792346,1792373" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0561-02,/pa/507/0561-01">507 Pa. 561</a>, 566, <a href="/pa/507/0561-02" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="493 A.2d 653" data-case-ids="1792346" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0561-02">493 A.2d 653</a>, 655 (1985); <em>Monessen Southwestern Railway Co. v. Public Utility Commission, </em><a href="/pa/507/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="507 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1792369" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0586-01">507 Pa. 586</a>, 589-90, <a href="/pa/507/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="507 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1792369" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0586-01">493 A.2d 666</a>, 668 (1985). It cannot be said, however, that the PUC’s interpretation of Apollo’s certificate was supported by substantial evidence. The interpretation was, indeed, patently erroneous. There is simply no rational way in which the certificate can be read as allowing Apollo to provide service to Eljer. Certainly, much deference is to be accorded an agency’s interpretations of its own regulations and orders. See generally <em>Commonwealth v. Beck Electric Construction, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/485/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="485 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="1755579" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0604-01">485 Pa. 604</a>, 614, <a href="/pa/485/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="485 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="1755579" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0604-01">403 A.2d 553</a>, 558 (1979). In particular, where the interpretation of a certificate of public convenience issued by the PUC is at issue, it has been held that courts “will not set aside a construction placed upon the certificate by the commission unless the result is clearly erroneous, arbitrary, and unsupported by the evidence.” <em>Marmer v.

The certificate also provided that Apollo could not expand its <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>operations to serve the “general public” without first obtaining PUC approval. By construing the certificate as allowing Apollo to serve the Eljer plant without prior approval, the PUC committed a clear abuse of its discretion. The express and plain language of the certificate was ignored by the PUC. Indeed, the PUC decision did not even address the effect of the words “confine and restrict.” <em>It is impossible to conclude that, if Apollo provides service to Eljer, it will be “confining and restricting” its service to the three plants named in the certificate.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b459-5" data-blocks='[["BL_459.5",459,[235,848,1147,630]]]'>It has been asserted that allowing Apollo to serve additional customers would also violate the certificate’s ban on serving the “general public.” Arguably, under the PUC’s interpretation of the certificate's language, service could further be extended to individual members of the public, without limitation, until the entire public is being served. This could render the certificate a nullity, for it plainly prohibits service to the general public. We need not address this argument, however, for the decision in this case is governed by the certificate’s requirement that Apollo “confine and restrict” its operations by serving only the designated plants.</p>
    <p id="b459-6" data-blocks='[["BL_459.6",459,[235,1499,1148,680]]]'>Consideration of the context in which the certificate was issued further supports our conclusion that the plain language of the certificate was ignored by the PUC. Apollo, in its application for the certificate, requested permission to serve <em>only </em>the three plants designated in the application, and, further, expressly stated that it was <em>not </em>seeking permission to serve the general public. The application also stated that Peoples, which furnished gas service to the public in Ford City, did not oppose Apollo’s application in view of the <em>limited </em>authority being sought. The express language of the certificate demonstrates that the PUC granted only the very limited authority that Apollo requested.</p>

Notwithstanding, it is clear that Apollo is bound by the terms of its certificate. Section 316 of the Public Utility Code provides:</p>

    <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.7",460,[249,907,1146,304]]]'>Further, if Apollo believed that the certificate improperly restricted its service rights, it should have promptly sought review of the limitations set forth therein.
