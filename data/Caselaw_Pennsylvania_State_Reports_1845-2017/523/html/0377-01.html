The issues presented are whether the enforcement proceeding under the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court was proper, and whether the amnesty provisions of. Act 41 of 1988 bar collection of the improperly paid insurance premiums.</p>
    <p id="b462-10" data-blocks='[["BL_462.9",462,[230,1305,1151,1039]],["BL_463.1",463,[223,319,1146,200]]]'>The controversy arose as follows. Mr. Fee was a longtime supervisor of Union Township who was directed, in January, 1982, to complete a form for hospitalization insurance coverage to be paid for by the township. After he did so, the township paid the premiums on the policy from January, 1982 through January, 1985, in the amount of $3,156.34. Acting on a complaint by an undisclosed informant, the State Ethics Commission investigated the payments. On May 2, 1986, in a letter styled “Order No. 476,” the commission informed Mr. Fee that the payments violated the State Ethics Act and that he was obligated to repay $3,156.34 to the township. The commission expressed the opinion that there was no intentional violation of the law, so the commission merely sought repayment of the benefit received in good faith but would not seek criminal prosecution under § 409(a) of the State Ethics Act nor treble damages under § 409(c), 65 P.S. § 409(a) and (c). The letter informed Mr. Fee that he could request reconsideration or challenge factual findings of the commission. Mr. Fee requested reconsideration, and on November 25, 1986, the <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>commission wrote another letter, called “Order No. R-476,” which essentially repeated its prior communication. Mr. Fee did not appeal the commission’s order, nor did he repay the insurance premiums.</p>
    <p id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[224,535,1146,616]]]'>On August 17, 1987, the Deputy Attorney General commenced an enforcement proceeding in Commonwealth Court, seeking, inter alia, a money judgment against Mr. Fee in favor of Union Township. On September 29, 1987, a senior judge of Commonwealth Court held an informal discussion at which the Deputy Attorney General appeared and appellant, unrepresented by counsel, appeared with two relatives. No witnesses were sworn and no testimony was offered. The court granted Mr. Fee an extension of time to enable him to obtain counsel to file pleadings in opposition to the Commonwealth’s complaint, which he did on November 13, 1987.</p>
    <p id="b463-6" data-blocks='[["BL_463.6",463,[224,1169,1147,513]]]'>On December 1, 1987, Commonwealth Court entered judgment against Mr. Fee in the amount of $3,156.34 in favor of Union Township, and rejected the claim for treble damages. The judgment was entered before the pleadings were closed and despite the fact that no trial or evidentiary hearing had been held by the Ethics Commission or Commonwealth Court, and no factual record on such matters had been made in or certified to Commonwealth Court. Mr. Fee filed a timely application to open or vacate the judgment as well as an appeal to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b463-7" data-blocks='[["BL_463.7",463,[223,1699,1147,668]]]'>While appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal was pending in this Court, a panel of Commonwealth Court heard oral argument on appellant’s application to open or vacate judgment. On the same day, March 21, 1988, the general assembly passed Act No. 41 of 1988, 53 P.S. § 65515, granting amnesty to second-class township supervisors who received insurance benefits between January 1, 1959 and March 31, 1985. The enactment of Act 41 was called to the attention of the Commonwealth Court panel in a post-submission communication. On May 13, 1988, the Commonwealth Court panel denied appellant’s application to open or vacate judgment, and this Court subsequently granted allowance of this appeal.</p>

    <p id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[222,530,1147,612]]]'>Despite a long-standing practice of providing insurance coverage for elected local officials, the State Ethics Commission and Commonwealth Court, in a series of decisions, ruled that such insurance could be provided only to employee supervisors, and then only with the approval of the townships’ auditors. <em>See, e.g., McCutcheon v. State Ethics Commission, </em>77 Pa.Cmwlth. 529, <a href="/citations/?q=466%20A.2d%20283" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="466 A.2d 283">466 A.2d 283</a> (1983). The general assembly remedied the effect of such rulings on supervisors who had accepted the benefits of group insurance policies in good faith by enacting Act 41 of 1988, providing amnesty to supervisors who received insurance coverage between January 1, 1959 and March 31, 1985.</p>

The Act states: “No penalty, assessment, surcharge, forfeiture or disciplinary action of any kind may occur as a result of participation by non-employe supervisors.” 53 P.S. § 65515(c)(2). The language appears to be plain enough and not to require any convoluted efforts of interpretation. As to the retrospective application of the statute, it must apply retroactively or not at all. It was enacted in 1988 to cover the period 1959 to 1985, and the clear intent of the legislature is that it be applied retroactively; any other application would entail the absurd conclusion that the legislature intended a nullity.</p>

I write separately, however, to resolve the critical issues which the majority fails to address, i.e., 1) whether the State Ethics Commission (Commission) had the authority to impose an enforceable money judgment against appellant, James Fee; and 2) whether the Commission’s letter of November 25, 1986, was a valid adjudication, and, was thus immune from collateral attack during the subsequent enforcement proceedings.
