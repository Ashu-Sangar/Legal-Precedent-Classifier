This is a direct appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court, under its original jurisdiction, which transferred to the Board of Claims the action filed by appellant herein, Mark S. Keenheel, whereby he sought to rescind or to nullify an agreement entered into with his former employer, the Pennsylvania Securities Commission (“Commission”). The transfer order issued in response to preliminary objections filed by the Commission challenging the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. The Honorable Doris A. Smith viewed the matter as based upon a contract executed between appellant and the Commonwealth and concluded that, pursuant to section 4 of the Board of Claims Act, 72 P.S. § 4651-4 (“section 4”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the appropriate forum to re<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>solve appellant’s complaint in equity was the Board of Claims, hence, the Commonwealth Court lacked jurisdiction. Accordingly, that court transferred the matter pursuant to section 5103 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5103. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that this action is not one arising from a contract action against the Commonwealth as envisioned in section 4, thus we reverse the decision below and remand the matter to the Commonwealth Court for it to reach the merits of the claim submitted.</p>

On June 17, 1987, the Commission terminated appellant’s employment, effective September 1, 1987. In response, appellant filed a petition in the Commonwealth Court alleging that the termination was in retaliation for filing the charges of race discrimination. Negotiations then commenced between appellant and the Commission. On August 27, 1987, shortly before the termination was to occur, the parties entered into the settlement agreement at issue in this case.</p>

It also provided that the Commission would pay appellant the sum of six thousand dollars in satisfaction of “costs and expenses,” and further provided that all personnel records, other than routine data, generated during 1987 pertaining to appellant, would be held by the Commission as non-public records pursuant to the “Right to Know Act,” Act of June 21, 1957, P.L. 390, § 1 <em>et seq., </em>65 P.S. § 66.1 <em>et seq. </em>The agreement further established that information as to these records would not be disclosed publicly, and that, if inquiries were ever made to the Commission regarding the quality of appellant’s job performance, the Commission would state that his performance had been “very good,” inasmuch as this corresponded to appel<a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>lant’s performance evaluation of December, 1986.

    <p id="b311-7" data-blocks='[["BL_311.7",311,[229,873,1147,420]]]'>In <em>Simpson </em>it was clear that the dispute centered upon the validity of a contract. The statutory provision was only relevant insofar as it may or may not have impacted upon that question. Thus in <em>Simpson </em>we rejected Shovel’s characterization of its claim as one premised upon a statutory mandate and identified the claim being asserted as one arising from contract. We held that the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims was properly invoked.</p>
    <p id="b311-8" data-blocks='[["BL_311.8",311,[228,1314,1150,792]]]'>In ruling that the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Claims was invoked in this case, the court below found that the instant action “is based upon a contract.” <em>Keenheel v. Commonwealth, Pennsylvania Securities Exchange Commission, et al., </em>Slip op. at 2, No. 976 (Pa.Commw. July 25, 1988). While it may be true that the contract is the subject of the instant action, it is not the basis for the claim asserted by the appellant against the Commonwealth. Indeed, the instant contract poses an impediment to the claim appellant seeks to assert against an agency of the Commonwealth. This distinction is critical to the instant inquiry. We are not here concerned with a contract claim being asserted against the Commonwealth. To the contrary, appellant has brought the instant action in an effort to avoid any obligation arising from the challenged contract.</p>
    <p id="b311-9" data-blocks='[["BL_311.9",311,[230,2126,1145,204]],["BL_312.1",312,[243,294,1148,734]]]'>The jurisdiction of the Board of Claims is not triggered simply because a contract may be involved in an action, rather the jurisdictional predicate is satisfied only when the claimant relies upon the provisions of that contract in <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>asserting the claim against the Commonwealth. The instant case indeed is the converse of <em>Simpson. </em>In <em>Simpson, </em>although a statutory argument was raised, its purpose was to seek the enforcement of the underlying contract and thus rendered the matter one arising from contract. In contrast, in this instance, the appellant is attempting to nullify the contract which serves as an impediment to the statutory claim that he wishes to assert. The instant action is one in equity to declare the contract a nullity so that appellant would then be free to renew his charges of discrimination against the Commonwealth. While the immediate subject of the controversy focuses on an alleged contract, this is not an action in which appellant is asserting a claim against the Commonwealth under the contract at issue.</p>

The Board of Claims was created to provide a remedy where there would otherwise be none for a party adverse to the Commonwealth. The language of the enabling statute is specific. It vests no reciprocal right in the Commonwealth to avail itself of the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims. Sovereign immunity does not preclude the Commonwealth from pursuing a claim arising from contract in the traditional judicial forum. Thus, where the Commonwealth is seeking to derive the benefits of the contract, the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims is not invoked.</p>
    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[215,988,1150,943]]]'>Notwithstanding, the Commonwealth argues that this matter belongs in the Board of Claims because, if appellant succeeds in rescinding the contract, he will be compelled to return the six. thousand dollars the Commonwealth has paid to him pursuant to the agreement. The Commonwealth insists, therefore, that appellant has lodged “[a claim] against the Commonwealth, arising from [a contract] entered into with the Commonwealth, where the amount in controversy amounts to $300.00 or more.” 72 P.S. § 4651-4. This is pure sophistry. The argument misconstrues the focus of the statute. According to the Commonwealth’s own contention, any monies paid as a result of appellant’s action will necessarily be paid by appellant and not by the Commonwealth. Thus, any action for reimbursement would be available to the Commonwealth, and not to appellant. Under the clear language of section 4, such an action would not be within the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims.</p>
    <p id="b313-5" data-blocks='[["BL_313.6",313,[215,1957,1148,421]],["BL_314.1",314,[243,335,1149,685]]]'>The language of section 4 must be given full effect. Its terms explicitly require that the Board of Claims “... hear and determine all claims against the Commonwealth arising from contracts hereafter entered into with the Commonwealth, where the amount in controversy amounts to $300.00 or more.” Clearly the statute is not applicable to the instant dispute. As stated, appellant is not asserting a contractual claim against the Commonwealth for an amount <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>in excess of $300.00. To the contrary, he is seeking to nullify a contract to relieve himself of any obligations by which he otherwise would be restricted. The rights he asserts do not arise “from the contract,” but from a separate claim he wishes to reinstate. Finally, the six thousand dollars is not an “amount in controversy.” What is in controversy is the validity of the settlement agreement. It is conceded that, if the agreement is a nullity, the six thousand dollars passed thereunder must be returned; nonetheless its return is not the subject of the instant dispute. Because the requirements of the statute have not been met, the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims has not been invoked.</p>

If the remedy at law is inadequate, the matter is properly within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. If the remedy is adequate, and rescission is inappropriate, the matter can then be pursued, if at all, before the Board of Claims.</p>
