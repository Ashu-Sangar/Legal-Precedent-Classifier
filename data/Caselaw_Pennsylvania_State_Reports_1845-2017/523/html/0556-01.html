Upon entering the apartment, James noticed that it was very hot in the apartment and that a foul odor permeated the air. Upon searching, he found the bodies of his sister, niece, and Myndie McKoy, under a mattress in one of the bedrooms. James also noticed that Sharon’s stereo and speakers were missing. Upon viewing this grizzly scene, James and his mother contacted the police, who immediately responded to the call and conducted an investigation.</p>

As part of the search for Appellant, they went to his brother’s home where the police saw the stereo and speakers that James Burley had described as belonging to his sister Sharon. The police obtained a search warrant for these items and returned to Eugene and Irene Marshall’s home and seized the stereo and speakers. Irene admitted that Appellant brought these items into her home and that he sold them to Eugene. Eugene told the police that he found his brother on a corner very near to where the victims lived near their time of death, carrying a knife and that he had blood on his shirt. He also told the police that he harbored Appellant in his home for a few days and knew that Appellant returned to the victims’ apartment following the murders to retrieve some of his belongings and the stereo, which he sold to Eugene. Finally, Eugene <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>told the police that his brother had confided to him that he had, in fact, killed the women.</p>

Myndie McKoy’s corpse also revealed that she had been stabbed in the back, which wound was listed as a contributing factor to her death.</p>

After some preliminary interrogation and the administration of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Appellant decided to waive those rights and give a statement which proved to be a confession.</p>
    <p id="b648-6" data-blocks='[["BL_648.7",648,[217,1258,1147,1104]]]'>Appellant recounted that he and Sharon had been lovers and that when she told him she was to marry another he became enraged. On the day of the murders, he had sex with the twenty year old Sharon, and while she slept, he put a clothes line around her neck and strangled her to death. He then went into Myndie McKoy’s room to tie her up. When she awoke and began to scream, he found a knife and stabbed her in order to quiet her and tied her up. He then dragged her into the bathroom and filled the tub up with water. She pleaded with him to leave her alone and she promised not to tell anyone and again began to scream, and then Appellant plunged Myndie’s head under the water in the tub and held it there until Myndie no longer moved. Having permanently silenced Myndie, he dragged her body into Sharon’s bedroom and laid her corpse next to Sharon. Appellant also admitted that he killed Sharon’s two-year-old baby, Karima, by strangulation and drowning because the baby was awakened by the commotion and called out for her mother. When little Karima was dead, Appellant put her between the bodies of Sharon and Myndie and covered their bodies with a mattress.</p>

He went back to the apartment to retrieve some of his belongings and took the stereo and speakers.

    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[257,707,1147,692]]]'>Taking all of these circumstances together, a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Sharon, Karima and Myndie died as the result of a homicide. From the nature of the injuries, the jury could infer that the killings were intentional and malicious. From the manner of the killings, the jury could conclude that the killings were premeditated and the jury could conclude that Appellant committed the crimes, from his own testimony as well as the circumstantial evidence linking him with the crimes. Accordingly, we are more than satisfied that sufficient evidence exists in this record to support the jury’s verdicts of murder of the first degree and dismiss Appellant’s sufficiency challenge.</p>

The police, however, contradicted Appellant and testified that he was alert and responsive during the interrogation and that Appellant agreed to be interviewed before seeing any photographs. Appellant decided to make his confession after he was shown his brother’s statement in which he told his brother that he had killed the women. After making his statement, Appellant signed each page of the confession and specifically answered that he was making his statement of his own free will, without force or fear, and without threats or promises having been made to him.</p>

Appellant next refers to the prosecutor’s alluding to Jesus Christ in his closing. In speaking about Appellant’s confession, the prosecutor noted that Appellant told the police that he would not have killed his victims, if Sharon hadn’t been the person she was. “She just wanted to use me and take my money.” The prosecutor answered Appellant’s justification for killing three people as follows: “... isn’t this like condemning a rich man for having made it when the robber takes it? Isn’t it like condemning Socrates for his unswerving search for truth or isn’t it like condemning Christ for the act of crucifixion?” Taken in context, this statement is <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>an ironic reply to Appellant’s attempt, in his confession, to shift the blame to the victim for her death. We do not view the prosecutor’s reference to these figures as anything other than rhetoric meant to dispel Appellant’s attempt at self-justification.
