      <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>Appellee, John Hart, was injured while operating a pipe-cleaning machine manufactured by appellant, W.H. Stewart (“Stewart”). Appellee filed suit against Stewart, alleging that the machine was defectively designed and that Stewart had negligently failed to provide proper warnings and instructions. At trial, appellee called as a witness a representative of appellee’s employer to testify in support of appellee’s claim for lost wages. Before calling this witness, appellee’s counsel indicated that he intended to file a motion <em>in limine </em>to prevent appellant from cross-examining the witness about appellee’s receipt of workmen’s compensation benefits because such questions would violate the collateral source rule. Appellant’s counsel argued that he did not want to elicit testimony about workmen’s compensation benefits, but instead intended to show that appellee had received his full salary for the three years from the time of his injury to the time of his removal from the company’s payroll. The trial court ruled that appellant’s objectives were not barred by the collateral source rule and that the desired cross-examination was permissible. The jury subsequently returned a verdict in favor of appellant on the issue of liability and never reached the issue of damages. Post trial motions were denied.</p>

The Superior Court ruled that even though the record did not indicate whether the witness had actually been called and/or cross-examined, it was reasonable to infer from the attorney’s comments at sidebar that the objectionable testimony had been allowed, and that this evidence was of the type barred by the collateral source rule. Concluding that the introduction of this evidence may have substantially prejudiced the jury with respect to the issue of liability, the Superior Court reversed the trial court and granted a new trial on both the liability and damages issues.</p>

We agree with this contention, and for this reason we now reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>

The speciousness of this argument is readily apparent. Before the issue of damages is relevant, the jury must first determine the question of liability. Appellees are implicitly urging that, if the jury had not been aware of this source of income following the injury, the jury may have been persuaded to overlook appellees’ inability to establish liability. Such a verdict had it been entered could not have been sustained. The magnitude of the injury sustained may never be permitted to overcome a plaintiff’s failure to establish a defendant’s liability.

      <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>The majority accepts the Superior Court’s characterization of the issue in this case as whether the trial court’s ruling allowing defense cross-examination of plaintiffs’ witness on “collateral sources” prejudiced the plaintiffs’ case. Both Superior Court and the majority of this Court acknowledge that the record is inadequate to show whether plaintiffs actually called the witness and, if so, whether cross-examination of said witness about “collateral sources” actually took place. Nevertheless, the Superior Court <em>assumed </em>that said witness testified and <em>assumed </em>that such cross-examination probably took place.</p>
    <p id="b102-4" data-blocks='[["BL_102.5",102,[235,938,1150,737]]]'>In my opinion, such an assumption has no place in appellate review and it was error for Superior Court to (1) make that assumption, and (2) use the assumed facts as the predicate for its decision to reverse the trial court. The majority perpetuates the error of that unwarranted assumption. It was the obligation of the plaintiffs, as appellants in Superior Court, to ensure that the record on review would be adequate to permit meaningful scrutiny. Mechanisms exist for reconstruction of a record where, as here, a critical gap appears. Pa.R.A.P. 1923 and 1924. The lacuna in the record should be held against plaintiffs-appellees herein who failed to place upon and preserve for the record sufficient data to support its position and convince a reviewing court that the trial court’s decision was erroneous.</p>

The briefs on appeal, the trial court’s opinion denying the post-trial motions and the reproduced portions of the transcript of the in-chambers discussion of plaintiffs’ motion in limine indicate to me that plaintiffs’ witness did not in fact, testify as to the plaintiff-husband’s “lost wages.” The trial court actually ruled that there were no lost wages for the three year period for which the plaintiff-husband’s salary was paid. Accordingly, it is <em>doubtful </em>that defendant would have cross-examined that witness on “collateral sources” of payments of lost wages <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>since there was <em>probably </em>no evidence of wages lost for that period.</p>

While the cases cited by the majority<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> to support that proposition did find the erroneous evidentiary rulings to be harmless in those cases, they do not support the blanket proposition that erroneous evidentiary rulings on damages are always harmless where the jury finds for the defendant on liability. To the contrary, this Court has recognized that, in some cases, a jury’s verdict on the liability issue may well have been undermined by an erroneous admission of evidence pertaining to damages, such as evidence of payments from “collateral sources.” <em>See, e.g.: Lengle v.
