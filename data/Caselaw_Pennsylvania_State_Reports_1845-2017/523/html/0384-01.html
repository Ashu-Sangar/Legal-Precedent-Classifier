O’Shea, the appellant, of robbery and of murder of the first degree for the machete killing of Herbert Kleber and the robbery of the <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>store in which Mr. Kleber was working when the murder took place. The following day, that same jury sentenced appellant to death following a hearing conducted pursuant to the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711. Post-trial motions were denied on December 5, 1986 by the presiding judge, the Honorable Robert P. Horgas. On February 2, 1987, Judge Horgas denied appellant’s supplemental post-trial motions, and formally sentenced appellant to death in accordance with the verdict of the jury. A concurrent sentence of ten to twenty years imprisonment was imposed on the robbery conviction. This direct appeal automatically followed. 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9711(h)(1) and 722(4); Pa.R.A.P.

In the early morning hours of November 22, 1985, City of Pittsburgh police officers found the body of Herbert Kleber in the rear of the Liberty Avenue News, where the victim was employed as a clerk. His body was in a freight elevator in the rear of the store, lying face down and his hands were handcuffed to the metal grate door of the elevator about six inches off the ground. Forensic evidence established that the cause of death was multiple deep wounds to the shoulders, neck and head that had been inflicted by a heavy and large knife, consistent with wounds that would be inflicted by a machete.</p>
    <p id="b473-6" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[208,1784,1147,587]]]'>One of the owners of the Liberty Avenue News had just stocked the shelves the preceding day with the victim’s assistance, and thus the owner was able to inform the police of numerous items that he knew to be missing from the store. These items included one of two machetes, knives, numerous inexpensive gold chains, about fifty butane lighters, martial arts throwing stars, other jewelry, cigarettes, and cash that had been in the cash register and in an envelope containing proceeds from the sale of lottery tickets. Also missing from the store was a light gray athletic type bag that had been left in the rear of the store.</p>

Appellant had been living with his brother and sister-in-law, James and Marion O’Shea, and their daughter Eileen in Shaler Township. When these detectives arrived at the O’Shea residence later that day, appellant was not there. After identifying themselves and explaining that they wanted to question appellant, the detectives were given permission to enter the house by the owners, James and Marion O’Shea. The O’Sheas took the detectives to the family gameroom in the basement which is where appellant slept. In this room, the detectives viewed a large hunting knife and a plastic bag containing several gold chains, which were identical to items stolen from Liberty Avenue News. The O’Sheas had never seen these items previously. Additionally, in a laundry room adjacent to the game room, Mrs. O’Shea discovered a gray athletic bag that she had never seen before (which turned out to be <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>the bag taken from the store) and turned it over to the detectives.</p>

He knew about the homicide/robbery and suspected the detectives were there to question him. Appellant became somewhat agitated and told the detectives that he did not want to involve his family, and he requested that he go downtown with them. Appellant voluntarily accompanied the detectives to the Pittsburgh Public Safety Building.</p>

Arriving at the Public Safety Building, appellant was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and he executed a written waiver of said rights. After giving two contradictory statements about his activities the previous evening, appellant confessed to the murder of Herbert Kleber and the robbery of the Liberty Avenue News.</p>

On July 11, 1986, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree and of robbery. The bifurcated sentencing proceeding required by the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711, was then conducted. The Commonwealth offered only one aggravating circumstance in support of the death penalty, namely that appellant had committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony, i.e. the robbery. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(6). The defense presented psychiatric and other evidence of mitigating circumstances suggesting that appellant was, at the time of the murder, under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance and that he was incapable of appreciating the criminality of his conduct or of conforming his conduct to the law. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(2) and (3). The defense also presented as other “evidence of mitigation concerning the character” of the accused, that he had been sodomized as a young boy of 6-8 years and that he had been deeply affected by his mother’s death when he was 16 years of age. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(8).</p>

The exceptions are not narrowly confined, as appellant suggests, but instead cover a wide range of situations wherein the evidence is not offered solely to portray the accused as a bad actor, but for some other legitimate purpose where the probative value of the evidence outweighs the potential prejudice to the accused. <em><a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">Id.</a></em>
