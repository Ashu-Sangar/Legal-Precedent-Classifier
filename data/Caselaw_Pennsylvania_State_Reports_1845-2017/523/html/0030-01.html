When he took a shot at the basket, the ball ricocheted off of the backboard, rolled to the end of the street and through a chain link fence, which stretched to the adjacent McFerran Street, and down an embankment toward the railroad tracks. Edward climbed through a hole in the fence and down the embankment to recover the ball. He then walked back up the embankment and threw the ball under the fence. Instead of returning to the basketball game, Edward, who heard a train approaching, went back down the embankment to the railroad tracks, which were readily accessible by various other routes. He then, as he had done before, hopped a freight train owned by the Reading Railroad Company. After travelling a short distance he tried to hop off the train; however, his pant leg got caught. In the process of trying to loosen it, he slipped and fell under the wheels of the train. Both of Edward’s legs were severed just below his knees.</p>

This finding was based on the fact that the City’s post-trial brief addressed only the issue of the existence of a causal connection between Edward’s injuries and the City’s breach of some unspecified duty. The City’s failure to brief the critical duty issue at the close of proceedings, Superior Court concluded, deprived the trial court of both the need and opportunity to address the merits of the City’s contention that the Scarboroughs failed to establish a legally cognizable cause of action because, as a matter of law, the City owed no duty to Edward Scarborough. <em>Scarborough v.

Examination of the City’s post-trial brief reveals that the introduction section sets out at length the City’s position that it owed no duty to Edward Scarborough and therefore could not be found negligent. This argument was implicitly incorporated into the question presented for review because, in describing the claim of negligence, the term that was used was <em>alleged negligence, </em>an element of which is duty.</p>

After both parties rested, the City moved for a <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>directed verdict, which was also denied. The City once again addressed the issue of duty when it submitted points for charge which provided that the City owed no duty to repair defective conditions maintained on property not owned by the City or to protect citizens from dangerous activities conducted on private property owned by others.
