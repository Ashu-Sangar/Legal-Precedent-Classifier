On May 31, 1983, appellant, Robert Marconi, was arrested and charged with possessing prohibited offensive weapons (18 <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>Pa.C.S.A. § 908); receiving stolen property (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3925); causing or risking catastrophe (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3302); recklessly endangering another person (18 Pa.C.

After the prosecution and defense had rested, but before the case proceeded to closing arguments, the jury panel was reduced to eleven members due to the twelfth juror’s excuse for cause. Appellant elected not to continue with this jury configuration and, on October 21, 1983, the trial court declared a mistrial for reasons of manifest necessity.</p>

This motion was denied on December 9, 1983, and appellant immediately filed a notice of appeal to Superior Court. On March 22, 1985, Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s order denying appellant’s motion to dismiss on grounds of double jeopardy, and on April 22, 1985, the record was remanded to the trial court which then rescheduled trial for May 13, 1985.</p>

On July 2, 1985, appellant again requested a continuance, which was granted, and the trial was rescheduled for October 18, 1985. Appellant filed a waiver of Rule 1100 at this time for the period from July 2, 1985 to October 18, 1985. On July 5, 1985, the Commonwealth filed an application for the extension of time, requesting that trial commence no later than November 5, 1985. A hearing was <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>scheduled on the Commonwealth’s petition for September 9, 1985; however, on August 26, 1985, appellant filed a petition for allowance of appeal nunc pro tunc to this Court from the order of Superior Court of March 22, 1985, which order had affirmed the trial court’s denial of appellant's double jeopardy claim.</p>

Ultimately, by order dated November 26, 1986, this Court denied appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal. This order was filed on December 11, 1986, and the record was remanded to the trial court on that date.</p>

On January 20, 1987, appellant filed a motion for dismissal of all aforementioned charges pursuant to Rule 1100. The trial court granted appellant’s motion on the basis of Superior Court’s holding in <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court determined that 142 includable days had elapsed from the date on which the trial court had declared a mistrial to the date finally scheduled for trial after remand from this Court. Thus, as more than 120 days had elapsed, the trial court dismissed the charges against appellant.</p>

The problem herein is that the trial court, following <em>Paprocki, <a href="/pa-super/327/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="327 Pa.

The trial court’s math was correct; however, the trial court should have started counting the Rule 1100 120-day limitation period for retrial <em>after </em>all of the appeals had been resolved. Because the retrial in this case was scheduled to commence 40 days after we remanded the record, there was no violation of Rule 1100 herein.</p>

Rule 1100 requires that every time an appeal is filed, the 120-day limitation period starts anew from the date the record is remanded from the appellate court. It is obvious that when a matter is on appeal, the case cannot be retried. To compute the limitation period as the trial court computed it in this case would allow defendants to manipulate the filings of their motions and appeals in such a manner that they could mathematically ensure that 120 days had lapsed and thus escape retrial. Obvious<a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>ly, this type of legal gymnastics will not be countenanced by this Court.</p>
