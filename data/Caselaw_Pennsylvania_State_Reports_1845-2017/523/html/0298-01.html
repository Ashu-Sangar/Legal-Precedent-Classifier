We granted the Appellant’s Petition for allowance of appeal because we were concerned that insufficient evidence had been presented to sustain the conviction for attempted burglary. After reviewing the record in light of the existing case law, we are convinced that the conviction for attempt to commit burglary cannot stand, and would therefore reverse.</p>

Suddenly her dog began barking, which caused Mrs. Smith to turn on the spotlights in front of the garage. Not seeing anyone outside, Mrs. Smith went back to the kitchen to continue preparing dinner. Several minutes after returning to the kitchen, Mrs. Smith heard the sound of a window breaking, which she believed came from the direction of the living room. Fearing for her safety, Mrs. Smith activated a silent alarm. She then looked out a kitchen window to determine whether it was safe to go outside should an intruder be in her house. Looking out the window, Mrs. Smith observed a man, fitting the description of the Appellant, on the driveway heading toward her garage. When she observed the man outside, Mrs. Smith ran upstairs, locked herself in her bedroom and telephoned the police to see if they had been notified of the alarm. Looking out the bedroom window, Mrs. Smith observed the same man walking outside, below this bedroom window. She remained in her bedroom until the police arrived at the house.</p>

At that time, the Appellant was standing at the bottom of the Smith driveway where it meets with College Avenue. He was carrying an umbrella and appeared to be -hitch-hiking. In response to the police officers’ request, the Petitioner identified himself and gave his address. After talking with Mrs. Smith and comparing her description of the intruder with the Appellant, the officers placed the Appellant under arrest. Appellant was driven to the house where Mrs. Smith identified him as the intruder.</p>

When intercepted by the police, the Appellant was observed hitch-hiking and continued to do so until stopped by the police.
