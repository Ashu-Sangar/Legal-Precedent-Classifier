On the morning of October 29, Richard Brode went to the marital residence to remove some items of personal property. While there, he asked his wife, as he had repeatedly done over the previous weeks, about coming home. Carole Brode told him that the marriage was over. Richard Brode then left the house and opened the trunk of his car. In the trunk was a shotgun and a box of shells that he had purchased the night before. He removed the gun from the box, assembled it, and put some shells in his pocket. He then returned to the house, loading the gun as he walked up the steps to the second floor, where his wife was in a bedroom. The two argued as Carole Brode tried to convince him to call his mother for help. Richard Brode then shot his wife once in the abdomen and once in the right elbow, reloaded, and shot two more times, hitting her in the chest.</p>
    <p id="b107-6" data-blocks='[["BL_107.6",107,[218,1612,1149,740]]]'>Brode’s defense sought to refute the inferences of planning and premeditation, and to establish his incapacity to form the specific intent to kill his wife. Brode testified that he had bought the shotgun as a gift for his son, to replace one he had been given that was too long and unwieldy. He explained that he had already drank four to six double shots of whiskey that morning before he went to retrieve a video cassette recorder and stereo from his wife’s house. After being rebuffed in his request to return home, he was preparing to leave with the items he had gone to the house for. When he opened the trunk of his car, however, he saw the gun, and, in his words, “I don’t know if I could take this anymore — I thought to myself.” He then returned to the house, and after arguing with his wife shot and killed her.</p>

The psychiatrist described in detail how, in his opinion, the anger and hostility associated with Brode’s compulsive personality disorder overrode his judgment and ability to form a specific intent; how Brode’s adjustment disorder with depression, resulting from the perceived lack of support upon leaving the rehabilitation center, affected his judgment and led to his resumption of drinking; and how Brode’s alcohol consumption that day interfered with his cognitive abilities, noting especially that Brode’s high tolerance for alcohol, developed during his years of alcohol dependence, was reduced because of his recent period of detoxification.</p>

    <p id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[233,740,1147,522]]]'>Although Brode claims that <em>Plank </em>is distinguishable in that Plank’s illness was traced to “chronic abuse of alcohol” while Brode’s psychiatrist labeled him “alcohol dependent”, this distinction is untenable. Whatever terminology may have been used, it is clear that Superior Court understood Plank to be offering a “defense based upon a purported ungovernable impulse to drink,” precisely the claim now made by Brode. We find the court’s rationale in <em>Plank </em>rejecting such a defense to be sound, and the appellant offers no reasons why we should hold to the contrary.</p>
    <p id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.6",110,[226,1281,1151,949]]]'>Moreover, it is not to be overlooked that Brode’s own expert never offered the opinion that Brode was unable to voluntarily refrain from drinking. It is true that he gave a general description of the power of the urge felt by those dependent on alcohol. This testimony, however, was offered at trial, when the purpose of the psychiatrist’s testimony was to establish Brode’s incapacity to form the specific intent necessary for first degree murder; the Commonwealth’s objection to the testimony was sustained. Nowhere in the offer of proof as to the insanity defense was it claimed that Brode was unable to resist the urge to drink, either generally or on the morning of the killing. This is asserted entirely by way of argument. Having reviewed the transcript of the expert’s proposed testimony, we are satisfied that the court correctly found that the offer did not properly raise an insanity defense. The evidence was thus properly excluded. There being no other claim of trial error, the jury’s verdict of first degree murder will stand.</p>

He also argues that the sentence was disproportionate and excessive, that it was the product of passion, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the only aggravating circumstance found by the jury. Because we agree that the evidence does not support the finding that the offense was committed by means of torture, requiring that the sentence be vacated and the case remanded for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, we need not address the appellant’s other arguments.</p>

A pornographic magazine found in the trunk of the appellant’s car was introduced as evidence as well. According to the prosecutor, the photographs demonstrated that the shots were deliberately placed. Although no reason was offered why the appellant would have aimed to shoot the victim in the elbow, the prosecutor did suggest that the shot to the abdomen reflected the appellant’s sexual frustration, as evidenced by his possession of the pornographic magazine.</p>
    <p id="b111-6" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[227,1480,1147,404]]]'>The prosecutor also referred to the coroner’s testimony during the trial that the shots to the elbow and abdomen preceded the fatal shots to the chest. He argued that the victim must have experienced considerable pain from these two shots before the shots to the chest caused instantaneous death.

Accordingly, those who drink, or use drugs are not excused under section 308 simply because they have done so under impulse or self-induced need. The General Assembly has excluded intoxicated and drug induced conditions from the parameters of section 315 by clearly defining the circumstances under which they can be raised in section 308. The majority establishes a dangerous precedent by failing to clearly identify the appellant’s defense for what it is, futile and frivolous. Otherwise, I join the majority opinion.</p>
