Initially, appellant had his victim sit on his lap fully clothed and he would fondle her breasts and genital area. This contact progressed to where appellant, on a number of occasions, undressed the child and performed oral sex on her. In one instance, appellant displayed a pornographic movie to her at home. He then removed her clothing and rubbed his hand in and around her vagina. During this incident, appellant requested her to imitate the actors in the movie by performing oral sex upon him. His fixation with oral sex lead him on one occasion to apply icing and jelly to his penis so his daughter would lick it off with her tongue. The child was forced to bathe appellant and at the same time straddle him while he simulated sexual intercourse with her. Finally, on two occasions appellant performed anal intercourse on his daughter. On one occasion he instructed her to place a towel in her mouth to muffle her screams; on the other he inserted into her rectum the tip of a tube of ointment commonly used to soothe teething infants to induce numbing in preparation for his assault.</p>

There is no gender distinction between them. The distinctions are traditional but not definitional. The act of rape can be committed by penetration however slight by penis or by mouth by either sex upon either sex. A male can rape a female by his penetration of any of the victim’s orifices; a male can rape another male in the same fashion; and, similarly, a female can rape another female or male as well.

The Commonwealth is free to charge under Rape or Deviate Sexual Intercourse. Both are felonies of the first degree. Charges are filed per assault per orifice.

According to the drafters of the Model Penal Code, this statute was drafted in gender-neutral terms, despite the continued use of the word “he”, and applies to sexual imposition by one male upon another or by one female upon another. Involuntary deviate sexual intercourse encompasses situations concerning homosexual assaults and assaults with bodily parts other than a penis, <em>ie., </em>tongue and appendages. The offense also applies to heterosexual assaults per os or per anus with a penis or other bodily part. It does not include vaginal penetration by the male penis as does rape.

      <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>However, I cannot concur with the majority’s statement, “This provision [involuntary deviate sexual intercourse] is equally clear, the gravamen is the same as the crime of rape, <em>i.e., </em>forcible sexual penetration of a person by another, the difference is that the crime is not confined to gender or to human beings.” At 1161. Involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, while containing essentially the same elements of rape, does not punish the same societal concerns as rape. The present definitions perpetuate the traditional distinction between sodomy and rape. Rape seeks to punish the violent and non-consensual element of an act of sexual intercourse. In contrast, the deviate sexual intercourse statutes, as was the case in the common law crime of sodomy, are directed to punish those sexual acts which society finds repugnant. Therefore, an assailant may be charged with rape, for the assaultive nature of the offense, and with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, for the nature of the act itself. The nonconsensual element of deviate sexual intercourse merely exacerbates the offense. 18 Pa.C.S. § 3123. Under my view there would be no merger of these offenses.' However, I find it difficult to understand how the majority could reach the position of no merger and embrace the premise that involuntary deviate sexual intercourse possesses the same gravamen as the crime of rape.</p>
