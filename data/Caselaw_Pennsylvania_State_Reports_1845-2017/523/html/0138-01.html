The Superior Court vacated the sentence imposed by the trial court and remanded the cause for resentencing. <a href="/citations/?q=367%20Pa.%20Super.%20648" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="367 Pa.

The Commonwealth sought review of the Superior Court’s decision by filing a petition for allowance of appeal to this Court. On February 17, 1988, this Court granted the Commonwealth’s request. Thereafter on March 29, 1988, petitioner filed a motion to quash the appeal. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the request to quash the appeal was appropriately lodged. We therefore enter an order quashing this appeal and rendering moot the arguments presented by the parties relating to the issues raised by the decision of the Superior Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The numerous incidents giving rise to these charges occurred over a six-month period in 1984 and involved 14 male children ranging in age from 4 to 14 years. The minors engaged in oral sex with each other as well as with petitioner. Occasionally petitioner photographed some of these encounters. At the time of these incidents petitioner was 38 years of age and had no other criminal record.

In this case there is no question as to the legality of the sentence imposed. The issue centers upon the appropriateness of the trial court’s exercise of discretion. One of the most important functions performed by a trial judge is the fashioning of the sanction to be imposed for those who are convicted of violating our laws.

The goal to be achieved in the sentencing decision must accommodate a number of different objectives. The trial court is required to be fair to the offender but at the same time protect society and vindicate the victim. The sentencing decision focuses on the well-recognized concerns for deterrence, retribution, and rehabilitation. In dealing with such an equation, reasonable men can obviously differ and thus the law has seized upon the wise decision to give great deference to the trial judge’s decision in this area.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The various episodes of depravity involved sodomy, masturbation, showing and using sexual aids, showing and using pornographic films, involuntary sexual acts, videotaping of the appellee performing sexual acts with the young boys and the videotaping of the youngsters performing sexual acts with one another. The maximum sentence that could have been imposed for the multiple counts to which the appellee pleaded guilty was 710 years of imprisonment.

At the sentencing hearing the trial judge observed that he was cognizant and recognized the psychological and psychiatric disturbances testified to by Dr. Rotenberg, appellee’s expert witness. (Rec., pps 124-27 &amp; 131) Dr. Rotenberg testified, inter alia, that the appellee was a pedophile; that he had difficulty dealing with his own feelings in relation to others, but he was not psychotic, nor was he out of touch with reality; that at the time of the incidents in question his sexual urges were out of control; and that he was possessed of a long-term personality disorder involving a lifestyle in which he had poor relations with others. Additionally, the trial judge <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>considered a letter written by Dr. Caggione, one of the appellee’s physicians in New York and letters from counselors, and a church written on behalf of the appellee and accepted into evidence at the sentencing hearing. After considering all of this information presented by the appellee pertaining to his background, physical, mental and emotional condition, and his rehabilitative needs, along with the nature of the crimes and the needs of society, the trial judge determined that a sentence of imprisonment for a term of 50 to 100 years was appropriate.
