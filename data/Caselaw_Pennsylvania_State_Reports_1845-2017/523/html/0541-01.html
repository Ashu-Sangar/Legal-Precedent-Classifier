    <p id="b626-17" data-blocks='[["BL_626.16",626,[231,1934,1148,410]]]'>This is an appeal from an order of the Superior Court which reversed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The latter order denied appellee’s petition to confirm a decision of a panel of arbitrators. It also mandated the convention of a new panel and re-hearing of appellant’s claim under the uninsured motorist provision of an insurance policy. The facts and procedural history of the case are set forth below.</p>
    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.4",627,[227,326,1147,461]]]'>

Involved in the accident were two other drivers, one of whom was allegedly uninsured. He entered a claim against appellee, the carrier of his employer’s insurance policy, for coverage under an uninsured motorist provision which appellee disputed. The contract provided that disputes would be resolved by arbitration conducted in accordance with the Pennsylvania Arbitration Act of 1927.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[226,803,1148,512]]]'>A panel of three arbitrators was assembled, as provided in the agreement, and presided over hearings on September 12 and 25, 1986. On July 28, 1987, the neutral arbitrator mailed a letter to the attorneys of the parties and each of the other panel members. It stated simply to the effect that appellee’s arbitrator and the neutral arbitrator found for appellee and that appellant’s arbitrator dissented and found for appellant. The neutral arbitrator’s was the solitary signature to the letter. The following day, the letter was filed with the Prothonotary.</p>
    <p id="b627-6" data-blocks='[["BL_627.6",627,[225,1333,1148,772]],["BL_628.1",628,[230,322,1144,97]]]'>Also on the following day, appellant’s arbitrator by certified mail, responded with a letter to the neutral arbitrator. In it he made a number of complaints. He stated that he had not agreed to the letter nor had he been consulted. He maintained in effect that the letter misrepresented his opinion. Regarding the deliberations of the panel members, he went on to express shock on learning that the other arbitrators had discussed the case out of his presence. In summary he stated that the letter was absolutely incorrect. He suggested further that the panel withdraw their purported findings and withdraw as the arbitrators in order to allow another panel to take over the matter. He sent courtesy copies to the other addressees of the neutral arbitrator’s letter. On August 3, 1987, the neutral arbitrator responded by letter. Its entire text stated, “Because of (sic) you have <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>impugned my integrity, I am withdrawing my award and I am withdrawing from the panel of arbitrators in this case.”</p>

On August 24, 1987, appellant answered, and filed new matter, petitioning, <em>inter alia, </em>for an order to convene a new arbitration panel. The court found adequate grounds to conclude that all of the panel members had not participated in the deliberations and that the award was not final in nature. The court therefore denied appellee’s petition to confirm the award and ordered the parties to convene a new arbitration panel to try the case.</p>
    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[224,922,1148,412]]]'>On appeal, the Superior Court reversed, determining that the lower court erred in its resolution of both the question of whether the panel had issued a final award and that of whether the award was the product of misconduct or other gross irregularity. <em>Goeller v.

In reply, appellee argues that the neutral arbitrator was without the power to withdraw the award of the arbitrators after it had been issued. We are impressed that the latter argument is non-responsive to the issue raised: whether there was an award in the first instance. We conclude that there was not.</p>

The object of the Court’s interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a), (b). The word “shall,” in the section relied on by appellant, is clearly mandatory in effect. <em>James F Oakley, Inc. v.

The purported award in this case, in failing the formal statutory requirement, failed the requirement of their agreement as well. The “award” was a nullity.</p>
    <p id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[243,1168,1147,895]]]'>Furthermore we are persuaded that there was no award in this case for another, more substantive, reason. This Court long ago voiced the principle that, “The opportunity to deliberate, and, if possible, to convince their fellows is the right of the minority, of which they cannot be deprived by the arbitrary will of the majority.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Maurer v. Burns, </em><a href="/pa/365/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="365 Pa. 596" data-case-ids="1225581" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0596-01">365 Pa. 596</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20383" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="76 A.2d 383">76 A.2d 383</a> (1950); <em>quoting Commonwealth ex rel.

In <em>Maurer </em>this Court declared invalid an appointment to the Board of Revision of Taxes made by fifteen of the twenty judges of a court of common pleas as violative of the principle. In <em>Claghorn </em>we did likewise in the case of a putative corporate act and for the same reason. We today hold that the principle is as applicable to the decision of a panel of arbitrators as in the instances cited and as a prerequisite to an award for which the parties bargained.</p>

When an arbitrator, properly appointed and entitled to act, is denied access to the deliberations of the other arbitrators, their decision is not a deci<a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>sion. It matters not whose arbitrator he or she may be. What is important is that all viewpoints must at least be heard. Each must be entitled to the opportunity to persuade the others, be permitted to dissent and to maintain his voice in the decision. It is manifest that that principle was violated in this case. <em>Claghorn.</em>
