(“Shovel”), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The dispute between the parties arose from the following factual situation. The issue presented is whether the Board of Claims (“Board”) has jurisdiction to determine whether a contract has been “entered into” for the purpose of invoking its jurisdiction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> For the following reasons we find that the Board is empowered to make such a determination.</p>
    <p id="b321-6" data-blocks='[["BL_321.7",321,[224,1018,1149,906]]]'>Early in 1986, Shovel learned that the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (“PLCB”) was looking for a new warehousing facility for its Pittsburgh distribution area. Shovel inquired whether the PLCB would be interested in utilizing a Pittsburgh facility that Shovel had recently acquired. Upon inspection of the facility, the PLCB determined that it would be suitable and instructed Shovel to contact the PLCB’s Logistics Bureau to discuss contract formation. The PLCB’s Executive Director then recommended transfer of the existing warehouse to Shovel’s facility, and the Board voted to adopt this recommendation and relocate. The PLCB’s Contract Administrator furnished Shovel with a fully negotiated contract, which contained blanks for the signatures of Shovel’s President, the PLCB Chairman, PLCB Chief Counsel, the PLCB Comptroller, the State Secretary for Budget and Administration, and a representative of the Attorney General’s office.</p>

PLCB then invited proposals from five companies, including Shovel, but contracted with another distributor at a price lower than Shovel’s. Shovel brought the instant action before the Commonwealth court to compel the comptroller and Budget Secretary to sign the contract, or, alternatively, to have the contract declared valid without their signatures.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> Shovel’s position is based on its contention that a valid contract had been fully executed, save for appellants’ signatures. The Commonwealth Court overruled the appellants’ objections and found that it had jurisdiction over this inquiry. For the reasons that follow, we disagree and reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court, and direct the parties to proceed before the Board of Claims.</p>
    <p id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.5",322,[252,1057,1148,465]]]'>Shovel instituted its action in the lower court by filing a petition for review in the nature of mandamus, seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The Commonwealth Court characterized this action as an attempt by Shovel to discern whether appellants were proper signatories to the contract and, if so, to compel them to sign it. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court determined that the action was not a contract claim, and that the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims had not been invoked.</p>

Shovel argued that the contract had been accepted by the PLCB <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>and that the action was brought to enforce appellants’ statutory duty to approve it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a> Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such a duty exists, Shovel cannot use it as a basis for characterizing this claim as statutory. The rights Shovel asserts derive only from the underlying contract. Consequently, Shovel’s true objective is to establish the enforceability of that contract, which is clearly a contract claim. The Board of Claims is a body created by statute for the arbitration of contractual and certain other claims lodged against the Commonwealth. Act of 1937, <em>as amended </em>October 5, 1978, P.L. 1104, No. 260 § 2, 72 Pa.S. § 4651-1. Although the Commonwealth traditionally had sovereign immunity from suit, the establishment of the Board of Claims waived that immunity by providing a tribunal whose specific duty was to entertain contract actions against the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a> The statute gives the Board of Claims “exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine claims against the Commonwealth arising from contracts hereafter <em>entered into </em>with the Commonwealth, where the amount in controversy amounts to $300.00 or more.” 72 Pa.S. § 4651-4 (emphasis added). A “claim ... arising from a contract” is often a dispute over the existence of the alleged contract as well as the liability flowing from it. In order for the Board of Claims to accept jurisdiction over a particular cause of action, it necessarily must determine as a factual predicate whether there is a valid contract in exist<a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>ence.

However, in <em>XPress, supra, </em>we declined to address the question of whether jurisdiction of the Board of Claims encompasses the ability to determine whether a contract had been “entered into.” We now direct our attention to precisely that question, and we hold that the Board of Claims has jurisdiction to determine whether a contract has been “entered into” for purposes of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.6",324,[248,1659,1148,525]],["BL_325.1",325,[204,335,1151,1058]]]'>Our finding that jurisdiction of this matter lies with the Board of Claims is supported by the fact that otherwise there would be no forum available to establish the fact of a valid contract against the Commonwealth. Since at common law sovereign immunity barred a claimant from asserting a claim against the Commonwealth based upon contract, 1 Pa. C.S. § 2310, no other forum would be available to test the validity of an alleged contract if it did not fit within the exception of the statute provided to exempt the immunity. Thus, any time the Commonwealth challenged the existence <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>of the underlying contract, the claimant would have no forum to establish its legitimacy. The statute creating the Board of Claims would thus be construed as allowing a claimant to sue only if the Commonwealth concedes the existence of a valid contract in the first instance. We find no basis for such a limited construction. In defending the Commonwealth Court’s jurisdiction over this matter, however, Shovel maintains that its action does not arise from a contract. Rather, Shovel contends that it seeks to force the appellants to comply with their statutory duty to either sign the contracts or permit the PLCB to adopt the contracts without their signatures. If Shovel is correct in characterizing its claim as statutory, there would be no question that jurisdiction of the matter lies with the Commonwealth Court. <em>See e.g., Delaware County v. Commonwealth, Department of Public Welfare, </em><a href="/pa-commw/34/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="34 Pa.

However, if the source of the right asserted by Shovel is contractual rather than statutory, the cause of action sounds in contract, and the proper forum is the Board of Claims.</p>

Rather, the focus is upon the origin of the rights claimed. In the instant matter, Shovel’s objective is to establish the contractual relationship. Shovel’s right to pursue this objective derives necessarily from the rights and obligations created by the contract, not by the alleged violation of a statute by the PLCB or the appellants. Shovel’s action thus assumes the nature of a breach of contract action in which a traditional remedy for the breach, namely specific performance, is sought. The proper forum for this type of action, therefore, is the Board of Claims. As we stated in <em>XPress, supra, </em>upon similar facts:</p>

Shovel further maintains that the Board’s Comptroller is given authority only to approve funds appropriated to the Board, 72 Pa.S. § 1501. Thus Shovel contends that because approval of the instant contract is beyond the scope of the Comptroller’s authority, formation of the contract does not depend upon the approval of the Comptroller.</p>

No other party has any significant interest in Shovel’s dealings with the Commonwealth. Thus the instant contract certainly does not rise to the level of statutory obligation reached in <em>Delaware River Port Authority, supra.</em>

      <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>It is a poor reflection on judicial efficiency when a disappointed state contractor is able to tie up two appellate courts and force an unnecessary remand by raising the red herring of statutory requirements which do not exist. We may not be able to prevent plaintiffs from distorting the nature of their claims, even outrageously, but we should not be hesitant to cut these distortions short in order to prevent an even greater waste of our resources.</p>

      <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.5",330,[240,637,1144,400]]]'>.- The background of this dispute is that Shovel has been involved in various contractual arrangements with PLCB for the warehousing and distribution of liquor in southwestern Pennsylvania for approximately thirty years. In 1985 Shovel was providing these services at a location outside of Pittsburgh, but Shovel located a warehouse suitable for PLCB use in Pittsburgh and notified the PLCB. When the PLCB indicated that it was interested in the Pittsburgh warehouse, Mr. Shovel and his wife entered into a sales agreement to purchase the facility. Thereafter, members of the PLCB visited the Pittsburgh facility, and subsequently the board approved the relocation of its southwest distribution center to the new Pittsburgh location.</p>
      <p id="b330-5" data-blocks='[["BL_330.6",330,[263,1045,1119,459]]]'>On October 1, 1986 the PLCB sent a draft contract to Shovel. However, when the board’s comptroller reviewed the contract, he raised questions about the propriety of awarding the contract without bids. The PLCB, nonetheless, sent the contract to Shovel for execution, indicating that he should return the contract for “Board and other agency approval’s [sic].” The PLCB Chairman and Chief Counsel then executed the contract and then submitted the contract to the PLCB comptroller for his approval. The Comptroller returned the contract with a request for clarification, citing Management Directive 250.3 and Manual 215.1, Contracting for Services, which require justification of the award of a sole source contract. The PLCB responded that they anticipated a cost saving by moving to Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p id="b330-6" data-blocks='[["BL_330.7",330,[266,1508,1113,143]]]'>When further correspondence failed to resolve the matter, the PLCB met with the Budget Office. As a result of these meetings, the Budget Secretary also determined that the PLCB had failed to justify the award of this sole source contract:</p>
      <blockquote id="b330-7" data-blocks='[["BL_330.8",330,[298,1663,1081,228]]]'>As I have indicated in our prior discussions, the LCB very easily could have, and most certainly should have, at least issued a Request for Proposals (“RFP”) prior to negotiating a contract with Shovel____ Furthermore, the Board should certainly have provided written sole source justification and received approval from the Comptroller before awarding any contract to Shovel.</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b330-10" data-blocks='[["BL_330.9",330,[297,1938,1082,188]]]'>The failure of the Board to follow these accepted procedures, prior to negotiating and executing the contract with Shovel during the final months of 1986, is a practice which this Administration cannot condone. Accordingly, neither I nor the Comptroller are willing to sign this contract.</blockquote>
      <p id="b330-11" data-blocks='[["BL_330.10",330,[263,2131,1113,72]]]'>The contract which the Comptroller and Budget Secretary had refused to sign contained the following signature page:</p>
      <blockquote id="b330-12" data-blocks='[["BL_330.11",330,[296,2208,1078,105]]]'>Now, therefore, the parties intending to be legally bound hereby, have set forth their hands and seals this 10th day of November, 1986.</blockquote>

        <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>Presumably because the Comptroller and the Budget Secretary refused to sign the contract with Shovel, the PLCB on December 2, 1987 voted unanimously to issue a request for proposals for a Pittsburgh distribution facility. Shovel was invited to participate, and the PLCB received proposals from five contractors. General Commodities Distributing Company (GENCO) submitted a proposal which was $3.5 million less than the original Shovel contract, and on April 13, 1988 PLCB and GENCO executed a contract which was approved by the Comptroller and the Budget Secretary.</p>
