On Wednesday, the 18th of March, 1981, at approximately 2:00, A.M., members of the Philadelphia Police Department’s Mobile Crime Detection Unit were summoned to investigate a disturbance in a building at 2308 West Diamond Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Upon arrival they discovered the bodies of Richard Mayberry and George Ellerbee. Mayberry’s body, with two gun shot wounds to the head, was found on the second floor landing of the north fire tower of this building. From there police followed a trail of blood which lead them to apartment 305 of the building, where they found Ellerbee’s body slumped on the sofa in the living room. From the apartment police recovered several fire-arms, live ammunition, spent cartridges, money and a large quantity of illicit drugs. Police learned that the apartment was rented <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>to an Evelyn B. Lingham. On March 20,1981, Ms. Lingham informed the police that she was present on the night of the murders. She named the appellant as the individual who killed Mayberry and Ellerbee. Another individual, a Paul Fisher, also informed the police that he too was in the the apartment on the night in question. He also named the appellant as the killer. On May 20, 1981, two months later, the appellant was apprehended and formally charged in connection with the killings. His trial began on April 28, 1982 and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on May 11, of that year. He raises several claims of trial court error. Before addressing these claims we must first determine whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain his convictions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b164-5" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[247,1141,1147,479]]]'>A review of the record reveals that the principle evidence presented at trial were statements by Ms. Ling-ham and Mr. Fisher. The trial court permitted the Commonwealth to introduce these statements as substantive evidence,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> even though both witnesses recanted prior statements. Two days after the murders, Ms. Lingham made three separate statements. The first two were transcribed by the police and signed by her and the third was tape recorded.</p>
    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[221,326,1148,690]]]'>
      <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>In the first statement Ms. Lingham denied any knowledge of the murders. Subsequently, in her second and third statements, she told them that she was contacted at her sister’s house by the appellant and that he asked her to meet with him, which she did. She stated that when she did he asked her to do him a favor, namely to telephone her apartment and to tell Mayberry that she wanted to come up to Mayberry’s apartment. Ms. Lingham stated that the appellant told her that he wanted to see Mayberry because Mayberry had cheated him in a drug deal. Further she explained that Mayberry was a drug dealer and that he had been paying her $300.00 a week to use her apartment to sell drugs.</p>
    <p id="b165-5" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[221,1035,1149,1213]]]'>Ms. Lingham also testified that she called, as appellant requested, but that Mayberry told her to wait for a half an hour. She and the appellant then waited together during which time the appellant showed her a .22 caliber revolver which was concealed under his jacket. They went to the apartment together and appellant knocked on the door. When Mayberry answered, the appellant told him that Ms. Lingham wanted to lay down and get some rest. Mayberry then opened the door. As the appellant entered the apartment, he walked next to Ellerbee, who was sitting on the couch and said, “why do people cross people”. He then shot Ellerbee in the head, turned to Mayberry and repeated “why do people cross people”. At that point she ran and Mayberry followed. She then heard two more shots. After she got to the first floor, she returned to her apartment and found Mayberry lying in the hallway, bleeding from the back of his head. She then saw the appellant, with gun in hand, trying to get Paul Fisher to come out of the bedroom of Mayberry’s apartment. Ms. Lingham then ran outside the apartment and attempted to flag down a cab. By the time she had gotten a cab to stop, the appellant arrived. Both got into the cab and later dropped the appellant at a hotel.</p>

He stated that <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>he went to the apartment on the night in question with his girlfriend and that both were admitted by Mayberry. Further that he and his girlfriend were in the bedroom when the appellant and Ms. Lingham arrived, that the bedroom door was partly open and that he saw both of them. He stated that he then heard four shots and that afterwards, he saw the appellant coming towards the bedroom door. He then quickly shut the door and locked it. He and his girlfriend then exited the room through a window.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[225,795,1147,252]]]'>This evidence, if accepted by the jury, was sufficient to sustain the appellant’s conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Commonwealth v.

A Ms. Geraldine Baxter testified that she was Paul Fisher’s girlfriend at the time and that she was in the bedroom of the apartment during the shootings. She testified that she had been sleeping and that she was awakened by the sound of gun fire. When she awoke, Fisher was leaning against the bedroom door holding it shut. Further that he called out to a Ms. Lingham by name and that a women replied. She then heard a male voice on the other side of the door telling Fisher to let him in. She testified that they looked for a gun in the room but that when they could not find one, they both exited the bedroom through the window.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The testimony given by the investigating officers and the medical examiner, further aided in that regard.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Finally, the appellant himself testified that he knew that the police were looking for him in-connection with the murders two days <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>after they were committed, but that he did not turn himself in. We believe that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the appellant’s convictions. We will next address the appellant’s specific claims of error, seriatim.</p>
    <p id="b167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[226,564,1148,362]]]'>The first issue raised by the appellant is that the trial court erred by allowing certain trial exhibits, namely the written and tape recorded statements of Mr. Fisher and Ms. Lingham, to be sent out with the jury during deliberations. He asserts that this violated Rule 1114, of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 1114 provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_167.6",167,[268,949,1105,314]]]'>Upon retiring for deliberations, the jury shall not be permitted to have a transcript of any trial testimony, nor a copy of any written confession by the defendant, nor a copy of the information or indictment.

    <p id="b167-6" data-blocks='[["BL_167.7",167,[225,1284,1148,632]]]'>He concedes that these exhibits were not specifically prohibited by the rule but argues that the practice of allowing written and tape recorded statements to go out with the jury during its deliberations in general, could be used to circumvent the rule’s prohibition against trial transcripts by unscrupulous individuals who could manufacture such evidence specifically for trial. While the appellant points out an obvious hazard of the rule, there is no evidence in the record to suggest such a finding in this case, thus we do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>See Commonwealth v. Riggins, </em><a href="/pa/478/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="478 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1740538" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0222-01">478 Pa. 222</a>, 232-33, <a href="/pa/478/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="478 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1740538" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0222-01">386 A.2d 520</a>, 525-26 (1978).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

The record reflects that the first time the jury was made aware of Ms. Lingham’s polygraph examination was during defense counsel’s cross-examination of a Detective Curcio. It is apparent from the record that appellant’s trial counsel intentionally elicited this information in an attempt to establish that the later two statements, by Ms. Lingham, were coerced by the police. <em>See </em>N.T., 5/4/82, pp. 5.24-5.25.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> It is well established that failed trial tactics of defense counsel are not grounds for a new trial.

      <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>The appellant next asserts that the prosecution improperly questioned him and others about his past drug dealings. He argues that this line of questioning was improper because it exposed the jury to his unrelated criminal conduct. As a general rule, evidence of a separate crime is inadmissible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> However, “where the evidence is relevant, the mere fact that testimony of another crime may be prejudicial will not prevent its introduction into evidence”. <em>Commonwealth v.

The record reflects that this witness testified that appellant was previously convicted of “six counts of robbery” while in reality he was convicted of six separate charges arising out of a single robbery. N.T., 5/6/82, p. 7.68. While this witness’ testimony was somewhat misleading in that it created an inference that he was convicted of six different robberies, this was in fact not what the witness stated, thus it did not amount to perjury. Further the record reflects that any ambiguity was removed during cross-examination. <em>See </em>N.T., 5/6/82, p. 7.74.
