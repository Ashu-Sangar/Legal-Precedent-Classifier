The issue presented is whether, after all <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>charges at a preliminary hearing have been dismissed, a writ of certiorari is available to test the legality of the district justice’s determination that no <em>prima facie </em>case exists. Petitioner argues that the Commonwealth must rearrest an individual after the dismissal of charges at a preliminary hearing, and that a writ of certiorari is an improper avenue to reinstitute charges. The issue is whether this type of ruling is of such a nature as to require a right of review by a higher tribunal. Respondent, Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County, asserts that a writ of certiorari is available to test the propriety of a district justice’s determination that a prosecution fails for lack of a <em>prima facie </em>case. We conclude, for the reasons hereinafter set forth, that the nature of such a ruling does not possess the finality as would require review.</p>
    <p id="b345-4" data-blocks='[["BL_345.5",345,[224,1128,1149,1247]]]'>The pertinent facts and procedural history are as follows. On July 7, 1987, George Bastían was found dead at his home in Allentown, Pennsylvania. On July 8, 1987, John Johnson was arrested and charged with being involved in the murder of Mr. Bastían. On July 13, 1987, petitioner was arrested. In addition to the charge of murder, petitioner was also charged with burglary, theft, receiving stolen property and criminal conspiracy. On August 7, 1987, a preliminary hearing was held in Lehigh County before a district justice. After the presentation of the testimony, the district justice ruled that the Commonwealth had failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case as to any of the charges against petitioner. Consequently, the charges were dismissed. On August 28, 1987, the Commonwealth presented in the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County a petition for writ of certiorari to the district justice, or, in the alternative, requested that a Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas judge sit as a committing magistrate for preliminary hearing purposes. On January 27, 1988, an <em>en banc </em>panel of the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County granted the Commonwealth’s petition for writ of certiorari and, upon review of the notes of testimony of the preliminary hearing, found that a <em>prima facie </em>case was established as to all charges against petitioner.</p>

The evidence presented by this witness established Mr. Liciaga’s participation in the crimes committed. Mr. Johnson testified that he and petitioner broke into the decedent’s home and searched for items to steal. Mr. Johnson further testified that as he descended from the second floor, he saw the petitioner straddling the decedent who was lying on his back. According to Johnson, petitioner had his hands around the decedent’s neck and Johnson observed a considerable amount of blood at the scene. In addition, Mr. Johnson testified that the decedent was yelling for help and making other sounds. In order to muffle those sounds, John Johnson took a pillow and forcibly placed it over the decedent’s face until the decedent was reduced to making almost inaudible sounds. At that point Mr. Johnson and petitioner exited the premises. Also introduced at the preliminary hearing were an autopsy report and the testimony of the first police officer on the scene after the murder had been discovered.

Although the factual circumstances of the instant case do not present the issue, there may be instances in which a defendant may be able to demonstrate that the Commonwealth’s actions in seeking reassessment of its evidence is intended to annoy or harass. Upon such a showing, I would not permit the Commonwealth to present identical evidence before successive district justices because the Commonwealth’s interests are sufficiently protected by the procedure that permits judges of the courts of common pleas to sit as committing magistrates.</p>

Such is the fact here. The Justice of the Peace discharged on grounds of credibility, that is he did not accept as true for prima facie purposes the prosecution’s evidence. As the majority holds, credibility at a preliminary hearing is not before the Justice of the Peace. The majority none the less orders a rehearing before a different magistrate. In the face of a clear disregard of the rule that credibility is not before a magistrate there seems no reason why appeal to the Common Pleas Court is not permissible.

Why that Tribunal cannot be a Common Pleas Court is part of the impracticality outlined in the dissent of Mr. Justice Bell. In Riggins, whether the appeal to a Common Pleas Court is termed a certiorari or it is another “tribunal” in the Riggins sense, it would seem certainly the more practical.</p>
