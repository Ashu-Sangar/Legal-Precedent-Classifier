The fundamental issue presented in this appeal is whether a decision not to prosecute on the ground of lack of evidence to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, made by the office of the district attorney and confirmed by a judge of the court of common pleas, is reviewable by the Superior Court. The Commonwealth’s framing of the issue has tended to obfuscate the relatively straight-forward question legitimately raised. Additionally, the Commonwealth has attempted to implicate constitutional principles and principles of law not presently germane to the instant inquiry. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Superior Court did have jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 742.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Moreover, that court correctly concluded that there was sufficient evidence to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case.

Benz of the Pittsburgh Police Department. On June 29, 1981, both men were in the West Penn Memorial Hospital to visit patients. While still in the lobby, Officer Benz, who was not in uniform, entered the elevator with packages for his ailing wife. Paaron Jones approached the elevator to speak with another passenger whom he knew. At the time Mr. Jones was on crutches with a broken leg in a cast and smelled of alcohol. He held the elevator door open with one of the crutches and continued to converse with the passenger on the elevator. After some delay of the elevator an argument began between Jones and Benz, resulting in Jones striking Benz with his <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>crutch. After Benz had retrieved his packages and entered a second elevator, Jones again struck Benz, sending him to the floor. While Benz was still on the floor, Jones struck him across the back with a crutch. Realizing that the altercation was getting out of control, Benz pulled out his badge and firearm and identified himself as a police officer. At that time Jones attempted to flee through the front exit and Benz pursued him with his firearm drawn, stating that he was under arrest and he should lie face down on the floor. Instead, a scuffle again resulted. This time, however, Benz had his gun exposed. During the fight the gun discharged and Jones was struck in the head with the bullet. The emergency unit was able to save Jones only for him to live in a vegetative state for four years until July 25, 1985, when he died as a result of the gunshot wound.</p>
    <p id="b290-5" data-blocks='[["BL_290.5",290,[240,1130,1148,745]]]'>After Jones’s death an open inquest was conducted by the coroner, and the coroner’s jury recommended that Benz be charged with voluntary manslaughter. Nevertheless, the District Attorney of Allegheny County did not file charges. The District Attorney decided that the eye-witness testimony was so disjointed as to make it inconclusive and instead relied on medical evidence of possible powder burns on the victim’s head and scientific evidence concerning the retention of the shell of the bullet in the chamber of the gun. That evidence seemed to indicate that the victim was in close proximity to Benz when the gun discharged. That conclusion supported the claims made by Benz that the two men were wrestling over the weapon and that the shot was fired accidentally.</p>

The majority makes the exercise of prosecutional discretion in refusing to prosecute justiciable. That is error in my opinion. Long ago, this Court recognized that a district attorney’s power to approve or disapprove private criminal complaints is consistent with that office’s unreviewable authority to initiate or discontinue prosecutions generally. <em>Commonwealth v. Ragone, </em><a href="/pa/317/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="317 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="8845384" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0113-01">317 Pa. 113</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.%20454" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="176 A. 454">176 A. 454</a> (1935). Pa.R.Crim.P. 133 protects the interests of the private complainant (often times, the victim) by allowing for the submission of a disapproved private complaint to a trial judge whose independent review checks and balances the district attorney’s decision and further hedges against possible error. At least, that is the theory behind the adoption of Rule 133 as set out in the A.B.A. Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, <em>Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function and the Defense Function, </em>§ 3.4 (and the comments thereto) (Approved Draft, 1971), upon which the Rule was based. History, logic and efficiency require that this limitation on a prosecutor’s discretion must be read as narrowly as possible lest we make the already overburdened criminal justice system wholly impossible to administer. Read in that light, I am convinced that a trial judge’s decision to agree with a district attorney’s judgment not to prosecute is unreviewable and, for the reason that, <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>
