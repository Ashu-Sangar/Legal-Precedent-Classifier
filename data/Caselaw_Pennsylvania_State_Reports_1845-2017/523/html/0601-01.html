The application contains information required for a PRD by section 707 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10707, Kidder Township’s Zoning Ordinance, and the township’s Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. Among the required materials was Pocono Green’s “Report on Sewage and Water Facilities,” which explained that because no municipal central sewage treat<a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>ment facilities were available, the Pocono Green development would have its own facility which would discharge “final treated effluent ... to an unnamed tributary of the Lehigh River ... located at 41 degrees, three minutes N. latitude and 75 degrees, forty-five minutes W. longitude.”</p>

At this hearing, Pocono Green’s engineer testified that the sewage treatment plant was “feasible from an engineering standpoint.” Additionally, as required by the Subdivision Ordinance, the developer included in its preliminary plan a letter from D.E.R. stating that Pocono Green’s preliminary plans for sewage disposal were acceptable to the agency.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Accepting Commonwealth Court’s definition of “feasibility” as a showing by substantial evidence that the plan is likely to succeed, it is apparent that a preliminary agency approval is irrelevant to the plan’s likelihood of success where the developer’s <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>expert indicates that he is not familiar with the stream into which the treated sewage would flow and that it will be difficult to persuade D.E.R. to issue a final approval of the sewage treatment proposal. At issue is not whether the sewage treatment plant, considered in a vacuum, is technically adequate, as is indicated by D.E.R.’s preliminary approval. Rather, of course, at issue is the feasibility of the developer’s plan <em>as it will operate at this particular location.</em>

That is why the approval is contingent upon the feasibility of the plan, not merely upon the acquisition of a preliminary approval from D.E.R.</p>
    <p id="b692-5" data-blocks='[["BL_692.6",692,[227,1295,1147,524]]]'>Further, the statute clearly places the , burden of establishing this feasibility on the developer, who must, submit substantial evidence that the plant will function properly where it is to be located. When the developer cannot answer questions about how the facility will operate at this location, the township may properly determine, indeed must determine, that the developer has not proved the feasibility of its plan by substantial evidence.

      <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>Next, the developer contends that the Supervisors’ reasons for denying approval are legally deficient. In particular, the developer argues that the township may not deny approval of a PRD application on grounds not contained in its ordinances. The grounds complained of are the township’s findings that the proposal requires the discharge of treated sewage into a stream that runs dry leading into a pond that does not discharge. These grounds, according to the developer, are not present in the township’s land use ordinance. We understand this argument to mean that because the township has no ordinance prohibiting the discharge of sewage into streams that run dry leading to ponds with no outlet, such grounds may not be used to support a denial. Thus, according to the developer, because the township’s ordinance contains no sewage requirements except that the treatment plan be approved by D.E.R., and because D.E.R. has issued a preliminary approval, the denial was in error. This argument is actually only a variation on the first argument, and also is completely meritless. The developer overlooks that the burden of presenting substantial evidence of feasibility is with him, and when he is unable to answer objections to his plan, and, in fact, indicates that he may have difficulty with the approval, the mere possibility that D.E.R. will finally approve his plan falls short of meeting that burden.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b694-3" data-blocks='[["BL_694.5",694,[242,295,1152,956]]]'>
      <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>Finally, the developer argues that the denial was in error because the township’s findings were not supported by substantial evidence. According to the developer, it will have to meet D.E.R.’s most stringent criteria for effluent quality because the stream into which it proposes to discharge treated sewage is classified as a “high quality cold water fisher[y].” Since the township failed to make any findings as to the capabilities of the developer’s proposed method of treatment, the engineering characteristics of the treatment plant, or the specific effect of the treatment plant on the stream, the developer contends that the township’s determination was unsupported by substantial evidence. This argument, too, is without merit. Once again, the burden is on the developer to establish the feasibility of the sewage treatment plan, not on the township to establish its nonfeasibility. When the developer fails to meet that burden by substantial evidence, the township has no alternative but to determine that the plan is not feasible.</p>
    <p id="b694-4" data-blocks='[["BL_694.6",694,[240,1315,1147,312]]]'>It is true that the township, pursuant to section 709 of the Municipalities Planning Code, is required to set forth reasons for the denial “with particularity in what respect the development plan would or would not be in the public interest, including, but not limited to, findings of fact and conclusions on the following:”</p>

Whether D.E.R.’s approval is sufficient to protect the public interest is an argument more appropriately addressed to the legislature than to this Court. The General Assembly specifically chose to empower local governing bodies to approve or disapprove the feasibility of certain components of planned residential developments, and the developer may not usurp this statutory scheme by substituting its opinion for that of the General Assembly as to how the public interest should be protected.</p>

There is no evidence of record that the unnamed tributary of the Lehigh River into which appellee, Pocono Green, Inc., planned to discharge treated effluent runs dry occasionally or that it flows into a pond with no outlet. The record herein reveals that appellee, during the public hearing on its application for preliminary approval of a planned residential development, produced 1) the sworn testimony of a registered professional engineer stating that appellee’s plans for central sewage treatment and disposal were feasible, and 2) a letter from the Department of Environmental Resources (DER) giving preliminary approval to those plans. The residents who spoke at the public hearing regarding the condition of the Lehigh River tributary into which appellee proposed discharging treated effluent were not sworn in as witnesses and were not subject to cross-examination during the proceedings. Thus, it is clear that the determination of the Board of Supervisors, i.e., that the sewage treatment proposal was not feasible because the tributary ran dry at times and ended in a pond with no outlet, was not supported by substantial evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

And, indeed, a <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>permit will not issue and the planned residential development will not be constructed if appellee’s plans are in any way inadequate or constitute a threat to the environment.
