Appellee asked an attorney if she was his lawyer. When she said no, he stated he did not wish to converse with her further. Clearly this demonstrated a judgmental determination! The Court in <em>Wainwright </em>stated, “[w]hat is impermissible is the evidentiary use of an individual’s exercise of his constitutional rights after the State’s assurance that the invocation of those rights will not be penalized.” <a href="/us/474/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="474 U.S. 284" data-case-ids="6204128" data-case-paths="/us/474/0284-01">474 U.S. at 295</a>, <a href="/us/474/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="474 U.S. 284" data-case-ids="6204128" data-case-paths="/us/474/0284-01">106 S.Ct. at 640</a>.</p>
    <p id="b182-5" data-blocks='[["BL_182.6",182,[237,1617,1150,593]]]'>In this instance, what the Commonwealth sought to introduce was neither an invocation of the constitutional right to remain silent nor a statement made in conjunction with that right. Under the facts, appellee had already been advised of his rights by the arresting officers and had indicated a desire to remain silent. The conversation which included the third statement was initiated by appellee and not connected with any type of interrogation. Consequently, the use of the statement triggers no constitutional issue. However, appellee’s decision to not further converse is relevant to a determination as to his competency.</p>
