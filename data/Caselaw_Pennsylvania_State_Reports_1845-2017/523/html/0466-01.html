The stabbing was observed by all of the patrons of the bar, including the group that accompanied Mr. Ellis to the bar to celebrate one of the members’ birthday. The police showed each of the witnesses a photo-array of eight pictures, and each identified the appellant’s picture as the one who had committed the mur<a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>der. Subsequently, when the police arrested the appellant for shoplifting in Strawbridge and Clothier department store, he had assumed the name of Booker T. Beatty, Jr. While still in police custody on that charge, the appellant was arrested pursuant to an outstanding warrant and charged with the murder of Christopher Ellis.</p>
    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[246,627,1147,632]]]'>At trial, the prosecution produced six eye-witnesses<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> who identified the appellant as the one they had seen commit the murder. Each witness had been familiar with the appellant, as a person who “hung around” the neighborhood. They all knew him by his first name only, “Reggie” or Reginald. There was also testimony that frequently the appellant was seen wearing clear lens, “schoolboy” glasses prior to the incident, similar to the glasses dropped by the assailant at the scene of the murder. Hattie English testified that the appellant and the victim were arguing over a five dollar debt the victim allegedly owed the appellant immediately prior to the stabbing.</p>

The Commonwealth produced the appellant’s fiancee, Stephanie McCorey, who testified she was pregnant at the time of the incident and had previously resided at 1610 N. Marshall Street. Mr. Whealton also testified the appellant approached him the next day and told him not to mention the appellant’s name with regard to the incident. In defense of this charge, the appellant maintained he was in San Diego visiting his brother at the time of the incident and therefore had an alibi. In support of this claimed alibi defense, appellant produced his brother and other family members to corroborate the story.</p>

There was also circumstantial evidence which connected appellant to the crime: the glasses left at the scene and the appellant’s pregnant fiancee was named Stephanie.</p>

While the appellant maintained that he was not in Philadelphia at the time, a jury’s refusal to believe his alibi witnesses would not be unreasonable. It appears that the jury did so refuse and it entered a verdict of guilty. Because of the overwhelming evidence to support the verdict, this Court is constrained to find there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict.</p>
