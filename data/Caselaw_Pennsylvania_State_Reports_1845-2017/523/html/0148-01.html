Moreover, Gladstone, the promisee, had a right of action against Blymire for the indemnity promised. Were Boistle permitted to sue Blymire on the contract, Blymire would be liable both to Gladstone, the promisee, and to Boistle, the creditor beneficiary.

The equity of the case would be, and chancery would decree, that Blymire should pay but once, and that the money should go to Boistle on his releasing Gladstone. But in two common-law suits against Blymire it might be difficult to effect this equity. The suits must, therefore, be by Gladstone against Blymire, and by Boistle against Gladstone, and thus Blymire would be released by one payment to Gladstone, and Gladstone exonerated by paying Boistle; unless one suit should be brought in the name of Gladstone for the use of Boistle against Blymire.</blockquote>

Neither were lawyers. Neither were counseled by lawyers at the time the critical events in this case occurred. Mr. Biggins merely adopted certain “homemade” and extremely inexact devices to arrange his financial affairs and we must now decide which is the sounder of two rules that ought to be applied to the facts at hand. I vigorously dissent from the view expressed by the majority that that choice depends solely or even principally on one’s natural instinct not “to destroy the annuity of his [Biggins] widow ... ”.

All persons must be equal before the Court, whatever their status. To do otherwise is to indulge in result oriented decision making that is ultimately destructive to the rule of law itself. It is wrong to pick a winner for extraneous reasons and then adopt a rule to reach the pre-chosen result. To do so, as I believe the Majority has done in this case, lends credence to the theories of “realists” like the late Judge Jerome Frank, and the modern “critical legal studies” radicals that ours is not a system of law at all, but merely one of individual preference.</p>

The rule in <em>Logan, </em>in turn, applies Section 142 of the First Restatement of Contracts. The First Restatement distinguished between third-party donee beneficiaries and third-party creditor beneficiaries with reference to the question of when their respective rights under a contract benefiting them would vest irrevocably. A donee beneficiary’s rights <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>vested irrevocably under Section 142 as soon as the contract in his or her favor was made, unless the right to modify the contract had been expressly reserved. A creditor beneficiary’s rights, on the other hand, could be changed at any time unless a term of the agreement provided that those rights could <em>not </em>be modified, or the beneficiary had justifiably relied on the promise before he or she received notification of the change.

Thus, the beneficiaries’ rights can be changed at any time unless the agreement provides that it cannot be modified or there has been reliance thereon. If the rule of the Second Restatement (§ 311(3)) were applied to the instant facts and no other considerations entered into the picture, Mrs. Biggins could not prevail unless she proved justifiable reliance upon the original agreement before she received notification of a change in beneficiaries. The requirement to establish such a factual showing would have precluded the grant of summary judgment in her favor.

The normal assumption is that when individuals sign a contract specifying how their own money is to be distributed, and one of the parties is merely an agent in some sense, as here, that the agreement can be changed, modified or altered in a confidential manner as suits exigent circumstances, at least before any third party becomes aware of it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_13" id="ref_footnote_3_13">13</a> A trust is a solemn undertaking creating property rights in a beneficiary.

The Superior Court concluded that Mr. Biggins did not make a valid <em>inter vivos </em>gift of the “Award of Options” because there was nothing to be given; Mrs. Biggins’ rights vested irrevocably when the original agreement was made. Under <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>the Second Restatement view (§ 311), Mrs. Biggins’ rights would not become irrevocable <em>ab initio, </em>hence, if Section 311 were adopted, the question of whether or not this was a valid gift would have to be considered. If, under the facts as pleaded, there is no way that it could be construed that a valid gift was made, then summary judgment in favor of Appellee would be correct. If, on the other hand, it is possible that there may have been a valid, completed gift here, then the summary judgment was improper.

I would hold that Mr. Biggins retained a power to revoke or modify under Section 311 of the Second Restatement of Contracts. Rights under this power may have been effectively transferred to Appellants as a gift prior to Mrs. Biggins’ assent to, or reliance upon, the agreement made for her benefit. The facts necessary to make this determination are not evident in the record. Facts necessary to determine the type of gift made (either <em>inter vivos </em>or testamentary) and therefore its validity are also not of record. Once they contended that a valid gift had been accomplished, Appellants should have been given the opportunity to prove their contention. They did not get that opportunity. On the facts pleaded, I would hold that Appellee was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Upon the presentation of additional evidence, it is possible that Appellants (defendants before the trial court) could show that a valid gift was made to them prior to Mrs. Biggins’ rights becoming irrevocable. Hence, in my view, the grant of summary judgment here was improper.</p>

That rule was not applied to fraternal benefit insurance, partly again because of statutes and partly because of charter and by-law provisions. Standard policy forms were revised to avoid the rule by reserving to the insured the power to change the beneficiary. Modern policies also provide for powers to surrender for cash, to borrow against the policy, and to assign the policy. Deletion of such a standard provision may manifest an intention that the power is not to exist.</blockquote>
