This building or “transfer station” was used to compact waste so that it could be loaded onto a tractor-trailer for transportation and ultimate disposal. Mr. Holmes was aware of the purpose of this building, as he had visited it previously and knew that Appellant had not been issued a permit to operate it as a transfer station pursuant to Section 201 of the Solid Waste Management Act, 35 P.S. § 6018.201 (Supp.1987). When Mr. Holmes lost sight of the truck as it entered the building, he exited his car, walked onto the property and into the “transfer station” building, without a warrant, to view the operation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">1</a> The trash truck was not empty and a load of <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>solid waste was in the compacting machinery. Thereafter, DER initiated a prosecution against Appellant under the Solid Waste Management Act for operating a transfer station without a permit.</p>

Appellant then filed a <em>de novo </em>appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County. On the date set for trial, Appellant filed a motion to suppress the testimony of Mr. Holmes on the basis that his testimony would be grounded on information obtained without a search warrant. The trial court allowed his testimony, reasoning that there could be no reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, due to the highly regulated nature of the waste disposal industry. After a non-jury trial, Appellant was found guilty and filed an appeal with the Commonwealth Court before sentence was imposed. The Commonwealth Court initially remanded to the trial court for sentencing. Appellant then filed a motion for reconsideration in light of <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em>Lutz </em>controls our disposition of this matter, the evidence derived from the warrantless search would be deemed illegal and subject to possible suppression. If subject to suppression, the issue whether there is a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule under our State Constitution would then arise.

While it could never be concluded that solid waste is benign in all cases when compared with the hazardous variety, it seems clear to me that the facts which would make it so would also provide the probable cause necessary to obtain a search <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>warrant. In the present case, nothing pointing to the imminence of the danger of the appellant’s activity warrant this Court’s excise, in one fell swoop, of a business’ expectation of privacy.</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[215,544,1148,414]]]'>In this aspect, I think that <em>Lutz </em>struck the proper balance between risk of harm versus the derogation of a business’ constitutionally protected rights. This Court need go no further than that to decide the present case. From the mere fact that the Legislature has expressed the same general concerns for solid waste as it has hazardous, does not come the conclusion that the two are para materia, and thus should not be treated as such.</p>
