Although the life of the Commission had been ostensibly extended until December 31, 1988 by resolution of the “Leadership Committee” pursuant to section 4(4) of the Sunset Act, 71 P.S. § 1795.4(4), the concurring opinion expressed the belief that this extension was “unconstitutional, as it allows a group of six (6) persons [i.e., the Leadership Committee] to legislate in place of the full House and Senate.

The flaw is that we already have jurisdiction in this case by virtue of the Commission’s direct appeal from the Commonwealth Court’s Order of October 25, 1988. The Commission predicated this appeal on the Judicial Code and the Rules of Appellate Procedure, 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 723(a), 5105(c) and Pa.R.A.P. Rule 311(a)(4), and it is highly inconsistent with the Commission’s statement of jurisdiction to now suggest that we have none and that we must do an <em>extraordinary </em>act to obtain jurisdiction.
