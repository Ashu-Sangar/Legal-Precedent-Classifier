    <p id="b217-9" data-blocks='[["BL_217.10",217,[208,1162,1150,311]]]'>As I understand the Majority, because Section 6106(a) of the Crimes Code is drafted as one sentence in which is included the following phrase set off by commas, “except in his place of abode or fixed place of business” that phrase is to be read as an element of the crime which must be proven by the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b217-10" data-blocks='[["BL_217.11",217,[206,1500,1149,364]]]'>In <em>Bigelow, </em>however, the Court relieved the Commonwealth of the burden of proving whether a person caught with a gun on a city street or building had a license, because that section was contained in a proviso, separated from the main section by a colon, but the two exceptions were all part of the one sentence defining the offense.

Apparently, the Majority is now indicating that the words of exception of Section 6108 are a proviso and are not interpreted as elements of a crime because of the <em>colon </em>separating them from the rest of the definitional sentence. This, however, was not the rationale given originally for the Court’s interpretation. The Court originally noted in <em>Bigelow </em>that the word of exception “unless” conferred proviso status on the <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>phrase and did not consider the effect of setting the phrase off from the rest of the definitional section with a colon.</p>

Punctuation should not be used to control the intention of the General Assembly and is specifically frowned upon by the Rules of Statutory Construction (1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1923(b)).</p>
