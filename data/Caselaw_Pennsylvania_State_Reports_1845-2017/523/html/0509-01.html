Appellee Jean Martin filed a fatal claim petition alleging that her husband’s death from a self-inflicted gunshot resulted from job-related stress. At the time of his death at age 56, Martin was employed by the Appellant, Ketchum, Incorporated, as a professional fund raiser for non-profit organizations. Martin was employed by Ketchum from <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>1958 until his suicide. Although Martin’s home was in Pittsburgh, his job required him to spend extended periods of time away at the location of a campaign.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[221,477,1149,681]]]'>In 1979, Martin was a Vice-President and Supervisor of Campaigns, directing a successful fund raising campaign at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Martin remained there for a period of four months. While he was located in North Carolina, Ketchum underwent several personnel changes in Pittsburgh. The individual who was then President was moved to a position as Chairman of the Board and one of the vice-presidents was promoted to President. Martin was very upset about the changes because he felt that the new president would not be as effective as his predecessor. Martin believed also that the changes would have a direct effect upon him personally and financially.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.6",596,[218,1178,1148,563]]]'>As a result of the changes, he went to the Chairman of the Board after completing the North Carolina campaign and requested that he be relieved of his supervisory responsibilities and assigned to campaign direction. The Chairman responded by saying that he could not think of a project that would be worthy of his talents. Within a few weeks, however, Ketchum “sold” a campaign to the University of Michigan. Martin was asked if he would consider becoming involved in that campaign. Martin accepted and was reassigned to the University of Michigan in January, 1980.</p>
    <p id="b596-6" data-blocks='[["BL_596.7",596,[216,1769,1148,307]]]'>He encountered numerous problems at the University of Michigan. When he returned home on weekends, he spoke to his wife about his concern that the University’s Vice-President of Development was not co-operating with him. He expressed his dissatisfaction with his staff, his inability to get an office, and the lack of campaign progress.</p>
    <p id="b596-7" data-blocks='[["BL_596.8",596,[215,2095,1145,254]]]'>The campaign was a major project. For that reason, Martin was concerned with the lack of progress.

      <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>Martin eventually contacted Ketchum’s Pittsburgh office and suggested the Chairman of the Board come to the University to review the situation. The Chairman was David S. Ketchum. Mr. Ketchum agreed and met with the University’s Director of Development, Dr. Michael Radock, on April 1, 1980 in Pittsburgh.</p>
    <p id="b597-4" data-blocks='[["BL_597.5",597,[248,646,1149,408]]]'>On April 9, 1980, Mr. Ketchum wrote a letter to Dr. Radock, reiterating his absolute confidence in Martin’s ability to direct the University campaign. Mr. Ketchum emphasized the wealth of Martin’s capital fund-raising experience as well as his great personal desire to serve the University. He explained that he felt that was what led Martin to press too hard in some of the personal relationships Radock had described to him.</p>
    <p id="b597-5" data-blocks='[["BL_597.6",597,[250,1079,1148,460]]]'>The letter reflects that Martin’s conflict with Radock arose out of their apparent battle of wills. Mr. Ketchum referred to lengthy, detailed discussions with Martin after the meeting, stating, “He [Martin] definitely understands that you are the University’s vice-president in the area in which he is a consultant.” (R. 73a). The letter outlined Mr. Ketchum’s plan to become personally involved in the campaign and a proposed general planning session with a team of officers.</p>
    <p id="b597-6" data-blocks='[["BL_597.7",597,[251,1564,1147,414]]]'>Shortly thereafter, a demand was made on Mr. Ketchum that a new director be assigned. Mr. Ketchum complied with the client’s demand. An in-house memorandum prepared by Mr. Ketchum on April 14, 1980 indicated that he had advised Martin of the change and had explained that the client had agreed with him that Martin was an experienced, able director. The sole reason for the requested change was “chemistry.”</p>
    <p id="b597-7" data-blocks='[["BL_597.8",597,[251,1995,1148,364]]]'>After his return to the Pittsburgh office, Martin became frustrated because he felt he was not being utilized properly. He was subsequently assigned to a fund raising campaign for the Salvation Army in Pittsburgh. The campaign was not as extensive or prestigious as was the University campaign. It was also considered less stressful because it permitted Martin to remain at home.</p>

      <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>Martin’s complaints about the Salvation Army campaign were similar to those he had expressed about the University of Michigan — inadequate office space and insufficient staff. He was unhappy with the project. During this time, Martin continued to brood over the change in the University of Michigan campaign.</p>
    <p id="b598-6" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[243,651,1146,371]]]'>Prior to the start of the Salvation Army campaign, Martin began seeing a psychiatrist.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The psychiatrist prescribed medication. He continued seeing the psychiatrist until November or December of 1980. The Appellee described her husband as appearing over-medicated and in a stupor during that time. After discontinuing psychiatric treatment, Martin appeared happier.</p>
    <p id="b598-7" data-blocks='[["BL_598.6",598,[242,1054,1146,480]]]'>Martin’s job dissatisfaction was not the only difficulty that he was facing. His presence in Pittsburgh was considered positive as far as his personal life was concerned. He was experiencing problems with a teenage son. It was due to those problems that Martin brought two guns from his home for safekeeping at the office. He was apparently concerned with what might happen if the guns fell into his son’s possession. Martin killed himself at his office by firing one of those guns.</p>
    <p id="b598-8" data-blocks='[["BL_598.7",598,[240,1566,1148,425]]]'>Dr. Ralph Zabarenko, a psychiatrist, testified on behalf of the claimant.

      <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>Dr. Zabarenko’s description of Martin is illuminating. He testified that Martin had enjoyed a successful career for many years, moving from one success to another. Despite his success, Martin was a “man who was chased by the specter of failure” to whom failure remained a great danger. Martin was described as a man whose view of himself was necessarily bolstered by continued, increasing success. When he did not meet with the expected success during the University of Michigan project, he suffered a decline in his self-esteem. Dr. Zabarenko indicated that Martin’s drive to succeed was what made him a valuable worker for the corporation, but that Ketchum did not realize that it was dealing with a vulnerable person.</p>
    <p id="b599-4" data-blocks='[["BL_599.5",599,[238,1020,1147,512]]]'>The most telling statement of Dr. Zabarenko is his personality profile description of Martin as a man whose overwhelming need for success existed long before the change in the Michigan project. He stated, “So that we have the outlines of a character structure existing for a number of years which has been pushed over the bridge by an act which was vulnerable.” Although his employer’s perception of Martin as a competent and successful fund raiser remained unchanged after the Michigan project, Martin’s self-esteem faltered.</p>
    <p id="b599-5" data-blocks='[["BL_599.6",599,[238,1558,1147,249]]]'>The referee granted benefits to the Appellee finding that Martin had sustained a work injury in the form of work-related stress which resulted in his suicide as a result of an insane, irrational impulse.

The Court noted that although the claimant had established the existence of stressful work conditions, the referee had not found that the events preceding the suicide constituted abnormal working conditions. Citing its decision in <em>Hirschberg v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Department of Transportation), </em>81 Pa.Cmwlth. <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>579, <a href="/citations/?q=474%20A.2d%2082" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="474 A.2d 82">474 A.2d 82</a> (1984), the Court noted that in order for an alleged work-related suicide to be compensable, a claimant must produce objective evidence that the working conditions were abnormal, i.e., actual, rather than merely perceived or imagined. Because the claimant had failed to meet her burden of proof, the suicide was not a compensable injury.</p>

The employer had argued that the § 301(a) Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 431 prohibits an award of benefits whenever the injury is self-inflicted. Section 301 provides in part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b600-6" data-blocks='[["BL_600.7",600,[292,1435,1105,308]]]'>Every employer shall be liable for compensation for ... the death of each employe, by an injury in the course of his employment, and such compensation shall be paid in all cases by the employer, without regard to negligence ____ Provided, That no compensation shall be paid when the ... death is intentionally self inflicted____</blockquote>

The issue then was whether the security guard’s suicide was preceded by a work-related injury. We noted that subsequent to the 1972 amendment of § 301, which deleted the phrase “violence to the physical structure of the body” from the definition of injury, the Commonwealth Court had expanded the concept of injury to include work-related mental injuries, as well as physical injuries, as compensable injuries. We concluded that the <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>referee correctly found that the suicide was preceded by a work-related illness — i.e., the severe mental disturbance the security guard suffered upon the accidental shooting of the suspect.</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[201,551,1148,512]]]'>The third issue raised by the employer in that appeal was whether the Commonwealth Court had erred in abandoning the <em>Sponatski </em>rule and in applying the chain of causation test to establish the causal connection between the injury and the employment relationship. We rejected the <em>Sponatski </em>rule which would require a claimant to establish that the employee took his life while possessed by an uncontrollable impulse or while in a delirium or frenzy and that the employee was not aware of the physical consequences of his act.</p>
    <p id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.6",601,[201,1089,1147,201]]]'>In doing so, we adopted the chain-of-causation test, the elements of which were described by the Commonwealth Court in <em>McCoy v.

    <p id="b601-8" data-blocks='[["BL_601.8",601,[199,1631,1148,511]]]'>We agreed with the Commonwealth Court that there was substantial competent evidence to support the award of benefits to the security guard’s widow under that test. Although we were not confronted in <em>Globe </em>with the issue now before us, our opinion in that case is instructive because it focuses on the significance of the existence of a work-related injury and the element of causation as part of the claimant’s burden of proof in establishing the compensability of a claim for benefits when an employee has committed suicide.</p>

Review of that line of cases by the Commonwealth Court demonstrates that the phraseology describes the requirement that the claimant produce evidence establishing that the mental illness is in fact a work-related injury. The requirement is an objective one, rather than a subjective one.</p>

A close look at Commonwealth Court’s language, however, and the facts of the individual cases supplies more accurate definition of the court’s vocabulary. In those cases, Commonwealth Court actually seemed to be looking for <em>changes </em>in the <em>status quo </em>because they stood out in relatively high relief against the landscape of the job. These changes — new positions, disciplinary measures, new assignments, loss of assistants — were not <em>uncharacteristic </em>of the occupations of the injured workers; they could certainly be dubbed “normal” happenings. They were, however, work events that were seemingly more easily and objectively identifiable among the multitude of everyday work events. (This is reminiscent of the need to define “accident” before the statute was amended to eliminate the accident requirement.) Thus, I conclude that Commonwealth Court initially and properly approached “subjective” mental disability claims by emphasizing the distinction between actual and imagined workplace stresses as a way to pinpoint causation.</p>

The court was looking merely for some objective evidence of work connection. A noticeable change in the status quo is capable of being pinpointed more easily as a causal factor. The focus of the court’s concern was not the “abnormality” of the stressful condition; that is, the court did not equate “abnormal” with the actual and the “normal” with the imagined. Rather, the essence of the court’s analyses was the distinction between the actual and the imagined. Actual, concrete, describable work events that <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>could be located in time and space, and for which “objective” evidence could be available, were the <em>sine qua non.</em>

In <em>Moonblatt, </em>Commonwealth Court determined that a lawyer who was disabled due to a work situation that included inadequate office space and help and a heavy caseload could not collect compensation <em>because such conditions characterized the work of many lawyers.

Many types of jobs are, by their very nature, high stress.

In addition, the decisions reviewed above and cited as examples of the application of the “abnormal working conditions” rule were decided without reference to it by name or in substance. Commonwealth Court made a significant, and in this writer’s opinion, an erroneous, shift from a standard that requires evidence of a connection between a worker’s disability and an actual work event, to an inquiry about whether the individual worker is “abnormal” because he or she has suffered mental disability under conditions where the average worker does not. The majority of this Court compounds that error by adopting the latter standard, and it does so without addressing how that standard complies with the spirit of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.</p>

No longer is the Court merely addressing the very real problems of proof of mental injury. Instead, the Court has adopted a test whereby the courts, as a matter of law, will judge whether a particular employee’s mental fortitude is normal. Because most police officers, most production line workers, and most advertising executives do not have mental breakdowns when confronted with particular stressful <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>events, the Court has deemed, in effect, that those individuals who do suffer mental disabilities should have been able to withstand these pressures.</p>
    <p id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[208,504,1147,632]]]'>The danger here is that where normal working conditions, especially those of police officers, are of admittedly “high stress,” individual claimants will succeed only if they show that they were confronted with virtually unimaginable and unpredictable events. Ultimately, the test will impose a standard of purported psychological normalcy. Even in cases where the referee finds that actual events triggered an actual injury, the claimant cannot recover. Although questionably qualified to do so, the majority would set itself (and compensation authorities) up to judge what kinds of stresses a “normal” police officer, advertising executive, or factory worker should be able to tolerate without breaking.</p>
    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.6",615,[207,1155,1148,738]]]'>Clearly, we do not set up this kind of requirement in the realm of physical injury. The Workmen’s Compensation Act no longer requires that a claimant be injured by “accident”, and it has never required that the events or conditions causing physical injury be more than normal working conditions. The fact that <em>other </em>employees were not physically injured under particular circumstances that led to one claimant’s physical injury is not relevant. The most recent applications of the test adopted today by the majority indicate that substantial injustices are being done to claimants who produce solid evidence of employment connection and who presumably would have qualified for compensation under the Commonwealth Court’s initial version of the test for work-related mental disability.</p>

The statute is intended to provide sure and efficient relief to those disabled because of their work. This humanitarian purpose is accomplished in part by foregoing a tort compensation scheme based on individual loss, in favor of a more generalized wage-replacement scheme. The statutory system, however, has always included important elements of individualization through which the system responds to the <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>differences and idiosyncrasies of individual workers.
