This vehicle was found in the parking lot of a Host Inn situated in Swatara Township, Dauphin County. The macabre discovery was made by a township police officer at approximately 5:20 a.m. on Monday, June 25, 1979. Earlier, at approximately 2:00 a.m., the same officer had observed the vehicle and noticed the hatch was up. At that point he intended to investigate further but was distracted by a radio dispatch requiring him to attend another matter. He subsequently returned to the area in response to an anonymous telephone call made to the Dauphin County police department. Later investigation revealed that the vehicle with the trunk open and an object protruding had been observed on June 24, 1979, at approximately 7:00 p.m.</p>

The victim was later identified as Susan Reinert, a teacher at the Upper Merion High School, located in Upper Merion Township where appellant herein was formerly the principal. A forensic pathologist determined that Ms. Reinert had sustained massive hemorrhaging in the eye area and abrasions over her body. He also opined that certain prominent bruises on the back of the body of the victim were consistent with the imprint of a chain. The cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation resulting from an overdose of morphine, which was consistent with having been caused by criminal agency. It was the pathologist’s opinion that death probably occurred during the morning hours of Sunday, June 24, 1979.</p>

Bradfield, a fellow English teacher at Upper Merion High School.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Reinert, believing Bradfield and she were to be married, began arranging her finances in favor of him, such as making him the primary beneficiary of her will and the sole beneficiary of $730,000.00 in life insurance benefits. The victim also had arranged to make Bradfield the guardian of her children in the event of her death. The arrangements were kept secret by Bradfield who told his friends, and his lover, Susan Myers, that Reinert was enamoured of him but that he was not interested in her, all the while promising Reinert he would marry her in the summer of 1979.</p>

There was no evidence of any relationship other than a professional one between Smith and the victim. The theory of the Commonwealth was that a conspiracy was formed between Smith and Bradfield to share in the monetary reward that would be available to Bradfield upon the untimely demise of Ms. Reinert. An additional reason offered was that Ms. Reinert was killed to assure that she would not disclose that Bradfield had offered perjured testimony on Smith’s behalf in an earlier, unrelated theft trial.</p>

It was further established that Bradfield appeared as a witness at the theft trial and offered alibi testimony on Smith’s behalf. Between the date of the theft and the trial of that matter in May of 1979, Bradfield and Smith established what the Commonwealth contended was a conspiratorial relationship. The Commonwealth in the instant trial called the witnesses from the theft trial to establish that Smith was indeed in the Sears store at the time of the theft. This evidence was offered to establish that Bradfield’s testimony in the former trial was untrue. An agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified that an unsigned, typed letter dated October 1978 (N.T. 4/21/86, Vol. 16, Exhibit 26) discussed a telephone code system as well as proposed alibi testimony for the theft trial. A fingerprint of Smith was found on an envelope which purportedly contained the letter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This evidence was offered to support the Commonwealth’s theory that a criminal conspiracy emerged from the effort of Smith to avoid conviction at the theft trial and continued over to the instant murders.</p>

Upon the discovery of the death of the mother, the police conducted a diligent search to ascertain the whereabouts of the children to no avail. The children had a close relationship with both their father and their paternal grandmother. Additionally, it was established that the children knew how to reach both their father and paternal grandmother by telephone and also were aware of where they lived. According to the testimony of both father and the grandmother, neither heard from the children after June 22, 1979. The Commonwealth produced evidence that a nationwide search was initiated by the FBI, which assigned eighteen agents full-time for five months in the investigation to ascertain the whereabouts of these children. These agents were further assisted in the search by each of the fifty-nine FBI field offices throughout the nation. Every lead received during this period was thoroughly investigated. The length of the absence, its unexplained character, the failure of the children to communicate with all known relatives and associates, the nature of the relationship of the children with their family and their dependency upon their family because of their minority all lead to the inevitable conclusion that they shared their mother’s fate and are no longer alive. Under these circumstances, the applicability of an inference of their death as a result of criminal agency is appropriate, and the jury could properly infer that those who caused the death of their mother also were responsible for a similar fate of the children.</p>

This witness was allowed to testify that Bradfield told him in the fall of 1978 that he, Bradfield, volunteered to serve as an alibi witness for Smith during the theft trial. It was subsequently made clear that the testimony that Bradfield was intended to offer on Smith’s behalf was untrue. He was permitted to relate a number of conversations on various occasions where Bradfield had described Smith as a dangerous individual who intended to harm a number of individuals, including Reinert. He testified that on one occasion Bradfield told him that Smith “was a screened hitman for the Mafia and wanted to kill a number of people, including Susan Reinert.” (N.T. 4/10/86, Vol. 9 at 1401.) He also stated that Smith had given him instructions on how to make a gun silencer. Further, additional statements in this vein attributed to Smith by Bradfield were: he, Smith, “knew how to take an ordinary household item and kill anyone with it”; (N.T. 4/10/86, Vol. 9 at 1407 and 4/15/86, Vol. 12 at 1792) that Smith was able to tape up and <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>immobilize a person very quickly; and that Smith stated that, “the best time to commit murders would be during holidays.” (N.T. 4/10/86, Vol. 9 at 1409 and 4/11/86, Vol. 10 at 1593.) Valaitis was also permitted to testify that Bradfield had urged him, on the weekend of the killings, to join Bradfield on a trip to the New Jersey shore. Susan Myers and Chris Pappas also accompanied Bradfield on this trip. Bradfield told the group that Smith was going to kill Ms. Reinert during that weekend and their presence with him (Bradfield) would serve to provide an alibi. On that occasion, the witnesses quoted Bradfield as saying, “I’m afraid this is it. I’m afraid this is the night that Jay C. Smith is going to kill Susan Reinert. I followed him. He circled her house 14 times, and I lost him in a hailstorm____” (N.T. 4/10/86, Vol. 9 at 1416.)

On that occasion, the witness, Bradfield, and Susan Myers had travelled to Florida for the express purpose of providing an alibi for Bradfield in the event that Smith did carry out his alleged threat to kill Reinert at that time.

Susan Myers, an admitted lover of Bradfield, was permitted to testify that Bradfield told her that Smith had committed thefts and had committed other murders, that “Dr. Smith intended to kill Susan Reinert” and that Dr. Smith “tended to kill on holidays” (N.T. 4/11/86, Vol. 12 at 1593). Wendy Zeigler, who was characterized as enamored of Bradfield, testified that Bradfield told her that Smith was “mentally unstable”, that he intended to kill Susan Reinert, and that he had a list of people to dispatch (N.T. 4/14/86, Vol. 11 at 1690). Chris Pappas was permitted to testify that Bradfield told him that Smith was under investigation for several crimes and that he “wanted to kill the judge, the people leading the investigation and people who were remotely associated with the investigation” (N.T. 4/15/86, Vol. 12 at 1785). Finally, Pappas testified that, after Bradfield received a call advising him of the murder of Susan Reinert, he stated, “... apparently Jay Smith had gone through with his threats and had killed her” (N.T. 4/15/86, Vol. 12 at 1833).</p>
