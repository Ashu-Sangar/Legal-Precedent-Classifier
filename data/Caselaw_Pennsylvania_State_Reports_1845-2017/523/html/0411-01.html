The judge in question, to be referred to herein as XYP for purposes of confidentiality, received a letter from the JIRB informing him that he was being admonished for a violation of Canon 3(A) of the Code of Judicial Conduct as a result of comments which he made in two opinions filed in one case. <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>XYP was unaware that such a letter might be forthcoming, for he had not been afforded any notice by the JIRB that his opinions were under review. The letter, dated May 12, 1989, and signed by the Executive Director and General Counsel for the JIRB, stated the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[259,591,1103,203]]]'>Following a review of the opinions written by you in [case name deleted], the Board has determined that its inquiries into this matter should be closed without any formal action being taken.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b497-6" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[259,808,1105,890]]]'>However, the Board has directed me to inform you that, in their view, the license taken by you in the opinions constitutes a violation of Canon 3(a) of the Code of Judicial Conduct which require[s] that a judge must be unswayed by partisan interest, public clamor, or fear of criticism and, most importantly, requires that a judge be patient, dignified, and courteous to lawyers and others with whom he deals in his official capacity. They have, therefore, directed me to admonish you that such conduct does not meet the standards required of the members of our judiciary by the Canons. The Board did consider all of the circumstances in this matter and, while they may understand the reasons behind your reactions, the Board concluded that the judicial immunity which a judge enjoys is a solemn and sacred trust that should not be used as a license for the types of opinions issued by you in this matter.</blockquote>

The relevant case was a class action involving damage claims against manufacturers of lead-based products which purportedly caused health-related injuries to a number of individuals. XYP denied the <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>motions for recusal, but then recused himself <em>sua sponte </em>on the ground that defense counsel had engaged in what XYP perceived as vicious and obstructive conduct designed to prevent him from presiding over the case.</p>

Canon 3(A) provides, in pertinent part, that a judge “should be unswayed by partisan interests” and “be patient, dignified, and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers, and others with whom he deals in his official capacity____”</p>
    <p id="b499-5" data-blocks='[["BL_499.6",499,[231,751,1148,313]]]'>The issue presented in this case is not, however, whether a violation of Canon 3(A) in fact occurred, but rather whether the JIRB had authority to issue a letter of admonition to XYP. Under Art. Y, § 18(e)-(h) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, it is clear that the JIRB lacked the necessary authority. Our Constitution provides:</p>
    <p id="b499-6" data-blocks='[["BL_499.7",499,[273,1083,1105,313]]]'>(e) The board [JIRB] shall keep informed as to matters relating to grounds for suspension, removal, discipline or compulsory retirement of justices or judges.

    <p id="b500-7" data-blocks='[["BL_500.6",500,[233,484,1148,575]]]'>The formal powers of the JIRB, under these constitutional provisions, are plainly limited to <em>investigating </em>the conduct of the judiciary and making <em>recommendations </em>to this Court regarding disciplinary sanctions. This Court, rather than the JIRB, has the exclusive constitutional power to impose sanctions. <em>See also Matter of Glancy, </em><a href="/pa/515/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="515 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1806077" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0201-01">515 Pa. 201</a>, 217, <a href="/pa/515/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="515 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1806077" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0201-01">527 A.2d 997</a>, 1005 (1987). By administering an admonition to XYP, thereby imposing a form of disciplinary sanction, the JIRB exceeded the scope of its authority. The admonition must, therefore, be expunged from records maintained by the JIRB.</p>
    <p id="b500-8" data-blocks='[["BL_500.7",500,[226,1082,1150,466]]]'>The Rules governing the JIRB specify that the JIRB can, of its own volition, or in response to allegations by a complainant, institute an investigation of alleged judicial improprieties. <em>See </em>Rule 1, “Preliminary Investigation.” We believe, however, that it is necessary to limit the investigatory power of the JIRB in cases such as this where the <em>sole </em>focus of inquiry is a judicial opinion. Otherwise, fear of investigation by the JIRB might unduly inhibit and chill judges in the performance of their duties.</p>

Judicial immunity rests upon a recognition of the necessity of preserving an independent judiciary, and reflects a belief that judges should not be hampered by fear of vexatious suits and personal liability. It also reflects a view that it would be unfair to expose judges to the dilemma of being required to render judgments while at the same time holding them accountable to the judgment of others.

XYP stated that the attorney had engaged in a "technique of exaggeration and distortion” and that he had attempted to secure a defeat for XYP in a retention election. XYP stated that the attorney had "weasel-worded” an affidavit, publicized "insidious and malicious falsehoods,” engaged in "an unworthy and unprofessional act” as well as "improprieties, dishonesty and unethical conduct,” and that his “beliefs and impressions are clever distortions and falsehoods ... [springing] ... from his own capacity for wrongful and vindictive conduct.” The attorney was also accused by XYP of “lying to the public and encouraging lying to the public,” of acting "out of a personal vindictiveness and for purposes of revenge," and of certain "despicable and dishonest” behavior in "obtain[ing] monies by false pretenses.” XYP further stated that the attorney had been characterized as an "ethical three dollar bill" and as "an ‘ethical midget’ who masquerades (with considerable success) as an ‘ethical giant’ [who] bores into positions of supposed morality and ethical aspiration ... for purposes of image and private profit." In addition, XYP stated that the attorney had engaged in a "wilful and deliberate breach of his fiduciary obligations” in a effort to “manipulate a choice of judges” in a "shocking and arrogant pursuit of power, control and money."</p>
