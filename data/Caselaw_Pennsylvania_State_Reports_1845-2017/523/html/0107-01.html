The court specifically rejected an “offense to offense formula” and made clear that “offense” meant the occurrence of the crime — not the conviction, which, in turn, means the point at which a jury renders a guilty verdict, a guilty plea is entered, or A.R.D. is accepted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The term “violating,” therefore, refers to the date on which the offense took place.

Our decision rests on a fundamental principle of statutory construction under 1 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. § 1921(b) (Purdon Supp.1986) (Statutory Construction Act): “When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” When “the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the judiciary must read its provisions in accordance with their plain meaning and common usage.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Although the application of a penal statute would subject a defendant to criminal liability, courts still are constrained to adhere to its straightforward meaning. <em>Commonwealth v.

Of particular relevance to the issue under review is our decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[204,970,1152,994]]]'>A court must construe each statute, therefore, according to its internal definition. <em>Commonwealth v. Lobiondo, </em><a href="/pa/501/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="501 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1782462" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0599-01">501 Pa. 599</a>, 603, <a href="/pa/501/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="501 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1782462" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0599-01">462 A.2d 662</a>, 664 (1983). In this case, the legislature deliberately used the words “violating” and “conviction” to anchor both ends of the computation. When the term “conviction” is used in a statute, it means “the ascertainment of the guilt of the accused and judgment thereon by the court,” stating our ancient rule in <em>Commonwealth v. Minnich, </em><a href="/pa/250/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="250 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1017026" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0363-01">250 Pa. 363</a>, 367, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20A.%20565" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="95 A. 565">95 A. 565</a>, 567 (1915). “Violating” in the common usage of the term refers to the time when the offensive conduct takes place, and it should not be confused with the point where the judicial process judges a violator to be accountable and then administers its punishment in accordance with due process. We read Section 3731(e)(1)(h) as meaning exactly what it says: a present violation and a previous conviction constitute the look-back period. The plain meaning of the statute affords no other interpretation.</p>
