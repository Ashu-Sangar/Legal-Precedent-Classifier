Suppression was based on two interrelated findings. First, the suppression court determined that insurance company representatives investigating a destructive fire at Appellees’ property were transformed into “agents” of the state by virtue of their extensive cooperation with the police. Second, the suppression court also found that the insurance company, now allegedly acting as an arm of law enforcement, coerced the Appellees by forcing them to answer questions and deliver documents under oath or forfeit payment under the policy and thereafter turned over the testimonial transcript and documents to the police who intended <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>to introduce the material at trial. It was this evidence given under oath which was suppressed.</p>

On April 29, 1982, Appellees filed a claim with the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company for $91,332.35. Several days after the fire, the Fire Marshall’s office concluded that it was arson. On two occasions shortly after, the Fire Marshall sought to question both Appellees who took the position that, in addition to lacking any knowledge of the fire, they would not answer without having first consulted an attorney. Concurrently, of course, Hartford was conducting its own inquiry through its Claims Supervisor.</p>

    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[235,596,1150,1217]]]'>On the factual posture of this case, nevertheless, we now decide that the court below erroneously suppressed the evidence gained from the testimony under oath. We predicate our findings on the evidence offered here. We draw attention, at the outset, to the fact that Attorney Henry emphatically warned Appellees and their attorney that the testimony was subject to discovery by anyone with proper authority. The trial court concluded that their agreement could be pierced only by a subpoena, but Attorney Henry specifically indicated that he would respond to “any other such documents requesting the exhibits or notes of testimony.” In any case, a subpoena is not required under the Arson Reporting Immunity Act which merely demands that the request for information be made “in writing,” which was done in this case. On this record, we determine that Appellees were warned properly that whatever they said or delivered could be divulged to an “appropriate authorized agency” pursuant to the statute. Appellees thereby waived whatever confidentiality they possessed. Furthermore, Appellees’ attorney was seeking confidentiality only on business and financial records. There is no evidence that the Fifth Amendment privilege was raised at all at the meeting with Attorney Henry.</p>

Attorney Henry’s warning was that “failure to respond <em>may </em>in and of itself be considered a material breach of the policy of insurance.” (Emphasis added.) That hardly amounts to coercion. Appellees could have insisted on awaiting the outcome of any criminal action before making statements in a civil proceeding. As Justice Flaherty once noted aptly: “Imposition of admittedly difficult choices is not necessarily unconstitutional.” <em>Commonwealth v.
