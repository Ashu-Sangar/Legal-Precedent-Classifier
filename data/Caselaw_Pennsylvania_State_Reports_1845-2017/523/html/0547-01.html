A trial was scheduled to begin on October 11, 1978, and on September 11, 1978, a jury was impanelled and sworn to hear the case. On October 10, 1978, the Court was notified by the District Attorney, through the Court Administrator, that an essential Commonwealth witness was ill and would not be available to testify the next day at trial. Consequently, the Commonwealth requested a continuance or a postponement in the alternative. On November 8, 1978, a second jury was selected and sworn, with the trial scheduled to begin on November 15, 1978. On November 13, 1978, before the start of trial, the appellee pleaded guilty to the charge of rape and the second jury was dismissed. Subsequently, the appellee was sentenced to one and one-half (IV2) to three (3) years imprisonment, pursuant to the agreed upon plea-bargain. There was no direct appeal from the judgment of sentence.</p>

Simultaneously, he also filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The lower court denied the petitions, and he appealed to the <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>Superior Court, which affirmed the judgment of the lower court on April 4, 1985 at No. 1316 Pittsburgh 1983. We subsequently denied his petition for allowance of appeal on September 23, 1985.</p>
    <p id="b634-5" data-blocks='[["BL_634.5",634,[240,558,1147,421]]]'>The appellee then filed a second PCHA petition, <em>pro se, </em>in which he argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the declaration of mistrial on double jeopardy grounds, and that PCHA counsel was also ineffective for failing to raise trial counsel’s ineffectiveness as to this issue. The petition was summarily dismissed by the Elk County Court of Common Pleas, and a <em>pro se </em>appeal was then filed with the Superior Court.</p>

The original district attorney on the case, the original defense counsel, and the previously unavailable Commonwealth witness all testified at the hearing.

    <p id="b634-8" data-blocks='[["BL_634.8",634,[238,1627,1147,740]]]'>On appeal four issues were raised. The court considered only the issue of whether the respondent’s prior counsel were ineffective for failing to raise the double jeopardy issue. The Superior Court found that the trial court abused its discretion in finding “manifest necessity” to declare a mistrial, which consequently had the effect of placing the appellee in double jeopardy. The Court noted that when the trial court declared a mistrial, no contemporaneous record was made which would have reflected the evidence presented, if any, the understanding of the court or the parties, or whether appellant had agreed to the grant of a mistrial. Accordingly, the trial court’s order was reversed, the judgment of sentence arrested, and the respondent was discharged. The Commonwealth now appeals.</p>

However, irrespective of the procedural issues raised by the parties, the fact the appellee pleaded guilty to the charge of rape is of vital significance. As we have held:</p>

The appellee is utilizing a procedure generously afforded to him by the PCHA legislation to attack another conviction in an entirely unrelated matter in the hopes of diminishing the length of the sentence for his second conviction.
