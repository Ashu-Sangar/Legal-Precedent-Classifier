The appeal centers around two issues; (1) the intent of an employee to voluntarily quit, and (2) the sufficiency of “necessary and compelling” reasons to excuse voluntary termination.</p>
    <p id="b128-4" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[236,509,1150,1228]]]'>This appeal is the result of a heated dispute between the agent of an employer, Jacob Siegel Company, and two employees of that company. The appellants were employed at that company as sewing machine operators. They were paid on a piece-work basis until sometime in late May, 1982.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At that time new machinery was introduced to the plant and pursuant to a union-management agreement the employees were to be temporarily paid at an hourly rate, while they became accustomed to the new machine. After a few days of the hourly pay the employees were switched back to the piece-work rate they had been paid previously. The appellants protested the change because they were fearful that they would not be able to produce an adequate income on this pay scale, but the manager assured the employees that any problem in the pay scale would be worked out with the union. The appellants were not placated by these assurances and told their manager that they were going to union headquarters. The manager replied that they could leave if they did not like the situation, “there’s the door”. He also stated “as soon as you walk out from that door, out of my place, you quit the job.” Appellants then left the premises and went directly to the union headquarters where they were told that they had been fired.</p>

An appeal was filed, and hearings were held before a referee. That referee affirmed the earlier determination. Separate appeals were taken to the Board, and it confirmed the denial of benefits. A joint appeal was taken to the Commonwealth <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>Court, and a divided panel affirmed the decision of the Board by Memorandum opinion <em>{Doyle, J., </em>Palladino, J.; Colins, J., dissenting). That court held that the employees had voluntarily quit their jobs because they had left the premises without permission after being given a <em>real </em>choice of working or resigning. This allowance of appeal was granted to resolve the issue of whether the decision of the Commonwealth Court is contrary to existing precedent. For the following reasons we conclude that the decision of that court and the earlier determinations, that these employees voluntarily quit their jobs, were proper according to the existing precedent in this Commonwealth and therefore must be affirmed.</p>

Case law has established “a finding of voluntary termination is essentially precluded unless the claimant had a conscious intention to leave his employment.” <em>See, e.g., Roberts v. UCBR, </em><a href="/pa-commw/61/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="61 Pa.

Furthermore, the case law supports the appellants’ contention that leaving the premises is not enough to determine intent to voluntarily terminate employment. <em>See, e.g., Philadelphia Parent Child Center, Inc. v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-commw/44/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="44 Pa.

However, where an employee without any action of the employer resigns, leaves or quits employment that action amounts to a voluntary leaving. <em>See, e.g., Helsel v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-commw/54/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="54 Pa.

The only restriction upon that privilege is the requirement that the employers act reasonably and in good faith. <em>See, e.g., Donaldson, supra; Dinges v.

    <p id="b130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_130.6",130,[243,1157,1152,1168]]]'>In the instant case, the appellants suggest that they did not voluntarily quit but were terminated when the manager stated “there’s the door.” They cite as authorit<em>y White v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-super/200/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="200 Pa.

However, these cases are distinguishable. In <em>White, </em>the petitioner was not offered a choice of remaining or leaving. Here the appellants had an alternative to the termination. They could have remained on the premises for the completion of the day and taken up a complaint at the union headquarters at a later time. It does not appear from these facts that the employer in this instance acted unreasonable or in bad faith. Here, the employer was merely attempting to return the employees to their previous form of payment within the limits of the union management agreement. The manager attempted to quell the financial concerns of the employees by stating that the union would work out any problems with the pay scale. These employees were offered a real choice between alternatives and chose to leave their employment. <em>See, e.g., Helsel, supra.</em>

The employer offered the appellants an opportunity to remain employed but refused to allow them an opportunity to leave the premises, during working hours, to speak to a union representative. It was not unreasonable for the employer to require the employees to complete the full working day. Moreover, the record does not suggest that this requirement would have precluded the employees’ immediate access to the union. Without any effort on the part of the employees to preserve their employment, the characterization by the manager, that the act of walking out the door would be an act of quitting, must be accepted. <em>See, e.g., Ryan v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-commw/68/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="68 Pa.

    <p id="b133-7" data-blocks='[["BL_133.9",133,[196,1238,1149,527]]]'>I dissent. The issue presented for our consideration in this case is whether appellants, Lea Monaco and Alba Caruso, had a conscious intention of quitting their jobs when, after a heated dispute with their manager, which dispute was conducted in broken English and concerned significant changes in their wages, they left their place of employment to consult briefly with union representatives, fully intending to return to their jobs once they had been assured that they would be able to produce an adequate income under the altered pay structure.</p>

Moreover, an employee’s act of resigning, leaving, or quitting employment does not amount to “voluntarily leaving work” under section 802(b) of the Unemployment Compensation Act, 43 P.S. § 802(b), unless he or she does so “without action by the employer”. <em>Department of Labor and Industry v.

    <p id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[230,442,1149,740]]]'>In the case sub judice, the employer precipitated the crisis facing appellants by abruptly changing back to a piece-work rate after a trial period at minimum wage that was set in place to assure adequate income while appellants learned to use new machinery on their jobs. Appellants’ manager told appellants that any shortages in income would be worked out with the union, and appellants, evidently not satisfied with this explanation, told their manager that they wished to consult with union representatives before subjecting themselves to earnings at the piece-work rate. This was not an unreasonable request, but appellants’ manager refused to let them leave and gave them an ultimatum, i.e., “as soon as you walk out from that door, out of my place, you quit the job.”</p>
    <p id="b134-5" data-blocks='[["BL_134.6",134,[227,1205,1148,740]]]'>The majority of this Court is of the opinion that the employer gave appellants a reasonable alternative to the termination in that “[t]hey could have remained on the premises for the completion of the day and taken up a complaint at the union headquarters at a later time.” Maj. op. at 130. This, of course, is a mischaracterization, because there was no offer made by the employer for appellants to consult with their union representatives at a later time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> It is <em>not </em>unreasonable for employees to seek counsel from union representatives when work changes have been presented on the job by the employer. In the same way, it is not unreasonable for a shop boss to consult with his or her supervisor when a dispute arises between the shop boss and a subordinate employee.</p>

To give appellants the “opportunity” to earn even less income than <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>minimum wage is not a “reasonable alternative”. To hold otherwise smacks of gross insensitivity to the concerns of those who labor most arduously for the least remuneration in this society, and does not fulfill the mandated humanitarian objectives of the Unemployment Compensation Act.</p>
