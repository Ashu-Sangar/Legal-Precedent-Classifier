    "head_matter": "Pence v. Poet, Appellant.\nPractice, C. P. \u2014 Affidavit of defense \u2014 Reinstating rule.\nWhere the plaintiff, in order to accelerate the trial of the case has the court discharge his rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and thereafter the defendant rules the case out for arbitration in order to keep it off the trial list, the court may in its discretion grant a second rule for judgment.\nArgued April 20, 1908.\nAppeal, No. 208, Jan. T., 1907, by-defendant, from order of C. P. Blair Co., March T., 1907, No. 238, making absolute rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense in case of Charles A. Pence and Cary A. Swisher, trading and doing business as Pence & Swisher, v. Philip W. Poet.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Potter and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nRule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nBell, P. J., filed the following opinion :\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorney, on his own motion, before argument of the first rule for judgment, had said rule marked discharged in order to place the case on the trial list. Defendant, in order evidently to keep the case off the trial list, entered a rule to refer. Under such circumstances it would seem but right and just to reinstate the first rule for judgment, or grant a. second rule, and I know of no law, rule of court, or precedent preventing such procedure. The fact that the case is ruled out for reference, does not prevent the court from entering judgment for want of an affidavit of defense: Act of May 14, 1874, P. L. 159.\nError assigned was the order of the court making absolute rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nH. Price Graffius, for appellant.\nJ. S. Leisenring, of Leisenring cfe Walters, for appellees.\nMay 18, 1908 :"
