        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice MESTREZAT,\nThis is an appeal by John P. Yan Leer from the decree of the court of common pleas No. 4, of Philadelphia county, in refusing to award him in fee the undivided one-seventh of two-thirds of the real estate of his deceased father. It would certainly give us pleasure to grant the desire of the appellant\u2019s mother and brothers and sisters and decree the property in question to the appellant free and discharged of the trust. Our decree, however, cannot be based upon our pleasure but upon the interpretation of the will of the testator. We are clear that the learned master interpreted correctly the codicil to the testator\u2019s will, and Ave agree with his conclusion \u201c that the trust is not a special trust but an active spendthrift trust, and that the legal fee is not in John.\u201d\nThere can be no doubt that the testator by his will intended to give his son John the undivided one-seventh of the two-thirds of his real estate in fee. His will, executed March 28, 1894, so declared. But it is equally clear that for reasons satisfactory to himself he had changed his mind and his intention when- he executed the codicil to his will on May 22, 1896. That codicil does not affect- the interests of any of the other six children who had been given, by the will, an equal interest in the testator\u2019s estate. The codicil dealt exclusively with John P. Yan Leer\u2019s interest or share, and it plainly and explicitly disposed of that share. It is contended by John that in executing the codicil the sole purpose of the testator was to prevent the woman whom John had married, and from whom he had separated, deriving any benefit or advantage from the income or principal of the estate; that the object was to create a special trust for that purpose, and that the divorce of the appellant from his wife executed the trust and accomplished the object of the testator. The learned master, however, as we have seen, did not agree with that construction of the codicil, but held that the testator intended to and did create an active spendthrift trust of the estate which had been given to John in fee by the will.\nThe sole basis of the appellant\u2019s contention is the supposed intention of the testator obtained dehors the will. The mother and brothers and sisters of John, remainder-men under the codicil, declare in the paper of June 29, 1907, that the only purpose the testator had in executing the codicil was to exclude John\u2019s wife from participating in any part of the testator\u2019s estate and that the trust created by the codicil for John was fully executed and terminated by the divorce of John from his wife. This contention is in direct opposition to the language of the codicil. It revokes the devise to John in the will, and devises to the testator\u2019s executors the same interest given John in the will, but in trust to receive the income and pay it to John for his own use and without anticipation, \u201cand so that the same shall never at any time or in any manner be liable for his debts, contracts or engagements, or subject to any distress, execution, or levy therefor, or to any process, whatever, on the part of any creditor or creditors of my said son, and expressly so that it shall not be liable for the support, contracts, debts or engagements of his present wife, Maud D. Yan Leer.\u201d The codicil, after making this provision and authorizing John by will to appoint the principal of his share at his pleasure, makes an alternative disposition of the estate on failure of John to appoint. At the conclusion, the codicil also declares that John\u2019s wife should in no event or in any circumstances derive any benefit from the income or principal of the trust created for John. It is clear, and no authorities need be cited to sustain the proposition, that had the parts of the codicil referring specifically to John\u2019s wife been omitted, there would have been created an active spendthrift trust. This court has declared time and again that such is the effect of substantially the same language as that used in this codicil. The instrument itself declares the intention of the testator to annul and revoke the devise in fee made to John in the will. The intention to revoke is manifest and is expressed in apt terms. In language equally certain and unequivocal, a trust is created and the purpose is definitely and unequivocally declared in language not to be misunderstood. The income from the principal was to be paid into John\u2019s own hands. He had no right of anticipation ; neither could it be subjected to his debts, contracts or engagements; nor was it liable to distress, execution or levy by any creditor. Standing alone this language is so clear and comprehensive that there can be no basis whatever for any doubt as to the testator\u2019s intention. That intention is made clearer by the devises over of the principal of the estate. They show that the principal was not to vest absolutely in John. It is true that he is given the power of appointment. He may dispose of it by will, but that discloses no intention to vest in him the fee and permit him to dispose of it for his own use during his life. The power, therefore, does not change the otherwise clearly expressed intention of the testator to create an active spendthrift trust.\nIt is contended, however, that the intention to create a special trust to protect the estate against John\u2019s wife is disclosed by the express prohibition in the codicil against liability \u201cfor the support, contracts, debts or engagements of his present wife, Maud D. Yan Leer, \u201d and the provision that the wife shall derive no benefit from the income or principal of the trust estate. But these provisions of the codicil do not modify, limit or in any way change the spendthrift trust previously declared in the codicil. Eliminating the special reference to John\u2019s wife in the codicil, the intention of the testator, expressed in apt language, is that the trustees shall hold the principal of the estate for the persons named in the codicil, and that the income shall be devoted exclusively for John\u2019s personal use, protected from any claim of his creditors and against any writ or process on any judgment or debt against Mm. Unquestionably the testator\u2019s intention was to defeat any claim that John\u2019s wife might have or obtain against the trust estate, but his intention is equally clear and expressed in language of no doubtful signification that he intended to extend a protection to the estate against any and all other claims and debts which John might incur or become liable for. This intention is as apparent and clearly expressed as the intention to defeat the wife\u2019s claims against the trust estate. If the testator intended simply to protect the trust estate against John\u2019s wife, he has failed to do so in language that can be so construed by any known rules of interpretation. He has declared a spendthrift trust pure and simple, and the special reference to John\u2019s wife has neither added to nor detracted from it.\nIn Hawkins on Wills (2d Am. ed.), p. 1, it is said: \u201c In construing a will, the object of the courts is to ascertain, not the intention simply, but the expressed intentions of the testator, i. e., the intention which the will itself, either expressly or by implication, declares: or (which is the same' thing) the meaning of the words \u2014 the meaning, that is, which the words of the will, properly interpreted, convey.\u201d In Woelpper\u2019s Appeal, 126 Pa. 562, we said (p. 572): \u201c It is often said .... that \u00a3 the question in expounding a wTill is not what the testator meant, but what is the meaning of his words.\u2019 Put by this it was never intended to say that the testator\u2019s meaning when apparent can be disregarded, but, that it cannot be got at aliunde, by what he might have meant, or even what under the circumstances perhaps he would have meant, but only by what he said. The search is confined to' his language, but its object is still his meaning.\u201d And in Huber\u2019s Appeal, 80 Pa. 318, this court said (p. 358): \u00a3\u00a3 When the meaning is clear from language that is unmistakable, the instrument interprets itself.\u201d\nIn construing the codicil and will of Joseph W. Yan Leer, we cannot go outside of its terms or apply any artificial canons of construction. The language is clear and unmistakable and discloses the testator\u2019s intention. It is not open to doubt, it creates no necessity for going outside of the instrument itself to ascertain the testator\u2019s intention. It may be that his chief and possibly his only purpose in revoking the devise to his son John and in creating the trust was to prevent John\u2019s wife from participating in his estate, but if so it does not appear from the codicil itself, which manifests a clear and unmistakable intention to create an active spendthrift trust and thereby protect John and his interests from assault from any and all quarters.\nWe concur in the conclusion reached by the learned master and approved by the court below, and, therefore, the decree is affirmed.",

Van Leer.\nWills \u2014 Trusts and trustees \u2014 Spendthrift trust \u2014 Provisions against son\u2019s wife.\nWhere a testator by a codicil revokes an absolute devise previously given to his son in his will, and in apt words creates for the son a spendthrift trust pure and simple, the fact that the codicil also contains an express prohibition against liability for the \u201csupport, contracts, debts or engagements,\u201d of the son\u2019s present wife, naming her, and directs that such wife shall derive no benefit from the income or principal of the trust estate, the court has no power after the death of the testator and after the son has secured a divorce from his wife, to declare the trust ended, and direct a payment and transfer of the trust estate to the son free and discharged from the trust.\nIn construing a will, the object of the courts is to ascertain, not the intention simply, but the expressed intention of the testator, i. e., the intention which the will itself, either expressly or by implication, declares: or (which is the same thing) the meaning of the words \u2014 the meaning, that is, which the words of the will, properly interpreted, convey.\nWhen the meaning of a will is clear from language that is unmistakable, the instrument interprets itself.\nArgued March 24, 1908.\nAppeal, No. 65, Jan. T., 1908, by John P. Van Leer, from decree of C. P. No. 4, Phila. Co., June T., 1904, No. 3,388, dismissing exceptions to master\u2019s report in case of Edward Shippen Van Leer v. George R. Van Leer, Bella Van Leer, Joseph W. Van Leer, Jr., May Van Leer, John P. Van Leer (appellant), and Elizabeth N. Van Leer, his \"Wife, Helen Van Leer, Arabella Van Leer and George R. Van Leer, Surviving Executor and Trustee under the Will of Joseph W. Van Leer, deceased.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Brown, Mestrezat, Potter and Elkin, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for partition.\nFrom the record it appeared that the bill was filed by one of the seven children of the testator, praying for the partition of the real estate of the testator. The averment of the bill, so far as material to the present controversy, was that each of six of the testator\u2019s children, including the complainant, was entitled to an undivided one-seventh share of two-thirds of the testator\u2019s real estate, in fee; and that a like share of a remaining child of the testator, John P. Yan Leer, the appellant, was vested in George R. Yan Leer, surviving executor and .trustee under the will of the testator and codicil thereto, in trust for the said John P. Yan Leer, during his life.\nNo answer was filed to the bill, and a de\u00f3ree pro confesso was entered, directing partition to be made, and referring the proceedings, \u201c by agreement of the parties,\u201d to a master.\nSubsequently, under order of the court, the master \u00e9xpos\u00e9d the real estate to public sale, and realized therefrom the net sum of $38,980, one-third of which he awarded in' trust for testator\u2019s widow during her life, and the remaining two-thirds he divided into seven parts, six of which he distributed among six of the testator\u2019s children, reserving for further consideration and report, upon request of all the parties in interest, the contention of testator\u2019s seventh child, John P. Yan Leer, that the trust created as to him by the testator\u2019s codicil to his will was a special trust intended solely to bar his then wife, Maud D. V an Leer, from any participation in his share, and that he, being now divorced from Maud D. Yan Leer, was entitled to receive his distributive one-seventh share or $3,712.38, free and discharged of the trust.\nAll the codistributees filed with the master a written declaration that they were satisfied that the testator\u2019s purpose in creating the trust as to John P. Yan Leer had been accomplished by the divorce of the latter and his former wife, Maud D. Yan Leer, and setting forth their reasons in the nature of a case stated. George R. Yan Leer signed this instrument individually, but \u201c not as executor or trustee.\u201d\nThe master awarded the distributive share of John P. Yan Leer to George R. Yah Leer, surviving executor and trustee under the will and codicil of the testator, and dismissed exceptions filed to his report by John P. Yan Leer.\nOn appeal, the lower court, without opinion filed, dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the master\u2019s report.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nHoward Benton. Lewis, for appellant.\nThe purpose of the testator, in placing in trust by codicil the fee previously given the appellant by will, was to exclude the woman whom appellant had married, and from whom he had separated, from the exercise of any marital rights against his estate : Stambaugh\u2019s Est., 135 Pa. 585 ; Postlethwaite\u2019s App., 68 Pa. 477; Tyson\u2019s Est., 191 Pa. 218 ; Hoge v.

Levy, 163 Pa. 647.\nMay 4, 1908:\nThe divorce of the appellant from. his former wife accomplished the purpose of the codicil; the trust therein created is executed, and, the legal and equitable title coalescing in the appellant, he is entitled to the full control of what, before the trust was created, was absolutely his : Koenig\u2019s App., 57 Pa. 352; Lee\u2019s Est., 207 Pa. 218 ; Bush\u2019s App., 33 Pa. 85 ; Steacy v. Rice, 27 Pa. 75 ; Smith v. Starr, 3 Whart. 62; Ogden\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 501.\n- No paper-book or argument for appellee."
