The question turned on whether Farquhar, who actually receiv\u00e9d the money, did so as attorney for defendant, or in some other capacity. The court found that Farquhar had no authority, in fact, to receive it, nor did he occupy any such professional relation to defendant as to raise an implication of such authority. The evidence was carefully examined by the learned judge, the facts clearly found, and the conclusions accurately drawn. \u00a5e see no reason to disturb them. Decree affirmed.",

Before Marr, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had received certain sums of money arising from granting licenses, that these moneys belonged to the plaintiff, and h\u00e1d not been paid over. The court found as a fact that the payments had been made to Fergus G. Farquhar, who, although local attorney for defendant, had no authority, either expressly or by implication, to receive the moneys, and that Farquhar had retained such moneys and appropriated them to his own use'. The court dismissed the bill.\nError assigned was decree of the court dismissing the bill.\nJ. O. Ulrich, with him L. C. Scott, for appellant.\nAbraham M. Beitler and Geo. M. Hoads, with them W. G.
