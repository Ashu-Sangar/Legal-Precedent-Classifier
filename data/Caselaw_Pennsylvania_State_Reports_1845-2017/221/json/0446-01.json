E. Stayman, The Failor Farm at a valuation of $12,500 from which they will receive the income after the death of my wife their Grandmother, and at their death it will descend to their issue.\u201d\nThe statement that they will receive the income after the death of their grandmother had reference to a charge on the land of its full rental value in her favor for life, and it may be doubted whether there was an intention to give less than an absolute estate. If the intention was to give a life estate only, the rule in Shelley\u2019s case applies to the devise. The word \u201cissue\u201d in a will means,-prima facie, \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d and an estate tail was created into which the life estate merged, and which, by virtue of the act of 1855, was enlarged to a fee : Carroll v. Burns, 108 Pa. 386.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
