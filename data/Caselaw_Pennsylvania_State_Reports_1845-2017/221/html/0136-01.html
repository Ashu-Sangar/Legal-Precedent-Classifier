The defendant prior to this time was employed in a telephone exchange and was sick for about three weeks and was at home with the defendant at her father’s house, during which time she persuaded the plaintiff to give her the bulk of her property after her death. From her own testimony the defendant commenced the conversation about the property. The plaintiff says that the defendant said that they were like sisters and that she would be the next to get the property. And also that she said she could not work at the telephone long any more and she thought already she would kill herself about it. That her brothers and sisters had homes of their own and she had none. The defendant also admits that the plaintiff was to have a life interest in the said house and lot and yet not one word <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>about it was said when she employed an attorney to prepare the deed, or did she say anything when the plaintiff executed the deed. The defendant did not show in this proceeding after she admitted the existence of a confidential relation that no deception was used and that all was fair, open, voluntary and well understood by the defendant. Even after the deed was executed and delivered to her (the old lady), the plaintiff was permitted to treat this house and lot as if no transfer of title had taken place and she was kept in ignorance of the full import of the instrument she had signed in the office of Mr. Adams until the defendant placed the deed on record about a year afterwards. The defendant not only succeeded in deceiving her aunt, the plaintiff, but also her counsel of the true facts. It is idle to suggest a parol agreement as to the rents.</p>
