By another clause he directed that if the bequest to charitable institutions for any reason should not take effect, or be held to be void, then he gave all moneys intended to be given to charitable purposes to his sister and brother, or to the survivor of them to be divided between them and to be disposed of by them or the survivor of them in any manner which they may deem proper and useful. A codicil revoked the charitable provisions set forth in the will and gave pecuniary legacies to certain specified charities, and further directed that the residue of his estate directed to be held in trust for <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>the benefit of his sister should at her death be paid over to such charities as he should thereafter name in writing to his executors, or by provision in a future codicil, but if he should fail to make such designation then to pay over and distribute the same to such charitable institution or institutions as his sister should by will appoint. A subsequent codicil revoked the provision for the payment of the whole income to testator’s sister, and directed his executors to pay her for life an amount per annum which was much less than the total income. After testator’s death it appeared that he had failed to name in writing to the executors, or in a codicil, any charities as beneficiaries of the residue. <em>Held, </em>that the provision in the will in favor of the brother and sister, if the charitable bequests should fail, was not revoked by the codicils, and that no intestacy arose as to the corpus of the residuary estate.</p>

The retention of this item, especially in view of the revocation of so many other items, is very significant, and there is no right to disregard it or to say that its operation is to be confined to the terms of the will as it originally stood.

But this exception from the operation of the statute manifestly cannot apply where there is no charitable object having a vested, or, at least, a contingent interest at the time the accumulations occur, and especially where, as in the present case, such object may never come into existence at all. Under these circumstances there would be an intestacy as to the surplus income, as the auditing judge has held there is, unless it'is prevented by the provisions of Item 28 of the will, republished by this codicil and those which come after it.</p>

He did not know that the court would hold that the statute would apply as against an unknown and unascertainable charity. This, however, did not affect his intention, and thus is presented the very case contemplated by Item 28 of the republished will: “ Should my said foregoing bequests to charitable institutions for any reason not take effect or be held to be void, then I give and bequeath all moneys intended by this my said will to be given to charitable purposes to my sister, Mary A. Dobbins, and my brother, Murrell Dobbins, or <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>to the survivor of them, to be divided equally between them, and to be disposed of by them, or the survivor of them, in any manner that they may deem proper and right.” “ Moneys intended ” for charities are, if the charitable intention should be held ineffective, covered by this item, and the “ intention ” may be manifested by implication no less than by express provision.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[267,711,1182,905]]]'>It is true that “ the heir will not be disinherited except by express words or necessary implication,” but where the will shows unequivocally, as it does in this case, that he has been excluded, the principle has little application where the claim by the heir is based upon a codicil: Norris’s Estate, <a href="/pa/217/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="217 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="953610" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0560-01">217 Pa. 560</a> ; 15 Pa. Dist. Eep. 449. The right to dispose of his property by will is conferred upon the owner by a statute no less explicit in its terms than is that which provides for its disposition where there is no will, and the very purpose of a will is to prevent the operation of the intestate laws. An intestacy will never be permitted where by any fair interpretation of the will, or any reasonable understanding of its language, it can be avoided. An intestacy can seldom, if ever, take place where there is a gift of the residue, for such gift will, in general, take in whatever is not well disposed of. Here there is a double disposition of the residue; first, to charities to be defined in the future, and, second, if they should fail, to the brother and sister.</p>
