Whether or not that be so, the cases referred to seem to me, beyond all controversy, to sustain the defendant’s point. Though the language of the wills which were under construction in the cases just cited was not in any instance identical with the language of the will now under construction, every essential element in the present case which would go to determine the nature of the estate that was taken by Mary A. Smith was covered by the cases mentioned, and, under those cases, I have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that, at the time when the mortgage was made, the law of Pennsylvania was to the effect that Mary A. Smith held a vested estate in remainder in the premises in question, and, therefore, that she, along with her mother, Mary Jane Patterson, and her husband, were possessed of.the entire estate in the property, and had full legal power to execute the mortgage and thereby subject the entire estate in the property to the lien of the mortgage. At the same time, it must be admitted, and it is admitted by counsel for both the plaintiffs and the defendant, that the law of Pennsylvania upon the subject under consideration has since been differently stated, and that if the present controversy is to be determined according to the view which is now taken in our state of the nature of such an estate as was created by the will, it. would be necessary to reach the conclusion that Mary A. Smith took only a contingent estate under the will, that upon her death the entire estate in fee vested in her children, the plaintiffs, and- that, therefore, the estate of the plaintiffs is not bound by the mortgage.</p>

      <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>It is true, as a general principle, that when courts of á given jurisdiction depart from a rule of construction applied, e. g., to the language of wills, and adopt another at variance therewith, it is to be regarded as an expression of a judgment by the courts that the law as modified was always the correct view to take of a particular question, and that earlier expositions of the law were erroneous. It is, however, equally true that, where judicial decisions have given to certain language á definite construction and meaning, the intention of the testator in the use of such language can only be reached by giving to the words employed by him in his will the meaning which had been fixed by judicial determination at the time when the will was made or when it went into effect. Such a course would seem to be necessary in order to avoid the thwarting of a testator’s intentions and to prevent the doing of great wrong to those.who may have acquired estates or entered into obligations upon the faith of the law being that which it had been decided to be. In the construction of every will it is incumbent upon the courts to endeavor to ascertain the intention of the testator. To do this is of’ more importance than to adhere to a rule of construction. In any case, how can the intention of the testator in the use of certain words be better determined than by knowing what meaning the courts have attached to such words ? In the case in hand, William Patterson used certain language disposing of his real-estate. Ab-cording to the settled construction given to such language by the courts at the time he made his will and when- he died, his daughter, Mary A. Smith, took a vested estate in -remainder in the property which is now in controversy. Must we not necessarily draw the inference that he intended she should have such an estate, and, therefore, that she should have the right, along with her mother and husband, to execute-such a mortgage as the defendant took? On the faith of the law as it was then interpreted the defendant presumably parted with money, to secure the return of which the mortgage was given. The rights of the defendant may be regárded as having then been settled according to a proper interpretation to be given to the will of the testator. Under such circumstances, I deem it entirely proper to conclude that the action of the testator’s widow and daughter in making the mortgage in question-'ivas <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>strictly in accordance with the rights and estate which the testator intended to confer upon them, and that the rights of the defendant should now be determined with reference to the character of the estate which, under the law as it then existed, the testator must be regarded as having intended to confer upon his daughter, and not according to what the courts at the present time would regard as the intention of a testator under a different view as to the construction to be placed upon such language as was used in the will in question. I may add that it is somewhat indicative of the intention of the testator that in his will he charged certain annuities and legacies <em>“ </em>upon the said remainder and residue of my estate herein devised to my daughter, Mary Jane and her children, in order that they may be paid out of the same.” The language just quoted apparently indicates that it was the understanding of the testator that the entire estate in the property in question would, under the provisions of his will, vest in his daughter, Mary Jane, and her children, and this view tends to corroborate the opinion already expressed by me.</p>

This is the general rule, but it is not to be applied-in all cases without discrimination. On the subject of interpretation of wills it meets the cardinal and controlling principle that the intention of the testator must prevail. It is undeniable that this principle had in certain classes of cases been so overlaid and hedged in by arbitrary canons of construction as to be<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>come a subordinate instead of a d'ominant rule.

The canon itself grew out of the preference in the policy of the law, in all doubtful cases, for vested rather than contingent interests. ' Like all artificial rules it had the constant tendency to become an arbitrary fetter, instead of a mere instrument for the ascertainment of the testator’s intent. The policy of the later cases in this state, if not everywhere, is to get back to the true rule of looking only to the actual intent. There is no sound reason in the nature'of things why the actual meaning 'of the person using the words should not be sought in the case of a will exactly as it is in the case of a contract.”</p>
