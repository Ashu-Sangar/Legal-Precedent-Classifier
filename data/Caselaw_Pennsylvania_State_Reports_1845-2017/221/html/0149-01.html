    <p id="b178-9" data-blocks='[["BL_178.14",178,[258,1489,1180,706]]]'>The bill in this case was for an injunction to restrain the defendant, an electric passenger railway company, from crossing at grade the tracks of the plaintiff’s road in the borough of Danville. The proposed crossing was upon the main street of the borough, which was thirty-six feet in width between the curb lines and closely built up on both sides. At this place fourteen regular trains cross the street daily and a full view of the plaintiff’s tracks cannot be had in either direction at a point more than a few feet from them. An order dissolving a preliminary injunction was reversed and the injunction reinstated to maintain the status quo until final hearing : see <a href="/pa/211/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="211 Pa. 591" data-case-ids="940118" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0591-01">211 Pa. 591</a>. On final hearing, on the same testimony, the injunction was dissolved and a grade crossing allowed, subject to regulations imposed by the court.</p>

    <p id="b179-4" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[205,624,1182,1228]]]'>In reaching this conclusion the wrong test was applied. The question was not as to the comparative dangers of an overhead and a grade crossing, nor as to the extent of the danger of the latter, but whether it was reasonably practicable to avoid a crossing at grade. The clear and explicit mandate of the Act of June 19, 1871, P. L. 1360, is that “ If, in the judgment of the court, it is reasonably practicable to avoid the grade crossing, they shall by their process avoid a crossing at grade.” The policy of the state as here declared has been given the fullest effect in an unbroken line of cases extending from Pittsburg, etc., Railroad Co. v. S. W. Penna. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/77/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="77 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="436305" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0173-01">77 Pa. 173</a>, the first case that arose under the act, to Penna.

The extent to which the risk may be reduced by the exercise of care, and the cost of constructing an overhead crossing, are not elements in determining the question: Delaware <em>&amp; </em>Hudson Canal Co. v. St. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/180/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="180 Pa. 636" data-case-ids="888314" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0636-01">180 Pa. 636</a> ; Penna. Railroad Co. v.

Experience teaches with absolute certainty that a 'grade crossing is unsafe and that its existence is a standing menace to human life. This fact should be kept constantly in mind in adjudicating the rights of railway cpmpanies in proceedings under the act of 1871.”</p>
