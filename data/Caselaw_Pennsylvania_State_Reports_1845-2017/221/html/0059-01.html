Such an act raises a presumption of negligence and puts on the party doing it the burden of showing circumstances which justified or excused it. How strong the presumption will be must depend largely on the circumstances. If the horse is young, skittish, nervous or unused to the sights and sounds of a city street the presumption would be strong, while if he is old, staid and accustomed to city life, it might be very slight.</p>

The attendant left .the chair with the plaintiff in it, standing in the cartway of the street while she went to deliver a package at the express office. About twenty feet in front of the rolling chair stood a horse and wagon belonging to the defendant, the horse being unhitched and unattended. While the two vehicles were in this position the horse suddenly backed upon the chair, overturned it and seriously injured the plaintiff. There was evidence that the cause of the horse backing, was the colic. The court submitted plaintiff’s negligence and defendant’s contributory negligence to the jury.</p>

The ordinance of February 2, 1897 (Brown’s Digest, p. 1348), regulating travel on the public highways of Philadelphia, classes together all persons riding or driving “ whether on horseback, in carriages, wagons or other vehicles, or upon bicycles, tricycles, or other mechanical contrivances,” as occupants of the cartway, and the next section subjects all persons using “ barrows or hand carts ” to the regulations prescribed for carriages, wagons and other vehicles. Wheeled or rolling chairs are not specifically named, but they are clearly within the description of vehicles, and “other mechanical contrivances.” Whether in view of their almost exclusive use for small children and invalids they might not reasonably be entitled to take the foot pavement, they certainly are not obliged to do so.
