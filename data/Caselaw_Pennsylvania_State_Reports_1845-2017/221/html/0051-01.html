    <p class="syllabus" id="b79-11" data-blocks='[["BL_79.12",79,[200,1420,1180,490]]]'>In an action against a city to recover damages for personal injuries, it appeared that the plaintiff while walking at night on a street stepped into a hole or depression, apparently a cover of a water box which had sunk several inches, and was an obstruction in the line of travel. Plaintiff was not clear as to the cause of her fall, but said: “My foot went in and I fell.” Her companions inspected the spot immediately and were more explicit in their description. As to whether she was looking she said that she was just looking the way she walked. <em>Held, </em>that the question of defendant’s negligence and plaintiff’s contributory negligence was for the jury, and that a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.</p>
