    <p class="summary" id="b176-4" data-blocks='[["BL_176.5",176,[270,454,1179,243]]]'>When plaintiff’s evidence closed, a motion for a nonsuit was made by counsel for defendant. This was overruled so that the whole evidence might be spread upon the record. After full consideration, we felt it our duty to instruct the jury to find a verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b176-5" data-blocks='[["BL_176.6",176,[271,713,1178,546]]]'>An examination of the testimony and argument of counsel have not convinced us of any error in directing a verdict for the defendant. The charge contains all that is necessary to be said in the matter. ■ The plaintiff was not a passenger. The team upon which he was riding was not struck by the car, but in leaving the tracks of the company, defendant, he fell from the somewhat insecure position he occupied upon the wagon. In some way or other there was a contact between the plaintiff and the car. The evidence fails to disclose anything that the motorman could have done in the emergency that he did not do.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b176-6" data-blocks='[["BL_176.7",176,[271,1276,1178,646]]]'>As was said in the charge: “ The motorman was not bound to anticipate his falling off and being stunned upon or at the side of the track. But when the motorman discovered plaintiff’s position upon the track, he immediately reversed the car and applied the hand brake, when the fuse blew out. This timely action on the part of the motorman undoubtedly saved plaintiff’s life. Had it not been for the fuse blowing out, plaintiff would have suffered no injury, for the car would have been stopped in time. The evidence is undisputed that but for the blowing out of the fuse, the motorman’s actions would have avoided all danger. He did all that could be done at the time to avoid the accident, and nothing more was required of him.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b176-7" data-blocks='[["BL_176.8",176,[270,1941,1175,198]]]'>The plaintiff was not a passenger. He was, therefore, subject to the burden of proof and must establish the fact of negligence on the part of the defendant by affirmative testimony, failing in which, he fails in his suit.</p>
