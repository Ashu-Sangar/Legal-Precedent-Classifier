It never contemplated that circumstance as an instrument to work a forfeiture, on the common-law doctrine of alienation by ten<a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>ant for life or years.” In commenting upon and. following this case, Chief Justice Gibson, in Estate of Sarah Desilver, 5 Rawle, *111, held that the object and effect of the act was not to make recording the equivalent of a feoffment with livery in all respects, but to make it a substitute for the ancient ceremony for the purpose only of <em>“ </em>giving possession and seizin and making good the title and assurance of said lands,” etc., evidently meaning the title which the recorded instrument was intended to convey. For example, the recording of the Dooley lease should not be held to enlarge the estate for years, intended to be granted into a freehold on the ground that the act declares that a deed when recorded shall have the effect of a <em>“ </em>deed of feoffment with livery and seizin,” but rather that it should have the same effect to give possession and vest an estate for years in the lessee as it would have if accompanied by delivery of possession to the latter. In this connection it may be noted that the words used in the act are “ possession and seizin.” The word “ possession ” would be superfluous if the legislative intent was to confine this provision to estates of freehold, since “ seizin ” is possession of such an estate. But when, upon turning to secs. 6 and 8, it is seen that leaseholds exceeding one and twenty years, and also those for a shorter term when actual possession does not go with the lease, are included in the act, it may, perhaps, be fairly claimed that a reason appears for the use of both words. At common law there might be <em>“ </em>possession ” but could be no “ seizin ” of an estate for years. But it may possibly be argued that, as the proviso to sec. 6 puts leases exceeding twenty-one years on the same footing with those for a term of less duration where actual possession does not go with the lease (see also sec. 3 of the Act of March 18, 1775, 1 Stn. L. 422), neither could properly be held to be within sec. 5 of the act of 1715, for the legislature could not have meant that recording the instrument should have the effect of <em>“ </em>giving possession where possession did not go with the lease, and, moreover, that to so hold would be contrary to the decisions which hold that the act was not intended to enlarge the estate granted. In answer to this argument it is, perhaps, sufficient to say that recording a deed or lease could not possibly be the same thing as giving actual possession of the land, and that the legislative <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>intent was merely to make the one a substitute for the other so far as possession had been necessary to “ make good the title ” to the estate intended to be granted. The main reason for the passage of the recording acts is, as stated in the preamble to the supplementary act of 1775, to prevent the evils arising from secret conveyances and incumbrances by providing for publicity in such transactions. That in this respect a short term lease with “ actual possession ” differs from one where actual possession does not <em>“ go </em>with the lease ” is obvious.</p>

The tenant stands for the landlord and holds the premises for him, and strictly in subordination to him, during the continuance of the lease. His possession is adverse to all the world except his landlord or those under whom the latter claims. It is the title of the landlord which gives to the tenant his right of possession. It is quite as true that the title of the landlord is the title of the tenant as that the possession of the tenant is the possession of the landlord.

By a written instrument dated January 9 of that year and recorded in March, 1869, the owners leased about five acres of the tract to James Dooley for a term of 999 years, excepting and reserving all the coal and minerals with the right to mine and remove all and every part thereof without liability for any injury or damage done the surface. By a lease, dated September 29, 1871, and recorded <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>Januarj»- 8, 1872, Gaylord and others demised to the predessors in title of the defendant company all the coal in and under their land including the lot claimed by the plaintiffs in this action. This lease grants the right to mine and remove all the coal, but does not relieve the lessee from the obligation to support the surface nor release the lessee from damages for injury that might result to the surface from mining1 operations. The plaintiffs claim title by adverse possession which began in 1874, and has continued without interruption since that time to the present.

The plaintiffs’ contention is that by the lease to Dooley there passed to him only an interesse termini and not an estate for years in the land, because of his failure to enter into possession of the premises under the lease. It is, therefore, claimed that the possession of the premises remained in the owners of the fee, and that plaintiffs’ subsequent entry and possession were adverse, not to Dooley but to the owners of the fee, and the title acquired by adverse possession under the statute is the title of the owners. If this contention be correct and the plaintiffs’ possession was adverse to the owners and not to Dooley, it follows that the defendant company whose rights to the coal accrued by the lease of 1871 which gave them no right to affect the surface by their mining operations had no authority to mine and remove the coal without leaving proper supports to sustain the surface in its natural and unbroken condition. The defendant’s contention, however, was, and it was sustained by the court below, that the execution and recording of the lease to Dooley prior to the inception of the plaintiffs’ title, vested in the lessee not simply an interesse termini but an estate for years, and that the title acquired by the plaintiffs’ adverse possession under the statute of limitations was the title of Dooley, the lessee, and not that of his lessors, the owners of the fee. This conclusion of the court was rested upon its construction of the act of 1715, which makes the recording of an instrument a substitute for a feoffment with livery, thereby “ making good the title and assurance of the said lands, tene<a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>ments and hereditaments as deeds of feoffment with livery and seizin.” As pointed out in the opinion of the learned judge, the Dooley lease was within the intendment of the recording acts and the effect of recording it ivas equivalent to entry into possession under the lease and consequently vested in the lessee an estate for years.</p>

It was Dooley’s possession that the plaintiffs attacked when they entered in 1874. The owners of the fee had no right at that time to the possession of the surface as against Dooley. So far as the facts disclose, the owners had not forfeited the lease and had no right to forfeit it. They have never asserted any right to forfeit the lease, and so far as this record shows the Dooley lease was in 1874, and has since been in full force and effect.</p>

It is true that the tenant cannot deny the landlord’s title, but it is equally true that the landlord cannot oust the tenant and repossess himself of the premises until the tenancy has been terminated. Until that event occurs, the tenant has the right to the exclusive possession under his lease against the landlord as well as against any and all other persons who may not have a superior legal or equitable right. Reversioners and remainder-men are not affected by the statute of limitations until the precedent estate has been determined and their right of entry accrues : Marple v.

This proposition is obviously correct, as it would be most inequitable and unjust to permit the statute of limitations to run against the reversioners or remainder-men until their right of possession accrued and it could be enforced by a proper action. So long as their bands are tied and they are unable to assert their right of possession, they are in no default and the law imposes upon them no penalty. It is a universal rule, with no exceptions so far as we are advised, that the statute of limitations does not begin to run against a party until his right of action accrues.</p>

There is nothing whatever in this record to show any cause of forfeiture of the Dooley lease nor that the lessors ever contemplated a forfeiture of the lease and a repossession by them of the leased premises. The lessors had unquestionably the right to permit Dooley to exercise his rights under the lease notwithstanding he may not have complied with its terms. While they might have enforced a forfeiture at any time that it occurred, it was not compulsory upon them but wholly discretionary and at their pleasure; and if they failed to exercise that right, the plaintiffs, whose only title to the premises is adverse possession, are not in a position to enforce the lessors’ right of forfeiture.</p>

The plaintiffs, and not the defendant company, instituted this action to determine the right of the defendant to remove the coal under the cemetery. The defendant, through its counsel, disavows any intention to exercise its right of withdrawing support from the surface, and thereby endangering the graves in the cemetery. By defending this action, the defendant does not necessarily declare its intention to remove all the coal under the cemetery and thereby break and injure the surface. Its title has been attacked by the plaintiffs, and it was, therefore, put upon the defensive and required .to protect the title or surrender it'to the plaintiffs. Neither sentiment nor any other consideration required it to submit to an attack made by a party who had no paper title to the premises, and who had record notice of the defendant’s title. We have no doubt of the sincerity of the defendant company in disavowing its intention to exercise its right to mine the coal so as to affect the surface of the cemetery lot.</p>
