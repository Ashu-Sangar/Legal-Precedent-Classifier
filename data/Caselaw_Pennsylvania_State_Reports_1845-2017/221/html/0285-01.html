The language used is, “ all my estate real and personal,” and “ all the powers vested in me.” It is certainly to be inferred that this language, which is comprehensive, simple and intelligible, should not be deemed applicable to less than all her property and all her powers. Any other view would be to force a construction other than implied by the ordinary meaning of the language used;- ‘</p>
