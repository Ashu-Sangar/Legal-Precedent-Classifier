The court found as a fact that the payments had been made to Fergus G.

The question turned on whether Farquhar, who actually receivéd the money, did so as attorney for defendant, or in some other capacity. The court found that Farquhar had no authority, in fact, to receive it, nor did he occupy any such professional relation to defendant as to raise an implication of such authority. The evidence was carefully examined by the learned judge, the facts clearly found, and the conclusions accurately drawn. ¥e see no reason to disturb them. Decree affirmed.</p>
