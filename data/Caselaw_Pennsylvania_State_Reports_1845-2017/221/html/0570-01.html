The cases are very numerous, but it is not necessary to refer to more than a few of them. In "Woods v. Wilson, <a href="/pa/37/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="37 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="418930" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0379-01">37 Pa. 379</a>, the subject was discussed by Chief Justice Thompson, and it was held that silence, in ignorance of one’s own right or of another’s expenditures will not estop, but that where silence, -with knowledge, is evidence from which a jury may find an estoppel. See also Hill v. Epley, <a href="/pa/31/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="31 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="985079" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0331-01">31 Pa. 331</a>; and Miranville v.

These decisions rest on the ground that the circumstances were such as to raise a duty to speak, and that failure to do so is either a fraud or would work such an injury as would be equivalent to a fraud, if the party should not be estopped. On the other hand, it was held as .early as Buchanan v. Moore, 13 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 304, and Robinson v. Justice, <a href="/pen-w/2/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 19" data-case-ids="8877333" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0019-01">2 P. &amp; W. 19</a>, that positive acts of encouragement or which help to mislead, will raise an estoppel, without any fraud and irrespective of the party’s knowledge of his own rights, and, as was pointed out by Chief Justice Gibson, this result rests on a different principle; that of two innocent parties, the one who occasioned the loss must bear it. See also Chapman v. Chapman, <a href="/pa/59/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="59 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="426925" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0214-01">59 Pa. 214</a>; Miller’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/84/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="84 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1053586" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0391-01">84 Pa. 391</a>; and Putnam v.

The distinction, therefore, between the cases where acts or declarations of encouragement are necessary to create an estoppel and those where mere silence or acquiscence will be sufficient, is one of principle, and each case as it arises must be assigned to one or the other class, according to its circumstances, the chief of which is knowledge or ignorance of the party’s own rights and the other’s actions. Encouragement is necessary where the party is ignorant; but knowledge creates the duty to speak, and, where that exists, silence, is enough to estop.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.5",605,[177,445,1182,663]]]'>An examination of all the deeds from the one whereby Pechin secured title to the Foltz deed, does not reveal a word indicating that George O. Marshall had any interest whatsoever in the title to the said land; the only deed of record bearing on the question — the deed of assignment to Jos. H. Kerr in January, 1892, — would almost warrant the presumption that he did not have any interest in the title to the land in question. We are not prepared to hold that the ex parte statement in the above quotation from the petition at No. 70, March Term, 1904, under the facts in this case, is sufficient to excuse Mr. Marshall for folding his hands and sitting by in silence and permitting all to be done that was done without a word of objection or protest on his part.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b605-6" data-blocks='[["BL_605.6",605,[174,1114,1182,558]]]'>We therefore conclude that, under the circumstances, it was Mr. Marshall’s duty, if not satisfied with what was being done, to speak out, not only for his own rights but for the protection of innocent third persons who were purchasing lots and making improvements thereon, and who could have no other source of definite information than through him. His failure in thát regard, we think, brings him within the rule as above expressed that, “ when silence is so suggestive that, coupled with the fact of knowledge within the mind of him, who in honesty and fair dealing ought to speak out, it becomes a fraud on the part of him who should speak, then it is sufficient to estop.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b605-7" data-blocks='[["BL_605.7",605,[175,1677,1177,137]]]'>Mr. Marshall’s silence and conduct in this matter have been of such character as to estop him and prevent recovery in this action.</p>
