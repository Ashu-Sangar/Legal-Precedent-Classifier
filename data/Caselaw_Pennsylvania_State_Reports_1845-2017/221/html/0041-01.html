The assignment further provided that said sums of money should be held by the city for the use of and as belonging to plaintiff, and the plaintiff was constituted irrevocably attorney to collect the same. The city had notice of the assignment and made no objection to it. Thereafter the contractor recovered a large judgment against the city. After this an equity proceeding was instituted between the plaintiff and the contractor for an accounting. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction to restrain the city from making any payment to the contractor until the suit for an accounting was determined, and a further order made.</p>

An order for its delivery to McManus was given him by the department of education. This McManus refused to let Watson have, unless he would agree to pay therefrom all the schoolhouse bills. This plaintiff refused to do, but reiterated his intention of carrying out his contract to pay out of the aggregate of moneys to be received by him all the debts on all the contracts. During a part of the grading work he had been paying all the bills, and he wanted reimbursement from the warrant for his outlays for these payments for work done on the grading. Plaintiff finally agreed, in order to induce Mc-Manus to give him the- order for the warrant, that he would pay half of it to the claims on the schoolhouse. McManus refused to do this, and thereafter neither he nor Mr. Watson got any more warrants on account of grading or the other two contracts.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="Akq" data-blocks='[["BL_72.5",72,[298,607,1190,1721]]]'>■ ■ Mr. Watson testified that he has always stood ready and willing and is yet ready and willing to carry out this agreement. McManus testified that Watson said he would not carry out his agreement. I had the witnesses before me. I heard their testimony. I noted their bearing and I have no hesitancy in stating that where McManus contradicts Watson, I give entire credence to the latter and disbelieve the former. I therefore have no hesitation in finding that at the time Mc-Manus refused to let Watson have the warrant due from the •city, his refusal was unjustified, and Mr. Watson had nothing to indicate an intention not to carry out his agreement. He • was entitled to that warrant. His offer to pay $5,000 therefrom to the creditors of McManus on the schoolhouse contract was more than his agreement required him to do. Had McManus acceded to it, his creditors would have received that $5,000 and. subsequently the §3,300 “ reserve ” on the schoolhouse contract. These two sums would have nearly paid all that was owing. McManus’ lack of honesty and good faith in the matter is sho.wn in this, that he subsequently collected the reserve on the schoolhouse contract by suit against the city and put it all in his pocket, paying not a cent thereof to his creditors or to his surety, but leaving the trust company to pay all the schoolhouse creditors. Another evidence of ■his lack of honest intent is the fact that at the time Mr. Watson agreed to take the warrant then due on the Lincoln avenue contract and pay therefrom $5,000 to the creditors on the schoolhouse, McManus had a suit pending to collect the balance due on the grading contract from the city, and in that suit, in spite of the fact that the contract expressly limited ■the total payments to him to $26,000, he was claiming (and his claim has been sustained by the Supreme Court) a very much larger sum. The fact that the suit was pending, or that •he claimed some $15,000 more than the warrant, he did not mention. . . , •</p>

The real reason of his refusal is apparent from, the testimony in the grading contract suit. Had he turned over the order- to Mr. Watson for the warrant, he would have had no standing to claim from the city a sum almost three times the face of the warrant. He could not let go the order for the warrant' and pursue the city for this greatly larger sum, and I find that there was an entire lack of good faith in the reasons he had then advanced and now advances for refusing to-let Mr. Watson have the warrant.</p>

He. took over McManus’ quarry as additional collateral security, and to complete the other three contracts and advanced money to run the quarry and to complete the three -contracts. He did not take the contracts completely out of McManus’ hands,, and there was not an assignment of the contracts as the con-, tracts exhibit an assignment.

But as a matter of law I hold that McManus cannot, in the proceeding before me, avail himself of the fact that he assigned to Mr. Watson, if what he did amounted in law to an assignment.

At that time he had the suit pending against the city to recover the amount he claimed to be due him on the Lincoln avenue grading contract. • That suit has resulted in his favor (<a href="/pa/211/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="211 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="940060" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0394-01">211 Pa. 394</a>).

The question is somewhat complicated. McManus has recovered upon the contract “ reformed.” In the Supreme Court opinion Mr. Justice Brown says:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-5" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[156,561,1181,251]]]'>“ This being so, the plaintiff stands on a written contract with the city, not to be altered, varied, or departed from, but, to put it mildly, to be reformed for a mistake.

    <p class="summary" id="b75-6" data-blocks='[["BL_75.6",75,[154,819,1184,661]]]'>It is to secure the payment due on this reformed contract that the plaintiff has sought the aid of a court of equity. I cannot see how Watson could have collected by suit at law after McManus had proceeded to have the contract reformed. Surely, the city could not have been subjected to McManus’ suit wherein he sought to reform the contract and to Watson’s suit (McManus to his use) on the contract. Watson never possessed any right to reform the contract. lie advanced moneys to do the work and to secure repayment is entitled to collect any payments due McManus, but he never had any standing in law to collect what has been, by the judgment of the Supreme Court, given to McManus. I therefore find against the defendant on this point.</p>
