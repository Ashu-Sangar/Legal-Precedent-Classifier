In the year 1904 the manhole cover near the pumping house was twice carried away by ice, on each occasion allowing raw water to get into the pipes ; in the summer of 1906 a manhole cover near crib No. 1 became broken and displaced, allowing raw water to enter the mains. With reasonable promptness these defects were remedied ; during their existence the purity of the water was more seriously affected; it was more turbid and contained a higher percentage of bacteria and coli.

The defendant company uses at present about 8,000,000 gallons of water per day; the Pennsylvania Railroad Company now being no longer a customer, necessarily the defendant company would have to increase its charges, otherwise it would not be able to secure a fair return for such an increased investment; this, however, is subject to modification for the reason that $750,000 of common stock is outstanding for which no money has been paid, and the franchises of the company are of large value, neither of which are taken into account in the foregoing estimate.</p>
