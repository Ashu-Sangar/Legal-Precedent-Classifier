Now, that is a matter that the 'jury will have to decide again. If you can reconcile the commonwealth’s testimony and the defendant’s own testimony, you should do so. But if both cannot be true — if both' statements cannot be true — it will be a question for the jury to determine whether they believe a man who is not accused of any crime, and is a disinterested witness for the commonwealth, or whether they will believe the testimony of the defendant who is swearing in his own behalf, with the interest of his life at stake. The jury have a right to remember, as the Supreme Court has said, when they consider the testimony of a defendant, it is their duty to consider the fact that at the same time he is swearing in his own behalf with the interest of swearing to escape punishment.] [1]</p>
