Is this a sufficient compliance on the part of the testatrix ? Figuring roughly, her life estate is worth but one-third of $6,000, or $2,000, while figured on her contract, as subsequently determined by the years testatrix survived, she earned for about twenty-one months out of sixty months, for which she was to be paid $20,000, or $7,000, a sum perhaps more than might be recovered upon quantum meruit, based upon the usual salary earned by a companion, combined with what would be reasonable damages for giving up the claimant’s medical pursuits, but a sum figured at the rate determined upon by the parties themselves.</p>

    <p id="b222-8" data-blocks='[["BL_222.12",222,[277,1255,1177,702]]]'>The principal question raised by this appeal is whether the evidence produced before the auditing judge was sufficient to establish a contract of employment and service alleged to have been entered into between the decedent, whose estate constitutes the fund for distribution in this proceeding, and the appellee, who presented her claim under such contract, and asked for an allowance of the same. The auditing judge and the court in banc have so found, and we concur in the views expressed and findings made by the learned judges who heard and determined the case in the court below. The contention as to the admissibility of declarations made by decedent to counsel and as to the proviso in the residuary clause relating to an attempt to contest the will, under the facts of this case, cannot be .sustained.</p>
