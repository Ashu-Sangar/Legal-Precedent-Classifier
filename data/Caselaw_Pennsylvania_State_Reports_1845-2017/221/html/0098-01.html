Patrick Keefe, the janitor and messenger of the estate, was there at the time or came in soon afterwards, and was <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>told by Mr. Yardley that the paper which he then had was a will which Judge Paxson intended to execute. It does not appear, however, that Patrick examined the paper or that he had any knowledge of its character or its contents than what he was thus told by Mr. Yardley. Judge Paxson came in at a later hour. He seated himself at the table in the main room of the Jayne office, and while Mr. Yardley, who stood by his side, read the original draft, he had before him the engrossed copy, and saw that it was correct. He then signed the latter, not only at the end, but at the foot of each page, Mr. Yardley turning over the pages for him as he did so.</p>

The rooms were communicating, with a wide, high opening between, so that from where he.sat, the table, the testator and Mr. Yardley were in full view. He might, therefore, have seen the act of signing, but he was unable to say that he did ; and even if lie had, he could not, except from what he had been told by Mr. Yardley, in the absence of the testator, have known that what was signed was- a will. See upon this subject, Hock v. Hock, 6 S. &amp; R. 47. It is true that Patrick testified that he saw a paper on the table in Mr. Yardley’s room at the time, which, when the will was brought before the auditing judge from the office of the register of wills, he identified as the same paper, though he only saw the outside of it, declaring that its appearance when on that table was precisely that of the paper from the register. The absolute unreliability of such evidence is shown by the fact that the latter paper had on it the buff colored back put on in the register’s office, which it certainly had not when it was signed by the testator.</p>

When, therefore, the act of 1855 declared that in order to create a valid charity the will must be “ attested, ” something different from the “proof” which was sufficient in the case of an ordinary will' was manifestly intended. The act was a remedial one and its purpose was apparent. It was to protect testators against their own weakness and from the importunities and undue influence of designing persons, often exercised at the expense of those to whom the testator was under moral obligation to make provision for. The law, to use the language of Judge Mitchell, in Hoffner’s Estate, <a href="/pa/161/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="161 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="854188" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0331-01">161 Pa. 331</a>, 343, “recognizes such bequests as valid, but requires them tobe made when the judgment is clear, and the obligation is not sharpened or exaggerated by the terrors of impending death.” It is to be so construed as to prevent the mischief which it was designed to correct, and this would be done very ineffectually, if at all, if “ attestation” is to be regarded simply as the equivalent or synonym of “proof.” Nothing would be easier than to antedate the will and dispense with witnesses, and then, the presumption being that the date was the actual one, the statutory provision that it must be at least one calendar month before the death of the testator would, in many, if not the majority, of cases, be a nullity.. To attest a will the witnesses must be able to identify the instrument as the act of the tes<a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>tator, not simply from the appearance and nature of the paper itself, but from the declaration of the testator and its identification by him at the time. Whether he must not also request the persons to bear witness that the instrument is his will need not be considered.</p>

The act is plain and its terms peremptory, and judges cannot disregard it or allow themselves to be influenced by the hardship of any particular case. Cases of hardship frequently occur as the result of statutory enactments, as, for example, the act requiring a promise to pay the debt of another to be in writing (see Schafer v. Bank, <a href="/pa/59/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="59 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="426972" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0144-01">59 Pa. 144</a>), or the act requiring aivill to be signed “at the end thereof,” which, as held in Wine-land’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/118/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="118 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="556716" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0037-01">118 Pa. 37</a>, in an opinion by Judge Paxson himself, must be literally complied with, even if the words following the signature do not affect or change the dispositions made by the instrument. In the present case the testator was perfectly familiar with the law. He knew that the will so far as concerned the charitable gifts was incomplete until duly attested ; and he declared that he would, at a later time, see that this was done; but, whether from forgetfulness, inattention, or because of some contemplated change, it never was done.</p>

The correctness of this, so far as appears, has never hitherto been questioned. So long ago as 1862 a very distinguished judge (Thompson, P.

J.: We adopt the adjudication of Judge Pen-rose as the opinion of the court. It was attempted to prove the-gifts to charity by two witnesses, one of whom, seated at a distance of fifty feet or more from the testator, could identify the paper upon which the testator wrote as the will, only because, the draughtsman, the other witness, had told him that it was the testator’s will, evidence which was purely hearsay. His testimony was defective in this, that it required to be supplemented by that of another; whereas, under repeated decision s,--each witness to a charitable gift must, from, his evidence, based on independent knowledge and information as an eyewitness, meet all the requirements of the statute: Hock v. ITock; 6:S. &amp; R. 47; Mitchell v. Low, <a href="/pa/213/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="213 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="943351" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0526-01">213 Pa. 526</a>.

The act of 1855, in our opinion, carefully guards against such a mischance.' It provides that no estate shall be conveyed or willed to a charity, “ except the same be done by deed or will, attested by two credible and at the time disinterested witnesses, at least one calendar month before the decease of the testator or alienor.” The orderly arrangement of these provisions seems to indicate that the attestation should be made at least one calendar month before the death : Gray’s Estate, <a href="/pa/117/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="117 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="555846" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0067-01">117 Pa. 67</a>. If the witness attest the will by signing, and we know no case where an instrument has been held to be attested except by the.signatures of the witnesses-, and one or both should die, proof of their signature will carry with it the legal presumption that the will was executed in conformity with all legal requirements. It is incredible- that the legislature could have meant to subject a will giving, as in this instance, a million to charities, to the hazard of the continuance in life of a single witness. ■ The testator, who had but recently resigned from the highest judicial ■office of the commonwealth,, evidently entertained this view. He acquiesced in the suggestion by the draughtsman, whom he requested to sign, that he and Keefe, being legatees, were perhaps interested witnesses within the meaning of the act, and were therefore ineligible; and he declared that he would have two other witnesses sign the instrument. He, therefore, manifestly regarded the will as at that time, incomplete. It is useless to speculate upon this after-inaction ; ne may have intended, on further reflection, to add other provisions to the instrument. But he did nothing, and his will remains as he saw fit to leave it.</p>

Obviously some kind of proof differing from the ordinary proof is there made requisite. "When a statute uses a different term from that used in another statute relating to the same general subject, the rule is elementary that a different meaning is intended; and the difference in the meaning of the words “proved,” as used in the act relating to ordinary wills, and “attested,” as used in the act with regard to wills creating charities, has been shown by eminent jurists, in language substantially the same in very many cases — beginning with what was said by Judge Oswald Thompson, in 1861, in ELupfeld’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Phila.%20219" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="5 Phila. 219">5 Phila. 219</a> ; Irvine’s Estate, <a href="/pa/206/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="206 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="931595" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0001-01">206 Pa. 1</a> — being the last utterances of the Supreme Court on the subject.

An “attesting” witness in the sense used by the statute, can be no other than one who of his own knowledge can identify the instrument as that executed by the testator “ not less than one calendar month before ” his death. The witnesses Avho “ attest ” must be credible and “ at the time” disinterested. At.AA'hat time? At the time of attestation. And what is it that they attest ?

L. 249, wills <em>“ </em>in all cases shall be proved by the oaths or affirmations of <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>two or more competent witnesses.” No subscribing witnesses are necessarj7-, «proof of the testator’s signature by witnesses acquainted with his handwriting being sufficient, and the witnesses being only required to be “ competent, ” i. e., disinterested, at the time of making proof. In the act of 1855, however, the legislature set an entirely different standard of proof. By that act “ no estate, real or personal, shall hereafter be bequeathed, devised, or conveyed to anybody politic, or to any person in trust for religious or charitable uses, except the same be done by deed or will, attested by two credible, and, at the time, disinterested witnesses, at least one calendar month before the decease of the testator or alienor.”</p>
    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[166,973,1181,1420]]]'>The purpose of this act is plain. It was to make reasonably sure that testamentary gifts to religion or charity were the result of deliberate intent of the testator, and were not coerced from him while in weakened physical condition under the influence of the doubts and terrors of impending death. The main feature of this precaution was, of course, the requirement that the gift must be by deed or will one calendar month before the decease of the donor or testator, and this fact must be attested by two credible and, at the time, disinterested witnesses. Nothing is easier than to antedate a writing, whether deed or will, and the statute guarded against that danger by the requirement that it should be not merely proved, but “attested ” by two witnesses, and those two must be at “ the time disinterested.” At what time? Certainly not merely at the time of probate, for that was the general rule under the act of 1833, and did not need any re-enactment. Those whose memory goes further back than the evidence act of 1887 will recall the amount of time and argument spent over questions of the interest of witnesses, and whether the interest had been or could be released. The act closed all controversy on this point by the requirement that the witnesses should be disinterested “at the time.” At what time? Clearly at the time the instrument was executed in the manner required by the statute. In Irvine’s Estate, <a href="/pa/206/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="206 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="931595" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0001-01">206 Pa. 1</a>, it was said by our Brother Mestrezat, that this language “pre-supposes the existence of a writing signed by the testator at the time of the attestation,” and that necessarily is the time the qualification of the witnesses must be referred to.</p>

      <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>Having regard, therefore, to the change in the language of the two statutes from “ proved ” in the act of 1833 to “ attested ” in the act of 1855, to the requirement of the latter that the two witnesses shall be “ at the time ” disinterested, and the absence of any other reasonable intendment as to that time than the date of compliance with the requirements of the statute, to wit: the execution of the will not less than a calendar month before testator’s death, and its attestation by two “ at the time” disinterested witnesses, the conclusion is not to be avoided that the attestation must be by witnesses who then and there make compliance with the statute certain by subscribing their names. An attesting witness under this statute means a subscribing witness.</p>
    <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[295,1027,1180,351]]]'>The learned court below called attention to the danger from the death of one or both witnesses that the gift might fail if the witnesses had not signed. It is a strong argument, ab in-con venienti, and adds to the force of the conclusion. But we put our decision on the manifestly intentional variation in the lam guage of the two statutes and the nature of the additional requirements in the act of 1855.</p>
