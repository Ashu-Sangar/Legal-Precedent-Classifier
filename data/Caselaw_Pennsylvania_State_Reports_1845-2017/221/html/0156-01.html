Fabel, the defendant, held for Jacob Bauer, the plaintiff. As the court remembers the testimony it. was clearly shown, without contradiction, that this check was made up of $2,000 which was margin deposited by the plaintiff in this case on these transactions, whether legal or illegal, as you should find them, and that when George W. Fabel sent this check it was intended to pay that $2,000 back and $1,262.50 profits. As the court remembers it, there is no question about that.

Not even that the man should keep the identical money as a stake, and so hold it, until the matter upon which it was paid was decided, but only so it can be arrived at and distinguished, and our courts have gone further and held that gambling transactions in stocks are wagering transactions, and that the broker in that case is nothing more than a stakeholder, and he cannot resist the payment of the money to the man who deposited it there on margins, by stating that man paid it to him for an illegal purpose, and that he is not bound to pay it back.

He must either stand by his propo-' sition in the whole or else drop it, and if he claims that the whole matter was a gambling transaction, through and through, all that he can defend against is the profits in this transaction, and those profits were $1,262.50.
