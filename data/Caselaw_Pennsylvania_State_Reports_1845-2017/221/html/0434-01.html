Defendant, in order evidently to keep the case off the trial list, entered a rule to refer. Under such circumstances it would seem but right and just to reinstate the first rule for judgment, or grant a. second rule, and I know of no law, rule of court, or precedent preventing such procedure. The fact that the case is ruled out for reference, does not prevent the court from entering judgment for want of an affidavit of defense: Act of May 14, 1874, P. L. 159.</p>
