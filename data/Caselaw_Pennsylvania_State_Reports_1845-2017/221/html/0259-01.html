By another clause he directed that if the bequest to charitable institutions for any reason should not take effect, or be held to be void, then he gave all moneys intended to-be given to charitable purposes to his sister and brother, or to the survivor of them to be divided between them and to be disposed of by them or the survivor of them in any manner which they may deem proper and useful. A codicil revoked the charitable provisions set forth in the will and gave pecuniary legacies to certain specified charities, and further directed that the residue of his estate directed to be held in trust for the benefit of- his sister should at her death be paid over to such charities as he should thereafter name in writing to his executors, or by provision in a future codicil, but if he should fail to. make such designation then to pay over and distribute the same to such charitable institution or institutions as his sister should by will appoint. A subsequent codicil revoked the provision for the payment of the whole income to testator’s sister, and directed his executors to pay her for life an amount per annum <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>which, was much less than the total income. After the testator’s death it appeared that he had failed to name in writing to the executors, or in a codicil, any charities as beneficiaries of the residue. The residuary income was much larger than that directed to be paid to testator’s sister. <em>Held, </em>that an intestacy did not arise as to the surplus income because it was the intention that the entire residuary estate should go to charities, for which purpose accumulation was not forbidden, and it was provided that upon failure of 'the charitable bequests, all money intended to be given to the charities should go to testator’s brother and sister.</p>
