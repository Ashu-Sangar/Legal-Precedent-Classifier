It is a statute which provides, in substance, so far as it bears upon this case, that contracts in relation to land must be in writing; that written title to lands, or written ownership of lands, cannot be affected or defeated, as a general legal proposition under this statute, by verbal testimony, by anything short of a writing. That statute has not been specifically mentioned in the argument here, but as we are requested to give you certain binding instructions upon the legal aspects of the case, it is proper for me to say that the statute of frauds, the statute to which I refer, is no bar to the plaintiff’s recovery in this action, if you find the contract as he has asserted it to be.] [2]</p>

In the first place, if you believe that the $4,800, paid to the association in New York for this property, was derived, $100 from money advanced by the plaintiff although subsequently the balance was returned, $81.00, and that $4,700 of it was advanced or put into the transaction by the de-fendant under the contract or arrangement asserted by the plaintiff, there would probably be in law what is denominated a resulting trust, that is, the assignment of this sheriff’s deed</p>

The facts as established by the verdict are <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>as follows: The plaintiff employed the defendant, a real estate, agent, to purchase land for him and to obtain a loan to be secured on it and used in part payment of the purchase price; the defendant was to be repaid all expenses incurred by him in attending to the business and a commission for his services. The defendant in violation of his duty purchased the land in his own name but made the first payment, when the contract was signed, with money received from the plaintiff for that purpose. When the plaintiff learned that the defendant was named as purchaser in the contract, he was led to acquiesce because of the defendant’s assurance that he would advance the balance of the purchase money and that if he held the title the expense of preparing and recording a mortgage would be saved. The land was sold through the agency of the defendant at a profit, and during the negotiations for its sale the plaintiff was always treated as the owner and consulted at every step. The defendant refused to pay the balance of the purchase price received by him after deducting his expenses, commissions and advances, but tendered the .plaintiff a part thereof in settlement.</p>

A trust will spring from the fraud practiced where one employed to negotiate for another takes advantage of the opportunity to obtain a conveyance to himself. Whether in this case the acquiescence of the plaintiff in the taking of title by the defendant left him anything to rely upon except an unwritten promise to hold the land for him need not be considered, for a trust also arose from the payment of the purchase money, which could be established by parol evidence. Where an agent to buy land uses his own money to complete the purchase, the transaction will be regarded as a loan to the principal.
