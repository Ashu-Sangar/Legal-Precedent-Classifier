But the plaintiff failed in the proof. All that was shown by the evidence was that the appellee had assigned the debt to him and with it his rights <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>over the collateral. The plates ultimately came into the possession of appellant and the learned judge below was of opinion that no damage had been proved. However this may be, the gist of the action was the conversion and as no conversion was shown the nonsuit was proper.</p>
