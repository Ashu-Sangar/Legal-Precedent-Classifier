Hawley, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20Minn.%20201" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="82 Minn. 201">82 Minn. 201</a>.

There must be a “reasonably accurate description of the papers wanted,” and a showing that it is material in a pending cause; here, a call for all telegrams between half a dozen <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>persons within fifteen months past was held too broad: United States v. Babcock, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Dill.%20566" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="3 Dill. 566">3 Dill. 566</a> (570). “The papers are required to be stated or specified only with that degree of certainty which is practicable, considering all the circumstances of the case, so that the witness may be able to know what is wanted of him and to have the papers on the trial, so that they can be used if the court shall then determine that they are competent and relative evidence.”</p>
    <p id="b564-4" data-blocks='[["BL_564.5",564,[253,754,1180,707]]]'>An order to produce all papers concerning the matter in dispute is not sufficiently specific. The papers and documents to be produced should be described with reasonable precision. An inspection of the subpoena in this case shows that the court below was fully justified in refusing to compel obedience to what was asked for. The first assignment of error is, therefore, dismissed. For the same reason the second assignment of error is overruled. It was unreasonable to ask for a blanket list of persons and firms with whom contracts had been made during the year. In the absence of all particularity in specifying what was wanted, and without any showing of materiality, the court was right in sustaining the objection to the demand for a general list of contracts with other persons.</p>

But the correctness of the judgment which has now been entered in the court below must, of course, be tested by the evidence offered upon the last trial. The trial judge held it was insufficient to establish authority in the district manager to accept the notes of the contractors in full settlement of the account, and our review of the testimony leads us to the same conclusion. The burden of proof was upon the defendant ; “ a party who avails himself of the act of an agent must, in order to charge the principal, prove the authority urn der which the agent acted.

There was no other evidence of his authority, and it appeared from the evidence that the contractors, Powell <em>&amp; </em>Company, had notice, from the invoices of the material sent to them, that payments must be made to the treasurer of the plaintiff company at St. Louis. And in pursuance of such notice they did forward the cash payments made by them on account, directly to St. Louis, and they paid no money to Mr. Lowery. At the trial the defendant put Mr. Lowery on the stand for the purpose of proving the scope of his authority, and this opened the door to the plaintiff on cross-examination to show precisely the limits of that authority. We see no merit in the third assignment of error.</p>

In the present case, if there had been evidence of authority on the part of Lowery to receive payment of the account in the shape of notes, then the testimony of the witness Smith would have been sufficient to take the case to the jury on the question of fact as to whether or not the notes were so accepted in payment, and with the intention of releasing the right to lien. But in the absence of any evidence of such authority on the part of Lowery, there is nothing in the record to show that the defendant company ever parted with the right to enforce its lien.</p>

Under all the evidence, as we have seen, a binding direction in favor of the plaintiff would have been proper at the close of the trial; The court below, therefore, very properly entered judgment non obstante veredicto for the plaintiff.</p>
