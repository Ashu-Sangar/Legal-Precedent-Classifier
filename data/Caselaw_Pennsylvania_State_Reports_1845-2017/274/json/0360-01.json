        "text": "Per Curiam,\nAnnie Shickley claimed compensation for the death of her husband, Henry Shickley, who was employed by defendant company. The referee made an award in her favor, which was reversed by the compensation board, and the decision of the latter was affirmed by the court below. The claimant has appealed. The questions involved, as stated by the appellant, are: (1) \u201cCan the ......board reverse the findings of fact of the...... referee without having granted a hearing de novo?\u201d (2) \u201cIs an accident which happened on the premises of the employer, on a path leading to and from the place at which the employee was employed, and found by the referee to have happened in the course of employment, a compensable accident?\u201d\nAs to the first question, it is sufficient to say that the controlling point in the case, suggested by the second of the above-stated questions, is one of law and not of fact. All the material underlying facts found by the referee were accepted by the board, but the latter drew a different conclusion therefrom, determining that, on the facts as found, the place where the accident happened was not part of the premises of the employer within the meaning of that term as used in the act; this \u2014 the finding complained of \u2014 is a conclusion of law.\nThe referee found that, on April 20, 1919, Shickley died from a disease of traumatic origin, \u201cprobably due to a wrench received on April 7, 1919, aggravated by his continuing at work\u201d; that the accident was caused by the deceased slipping on a loose stone at a spot on a path leading to his place of employment, but at least 900 feet therefrom; that the path in question (though not part of the premises connected with the plant where Shickley was employed, and not maintained or kept in condition by defendant company) was upon property owned by his employer and was habitually used by him and others of defendant\u2019s employees, there being no approach from Mt. Carmel, where Shickley lived, to defendant\u2019s mine except by this and other paths, all \u201con or over\u201d defendant\u2019s property. On this state of facts the referee concluded that the path used by Shickley \u201cwas a part of the premises of defendant\u201d and that the accident \u201cwas due to the condition of the premises\u201d; therefore, he made the award. In reversing, the board states: \u201cThere is a distinction between the word \u2018premises,\u2019 as used in the act, and the word \u2018property,\u2019 and the word premises cannot be enlarged in its meaning and application so as to include land or property [outside of that used in connection with the actual premises where the employer carries on the business in which the employee is engaged]......Therefore, the mere fact that defendant company owned the land on which decedent was injured is not sufficient to establish the right of compensation......When we speak of the \u2018premises\u2019 in this case, as they are contemplated in the statute, we mean the Alaska Colliery, where decedent was employed......When decedent was injured he had not reached the actual scene of his employment but was at least [900] feet therefrom; he was on a path not maintained by defendant company, but which passes oyer land owned by it......We are unable to conclude that decedent was injured on his employer\u2019s premises within the meaning of the act.\u201d\nWe agree with the above conclusion, and need add only that the other point sought to be raised, \u2014 viz: albeit the accident did not happen on the employer\u2019s premises, yet, Shicldey having worked on such premises after his fall and this having aggravated the condition caused by the accident, a liability arises under the act, \u2014 is not suggested by the statement of questions involved, nor, so far as the record shows, was it depended upon at any prior stage of this case; moreover, we are not impressed that, on the facts here shown, it has merit.\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.",

Where all the material underlying facts found by the referee, under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, are accepted by the Compensation Board but that body draws a conclusion of law therefrom different from that of the referee, the award of the referee is properly set aside.\n2. In such case the finding of the referee is not a finding of fact, but a conclusion of law from the facts found.\n3. The word \u201cpremises\u201d as used in the Compensation Act cannot be enlarged in its meaning and application so as to include land or property outside of that used in connection with the actual premises where the employer carries on the business in which the employee is engaged when injured.\n4. It seems that no liability arises under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, where an employee injured off his employer\u2019s premises, worked thereon after his injury and this aggravated the condition caused by the accident.\nAppeals \u2014 Point not raised in court helow \u2014 Statement of questions involved.\n5.
