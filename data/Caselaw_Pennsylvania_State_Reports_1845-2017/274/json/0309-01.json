If started now, it starts under the new ordinance, and there is nothing to prevent its being constructed where it has been located......We cannot assume that defendant will make of itself a nuisance sometime in the future, or continue the injunction to meet such a possibility.\u201d\nIt need be added only that, until proof to the contrary is shown, it must be assumed that the ordinance under attack was duly passed, in entire good faith, by the city councils.\nThe decree is affirmed at cost of appellant.",

Wyoming Valley Homeopathic Hospital et al.\nMunicipalities \u2014 Ordinance\u2014Restriction as to hospital construction near dwelling houses \u2014 Amendment of ordinance \u2014 -R'quity\u2014 Injunction.\n1. Where a person purchases a dwelling house prior to the passage of a city ordinance prohibiting the erection of a hospital within thirty feet of a dwelling, the fact that such person makes improvements upon her property, does not deprive the municipality of the right to amend the ordinance by changing the distance to twenty feet.\n2. It seems that the amendment is effective from its own date, rather than from the date of the original ordinance.\n3. It makes no difference as to which date the amendment became effective, if it appears that the construction of a hospital within thirty feet but more than twenty feet of a dwelling had progressed no further than a slight disturbance of the soil when it was stopped by a preliminary injunction, inasmuch as such injunction must be dissolved, because the renewal of the work would be after the date of the amended ordinance.\n4. The court will not assume that the hospital will make itself a nuisance sometime in the future, nor will it continue the injunction to meet such a possibility.\nMunicipalities \u2014 Ordinance\u2014Presumption as to validity \u2014 Evidence.\n5.
