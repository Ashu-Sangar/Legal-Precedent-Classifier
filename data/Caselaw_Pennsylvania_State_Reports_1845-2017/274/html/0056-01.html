Plaintiff, in that year, became the owner of several lots of ground south of the land of the coal company, separated therefrom by a street and lot,, each thirty feet in width; there were sixty feet of solid coal intact, owned by others, south of the southern boundary of the appellee’s coal tract. When plaintiff acquired its property and built its brewery in 1900, it knew the Thomas Coal Company had been mining north of Line Street for many years, and would continue to do so. Cracks appeared in the surface north of plaintiff’s lots, and, in 1904, an injunction was secured from Judge Maar to restrain Thomas Coal Company from further mining for the reason that such operations interfered with plaintiff’s right of lateral support. The following year the present defendant, Thomas Colliery Company, took over the operations of the coal company and was <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>substituted of record as defendant. Judge Shay enlarged. tbe scope of tbe preliminary injunction in 1911, but no steps were taken toward final bearing until 1915, before Judge Brtjmm. That jurist, after a personal inspection of tbe property, but not going down into tbe mine, entered a decree in 1916 modifying tbe injunction then in effect, continuing it, however, in many important particulars. Exceptions were filed by both parties; these came on for bearing in 1920 before Judge Henry of Lebanon County, specially presiding, Judge Brtjmm having died in tbe meantime. Tbe delay in closing up tbe litigation can be easily accounted for as defendant could mine in other parts of its operation without interfering with tbe disputed territory. Judge Henry, after a most careful study of tbe evidence and an examination of all matters submitted, sustained many of tbe exceptions to Judge Brumm’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and entered a decree dismissing tbe bill.</p>

Evidence as to buildings and improvements tending to establish a right to restrain the use of the adjoining land was improperly admitted. The authorities cited by appellant are not inconsistent with this position.</p>
    <p id="b85-4" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[150,1265,1156,591]]]'>The sum total of the evidence as to future injury comes to this: It may possibly happen in the future; it is uncertain, and the injury, if it happens, will be to the buildings or the machinery there installed. Such injury is not invasion of any legal right of plaintiff, — the injury, therefore, to its surface is negligible; it might have caused a crack in the building or machinery to be out of line, but such injuries, without negligence, would be damnum absque injuria. The third conclusion scarcely needs justification at our hands; the photographs emphasize it.</p>

He resolved the doubt against defendant on the main seam of coal, and, by the injunction, took out of market 450,000 tons of anthracite coal, of a value largely in excess of the property for whose benefit the injunction was issued, and in <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>a community whose prosperity was absolutely dependent on the coal industry.</p>
    <p id="A0r" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[293,430,1154,473]]]'>The witnesses on both sides agree that, under present conditions, the property of defendant was unsafe, and defendant’s testimony seems convincing that approved methods of mining would lessen, if not eradicate, the danger. Possibly there would have been no damage if this character of mining had been pursued prior to 1904. It is certain, in this view of the case, equitable intervention should have been withheld, under the facts as presented.'</p>
    <p id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[294,920,1152,536]]]'>But the prior decree as to other veins was modified, and defendant permitted to do more mining because of this evident uncertainty in the chancellor’s mind. The court seemed possessed with an idea the question was one of public interest because of other buildings located close by. The owners of these buildings did not see fit to complain, ask equitable relief or intervene in this litigation, and, while courts should be careful to safeguard public rights, it is not necessary to create fancied dangers, with rights flowing therefrom.</p>

The court below found any present injury due to mining prior to 1904 could be compensated in damages, and, unless we hold the mere possibility of an injury to an owner through the lawful use by one of adjoining property is ground for an injunction, we must dismiss this appeal, as previously stated. The threatened injury must be “imminent” and “irreparable.”</p>
