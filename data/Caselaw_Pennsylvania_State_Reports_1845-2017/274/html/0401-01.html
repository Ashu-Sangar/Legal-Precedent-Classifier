The defendant, a married man, who had no personal acquaintance with her, accosted her on the street, gained her confidence by talking about her father, whom he claimed to know, and invited her to ride in his automobile, saying he would take her to the business section of the city. She got into the automobile and after driving a short distance in the direction he told her he would take, defendant changed his course, drove out into the country some four or five miles, turned into a lane but little traveled, proceeded along it to a woods, where he alighted from the car under the pretence of giving some berries which he had in the car, to a sister, and asked the girl to accompany him; she declined to do so. He took a policeman’s mace from the car and left her for at least fifteen minutes. It turned out on the trial he did not have a sister in the vicinity. The girl remained in the lane while he was gone; on his return, they got into the automobile, and after driv<a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>ing a short distance along the lane, he stopped, and told her the rear wheels had locked. They both got ont of the car and at his suggestion began to work about the rear wheels, he showing her how to pry between the spokes with the policeman’s mace to unlock the brakes. After she had endeavored to do this for some little time, she took the mace out of the wheel, laid it down in the road, stepped back of the automobile and was standing looking at the defendant, who she testified had been eyeing her in a peculiar way, when she lost consciousness and had no memory of anything thereafter for several weeks. She said he had not gotten into the car, up to the time she became unconscious.</p>
    <p id="b429-3" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[164,1028,1161,1351]],["BL_430.1",430,[269,304,1158,1015]]]'>The accused testified he went to the lane for the purpose of getting some whiskey he had buried in the woods alongside of it, and to divert suspicion from himself in obtaining it, had taken the girl with him; that, when the wheels locked, and after showing her how to aid in prying the brakes loose with the policeman’s mace, he got into the car and started it, the brake pressure having been somewhat released; that when the car started, it leaped ahead and then stopped; that he caught a glimpse of the girl, who had been thrown forward, jumped out of the car and found her lying partly under it, lifted her up, discovered blood running over her face and that she was unconscious. He described his endeavors to revive her, which he said were of no avail. Thinking she was dead and of the predicament he would be in, in view of his past record, with the supposedly dead girl and a ear full of whiskey, he became panicked, picked her up, carried her into some bushes on the side of the lane and left her there. Coming back to the car, he found what had prevented it from running, corrected this, went to New Castle, where he had taken an aunt in the morning and returned with her to his uncle’s, some twenty miles in the country. In the afternoon, he drove his wife to New Castle, for the purpose as he says, of getting a copy of their marriage certificate; the reason for obtaining it <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>is not apparent in the testimony; no endeavor was made to get it on arrival there. Leaving New Castle, accompanied by his wife, he drove ont to the woods where he had left the girl, not telling his wife anything about what had occurred, purposing, as he testified, to pretend he had discovered the body and to take it to New Castle. This plan he abandoned, however, and concluded to give the impression that the girl had been ravished. He got out of the car in the near vicinity of the spot where the girl was lying, leaving his wife in the lane; she had not seen and did not see the girl. He entered the bushes where the latter was lying, pulled most of the clothing from her body, tearing some of her undergarments into shreds, and went back to the car. He then drove his wife to his uncle’s house, hid the policeman’s mace in a manure pile, destroyed the whiskey and washed away the blood of the girl’s wound which had gotten on the running board of the car. His wife was not called as a witness in his behalf.</p>

There were serious wounds about her head, five in number, from one of which, a fracture of the skull, she died on the following 27th of November. Medical testimony established that her death was due to the injuries she received at the time of the assault on July 14th.</p>

As a result of her testimony, he was bound over on the charges against him, other than rape, of which there was no medical proof. The story of the defendant on the stand and that told by his victim at the preliminary hearing agreed in substantially all respects until the time she said she became unconscious, and he said he got in the car to start it and she was injured by its sudden starting.</p>

These points the court affirmed, saying in connection with them, that the jury should take into consideration all the testimony regarding her condition on the two days she remained in the woods, and the testimony of the defendant as to her appearance which led him to conclude she was dead, in determining whether or not he was aware at the time she was living and had abandoned her. We fail to see where the defendant has any ground to complain of the district attorney’s request, which was withdrawn and not answered, or of the answers to his own points. The issue of death by neglect or abandonment was put in the case by the accused, nowhere in its general charge had the court said anything on the subject, and the: record discloses the Commonwealth did not try the case on that theory.</p>

She was produced at the hearing by the defendant’s attorneys and was in their employ and reported the hearing for them; she testified to the integrity of her notes and transcript and that they correctly set forth the questions asked the witness and her replies. As to the mode of proof, the general law is that where the testimony is reduced to writing by the stenographer who took the stenographic notes, the person who took the notes may read from them or from the transcript, providing he testifies they were correctly taken: 16 Corpus Juris, section 1558, p. 759.</p>

The record discloses that the information on which the first hearing was founded was sworn out by the same person who made the affidavit to the murder <em>complaint; </em>he testified that both prosecutions grew out of the same facts and circumstances.

Hefferman, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20L.R.A.N.S.%20868" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="25 L.R.A.N.S. 868">25 L. R. A. (N. S.) 868</a>, which reviews most of the cases on the question, announces the conclusion that the overwhelming majority of the courts have favored the view that such testimony is admissible, where the accused person has had the opportunity to subject the witness to cross-examination, provided he was present as the party charged with the offense which was being investigated and the offense there charged and the one being tried are substantially the same. “Generally, the viva voce examination of a witness in the presence of the party on trial is required, because it is the best evidence. The direct and cross-examinations are the best means of eliciting the whole truth, and the manner of the witness is one of the tests by which to determine the degree of credit to which he is entitled; but this is not always attainable, and what a deceased witness, or one who from other causes has become incapacitated to give evidence, has sworn on a former trial or preliminary examination where the accused had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, is admitted on the principle that it is the best of which the case admits. Such testimony is not open to the objections ordinarily urged against hearsay or derivative evidence, having been delivered under the sanction of an oath, and the adverse party having had the full benefit of a cross-examination. It is therefore admitted upon the principle of necessity so as to prevent a defeat of the ends of justice”: 8 Ruling Case Law, section 209, p. 218.</p>

With us, the rule has been clearly established, as the heretofore cited cases show, that in a murder trial, evidence is admissible of the testimony of a deceased witness taken before a committing magistrate at a preliminary hearing in the presence of the accused and his counsel, the witness having been cross-examined by the counsel for the accused.</p>
