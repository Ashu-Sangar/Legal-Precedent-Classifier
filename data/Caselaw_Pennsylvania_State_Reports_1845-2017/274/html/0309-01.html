      <em>1. </em>Where a person purchases a dwelling house prior to the passage of a city ordinance prohibiting the erection of a hospital within thirty feet of a dwelling, the fact that such person makes improvements upon her property, does not deprive the municipality of the right to amend the ordinance by changing the distance to twenty feet.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b333-7" data-blocks='[["BL_333.9",333,[127,1841,1147,85]]]'>2. It seems that the amendment is effective from its own date, rather than from the date of the original ordinance.</p>

It makes no difference as to which date the amendment became effective, if it appears that the construction of a hospital within thirty feet but more than twenty feet of a dwelling had progressed no further than a slight disturbance of the soil when it was stopped by a preliminary injunction, inasmuch as such injunction must be dissolved, because the renewal of the work would be after the date of the amended ordinance.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b333-9" data-blocks='[["BL_333.11",333,[124,2272,1149,128]]]'>4. The court will not assume that the hospital will make itself a nuisance sometime in the future, nor will it continue the injunction to meet such a possibility.</p>
