If defendant wished this question decided in limine, he should have applied to the court itself for a stay of proceedings until the statement and rule were properly served; and, if this was subsequently discharged, he could then have asked for an extension of time to file his affidavit of defense: Section 22 of the Practice Act of May 14, 1915, P.

If he had taken this course, it is more than probable his “sober second thought,” if he had a defense on the merits, would have reminded him that the slight delay to be gained, would hardly justify the necessary expense of an appeal.</p>
    <p id="b613-4" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[160,1189,1151,919]]]'>Since great injustice might be done if a defendant was not brought into court, by service of an alias or pluries writ7 until a number of years after copies of a statement and rule to file an affidavit of defense had been served on him, — when possibly the copies had been mislaid and forgotten, or the member of his family, upon whom they were served, had died or moved away, — we wore at first tempted to lay down a general rule for all future cases; but have concluded, since the local requirements may vary in the several districts, to leave this for such action, by the courts of first instance, as to them shall seem wise. Of course they would be swift to open a default judgment under such circumstances, if a defense on the merits was shown; but an innocent defendant should not be compelled to suffer the embarrassment and loss which sometimes results from the entry of a judgment, and its continuance, pending final disposition of the case.</p>

Co., <a href="/pa/176/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="176 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="882217" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0172-01">176 Pa. 172</a>, 175-6, 180), or at least within the term of court to which the writ issues, — this, by common law, by statute, and by modern practice, being the period of time within which a party is frequently required to act, if he intends to disturb an existing status. These, however, are merely suggestions, the value of which will doubtless depend on the local conditions in the particular districts.</p>
