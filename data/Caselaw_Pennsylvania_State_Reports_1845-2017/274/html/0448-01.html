This contention indicates a misconception of legal principles, in that it attempts to apply the rules growing out of a former adjudication between the same parties, to those appertaining to a prior judgment between different parties. When res adjudicata is applicable, every essential fact, proved or unproved, as well as the ultimate fact found, must be treated as established, when pertinent for consideration in a later suit .between the same parties; whereas stare decisis simply declares that, for the sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be applied to those which follow, if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. Similarity of the relevant facts being necessary, it follows that if here they are essentially different from those in the Alden Coal Co. and St. Clair Coal Co. cases, supra (as the court below found they were), its ruling that stare decisis did not apply was necessarily correct. Indeed this is particularly so, where, as here, the decision depends not on <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>the effect of some of the facts, but upon the combined force of all that are proved at the time the question arises, when the progress of science or the course of trade may, since the prior decision, have greatly changed the uses to which one or both of the commodities may be put.</p>

The reasons which actuated our predecessors in declaring an act unconstitutional, have and should have great weight with us, when determining whether or not a later similar statute is likewise objectionable, but if, after having fully considered the matter, we are nevertheless impelled to the conclusion that the later enactment is constitutional, we cannot decide otherwise, unless we are to forget our duty to support the Constitution as the supreme law. Our reason for this conclusion cannot be better expressed than by interpolating a few appropriate words into the wonderfully simple and convincing language of Chief Justice Marshall, when considering whether or not the courts have the power to declare a statute unconstitutional: “If both the law [i. e. the statute backed by the court’s prior error, if it was such] and the Constitution apply to a case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law [i. e. the erroneous decision declaring it to be so], disregarding the Constitution, or conformably to the Constitution, disregarding the law, the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.

Madison, <a href="/us/5/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="1 Cranch 137" data-case-ids="12121622,6759998,6760011" data-case-paths="/us/5/0137-01,/dc/1/0137-01,/dc/1/0137-02">1 Cranch 137</a>, 178. To this it may be added (though somewhat aside from the present inquiry) that it is at least as important now as it ever was, that doubts as to the constitutionality of a statute (though arising from a prior decision) should always be resolved in favor of constitutionality.</p>

It says: “All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax.” In form this is restrictive, but it none the less recognizes that the power which had theretofore existed in the general assembly to legislate upon all subjects not forbidden by the Constitution, still exists so far as relates to taxation, limited only by the provision as to uniformity. Despite appellant’s argument, it is clear that an entirely different situation exists when the question arises under article III, section 7, for there no power to classify is conceded, indeed, impliedly at least, it is denied; hence legislation, based on classification regarding the subjects there specified in it, can be sustained only where there is “a necessity springing from manifest peculiarities clearly distinguishing those of one class from each of the other classes, and imperatively demanding legislation for each class, separately, that would be useless and detrimental to the others” (Ayars’s App., <a href="/pa/122/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="122 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1948405" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0266-01">122 Pa. 266</a>, 281; Com. v.

In respect to these it has been well said: “In short, the Constitution having delegated to the legislature the power to classify persons and property for purposes of taxation it may select any reasonable basis upon which to make the classification, and may create as many classes as it may in its discretion decide upon, subject always to the limitation that it must exercise good faith and must not make arbitrary and unjust distinctions” : White on the Constitution of Penna., 379-380. It follows that if anthracite coal can, from any reasonable standpoint, form a class in and of itself, the legislative power to so tax it is uncontrollable by the courts. Probably this conclusion would not be challenged by any one; but it is attempted to fritter it away by arguments now to be considered.</p>

The error in this oft-repeated claim arises from overlooking the fact that names are but a human device for designating things, th*e thing, not the name for it, being the important matter; hence the mere designation of both bituminous and anthracite as coal, cannot alone operate to prevent the legislature from classifying them for the purpose of taxation. Surely no argument is needed to sustain this conclusion, but it may be asked, if anthracite coal, bitumose coal, cannel coal and charcoal must always be in the same taxable class, because “coal is coal,” could they be taxed separately if the word coal was omitted from their names and they were called anthracite, bituminous, cannelite and chardwood?</p>

Pursuing to its logical conclusion the line of inquiry thus suggested, we find that the ascending grade from wood to lignite, cannel coal, bituminous coal, anthracite, and, finally, to graphite or diamonds, is only the further carrying on of the same chemical reactions, resulting principally in the formation and expulsion of more and more of the hydro-carbons and other gases; lignite being wood with some of them expelled, anthracite coal being wood with most of them gone, and graphite and diamonds being wood with practically all of them eliminated. So, also, coke is anthracite coal in all essential respects; in the former man has expelled these gases by the artificial application of heat; in the latter nature has eliminated them by <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>heat, largely generated through pressure, during the great cataclysms which resulted in a reasonably stable world.

He also says: “Mere competition between two wholly different articles, could not, of itself, bring them within the same ‘class of subjects.’” Taken together, these two statements amount to this: the legislature may classify, however alike the articles may be, if they do not come into competition; it may classify, though they come into competition, provided they are not alike; but if they are alike and also come into competition, it may not classify; that is, a “class of subjects,” in the constitutional sense, is one in which the articles are not only alike but are competitive. If this contention was sustained then natural ice and artificial ice would have to be taxed similarly or left untaxed, natural gas and manufactured gas would have to be treated in the same way, and doubtless many other subjects of taxation would be unnecessarily yoked together. Reasonably applied, the rule <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>stated might furnish an easy method to guide the general assembly, but the courts cannot found their decisions upon it alone, since the Constitution does not so provide, but, on the contrary, gives to the legislature the right to determine the principles upon which the classification shall be made, and to the courts the right to interfere only when the course pursued results, not in classification but merely in arbitrary separation.</p>

Admittedly bituminous coal is used in the manufacture of coke, and anthracite coal, practically considered, cannot be; and admittedly also the smaller sizes of anthracite coal come in competition with bituminous coal in the manufacture of steam for industrial uses, and to a minor degree for heating purposes. Can the courts rightfully say that the time has not yet come when, despite the former and because of the latter, the legislature may not classify under the general power given to it ? Or can they rightfully say to it, you may not exercise the power to classify until a greater percentage of bituminous coal is used in the manufacture of coke than the percentage of anthracite coal used in the manufacture of steam, and if they may do this, where must they draw the line in order not to encroach on legislative power?</p>

Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/244/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="244 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1003526" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0241-01">244 Pa. 241</a>, 246.</p>

The problems which are met1 in the government of human beings are different from those involved in the examination of the objects of the physical world and assigning to them their proper associates. A wide range of discretion, therefore, is necessary in legislation to make it practical, and we have often said that the courts cannot be made a refuge from ill-advised, unjust or oppressive laws.”</p>

Alden Coal Co., <a href="/pa/251/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="251 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1019566" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0134-01">251 Pa. 134</a>) may be suggested, yet, on the controlling point upon which we rested our former decision, the two acts are in practical accord. When the other case was here, I reached the deliberate conclusion, stated by Mr. Justice Stewaet for the court (p. 142), that, if coal were to be taxed, there could be no valid classification between anthracite and bituminous; nothing has been brought forward since to change that conclusion. The fact that, for numerous other purposes, such as operating the mines, etc., classification between the two sorts of coal has been permitted, is beside the question: men and women may be classified separately for many legislative purposes, but when it comes to taxing them, differentiation is undoubtedly forbidden; so with coal. To my mind, the several kinds of coal can no more be separated for purposes of taxation than can the <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>different kinds of grain; the State may tax grain, but, surely, it cannot legally tax wheat and exempt barley.</p>
    <p id="b489-3" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[158,445,1150,757]]]'>In addition, notwithstanding my respect for the view of the writer of the majority opinion, I cannot agree with his statement that “stare decisis has no real place in constitutional law”; this thought, being unnecessary to the decision in hand, ought to be taken as dictum of that writer. The doctrine in question, while not always deemed controlling (and perhaps not so in the instant case), cannot be put aside as a principle of law when considering fundamental points; my idea of the limitations on it in that field are expressed in Luzerne County v. Morgan, <a href="/pa/263/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="263 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1047517" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0458-01">263 Pa. 458</a>, 465, but, despite such limitations, that stare decisis has long been recognized as occupying a “real place” in American constitutional jurisprudence, is shown by many decisions in all jurisdictions.</p>
    <p id="b489-4" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[160,1214,1150,697]]]'>Again, I think the words which the writer of the majority opinion “interpolates” into the quotation from Marbury v. Madison, are not “appropriate.” As I understand the governing principle, when a prior decision is overruled, — although, to avoid injustice, certain rights and positions, assumed on the faith thereof, may remain undisturbed — the theory is that such decision, being in error, never was law; not that it was the law and that the court changes it: Ray v. Natural Gas Co., <a href="/pa/138/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="138 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="11252411" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0576-01">138 Pa. 576</a>, 590; Harlow v.

This court, in Com. v.

The court there considered the matters above referred to as thoroughly as we are now considering them. Like any other case, “all relevant facts and issues directly connected with the subject-matter of the litigation......might properly have been offered in the prior case” (State Hospital for Criminal Insane v. Consolidated Water Supply Co., <a href="/pa/267/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="267 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="1057765" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0029-01">267 Pa. 29</a>, 37); and all issues entering into the governing point are there determined: Allen v.

The reasons given to sustain the conclusion of the court in the former case are not so erroneous or out of harmony with the Constitution that we can declare they were error. I cannot discover additional ground on which to rest contrary view.</p>
