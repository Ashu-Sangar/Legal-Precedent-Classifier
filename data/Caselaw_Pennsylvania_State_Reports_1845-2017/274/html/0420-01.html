Bachman was treasurer of the County of Berks, which has a population in excess of 150,000, and issued licenses for hunters, merchants, brokers and others, collecting the fees fixed by the various acts of assembly. From the sums received, he deducted certain commissions, designated in the statutes to be hereafter referred to, and claimed the right to hold the same for his individual use.</p>

      <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>The financial affairs of a county such as this are managed by a controller, who is given the power to audit and settle accounts, as are county auditors, under the Act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 545, sections 47 and 48. A duty is imposed upon him to file a report of the county affairs in January of each year, with the right to appeal by parties aggrieved, as permitted by the earlier legislation. In the present instance, the controller surcharged Bachman with the sum of $2,506.80, the amount of fees and commissions retained by him as compensation for services rendered in issuing licenses. The report was duly filed in January of 1921 and advertised, but no personal notice of an intention to adjust the treasurer’s claims was given him prior to that time. He did not discover that an adverse finding had been made until the statutory period of sixty days allowed for appeal had elapsed; thereupon, he presented his petition asking that the action of the controller be set aside. After hearing, the application was refused.</p>

In counties containing over <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants all county officers shall be paid by salary.” And it has been judicially declared that this requirement includes all sums collected in an official capacity whether they be designated as “fees” or “commissions”: Luzerne County v.

    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[286,429,1158,1715]]]'>It therefore becomes necessary to consider the wording of the various statutes, by virtue of which the claims are made in the present case. An enumeration of all of them will show it is by reason of the holding of the office that the treasurer is named as collector, and the commission is made payable because of his position; under such circumstances, the sums received cannot be retained by him. Fees for the issuing of hunters’ licenses were provided by the Act of April 17, 1913, P. L. 85. No appointment is made of the local official as special representative of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, the compensation allowed is payable to the county: Schuylkill County v. Wiest, <a href="/pa/257/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="257 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1032433" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0425-01">257 Pa. 425</a>. The same is true in the case of collections based upon mercantile licenses under the terms of the Act of May 2, 1899, and the earlier acts of April 15, 1834, P. L. 544, section 42, and April 7, 1830, P. L. 391, section 9: Luzerne County v.

Nor is there any difference in the statutes providing for commissions upon sums received for billiard and pool-room licenses (Act May 25, 1907, P. L. 244), brokers’ licenses (Act May 7,1907, P. L. 175, section 10), amusement places (Act May 20, 1913, P. L. 229, section 14), or eating houses. Act April 25,1907, P. L. 117, section 2.

Renewed misunderstanding has been caused by the ruling of this court in Westmoreland County v. Miller, <a href="/pa/265/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="265 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1051899" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0394-01">265 Pa. 394</a>, where a claim was allowed.

Evidently, there was some misapprehension in this court as to the facts involved, and, as a result, an affirmance was had in a per curiam opinion. Without discussing the record as made up in that case, or attempting to distinguish it, it is now overruled, so far as it gives color to the claim that the county treasurer may retain commissions on collections for the Commonwealth, except where the statute names him as its agent, and awards to him pay for services performed. The conclusion reached by the learned court below in the present case was correct.</p>
