He was seated in a Pullman car which was derailed while passing through Centre County, and as a result was seriously hurt. Investigation, made after the accident, disclosed a rail broken into six parts, and a spreading of the track for some distance, likely due to the shifting of the ties when the coach was overturned. Suit was brought to recover damages, and, upon the trial, evidence was offered to show the relation of claimant to the company at the time his injury was received, and the amount of loss sustained. With these facts proven, a presumption of responsibility arose, the passenger having suffered harm by reason of a defect in the railroad appliances: Meier v. P. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/64/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="64 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1021259" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0225-01">64 Pa. 225</a>; McCafferty v. P. R. R.

It then became the duty of defendant to establish, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the accident occurred notwithstanding its exercise of the highest degree of practicable care and diligence : Doud v. Hines, <a href="/pa/269/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="269 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="1063528" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0182-01">269 Pa. 182</a>.</p>

It appeared <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>that the supervisor of the division went over the track at least once a month, and a track-walker passed the locus in quo, daily on foot, observing the rails for possible breaks. The section covered by him each day to and fro was nearly five miles in length, and his investigations were limited to such matters as were openly visible. It was proven, further, that the rail which gave way had been purchased from a reputable manufacturer about one year previously, after tests hadi been made to determine its soundness. Experts examined the broken pieces after the derailment, and testified the steel was of good quality, the fracture having resulted from “internal transverse fissures,” which were latent defects, not discoverable by the use of any reasonable mechanical methods. No evidence in contradiction was offeied by plaintiff, resting as he did on the presumption of lack of proper care arising from the happening of the accident. Upon motion, the court gave binding instructions for defendant, and subsequently entered judgment on the verdict rendered. As a result, this appeal was taken.</p>

It stands as a fact, except as overcome by testimony produced by defendant. The railroad company did not dispute plaintiff was a passenger, and had been injured by a break in its track, but attempted to show a condition, which, if true, relieved it from responsibility. It claims to have established its defense by testimony so conclusive as to justify binding instructions in its favor, but, as pointed out in Holzheimer v. Lit Brothers, <a href="/pa/262/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="262 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="1044351" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0150-01">262 Pa. 150</a>, 153, and Clark v.

Ordinarily, however, capricious verdicts are to be cured by the grant of a new trial, and it is only where no dispute appears in the evidence, or in the inferences which may possibly be drawn therefrom, that binding instructions can be given, where the finding is necessarily based on parol testimony: Devlin v.
