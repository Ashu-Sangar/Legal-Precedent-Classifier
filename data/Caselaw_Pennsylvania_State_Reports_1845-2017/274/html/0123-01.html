Hess, thereby terrorizing and assaulting her and causing her a severe nervous shock, as a result of which, she, the said plaintiff, who was then pregnant......suffered a miscarriage, as well as a complete nervous collapse, and otherwise became sick and disabled.” A trial was had, which ended in a directed verdict for defendant. The court below granted a new trial, without assigning any specific reason. Defendant has appealed.</p>

We cannot tell what moved the court below to grant the new trial, nor what may develop at the next one; therefore the order complained of will not be disturbed.</p>
