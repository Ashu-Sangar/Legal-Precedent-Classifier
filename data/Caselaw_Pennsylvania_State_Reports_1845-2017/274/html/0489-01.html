Finally, the authorities indicate that it is competent for the legislature to vest a civil remedy in any citizen, irrespective of his special interest, to enforce a declaration of public policy, and this the present act does in effect. The principle involved is thus stated in Littleton v.

The Anthracite Mining Act of June 2, 1891, P.

No great hardship would follow that action; this, indeed, was the solution of this problem reached by the Constitutional Eevision Commission of 1920; an amendment was proposed which, in express words, permitted the legislature to tax only for the purpose of affording compensation to surface owners. Instead of adopting such remedy, the legislature passed two bills known as the Kohler and Fowler Bills, only the first of which is here for consideration.

This may be a proper conception of the science of government, but I think the Constitution of this State and of the United States would not have been adopted had the participants expected such results. The logical result of the majority opinion will go far to bring about the condition so earnestly longed for by those advocating equalization of property. Constitutional mandates and protections are swept aside and the legislature is supreme, while acting within any pretended scope of this power, so long as the statute, in a preamble, asserts: “this is for the public good.” Police power becomes the open door to govern or rule, for, through it, property may be transferred by the legislature from one person to another without compensation ; the limitation of power to so act was heretofore one of the chief obstacles in the way of those favoring this socialistic principle.</p>

It now happens they, and others like them, are dissatisfied and have induced the legislature to pass this act, known as the Kohler Act, which forbids mining this same coal from under this same lot without leaving sufficient surface support, — that is, requiring, for all practical purposes, from one-fourth to one-third of the coal to remain in place. The act gives free of chargeto all these surface owners that which they have already been paid for, — all this, under the police power. But, mark the deception of those who wrote the act.

If the legislature had desired to protect life and limb it could have required a notice, given sufficient time in advance, from the operator to the surface owner, when mining was to be done under his or her land, Where the right of surface support had been released or conveyed away. Severe penalties could be attached for failure to give the notice in time if mining was proceeded with. It will thus be seen that, regardless of anything else that may be in the act with respect to these purposes, the end does not justify the means, and it is evident, from both acts, the real purpose of the legislature and the framers of the act was in the interest of property, and property alone, — not to prevent the “terrible menace to human life, public safety and morals.”</p>

      <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>Our decisions covering public service laws do not apply, for it was distinctly stated that, where a business was recognized as lawful and not against public welfare, and the statute controls only its method and administration, such control is not affected so as to work confiscation or a destruction of property; in all cases of regulation, the courts inquire whether property has been taken without due process of law, or contract rights violated. So we have held that contracts are not interfered with or impaired by such laws, where compensation is reduced. See Suburban Water Co. v. Oakmont Boro., <a href="/pa/268/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="268 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1061592" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0243-01">268 Pa. 243</a>, 253.</p>
    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.4",540,[283,987,1150,795]]]'>But we have never before upheld a statute that confiscates property; nor does the case of Nolan v. Jones, supra, reach the point involved in this case. I do not quite comprehend what is meant by the discussion that the act does not “in any true, legal sense, contemplate the taking of private property for public use, or transferring it to another,” unless it is meant that actual seizure is necessary, for, under this act, it is just as certain as anything can be that one-fourth to one-third of the coal must remain in place for surface support, for the coal owner, under the Kohler Act, will scarcely provide artificial support, by concrete or stone pillars, or otherwise, at a cost greatly exceeding the value of the coal. Of course, later, the Fowler Act permits its removal as indicated.</p>
    <p id="b540-5" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[282,1802,1150,360]]]'>The fact the bill does not suggest any such purpose has nothing to do with the intent of the legislature, here enforced by injunction; nor does reference to the different acts regulating the mining of anthracite and bituminous coal. Different rules and regulations must be adopted for different mines, according to working conditions.</p>
    <p id="b540-6" data-blocks='[["BL_540.6",540,[283,2184,1149,206]],["BL_541.1",541,[151,314,1152,371]]]'>Decisions cited in relation to the liquor, oleomargerine or other businesses are distinguishable in that they are real exercise of police power, and where relief was not obtainable in any other way. The mining of coal is an <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>important factor in onr lives. Coal must be procured that tbe people may live; it is only recently that this court has given expression to such thought: Pioneer Coal Co. v. Cherrytree R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/272/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="272 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="1068380" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0043-01">272 Pa. 43</a>, 52. The effect of these laws is to further embarrass the production of coal and reduce the output, as well as confiscate a well-defined property-right in the land.</p>
    <p id="b541-3" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[152,696,1150,153]]]'>To summarize, the Kohler Act, as it appears to me, is a confiscatory enactment, under the guise of a police provision, for the following reasons:</p>
    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[152,859,1151,253]]]'>1. It is entirely unnecessary, in order to protect life, to forbid mining of coal. A notice such as I have suggested would fully protect all except those who, being of full age and sound mind, voluntarily go where it is not safe for them to be.</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.6",541,[153,1133,1151,315]]]'>2. The provisions of the Fowler Act clearly show that this is merely part of a scheme to force the coal companies to support the surface of owners who have either for value released the right of support or have purchased their lots for a less price by reason of not acquiring this right with their purchase.</p>
    <p id="b541-6" data-blocks='[["BL_541.7",541,[154,1458,1150,262]]]'>3. I can conceive of no reason, — if it be necessary for the public good the surface be supported, — why, as in the case of the Rent Laws, fair compensation should not be provided, save only the desire of the beneficiaries to get something for nothing.</p>
    <p id="b541-7" data-blocks='[["BL_541.8",541,[154,1738,1152,315]]]'>4. If this law were in good faith intended to protect lives and safety from cave-ins caused by underground mining, it would protect from all such subsidences. The paper-books now before us show cases in the appellate courts of this State covering more litigation over subsidences due to bituminous mining than to anthracite.</p>
    <p id="b541-8" data-blocks='[["BL_541.9",541,[156,2065,1150,205]]]'>5. Prior Pennsylvania legislation provided adequate protection to the property of all surface owners except such as had released their protection. It was for the sole benefit of this class that the Kohler Act was passed.</p>
    <p id="b541-9" data-blocks='[["BL_541.10",541,[156,2283,1149,100]],["BL_542.1",542,[292,309,1151,361]]]'>6. The Kohler Act, in effect, confiscates defendant’s coal for plaintiff’s benefit. Defendant’s right to mine <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>its coal on condition that it accept the Fowler Act and pay two per cent on the value of its total tonnage, or its right to mine on spending on artificial support many times the value of the coal, are rights so obviously illusory as merely to emphasize the real purpose of the act, — to require the coal to be left for all time for the use of the surface owner.</p>
    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[292,692,1149,311]]]'>The entire purpose and design of this legislation is clearly, to my mind, to force the coal companies, who have already paid for this property-right once, to pay for it again, and to give to the surface owners a valuable right for which they have already been paid by the parties from whom they now receive it for nothing.</p>
    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[339,1015,897,33]]]'>I would affirm the decree of the court below.</p>
