It became a municipality of the third class in 1878, and thereafter was controlled by the . acts applying to such cities, as well as by local legislation not repealed by the later general statutes. From time to time annexations of adjoining lands were made, and in 1919 a considerable acreage from Mill Creek Township was added, most of which is devoted to agricultural purposes. The correctness of the assessment of a part of this property is the question raised by the present appeal from a final decree restraining the collection of any tax based thereon.</p>

If in force, the plaintiffs were entitled to have their lands returned as farms, upon which a less rate of tax was to be imposed.

On the contrary, uniformity is directed (Act May 27,1919, P.

An examination of the Clark Act shows a clear purpose to establish a uniform system of taxation in cities of the third class. The assessor appointed includes all property, noting whether improved or otherwise, and fixes a valuation, subject to review. The city is no longer directed to discriminate in favor of farm lands; on the contrary, it is directed to make its taxation uniform, and is given the power to equalize the assessments in individual cases, or by wards. It may have been the legislative thought that where public service was not supplied, the valuation would be correspondingly low, and the landowner thus be protected. Whatever the purpose, explicit directions are given by the act <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>as to the manner of assessment and levying taxes, which are in conflict with the plan theretofore provided.</p>

As already noted, the owner is given a right of appeal to the board of revision, if dissatisfied with the valuation, and a further review may be had by the common pleas.
