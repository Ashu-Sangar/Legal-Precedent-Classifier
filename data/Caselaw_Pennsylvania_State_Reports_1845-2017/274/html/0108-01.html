On the afternoon of June 28,1921, the defendant, Harry Lessner, and a confederate named George Jackel, entered the jewelry store of S. Bugay, 2327 South Seventh Street, Philadelphia, and with drawn revolvers attempted to hold up and rob Mrs. Bugay, who was in charge of the store; her screams, however, brought the neighbors to her assistance before the robbery was completed. The robbers being frustrated by men entering the store put their revolvers away and started for the door, but, being intercepted, again drew their weapons and forced their way out, where they <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>were immediately surrounded by neighbors who had heard the woman’s cry of alarm. According to the Commonwealth’s evidence the defendant brandished his gun and threatened death to any one who got in his way, and did aim at and shoot through the heart Isadore Rabinowitz, the deceased. Whereupon defendant was disarmed and turned over to an officer.</p>
    <p id="b135-3" data-blocks='[["BL_135.4",135,[144,731,1155,1687]],["BL_136.1",136,[304,351,1152,696]]]'>The theory of the defense is that the gun was accidentally discharged in a struggle for its possession and not fired at the deceased or at any one. Such theory, even if true, of which there was but slight evidence, would constitute no defense. The statute says: “All murder......which shall be committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, robbery or burglary, shall be deemed murder of the first degree.” In the instant case, the shooting, although done in front of the store, was so connected with the attempted robbery as to form a part of it. The mere putting away of the weapons, on the approach of the neighbors, and immediately redrawing them did not constitute a break in the chain of events; therefore, we must treat this case as a homicide committed in an attempt to perpetrate a robbery, and, so treating it, the defense of an accidental killing is without avail. The gun that fired the fatal shot was in the defendant’s possession for the criminal purpose of robbery and that the discharge was unintentionally caused while struggling with his victim, or with a third party who came to the latter’s assistance, is immaterial. Under the statute it is murder of the first degree although the killing was casual and unintentional: Wharton on Homicide (3d ed.), p. 175, and note; and, “The term ‘murder’ as used in such statutes includes all kinds of unlawful killing which constituted murder at common law, and is not confined to such as were committed with a deliberate and premeditated design to kill”: <a href="/pa/252/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="252 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="1021581" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0187-01">Ibid.</a> It is the fact of killing in the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate the crime which brings the case <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>within the statute — not the intent to kill. An accidental killing in the ordinary sense is not felonious but no such result can follow a killing by a felon in the perpetration of one of the specified crimes, for the malice of the initial offense attaches to whatever else the criminal may do in connection therewith. The statute would be vain if it applied only where there was an intent to take life, for in such case it would be first degree murder without it. This conclusion justifies the refusal of defendant’s fourth, seventh and eighth points. Moreover, the evidence of disinterested eyewitnesses, the direction of the wound and all the circumstances, wholly discredit the theory of accidental shooting.</p>

    <p id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[304,1440,1151,315]]]'>In referring to a part of the confession the trial judge said “and this is without contradiction”; but that was not a reference to the failure of the defendant to testify, as it might have been contradicted by other evidence, and therefore not a violation of the statute prohibiting such reference: Com. v. Chickerella, <a href="/pa/251/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="251 Pa. 160" data-case-ids="1019920" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0160-01">251 Pa. 160</a>.</p>

In this case a murder was committed after an attempted <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>robbery. A life has been taken. The unfortunate Rabinowitz was sent to an untimely grave, struck down by the hand of violence, and it is for you to determine whose that hand and what its guilt.” This left the question of guilt and of the degree thereof to the jury. According to the evidence on both sides, including the defendant’s confession, the gun was in his hand when the shot was fired and, if the jury so found, he would be guilty of murder, for reasons above stated; but had the jury failed to so find then he would have been acquitted. So the statement that “a murder was committed” did him no harm.</p>
