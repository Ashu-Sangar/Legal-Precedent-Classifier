Subsequently, a merger was had with another corporation, and the consolidated company was leased to the present defendant, which agreed to “pay for all paving done or to be done after the first day of July, 1906, whether or not the obligation to do said paving shall have been imposed by the local authorities before the first day of July, 1906, and Rapid Transit shall also pay any amounts falling due under continuing contracts, the benefit of which is enjoyed by Rapid Transit.”</p>

    <p id="b152-4" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[307,396,1155,917]]]'>Defendant insists contracts of this character are without effect1 in the absence of approval by the Public Service Commission. Section 11 of article III (Act 1913, P. L. 1374) says: “No contract or agreement between any public service company and any municipal corporation shall be valid unless approved by the commission.” It is to be noted this clause was made effective upon the passage of the act (article VI, section 54, July 26, 1913), whereas the legislation generally was not in force until the following January. It would seem, therefore, to have been the legislative intention that the provision for approval was not to be retroactive, but to apply only to agreements entered into after the date fixed. By another section, the commission was given the power to demand the filing of other municipal contracts, but nowhere is it directed that consent to the terms of those entered into before July 26,1913, shall be obtained.</p>
    <p id="b152-5" data-blocks='[["BL_152.5",152,[304,1326,1149,699]]]'>The claim is made, however, that the undertaking was a continuing one, and when demand for performance was made subsequent to the passage of the act, approval of the reasonableness of the stipulation was then required. If new right's were asked, based upon an agreement prior to 1913, the Public Service Commission would have power to supervise (Schuylkill L., H. &amp; P. Co. v. Pub. Serv.

Superior Ct. 400</a>), but that is not the situation presented here. The contracts of 1899 and 1903 did not require approval, and hence were not brought within its control.
