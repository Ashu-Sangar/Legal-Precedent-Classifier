Campbell, out of the distribution of whose estate the present controversy arises, died December 18, 1918, leaving a will, bequeathing all his property to a daughter, Ruth C. Bryson. On December 5, 1918, being sick in Pittsburgh with the illness from which he subsequently died, he asked a friend named Richards, who had called <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>to see him, to witness a check which he, Campbell, had drawn on a savings bank in favor of his brother, A. Earl Campbell (appellee), for four thousand dollars, representing the exact sum on deposit to the drawer’s credit. That the check should be witnessed was a requirement of the bank. Richards witnessed it and put it and the bank book showing the deposit in an envelope addressed to appellee at Akron, Ohio, where he lived, sealing the envelope and placing it in decedent’s satchel by his direction. Richards testified the decedent said to him “He wanted Earl to have the money, as Earl was married and settled down and he wanted him to buy a home.” Richards advised decedent that the medium of a check was not the right way to accomplish this purpose, and that if he wanted his brother to get the money the check called for, the matter should be put in some other shape, that if the check was presented after his death, payment would be stopped on it, to which decedent replied “He will get it all right if he keeps his mouth shut,” the deceased asserting that neither his daughter nor sister would make any trouble. He further said that when he told the decedent he ought not to leave the check in the satchel, the latter replied, “Yes, they will get it there.”</p>

Earl Campbell claimed in the court below the check was a gift inter vivos to him by his brother of the sum it represented, or, if not a gift, that, being for the exact amount of the deposit, the check constituted an equitable assignment. The amount of the check, with interest, aggregating about half of the estate, was awarded to claimant, the court rightly holding that, as the deposit <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>had been collected by the executors and constituted part of the fund for distribution, it had jurisdiction to determine the question whether the money had been given to appellee: Cooper’s Est., <a href="/pa/263/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="263 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="1047467" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0037-01">263 Pa. 37</a>.</p>

Though every other step be taken that is essential to the validity of the gift, if there is no delivery, the gift must yield. Intention cannot supply it; words cannot supply it, actions cannot supply it; it is an indispensable requisite, without which the gift fails, regardless of consequence”: 2 Thornton on Gifts, page 105. Ordinarily mere possession of the property is not sufficient evidence of a gift, for this may be consistent with a mere custody or agency: Reading Trust Co. v. Thompson, <a href="/pa/254/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="254 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="1025434" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0333-01">254 Pa. 333</a>, 337. “A gift may be defined as a voluntary transfer of a chattel completed by the delivery of possession.

Out of the incident of this visit, to which no one but the claimant testified, and from the circumstance that he, the appellee, went directly from Cresson to his home in Akron, where he remained until he received word of his brother’s death, and from the further fact that on his way through Pittsburgh to decedent’s funeral, on December 19th, he presented the check to the drawee bank, which refused payment, the claimant seeks to sustain the inference drawn by the court below, that decedent delivered the check to him and thus made an executed gift of it on the occasion of his visit to the former at Cresson on December 15th. The court ruled that appellee was incompetent to testify as to what took place at the time of the above visit, but that he could state the fact of the visit. It is strongly argued that claimant was not a competent witness under the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, Purdon 1495, section 34, — which provides: “Nor where any party to a thing or contract in action is dead......and his right thereto or therein has passed......to a party on the record, who represents his interest in the subject in controversy, shall any surviving or remaining party to any such thing or contract......be a competent witness to any matter occurring before the death of said party,” — to testify even to the fact that he had visited his brother prior to the latter’s death, and thus to lay the foundation for the inference of delivery of the check.</p>

    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[273,583,1153,1176]]]'>In McConville v. Ingham, <a href="/pa/268/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="268 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="1061505" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0507-01">268 Pa. 507</a>, 519, we held that the endorsement of a check absolute in form is sufficient to give rise to a presumption of a gift of the check. A stronger presumption arises from the drawing of a check to the order of one who. sets up a gift of it. Under the testimony of Richards, there can be no question but that the decedent intended his brother should receive the money represented by the check. The circumstances occurring subsequent to the death of the decedent, — the fact that appellee at the time of his brother’s death was in Akron and that the day after the death, without having thereafter been at decedent’s home or at the place where he died, appellee presented the check at the bank on which it was drawn, — negative the idea that claimant obtained the check after the brother’s death and support the contention that it came into his possession prior thereto, and this without considering appellee’s own testimony of his visit to the decedent at Cresson. • The case at bar is readily distinguishable from Isett v. Maclay, <a href="/pa/265/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="265 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="1051880" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0165-01">265 Pa. 165</a>, in which the testimony disclosed no possibility of delivery of the note there in question before the death of the maker.</p>
