In every live city, comprehensive forward planning does and should precede specific local improvements, and does not and should not result in penalizing these municipalities by depriving them of the right (admittedly enjoyed by less progressive cities), of assessing the cost thereof against the properties specially benefited. In the present instance (as the effect will always be if the planning is wise) this resulting stimulus was not felt by Delaware Avenue alone, but by all the neighborhood affected by this part of the improvement; and, by the removal of the grade crossings elsewhere, not only the streets named in the contract, but the near-by property in every direction therefrom, probably extending for miles to the southward of the elevated railroad tracks. All this, however, is beside the questions here, which are: Had the City of Philadelphia a reasonable right to believe, and hence to act on the belief, that Delaware Avenue, in the neighborhood of defendant's property, was ripe for the paving at the time it was done, irrespective of the question as to what was the cause of its reaching that condition, and was defendant’s property specially benefited by the paving?

Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/89/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="89 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="1063277" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0265-01">89 Pa. 265</a>), was that on each of <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>those streets the paving was done through a rural district, not needing municipal improvements, and for a reason which negatived the idea of an intention to benefit the abutting properties. In the present instance, if defendant had shown that the paving of Delaware Avenue at this point was not needed at the time it was laid, and its property was not benefited thereby, it would have presented a defense for a jury’s consideration, just as in Washington Avenue and Market Street, supra. This was not shown, however, and since the courts cannot inquire into the city’s reasons for doing that which she was legally entitled to do (Scott v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/266/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="266 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1055994" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0052-01">266 Pa. 52</a>; Roush v. Herbick, <a href="/pa/269/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="269 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1063607" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0145-01">269 Pa. 145</a>), we can only conclude that defendant has not carried the burden referred to in the beginning of this opinion, and plaintiffs’ prima facie right to recover has not been overthrown by the evidence.</p>
