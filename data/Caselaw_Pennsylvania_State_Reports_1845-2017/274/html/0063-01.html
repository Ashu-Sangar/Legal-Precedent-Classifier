This limited jurisdiction was greatly enlarged by the Act of April 18, 1919, P.

It is claimed that the words “except as hereinafter stated,” in the preamble to the preliminary injunction, and the language of- the second and third paragraphs of both decrees, necessarily make it questionable whether the first paragraph should not be limited to <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>other veins of coal than the “two so-called surface veins”; so that, as regards these latter veins, the coal company could remove sixty per cent of the coal from under the highways themselves, though this was wholly forbidden as to the other veins. The decrees, however, are clear and explicit in forbidding “all and singular <em>any </em>mining under the streets and highways,” whether from the “two so-called surface veins” or any others; the second and third paragraphs providing an additional safeguard of lateral support for the highways (as we said in Scranton v. Peoples Coal Co., <a href="/pa/256/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="256 Pa. 332" data-case-ids="1030754" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0332-01">256 Pa. 332</a>, could be required, when necessary), by forbidding the taking of more than sixty per cent of the coal in an area of 100 feet from the centre line of the streets and avenues and 50 feet from the centre line of the other highways. Appellant Hayes admits, — and this must have been apparent to the other individual appellants also, — that a greater necessity existed for preventing excess mining in the surface veins than in those lower down, for thus only could full protection be given to the highways, and hence he thought it singular that more coal would be allowed to be taken from the former than from the latter. It follows that, as appellants knew the purpose intended to be accomplished by these decrees, this “singular” interpretation should have been rejected as incorrect, despite the advice of counsel, who may not have been adequately informed regarding the facts. Appellants should also have known that the effect of the percentage clause, in the second and third paragraphs, was simply to provide that if, at the time the decrees were entered, but little coal had been taken from the surface veins immediately under the highways (some coal having theretofore been removed under each of them), a greater quantity could be taken from the specified areas outside the lines of the highways; if much had been taken, less could subsequently be removed outside these lines; but thereafter none could be taken from under the highways themselves. It may be added, though perhaps unnecessarily, in view of the above con<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>elusion, that the words “except as hereinafter stated,” in the preliminary decree, refer to the sixth paragraph where “Main Avenue is excepted from the operation of this order,” for reasons therein set forth.</p>

If plaintiff and appellants had entered into a contract which had for its purpose the preservation of the status which existed at the time those decrees were made, and the latter had breached it by doing the things of which complaint is now made, the cost of restoration would be the measure of plaintiff’s damage. So also, under like circumstances, if appellants wrongfully removed the coal and plaintiff was required to construct pillars to furnish adequate support to the highways, the damages would be measured by the expense thereof, with sufficient punitive damages added to cover these costs. A court would be weak indeed if a wrongdoer could wilfully violate its decrees, and escape with a less liability than if he had breached a contract or committed a tort.</p>

If this were not so, since a corporation can be punished by fine only, innocent stockholders would be compelled to pay the penalty, and the officers, unless they were stockholders also, would escape altogether, although the actual contempt was theirs.

These tacit admissions of their actual, though, as they say, not wilful or intentional violations of the decrees, may have had great weight with the court below in reaching its conclusions, and hence must be so considered by us in determining whether or not these appellants were responsible for the violations found; the evidence bearing upon this question being now stated as briefly as it can be done.</p>

While these areas were still being wrongfully worked, the officials of the company required a day’s notice of the intention of the city’s inspector to visit the mines (which occurred once in every five or six weeks after February 3, 1919), and then walls would be built preventing access to the places where the coal was being wrongfully removed, so camouflaged as to have the appearance of having been constructed long before, and falsely asserted to be for ventilating purposes or for the support of the roof. There were fifteen such walls. After the inspector had left the mine, on the conclusion of these numerous examinations, the walls would be pulled down as soon as it was desired to proceed with the prohibited mining, and thus the city’s officials were completely deceived and the violations long continued.</p>

In the present instance these books and maps were kept in the executive department, of which Christian was chief and where his and Hayes’s office was located, and the maps were posted, from time to time, under the direction of Pearn. Those which would have shown the workings in the areas where the roof was blown down to conceal the wrongful mining, could not be found, and of this fact no adequate explanation was made. At times the survey of the advanced work was kept on loose memoranda, or posted on blueprints instead of on the regular maps, and were placed in the office safe. On at least one occasion, after it became certain that these memoranda and blueprints would become valuable in showing what had been done, Pearn made certain postings therefrom on the maps, and then threw the original papers into a waste-paper basket, from which they appear to have been taken and burned; at least they were not produced (for the effect of this as evidence. <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>see McHugh v.

In other instances the advanced workings, demonstrating the violations of the decrees, were found duly entered on the maps of the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad Company, the coal company’s lessor, but not on those of the coal company, though the facts regarding these matters were, or should have been better known to defendant’s officers and employees than to the railroad company’s servants, since the former were constantly in the mine and the latter only occasionally. The books and papers referred to were always open to the inspection of these individual appellants, and presumably were examined by them, for not otherwise could they perform their duties as oficiáis of the company. If they were so examined, then appellants knew that the actual condition of the mine did not appear, that the results of second mining were not shown and that such entries as were made were long delayed. It cannot be presumed that they would have consented to these breaches of duty unless they had a reason for thus doing; indeed it was their own duty to so supervise the mining, which was in their charge, as to assure the fact that the court’s decrees were not violated, and a failure to do this possibly would be sufficient to charge them with contempt: Silliman v.

Appellants make the remarkable but suggestive statement regarding this, that they thought the city’s engineers were to be guests of the coal company, and were only “to examine the live workings”; this would appear to have meant, as theretofore, those “workings” which appellants chose to leave open for inspection; hence no objection was made to the visit when the day’s <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>delay was granted. When it was ascertained, however, that the engineers intended to take down one of the walls which hid the wrongful mining, Pearn and several others stood guard with sprags and refused to allow it to be done; and when the engineers still proposed to proceed, a body of armed miners appeared on the scene and the engineers were compelled to withdraw. Later, when the engineers and mayor reappeared, and it thus became known that the city would insist on a thorough inspection, Christian, though now professing innocence, personally refused to give them permission to enter the mine (though this was expressly authorized by the decrees), and gave orders to the employees to prevent it. This the latter attempted to do by disabling the machinery, and the entrance was finally effected through an adjoining mine. When the camouflaged walls were removed, though it was asserted no one had been behind them for a long time, the recent workings were made clear, newspapers but a few days old and a drill hole, loaded with dynamite but unexploded, were found there, and the places were in such a condition as to show an intention to resume the wrongful mining as soon as it could be done with safety.</p>

Recognizing this, Christian, in an endeavor to exculpate himself, points to certain other testimony which shows that, immediately after the decrees were made, he directed that they be obeyed, that he was sick at his home for some two months during the time the alleged violations were taking place, and even when well and at the office, was rarely in the mine. We are not so much concerned, however, with where he was or what he at first <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>said, as with what he said and did before and at the time of the violations.

Unhesitatingly one’s mind answers: Christian primarily, despite his contention above referred to. He was president, treasurer and director during the entire time covered by this controversy, and was receiving a salary for so acting and also a royalty on much of the coal mined. How much coal was left in the mine does not clearly appear, but it is reasonably certain it would rapidly become exhausted if that protected by the decree of the court was left undisturbed. It is also clear that the company had not been a financial success; Christian said it “had no profits but losses,” by reason whereof he had become a creditor for over $92,000, despite the high prices received for coal during the period of time covered by these proceedings. Apparently no other persons advanced any money to the company. In addition, Christian’s wife and her brother’s wife were the only stockholders of the company, Mrs. Christian receiving her $50,000 par value of stock by gift from her husband. He says no dividends were paid on this stock; but in any event the combined force of the facts stated shows that he had a strong motive to mine and sell at this particular time as much coal as possible, <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>and that he and his family alone stood to gain financially by so doing.</p>

As to Hayes the evidence is not so certain, but we cannot say there is an entire absence of clear and satisfactory proof thereof. He was general manager or general superintendent, and was getting $6,000 a year for half his time. True, he now denies he held these offices, and says he was only consulting engineer and assistant to the president, but since, in previous litigations, he swore he was general manager, at a time when he had no interest to deny the fact, he could hardly have expected the court below to accept his denial as true. As such officer he necessarily was often in the mine, not only when the wrongful mining was hidden by false walls and blown-down roof, but also when everything was open to his view, and he must have known that the decrees, a copy of which he had, were persistently being violated. On one occasion, when his attention was called to certain wrongful mining then going on, he said he would have it stopped, but did not; and in another instance he said mining could not be done at a particular place because of the “black damp,” though he knew or should have known that it was going on at that point in violation of the decrees. When he should have spoken, if innocent, he was silent, and continued in the employ of the company and under the control of Christian; these facts, added to the other matters above referred to, debar us from asserting there was no evidence he was acting in conjunction with Christian and Pearn in the wrong being done.</p>

The facts on • this point may be briefly stated: The fifth paragraphs of the decrees provide that “Plaintiff by its proper officers [shall] have the right of access to the mines at all reasonable times for the purpose of inspection.” After the mayor and engineers of the city had been refused access for the purpose of making the inspection, the former took forcible possession, and the investigation which followed resulted in a discovery of the facts above detailed. It would have been better had the mayor applied to the court, instead of proceeding by a strong hand; but since the discoveries serve to explain appellants’ conduct in opposing the inspection, which was expressly authorized by the decrees of the court, perhaps to some this measurably justifies the course pursued. Even if there is no justification, however, the argument made upon the point under consideration is without merit. All the violations complained of were before the mayor took possession; to say then that the flouting of the court’s decrees and reparation to the city for the wrong previously done, cannot equitably be granted because of his subsequent action, indicates a confusion of thought regarding the legal prin<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>ciples involved. If the decrees had been obtained by unclean methods, and the unclean person was seeking relief, a reason would appear for the contention now made; but this is not claimed, and indeed would not be a defense in this proceeding, for the remedy in that event would be an application to open or vacate them. Hence the remedy sought being reparation for a wrong which was consummated before the time when the mayor proceeded in the manner complained of, equity would grant relief even though he was himself the litigant: Orne v. Kittanning Coal Co., <a href="/pa/114/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="114 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="550022" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0172-01">114 Pa. 172</a>; Reynolds v.

A fortiori, the city, as the State’s agent, charged with the duty of protecting the public against wilful invasion of the state’s rights in her streets, cannot be affected by the act of the mayor, even if it be supposed he was in the wrong and personally would have been denied relief.</p>
