The tenure of these appointees was cut short by the sustaining of a demurrer, which raised the question of the power of the United States Court to take jurisdiction of a public service corporation in bankruptcy proceedings. Before they were ousted, the United States receivers, under authority of the court appointing them, issued receivers’ certificates to the amount of $3,000, which are held by one of the appellants, the Western Electric Company. On the termination of the functions of the United States receivers by the decree entered on the demurrer, the property of the company came back into the custody of the receiver appointed by the state court, and he subsequently sold it under order of the court which appointed him, and the fund realized, $10,000, is the subject-matter of these appeals. An auditor was appointed to distribute it and before him and the court below on exceptions to his report, the appellants, the Western Electric Company, holder of the receivers’ certificates heretofore referred to, and the Commonwealth, for state taxes due to it, presented claims which were disallowed and which we are asked to reinstate.</p>
