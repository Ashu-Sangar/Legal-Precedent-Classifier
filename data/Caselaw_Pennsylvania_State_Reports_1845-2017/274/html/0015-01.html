The court below was of opinion the remainder was contingent, and declined to allow an award to the representatives of brothers and sisters who died before the widow’s death leaving no issue to survive. The question presented is not altogther an easy one. When we look at the will from the standpoint of a layman, we are impressed at once with the thought testator intended to give his estate to his brothers and sisters, or the issue of his brothers and sisters surviving or living at the death of his widow. The court below held the remainder was contingent from different points of view. This divergence in thought is brought about because the words used to express testator’s intent make it a close case; the difficulties arise, not from anything testator refrained from doing, as witness the general import of the will, but from the adjudicated cases, wherein, through the application of artificial rules of construction to similar wills, there is in this case introduced a doubt which otherwise would not exist. These rules of construction have no place in determining the intention of a testator where it is reasonably clear from the will itself, but, when we compare the language of wills there disputed, we find a remarkable similarity in thought, with legal conclusions therefrom not altogether harmonious, and it would be more than difficult for the writer of this opinion to follow the finely spun threads of difference used in emphasizing the distinguishing element of each. Litigation of this class is always difficult, for its correct determination involves to a large extent scientific and psychologic study of the personal factor in the equation, dealing Avith <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>moral obligations as expressed in words, with a view of determining the latter’s relation to the state of mind of one since deceased, and as coinciding with fixed rules of law governing the transmission of property, — that is, regulating the acts which a man may or may not do with respect thereto, or regulating the disposal which a man may make of his property.</p>
    <p id="b43-5" data-blocks='[["BL_43.4",43,[209,715,1153,1465]]]'>Testator’s will seems to indicate an intention to create an estate, to begin and take effect at the widow’s death, and it first appears as such from the direction to pay and divide the principal; the persons who are to take are the persons to be then ascertained as in being “among my surviving brothers and sisters”; and, reasoning from the substitutionary bequests, it is made more certain, for it then appears “among my surviving brothers and sisters,” “if living,” and, if not living, the issue of such brothers and sisters are substituted, to take only the share their deceased parent would take. It means, moreover, the issue of the deceased parent could take only if the deceased parent was not living at the death of the life tenant. Much of the language of this clause would have been unnecessary if testator had intended the brothers and sisters to have a vested remainder, and were not to be alive at the time of distribution. Here the time fixed for the enjoyment, as well as the description of the thing to be enjoyed, made up the entire ulterior estate by a specific clause of the will, so that the period fixed is annexed not only to the payment and division, but also to the gift or devise itself, arising from division and payment. It follows, then, that the individuals to take could not be ascertained until the determination of the life estate. And, while this was a fixed, determined period, as the widow must die, the uncertain event was the survival of brothers and sisters, or issue of brothers and sisters.</p>

But, where the estate that follows is then brought into being through a direction to pay and divide among surviving brothers and sisters, if living, the description of the event which determines the prior estate will be construed not only as determining the possession or enjoyment of the prior gift, but as being designed to postpone the vesting of the ulterior estates there granted.</p>

The condition precedent was survival, that is, to pay and divide to surviving brothers and sisters if living, — the heirs to take the share of their deceased parent. It has frequently been said that if there is a present right to future possession, the estate is vested, but, where the time fixed for enjoyment is joined with and a part of the description creating the interest, there is not a present right to future enjoyment, but a contingent one. It was said in Marshall’s Est., <a href="/pa/262/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="262 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1044445" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0145-01">262 Pa. 145</a>, 148, that the presumption of vesting was not as strong with relation to collaterals as it was to lineal descendants. “Where there is no gift but in a direction to pay or transfer or divide among several persons, at a <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>future period, though the future period is annexed to the payment, possession or enjoyment, yet it is also annexed to the devise or bequest itself. For, in this case, the direction to pay or transfer or divide, constitutes the devise or bequest itself; and, therefore, the vesting in interest is postponed, and not merely the vesting in possession or enjoyment”: Smith on Executory Interests, section 314. “The ruling principle of a case like this is that where there is no separate and antecedent gift which is independent of the direction and time for payment, the legacy is contingent; and it seems to be well founded in reason, as rules of interpretation usually are. Where a gift is only implied from a direction to pay, it is necessarily inseparable from the direction, and must partake of its quality, insomuch that if the one is future and contingent, so must the other be”: Gibson, C. J., in Moore v. Smith, <a href="/watts/9/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="9 Watts 403" data-case-ids="1849953" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0403-01">9 Watts 403</a>, 407. “The rule ig conceded that where there is a bequest in the form of a direction to pay, or pay and divide ‘from and after’ the happening of any event, ‘then the gift being to persons answering a particular description, if a party cannot bring himself within it he is not entitled to take the benefit of the gift’ ”: Rosengarten v.
