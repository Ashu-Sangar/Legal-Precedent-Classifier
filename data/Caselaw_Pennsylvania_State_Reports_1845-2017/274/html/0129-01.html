On December 2, 1918, the defendant insurance company issued a $5,000 fire policy to the plaintiff bank, covering a quantity of cheese stored in the frame building of John Fiorini on the west side of Main Street in Mildred Borough, Sullivan County.. Later, plaintiff decided to. remove the cheese into a stone warehouse, situated a short distance away on the opposite side of the street. Thereupon the bank’s president, on December 26, 1918, telephoned J. H. Thayer, defendant’s agent, who had issued the policy, with reference to transferring the insurance to the new location. The evidence was conflicting as to this conversation; the jury, accepting defendant’s version, found that the bank president, when informed the insurance could be transferred, insisted that it be done immediately as the cheese would be moved that day, to which the agent, after vainly urging it would <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>be better to wait until the actual removal, consented, hung up the receiver and directed his clerk to record the transfer on the policy record in his office, which was done and entry thereof made as follows, viz: “Property insured under above policy is hereby transferred to a stone building situate on the East side Main Street, Mildred, Pa. Insurance to cease in old location and take effect in new from this date. J. H. Thayer, Agent a copy of which was sent same day to defendant’s district office at Scranton. The oral agreement for the transfer, however, did not expressly provide that the insurance should cease at the old location. Plaintiff’s agents immediately went with a team to the Fiorini building, but found it locked and Mr. Fiorini angrily forbade the removal of the cheese and drove them from the premises. No further effort was made to remove the cheese and it was destroyed by fire twelve days thereafter, without notice or knowledge to defendant of the failure to remove it. Plaintiff’s president, while admitting a telephone conversation with defendant’s agent, denied the making of such an agreement and the trial judge instructed the jury, in effect, that unless it found the minds of the parties met and both understood the agreement was for an immediate transfer of the insurance upon the cheese, from the old location to the new, plaintiff could recover. This was certainly all to which the latter was entitled.</p>

In the former the insured never ordered the policy transferred to the new location, and merely asked for permission to remove. In the latter the policy by express agreement, based on the consideration of an additional premium, covered the goods in both locations. But by the Act of June 8, 1915, P. L. 919, the standard policy (as is the one in suit) covers property while in one location “but not elsewhere,” except in case of a removal during or after fire.
