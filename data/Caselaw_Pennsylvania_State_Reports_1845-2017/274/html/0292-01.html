Plaintiffs aver in their statement “they performed all things on their part to be performed under the policy, but defendant has broken the covenants on its part to be performed.” The affidavit of defense denies this by setting up that the premises “were situated upon leased ground, and plaintiffs had knowledge the premises were situated on leased ground, but nevertheless concealed that fact from defendant, all in violation of the terms and conditions of the policy of insurance.”</p>

It is admitted that, prior to the Act of 1915, this fact would have been at issue under the general issue plea. The Act of 1915 specifically states what the pleadings shall consist of, and when cases shall be deemed at issue. This case was at issue on filing the affidavit, and defendant evidently concluded the disputed fact was thus put in issue, with a right in plaintiffs to introduce evidence in relation to estoppel. Only where defendant sets up a set-off or counterclaim is an answer required, under section 15 of the Act of 1915. In no other case does the act provide for an answer, and, as this defense clearly is not a set-off or counterclaim, no further pleadings were required, and plaintiff was at liberty to introduce this evidence. It was not necessary, under the act, to anticipate the defense by averring, by way of confession and avoidance, the facts of estoppel in the statement of claim. How is plaintiff to know defendant will wrongfully undertake to secure undue advantage of the nonexistence of a fact required by the policy to exist, of which it had full knowledge, but its existence deemed unnecessary before the policy issued? Plaintiffs stood in a position of having substantially complied with the requirements of the policy, and awaited the insurance company’s answer to their suit. The effect of this an<a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>swer was to place the disputed fact in issue as squarely as if it had been raised by confession and avoidance in plaintiffs’ statement of claim. Sections 6, 14 and 15 of the act must be read together, and, when so read, it becomes apparent there is nothing in the act to alter this important feature of pleading; evidently defendant recognized this, for, in its affidavit of defense, as above quoted, it avowed that the fact that the building was on leased ground was “nevertheless concealed [by]...... plaintiffs,” an issuable question which plaintiffs had clearly the right to rebut on the trial, just as they did. The evidence of estoppel was germane to the allegation in the affidavit, going a step further, showing knowledge in defendant, at the time the policy was issued, of the thing to which it now seeks to take advantage. The company issued the policy without any fraud or misrepresentation on part of plaintiffs. Rinker v. Ætna Life Ins.

In the former, facts in explanation and avoidance of statements contained in a writing must be set out in the bill: Doughty v.

It is linked with other statements which are not binding agreements as to their truth, — by their nature they could not be. They may or may not be the basis of issuing the policy, usually not, — and by their nature they could not be warranties, relating, as they do, to future acts. At best they are but representations that the facts are true, or that certain acts will be performed in the future; if untrue, or if the acts are unperformed, this untruth or failure amounts to a misrepresentation: Lycoming Ins.

Waivers need not be express; they may be inferred from acts which recognize a liability or a condition existing contrary to a statement made in the policy which, to them, appears not of sufficient importance to deter them from issuing the policy. The company does not consider such requirement as a hazard in view of many circumstances. A building is no more liable to burn if situated on leased than fee land. The character of the owners may cause the location to be a greater hazard, but, when approved persons apply, the risk is no greater than fee ownership, and is so regarded by accepting the premiums, with knowledge of the truth. The reason for the estoppel may be readily seen.</p>

Usually, whether a sufficient foundation has been laid for such course is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.

The witness was then withdrawn, defendant, however, protesting the former should not read the notes of testimony to refresh his memory when off the stand. Whether he did so or not did not then appear. On resuming, he was asked whether he had further enlightened himself as to what transpired between him and the general agent. The objection to this was general, and, of course, the evidence was clearly admissible as the record then stood. Had defendant interrogated the witness as to how he became enlightened, before answering plaintiffs’ counsel, defendant might have raised the question. Instead, however, it waited until the witness was turned over for cross-examination, and then brought out the fact that the enlightenment came from reading the notes of the previous trial. There was no request to strike out the testimony of the witness; nor was any further attention called to it; the question as to whether a proper foundation had been laid is not before us.</p>
