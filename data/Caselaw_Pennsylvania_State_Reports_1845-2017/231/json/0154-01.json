The referee found that the bonds in question were sold and not pledged to the appellants. The finding of the referee was confirmed by the court below. After a careful consideration of the case, we find sufficient evidence before the referee to warrant his finding and having been approved by the court, it will not be disturbed.\nJudgment affirmed.",
