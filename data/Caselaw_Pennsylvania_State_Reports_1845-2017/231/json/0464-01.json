The decree requiring the defendant to abate and remove all parts of its building protruding or projecting upon or overhanging the appellees\u2019 premises, is but an enforcement of the agreement of March 28,1904, between the appellant and the appellees\u2019 predecessors in title.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.",
