He claimed a further reduction on the allegation that the standard of valuation throughout the district was below the market value. The court found that the valuation of $130,000 was uniform with the valuation of other real estate throughout the county. This finding, to which an exception is taken has not only all the weight of a finding of fact by the court, but the rule that such a finding will not be disturbed except for manifest error applies to it with exceptional force because of the nature of the subject of inquiry.\nThe decree is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.",

T., 1910, by Edgar T. Scott, from order of C. P. Delaware Co., March T., 1910, No. 90, in Re Appeal of Edgar T. Scott from assessment for taxation.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Elkin, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal under the Act of April 19, 1889, P. L. 38, from tax assessment.\nBroomall, J., found, inter alia, the following as a fact:\nWe are convinced that there is no such thing in Delaware county as adjusting the tax valuations at a less sum than the public sale valuations, and that such a rule would be a bad one to adopt.
