        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe ground of this action was that the defendant had wrongfully and maliciously injured one of the plaintiffs, a boy ten years of age, causing permanent deafness. The only assignment of error pressed at the argument relates to the refusal of the court to instruct the jury that any recovery by the plaintiffs should be restricted to compensatory damages. A witness to the occurrence, called by the plaintiffs, testified that the defendant seized the boy by the neck and threw him violently against an iron box or slot machine, and at the same time kicked him. It appeared from the testimony of the defendant, that his son and the plaintiff, who were near the same age, had quarreled on the street and his son had returned home and told him of the occurrence. More than fifteen minutes afterwards, while the defendant was seated in a chair on the pavement, in front of his house, reading a newspaper, the plaintiff, who was on the opposite side of the street, was pointed out to him as the boy who had quarreled with his son, and he crossed the street to where the boy stood. Whatever he then did was not in defense of his son nor in sudden heat or excitement because his son had been beaten by the plaintiff. Whether under the circumstances it was wanton and vindictive, was a question for the jury and it was properly submitted.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

Domansky, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Damages\u2014Compensatory or punitive damages \u2014 Wanton assault.\nIn an action for personal injuries inflicted upon a boy nine years of age it is not error for the court to refuse to instruct the jury that plaintiff\u2019s recovery should be restricted to compensatory damages where it appears from defendant\u2019s evidence that his son and the plaintiff, who were near the same age, had quarreled on the street, and that fifteen minutes after being informed of the occurrence, while seated in front of his house reading a newspaper, he perceived the plaintiff across the street, and went over where he was; and a witness to the occurrence called by plaintiff testified that the defendant seized the boy by the neck and threw him violently against an iron slot machine, and at the same time kicked him.\nArgued Jan. 18, 1911.\nAppeal, No. 187, Jan. T., 1910, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 4, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1907, No. 618, on verdict for plaintiffs in case of Frank Perovich, by his father and next friend, Ambrose Perovich, and Ambrose Perovich v. Vincent Domansky. Before Fell, C. J.,\nBrown, Mestrezat,' Potter and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries to a minor child. Before Willson, P. J.\nThe facts appear in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nAt the trial the defendant offered the following point, which was refused;\n\u201cIf the jury find for the plaintiffs in this case, they are restricted, under the pleading, to a verdict for compensatory damages, and punitive damages cannot be given to the plaintiffs.\u201d\nVerdict of $3,000 for the minor plaintiff and $1,000 for his father, and judgment thereon.\nError assigned among others was in refusing defendant\u2019s point as above.\nMarch 20, 1911:\nJohn G. Johnson, and Henry B. Patton, with them William W. Staake, for appellant.\nIt is error to instruct the jury that they may find punitive damages where the evidence justifies only compensatory damages: Rose v. Story, 1 Pa. 190; Lynch v.
