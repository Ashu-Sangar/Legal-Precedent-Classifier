    "head_matter": "London Guarantee & Accident Company, Ltd., v. Ogelsby, Appellant.\nInsurance \u2014 Indemnity insurance \u2014 Premium\u2014\u201cKind of work \u201d\u2014 Contract.\nIa an action to recover premiums on policies of indemnity insurance, it appeared that the defendant was a contracting plumber, employing in his business not only plumbers, but helpers, laborers and others. In a schedule in the policy under the caption of \u201cKind of work \u201d were included \u201cPlumbers inside buildings \u201d and \u201cPlumbers exterior construction.\u201d The estimated pay roll for the policy term of the first class was $10,000 and of the second class $2,000. Following the schedule was this clause: \u201cThe estimated pay roll covers wages of all persons employed at the places mentioned above, including executive officers and office men and drivers and drivers\u2019 helpers, except as follows: Except assured and office force.\u201d Held, that the policy included all persons engaged in defendant\u2019s plumbing business, whether they were actual plumbers or not, and that the insured was liable for premiums in accordance with this construction of the contract.\nArgued Jan. 5, 1911.\nAppeal, No. 175, Jan. T., 1910, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1906, No. 4710, on verdict for plaintiff in case of London Guarantee & Accident Company, Ltd., v. William P. Ogelsby.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit to recover the premiums on a policy of indemnity insurance. Before Br\u00e9gy, P. J.\nAt the trial the jury under the instructions of the court returned a verdict for $2,345.31.\nOn a motion for judgment for defendant n. o. v. Br\u00e9gy, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThis is a suit to recover the amount claimed to be due to the plaintiff as deferred premiums on policies of indemnity insurance.\nThe amount claimed is due if the policies issued by the plaintiff company insured the defendant against accidents \u2014 to his helpers, laborers, and others that were engaged in the work of his plumbing business \u2014 in addition to the plumbers themselves. The defendant\u2019s contention is that the policies only insured the actual plumbers\u2014 if he is right in this, the verdict is wrong.\nThe best way to determine this is to ascertain whether, if suit was brought for illustration for injury to a plumber\u2019s helper or laborer, would the insurance company be liable.\nAnd in doing this the principle must be kept in mind that in construing the policy, it must be construed as strongly as possible against the company issuing the policy.\nIn the policy there is a section of it called \u201c Schedule.\u201d In the fourth section of that schedule this is what appears:\n4th. The place or places where work is to be carried on, the kind of work at each such place, the number of employees and estimated pay roll at each, such place as stated below:\nThe first question is, does the entry under the title \u201cKind of Work,\u201d indicate or mean that only plumbers were insured? We believe that entry applied only to the business or kind of work Mr. Ogelsby was engaged in, and this view clearly appears to be right, when we look at sec. 5 of the schedule, which is in these words:\n\u201cThe operations carried on are those usual to the trade or Idnd of work described above.\u201d We then have the assertion that the policy which insured Mr. Ogelsby was against accidents occurring during the carrying on of operations usual to the kind of work described under that title. Mr. Ogelsby was a contracting plumber, doing the kind of work mentioned in the schedule under the title \u201cKind of Work.\u201d\nThis applies, of course, only to the kind of operations that the policy covered. We think the question as to what persons were insured is settled by the twelfth section of the schedule, taken in connection with the entry under the item \u201cEstimated Pay Roll for Policy Term,\u201d in sec. 4 of the schedule. The entries under the above caption are $10,000 and $2,000.\n\u201cThe estimated pay roll covers wages of all persons employed at the places mentioned above including executive officers and office men and drivers and driver\u2019s helpers, except as follows: Except assured and office force.\u201d\nThe premiums to be paid for the policy is to be based upon the amount of the pay roll of the insured persons. It is a percentage of the pay roll under sec. 4, as already stated. Mr. Ogelsby put down the sum of $10,000 as the amount of \u201cEstimated Pay Roll for Policy Term\u201d\u2014 opposite the entry \u201cPlumber\u2019s inside building \u2014 including the making of house connections, gas, steam and hot water apparatus, filters and installation of ventilating plants away from the shop,\u201d and opposite the words \u201cPlumber\u2019s exterior construction work only\u201d the sum of $2,000 was put down.\nWe think the answer to the question as to what these two entries \u2014 $10,000 and $2,000 \u2014 mean settles the question of the insurance company\u2019s responsibility.\nSection 12 says: \u201cThe estimated pay roll (that is, the entries above alluded to) covers the wages of all persons employed at the places mentioned above, etc., etc.\u201d\nIn a suit against the insurance company, it seems to us that a defense by them that the estimated pay roll only covered actual plumbers, would fail in view of the words of sec. 12, so often quoted by us.\nOtherwise the state of affairs would be that a company issuing a policy to a customer who indicated under the words \u201c Kind of Work\u201d that his business was that of a general contracting plumber, and who had indicated the amount of his pay roll, with the assertion in the schedule (which is signed by the applicant for insurance), that the pay roll covered the wages of all persons employed at the places mentioned \u2014 did not insure all persons so employed.\nTo construe that policy as strongly as these words would permit, must result in holding this company liable. This makes the present defendant liable.\nThe offer made of testimony to alter the terms of the policy we think did not come up to the legal requirements. Iii our opinion there is no doubt about the construction of the policy and the admission of what was offered would be most dangerous.\nApril 10, 1911:\nThe rule for a new trial is discharged and the motion for judgment n. o. v., etc., is dismissed.\nKinsey, J., concurring.\nError assigned was in giving binding instructions for plaintiff.\nRuby R. Vale for appellant.\nThe policy applied to plumbers only: Dives v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 206 Pa. 199; People\u2019s Ice Co. v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assur. Corp., 161 Mass. 122 (36 N. E.

Repr. 994).\nW. W. Smithers, for appellee.\nThe policy was properly construed by the court below: Smith v. Ins. Co., 103 Pa. 177; Reynolds v. Casualty Co., 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 456; Hughes v. Accident Ins. Co., 222 Pa. 462; Humphreys v. Ben. Assn., 139 Pa. 264; Western & Atl. Pipe Lines v. Ins. Co., 145 Pa. 346; New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Mesker, 106 S. W. Repr. 561."
