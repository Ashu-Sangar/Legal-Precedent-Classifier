        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Potter,\nThis action was brought by plaintiffs to recover damages for injuries to their growing crops of vegetables, alleged to have been caused by noxious products, smoke and soot, emitted from the oil refinery of the defendant company. Upon the trial, evidence was offered on the part of the defendant, tending to show that the loss of the crops was not due to injuries caused by products from the smokestack of the refinery, but was owing to lack of proper care, and to the ravages of insects, and to smoke from locomotives passing upon a railroad track near by. The issue of fact thus raised, as to the cause of the injuries, was determined by the jury in favor of plaintiffs. From the judgment entered upon the verdict, defendant has appealed.\nThe first and second assignments of error are to the refusal of the court below to enter judgment in favor of the defendant, non obstante veredicto, and to the refusal of defendant\u2019s first point, asking for binding instructions in its favor. In support of these assignments, it is urged that there can be no recovery because there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant company in the operation of its works. But in Robb v. Carnegie Bros. & Co., 145 Pa. 324, which is a leading case on the subject, we held that evidence of negligence is not necessary in order to establish a claim for damages in a suit of this kind. The defendants in that case had erected coke ovens on land adjoining plaintiff\u2019s farm. Plaintiff alleged \u201cthat the smoke and gas from these ovens passed over his farm injuring thereby his crops, his soil and the comfort of his home.\u201d In denying plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, defendant contended that the injuries resulted \u201cfrom the pursuit of a lawful calling, in a lawful manner, without either negligence or malice, on the part of the owner or his employees.\u201d But this court held that where land is used for manufacturing purposes, the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non lsedas should apply. Counsel for appellant here cite Stewart v. De Noon, 220 Pa. 154, as sustaining their position; but in that case, the injury was not the result of the ordinary conduct of the business. The damages were caused by a fire originating in an explosion on defendant\u2019s premises. So in Zahniser v. Torpedo Co., 190 Pa. 350, which is also cited, the action was by the owners of an oil property to recover damages from a contractor, for the injuries caused by a premature explosion. The only question considered was whether the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur would apply. Appellant also relies upon Harvey v. Coal Co., 201 Pa. 63, where the action was for injuries caused by the alleged negligent escape of coal dust from a breaker; but that is one of the exceptional cases referred to in Robb v. Carnegie Bros. & Co., 145 Pa. 324, where negligence must be shown. The distinction is pointed out by Henderson, J., in Campbell v. Coke Co., 23 Pa. Superior Ct. 374 (380). The case of Stokes v. Penna. R. R. Co., 214 Pa. 415, is a later authority-sustaining the right to recover here without showing negligence. It was there expressly held that an averment of negligence contained in plaintiff\u2019s statement, as in the present case, did not impose on him the duty of showing negligence by his evidence at the trial. Mr. Justice Stewart said (p. 419): \u201cTrue, the statement filed in this case averred that the acts complained of had been done negligently, but this did not. make negligence a material question; the action being for damages occasioned by maintenance of a nuisance, the question of negligence was not involved.\u201d\nThe third and eighth assignments relate to the exclusion of evidence .that the defendant used the most effective and approved appliances. But the excluded evidence would be material only as to the question of negligence; and, as we have just pointed out, that is not important here.\nThe fourth and fifth assignments are to the refusal of points relating to the measure of damages. Appellant contended that loss of profits in being compelled to raise less productive crops, or decrease in rental value, should have been the measure. But no evidence was offered upon which to base any such a measure of damages. The trial judge allowed recovery for the value of the crops alleged to have been destroyed, and this was in accordance with the rule in Robb v. Carnegie Bros. & Co., 145 Pa. 324.\nWe see no merit in the sixth assignment of error, in which complaint is made that a witness was allowed to testify upon cross-examination, against objection, that he received complaints about the smokestack,' from other persons than plaintiffs. In his direct examination the witness had put plaintiffs in the position of chronic complainers, and it was competent to show on cross-examination that they were not the only objectors.\nIn the seventh assignment it is alleged that the trial judge erred in permitting a witness to testify against objection that the defendant had annual agreements with certain peopl\u00e9 in the vicinity to reimburse them for damages done by the smoke from its works. This testimony was improper, we think. Such payments if made would naturally be in the nature of compromises, and as such could not properly be shown. Payment of claims of other people would not justify an inference of liability to these plaintiffs. This assignment is sustained.\nIn the ninth assignment it is alleged that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit testimony that the vegetation at the same place showed substantially the same kind of injury in subsequent seasons, when the works of defendant in question were not in operation. The offer of defendant was to prove that the witness on the previous day had collected salad or spinach, from a farm right in the neighborhood of plaintiffs\u2019 place, and that it presented the same appearance as that which the plaintiffs contended was the result of the fumes from the stack, although the stack had been out of operation for two or three years. This offer bore directly upon the main question at issue, which was, whether the injury to the vegetables was due to the products cast forth by defendant\u2019s smokestack, or was due to some other cause. If it could be shown that vegetables in the same place presented the same appearance of injury in succeeding years, when defendant\u2019s works were not in operation, it was certainly material to the inquiry; and it was error to exclude evidence of that nature. Authority is hardly needed to substantiate this ruling, but the general principle is thus set forth in 17 Cyc. L. & Pr. 288, where it is said: \u201cPersistent recurrence of a given result when one antecedent alone remains constant is highly probative that this antecedent is the cause of the result. In order to meet such evidence, or generally, it is entirely relevant to prove instances where the alleged cause was present and the result failed to follow; or where the same result followed when the alleged cause was not present; provided the other conditions are shown to be sufficiently similar to render the evidence relevant.\u201d\nTestimony tending to show that the vegetation showed the same sort of blight or injury as that of which complaint was here made, at a subsequent time, when it could not have been caused by the products of defendant\u2019s stack, would fairly justify an inference that the injury for which recovery was here sought, was not caused by the operation of defendant\u2019s works.\nBy reason of the errors set forth in the seventh and ninth assignments, the judgment is reversed, with a venire facias de novo.",

The action in such a case is for damages occasioned by the maintenance of a nuisance.\n2. Where land is used for manufacturing purposes the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non lades applies.\n3. In aii action against an oil refining company to recover damages for injuries to crops alleged to have been caused by noxious fumes, the measure of damages is the value of the crops alleged to have been destroyed.\n4. In such a case where a witness for the defendant had put the plaintiffs in the position of chronic eomplainers, it is competent to ask him upon cross-examination whether he had not received complaints from other persons than the plaintiffs.\n\u2022 5. In an action for damages for nuisance it is not permissible to permit, a witness to testify against objection that the defendant company. had annual argreements with people other than the plaintiffs, in the vicinity, to compensate them for damages done by the smoke from its works.\n6.

Were the Vautiers the only people you ever received complaints from in the spring and fall about the smoke from that stack? \u201d\nObjected to by counsel for defendant. Objection overruled; exception to defendant. [6]\n\u201cQ. Were the Vautiers the only people you got complaints from in the spring at all? A. No. Q. As a matter of fact, Mr. Houpt, did\u2019nt your company have agreements, annual agreements, with certain people there in the Neck for reimbursement for damages done them by your smoke?\nA. Yes.\u201d\nMr. Brown: I object to that and ask that the answer be stricken out.\nThe Court: \u201c Q. Do you mean as to vegetables? A. Why, there were certain people.\u201d\nMr. Brown: I object to this, your honor.\nThe Court: I want to have sufficient evidence upon which to base a ruling on your objection, Mr. Brown.\nMr. Brown: Then I don\u2019t object, your honor.\nThe Court: I will overrule the objection and give you the exception, Mr. Brown. [7]\n\u201cNow, Mr. Houpt, were or were not the appliances used by the Atlantic Refining Company the most effective and approved known appliances for the purposes for which they were intended?\nObjected to by counsel for plaintiff. Objection sustained; exception to defendant. [8]\nMr. Brown: I offer to prove by this witness that yesterday he collected salad,, or spinach, from a farm right in this neighborhood, that was lousy, just as the witnesses have testified to, and it shows the same appearance as the plaintiffs contend resulted from the fumes of this stack.\nMr. Stevenson: I object to it. This was done yesterday.\nMr. Brown: I want to show that the very condition of the spinach to-day is the same and that it has the same appearance that Mr. Vautier's had, and this stack has been but of work now for two or three years.\nMr. Stevenson: I still object to it.\nObjection sustained; exception to defendant. [9]\nThe court charged in part as follows:\n[Both the plaintiffs and the defendant were engaged in legitimate enterprises, the one as farmers and other as refiners of oil, and each had the absolute right to the enjoyment of their property, though neither was permitted under the law to so use their property as to destroy the products of the other.] [10]\nDefendant presented these points:\n2. If you find that defendant used the most effective and approved known appliances to control the emission of soot from the chimney of the sweetening plant, then no lack of care could be imputed to it, and if nevertheless some soot did escape and settle on plaintiffs' crops, the injury, if any, would be damnum absque injuria and your verdict should be for the defendant.
