The distillery was closed, as well as the rectifying departments at 242 South Front street, in the city of Philadelphia. In order that the business might be resumed, it was necessary for the executors to obtain license from the court of Philadelphia, and from the court of Westmoreland county. It also became necessary for the executors to furnish large bonds to the United States government. They were required to give bonds aggregating in amount about $2,509,000, and, as we understand, these bonds, are required to be annually renewed. There were about 40,000 barrels of whisky in the bonded warehouses at Gibsonton, and 30,000 barrels more belonging to customers. The decedent had established agencies in the cities of New York and Boston. Expert accountants were retained to examine the books and accounts of the decedent’s business, so that the executors might be properly informed of the situation. They retained Mr. John Sinnottas manager, as the testator expressly recommended, at a salary of $15,000 per year, and they placed a Mr. Daly in charge of the business at Gibsonton. The importance of the business, the great responsibility resting upon the executors, their positive duty to manage it for the best interests of the estate, called for the best business judgment, and the executors very properly resolved themselves into a board of directors, so to speak, held regular meetings, kept full minutes of every proceeding, and acted after full consultation and due deliberation. There were frequent consultations with the expert accountants, and the manager, and those in charge of the business at Gibson-ton. The manager was required to furnish accounts of the business each month, and full detailed statements every three months. There were daily consultations with the <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>manager, and the executors’ counsel. Many difficult questions arose day after day, requiring not only work and labor to solve, but also the application of the very best business judgment. Under the laws of the state of Massachusetts, in order that the agency business in the city of Boston might continue, ancillary letters on the estate were required. This involved additional labor and responsibility. Another matter of grave concern arose out of the failure of the Real Estate Trust Company, of Philadelphia, the surety upon the bonds given by the executors to the United States. Immediately after the public had been informed of the failure of the company, United States officials notified the executors to file new bonds. This required the executors to find additional surety, and to act without delay, because failure to comply with the demand of the government would have resulted in the closing down of the entire distilling business.</p>

The exceptant makes no point that the estate in the hands of the executors is not to be transferred at this time to them as trustees. He frankly stated that for the purposes of the case, the taking over of the assets of the distillery business might be regarded as an actual conversion. We are not, therefore, confronted with the situation the estate was in when the appeal was heard in the Supreme Court. The estate has not only been conserved, but for present purposes has been converted.</p>

Justice Stewart when this case was before the Supreme Court, said, “The basis on which compensation must be determined in every case where it takes the form of a commission, is the amount <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>of the estate administered upon and accounted for. With this amount ascertained, such per centum rate may be allowed thereon as in the opinion of the auditing judge will afford just and reasonable compensation to the accountants.” He further said, “Until such conversion shall have been accomplished, no compensation will have been earned as to these assets, and therefore none will be allowed.”</p>

As to the compensation of the Fidelity Trust Company, that was fixed by the testator himself, under agreement of April 18, 1900. He agreed to appoint the company one of the executors and trustees, and provided that they should have a commission of one and one-half per centum of the principal of the estate if it inventoried over $1,000,000, and a commission of two per cent on the income, and that they should have for acting as trustees two per centum on the income, and an allowance of one-half of one per centum on reinvestments. The compensation of the company was graduated if the inventory was over $500,000 and less than $1,000,000, or if it was over $100,000 and less than $500,000. The agreement also provided that the company’s compensation should be outside of the compensation of the other executors and trustees, which the decedent was to fix.</p>

On this appeal the question is as to the commissions to which the other four are entitled on the corpus of the estate, amounting to $2,503,099.95. They are to be allowed “just and reasonable compensation” for their services : Sinnott’s Est., <a href="/pa/224/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="224 Pa. 333" data-case-ids="963061" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0333-01">224 Pa. 333</a>. They asked credit in their account for commissions at the rate of three and one-half per cent on the principal of the estate, and, in sustaining an exception filed by the appellant to this item, the learned judge below, in his adjudication of the account, reduced the commissions to two and one-half per cent, saying: “We have given the matter careful consideration, and have reached the conclusion that the four executors, under all the circumstances, will be reasonably compensated within the meaning of the law if they receive two and one-half per centum on the corpus of the estate.

We are satisfied that the conclusion reached by the auditing judge in his adjudication was the correct one, and no good or substantial reason is to be found in the opinion of the court sustaining appellees’ exception for disturbing the original finding. The decree allowing the appellees three and one-half per cent on the principal of the estate is reversed, and it is now ordered and decreed that they be allowed two and one-half per cent thereon, found in the adjudication to be reasonable compensation to them, the costs on this appeal to be paid by the estate.</p>
