The grandchildren were then minors, and their interests were not passed upon. Emily Hoopes, one of these grandchildren, is now of full age. At the audit of the present account she claimed that upon reaching her majority she was entitled to her share absolutely and free of trust; contending that the provisions of the will postponing the payment of the principal were void, and that the limitations -over were only intended as substitutionary b’equests in the event of her death during the life of the testator. The court below held that the will created a valid trust for this share until she should reach the age of twenty-five years, and awarded the principal to the trustee named in the will.

It may be that if the first clause .... stood alone, it would give a fee simple .... absolute .... But .... the testator has declared in effect that such was not his intention.

It is apparent that the testatrix considered it inexpedient to turn over to her grandchildren the principal of the shares bequeathed to them until they should reach the age of twenty-five years; she, therefore, placed these shares in the control of a trustee, vesting in him the power to make investments, which of necessity included the right to reinvest the principal from time to time during the running of the trust: Eshbach’s Est., <a href="/pa/197/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="197 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="918674" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0153-01">197 Pa. 153</a>. She further directs the trustee to use the income for the maintenance, support and education of her grandchildren, with discretionary power to consume principal for these purposes. It would be difficult to find a trust where the necessity for the control of the fund to carry out the intent of the testator was more apparent. In the words of Mr. Justice Green, in Harbster’s Est., <a href="/pa/133/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="133 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="812910" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0351-01">133 Pa. 351</a>, “It is very clear, indeed, to us that the trust reposed in the executors is an .active trust, which makes it necessary at all times for them to have possession of the fund until it is ultimately paid over to the persons entitled to the principal.”</p>

Here, first, not only are there limitations over, but, as we have already shown, there is an active trust to fulfill a lawful purpose; next, it is plain that the testatrix contemplated that her grandchildren would survive her, otherwise she would not have made such specific provision for the care of their estates and for their respective maintenance and education until a certain age. The rule of construction which limits the death of the first taker to the testator’s lifetime is adopted in aid of what is conceived to be the general intent of a will, but it is never applied where the beneficiary is expressly treated as living at a period subsequent to the death of the testator: Stoner v.
