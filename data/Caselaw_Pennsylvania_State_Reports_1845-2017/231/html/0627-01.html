In an action against a street railway company to recover damages for death of plaintiff’s husband killed by falling from the running board of a summer car, a verdict and judgment for plaintiff will be sustained where the evidence tends to show that the deceased was either thrown from the car by its rapid motion when it entered a switch, or that he was knocked off by striking a standing car on the main track; that the track and switch were so jiear each other that there were but twenty-eight inches between the sides of the cars and but two inches between the running boards; that the car started as soon as the deceased stepped on the running board, and that he fell within eight or ten seconds after-wards, while he was endeavoring to get into the car, which was crowded with passengers.</p>

No witness saw him at the moment that he fell, but there was testimony tending to show that he was thrown from the running board by the motion of the car when it entered a switch at a rapid rate of speed or that he was knocked off by striking a standing car on the main track. This track and the switch track were so near each other that there were but twenty-eight inches between the sides of the cars and but two inches between the running boards. The car started as soon as <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>the deceased stepped on the running board and the accident happened within a very brief space of time after-wards, estimated by some witnesses as eight or ten seconds. During this time the deceased was endeavoring to get into the car which was crowded with passengers. This testimony would have justified an inference of negligence on the part of the defendant and it disclosed no negligence on the part of the deceased. It was submitted with the distinct instruction, that a passenger who remains on the running board of a car an unnecessary length of time, when there is room inside, is negligent and there can be no recovery for his injury or death.</p>

But where remarks of counsel are objected to as prejudicial, the circumstances under which they were made should be considered. A witness for the plaintiff was charged with having made false statements to the defendant’s employees in order to obtain information from them and to secure an opportunity to make measurements, and the remarks of plaintiff’s counsel were in reply to this charge and in justification of the witness and in comparing the difficulty the plaintiff had in ascertaining the facts with the ease with which they could be presented by the defendant. It does not appear that the remark was made for <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>the purpose of exciting antagonism, and the learned trial judge carefully guarded against any prejudicial effect it might have on the minds of the jurors.</p>
