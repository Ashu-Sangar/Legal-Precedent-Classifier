At the trial, offers of testimony were made, to show that before the adjudication by the orphans’ court one of the executors had sold the widow six houses under a verbal agreement with her that he, and his coexecutor “were to take of such moneys as might come into their hands” as executors, the amount of the purchase price of the houses that was unpaid. The purpose of the offer, as stated by counsel, was to prove that long prior to the adjudication, the amount the widow was found to be entitled to, had by the agreement mentioned, been paid her, and that nothing was then due her by the executors. The assignments of error relate to the overruling of these offers and the direction of a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>
