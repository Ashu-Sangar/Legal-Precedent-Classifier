The suit was brought in the name of G. Percy Lemont, assignee of George W. Waslee, who was assignee of the Continental Title and Trust Company, who was assignee of George W. Waslee, the mortgagee, v. Paul Rossman, mortgagor, and Lulu Waslee, real owner. No interest was ever paid upon this mortgage, and the suit is to recover the principal sum and interest. The mortgage is secured upon the premises 1942 North Eleventh street, Philadelphia. It appears that George W. Waslee had agreed to purchase the property from Moses Hamburger and had paid $100 on account, and at or about May 8, 1905, he paid the balance of the purchase money for the property to Moses Hamburger. George W. Waslee, however, did not take the title in his own name, but on May 8, 1905, Moses Hamburger conveyed to Paul Rossman (who was a straw man), the consideration mentioned in the deed being $4,250. On the same day, Paul Rossman created a mortgage for $4,250, upon which the present suit has been brought; and upon the same day, May 8, 1905, Paul <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>Rossman conveyed to George W. Waslee for a consideration mentioned in the deed of one dollar, subject to the mortgage of $4,250 from Rossman to Waslee. The deed from Hamburger to Rossman, and the mortgage from Rossman to Waslee was recorded May 8, 1905. The deed from Rossman to Waslee was not recorded until January 9, 1906. On January 9, 1906, George W. Waslee assigned to the Continental Title and Trust Company the mortgage for $4,250, and on the same day George W. Waslee created a mortgage in favor of the Continental Title and Trust Company for $2,500. The assignment and the mortgage for $2,500 were recorded on January 9,1906. The transaction between George W. Waslee and the Continental Title and Trust Company was as follows: The Continental Title and Trust Company loaned to Waslee $2,500 upon his collateral note, with the mortgage for $4,250 as collateral security, and also took a mortgage from Waslee for $2,500 upon the same property. On January 12th, 1906, George W. Waslee, by deed recorded the same day, conveyed the premises in question to Paul Rossman for a consideration mentioned in the deed for $1.00, subject to a mortgage of $2,500 created in favor of the Continental Title and Trust Company. The deed from Waslee to Rossman of January 12, 1906, recited the deed from Rossman to Waslee of May 8, 1905, subject to the $4,250 mortgage, and then uses the following words: “which said mortgage debt is intended to be paid off and satisfied of record.” On the same date, Paul Rossman conveyed the premises to Lulu Waslee, for a consideration mentioned in the deed of $1.00, subject to the $2,500 mortgage. On March 11, 1907, Lulu Waslee paid to the Continental Title and Trust Company $2,500, which George W. Waslee had borrowed, the $2,500 mortgage to the Continental Title and Trust Company was satisfied of record as of March 15, 1907, and the mortgage of $4,250 was assigned back to George W. Waslee. This assignment was recorded on March 12, 1907. On October 3, 1908, George W. Waslee assigned to G. Percy Lemont the $4,250 mortgage. <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>This assignment was recorded January 7, 1909. G. Percy Lemont gave no consideration whatever for this assignment, but acted in the matter simply for Waslee, as what is called a “straw man.” G. Percy Lemont brought suit upon the mortgage, and the praecipe for sci. fa. is marked filed October 22,1908. On May 1,1909, G. Percy Lemont reassigned to George W. Waslee the $4,250 mortgage, which assignment was recorded May 7, 1909.</p>

Waslee is stopped from enforcing the mortgage against Lulu Waslee, because in the deed of January 12, 1906, he conveyed the premises to Rossman subject to the $2,500 mortgage, and reciting the deed of Rossman to Waslee of May 8, 1905, subject to the $4,250 mortgage, used thereafter the following words: “Which said mortgage debt is intended to be paid off and satisfied of record,” and the deed from Paul Rossman to Lulu Waslee, recites the consideration of $1.00, subject to the $2,500 mortgage. (The deed from Paul Rossman to Lulu Waslee, of January 12, 1906, is silent as to the $4,250 mortgage). If the present mortgage had been sold for value and the assignee of the mortgage were attempting to enforce the mortgage, the law might be different, but the trial judge is of opinion that the defense is a valid one against George W. Waslee, and as it arises from the deeds themselves, there is no question for a jury to consider; and that the present plaintiff, George W. Waslee, cannot enforce his mortgage against Lulu Waslee, because the words of his deed to Paul Rossman, of January 12, 1906, “which said mortgage debt is intended to be paid off and satisfied of record,” estop him from enforcing the $4,250 mortgage.</p>

Waslee, the plaintiff, had lived for several years with Lulu Waslee, the defendant, whom he called his wife, although they had not been formally married. In May, 1905, the plaintiff purchased a piece of real estate, 1942 N. 11th street, Philadelphia, for $4,250. At his direction the title was conveyed to one Rossman, who, on the same day, May 8, 1905, executed a mortgage to Waslee for the amount of the purchase money, and forthwith deeded to him the property, subject to the mortgage. This deed, although delivered on its date, was <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>not recorded until January 9, 1906. On that day the plaintiff assigned the mortgage to the Continental Title &amp; Trust Company as collateral for a loan of $2,500, and, as additional security, he executed another mortgage upon the same property in the amount of the loan. Three days later Waslee and Lulu Waslee, the latter referred to in the deed as the wife of the former, gave a deed to Rossman, expressly subject to the $2,500 mortgage, and reciting therein the deed of May 8,1905, from Rossman to Waslee, subject to the $4,250 mortgage, adding “which said mortgage debt is intended to be paid off and satisfied of record.” Directly thereupon Rossman conveyed the property to the defendant, subject only to the $2,500 mortgage, describing her as “the wife of George W. Waslee.” About four months after this the plaintiff and the defendant were formally married, and on March 11, 1907, the $2,500 loan was paid off, the mortgage satisfied of record, and the $4,250 mortgage reassigned to Waslee. In August, 1908, a divorce suit was instituted by the plaintiff against the defendant, and, while the proceedings were pending, Waslee assigned the latter mortgage to a straw man, who subsequently reassigned it to him. On October 22, 1908, a sci. fa. issued upon this mortgage. The court below held that it must be treated as satisfied, and directed a verdict for the defendant; the plaintiff has appealed from the judgment thereon.</p>

The plaintiff offered the mortgage and its assignments in evidence, and stated that neither the principal nor any interest thereon had ever been paid. The defendant then offered the other documents, and testified that Waslee had made a gift of the property to her; that he had given her the title papers, and had said “the house is yours outside of the mortgage.” There is some confusion in the testimony as to this statement; the plaintiff contends that the reference was to the $4,250 mort<a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>gage,’ and the defendant that the $2,500 mortgage- was meant. We think the latter is the more probable, but for the purposes of this case it is sufficient to say that it is hot clear. The defendant claimed that she did not know of any intention on the part of her husband to keep the $4,250 mortgage alive after the gift of the house to her. The notary public who acted at the time the property was placed in Mrs. Waslee’s name, stated that the plaintiff had introduced the defendant as his wife, and had remarked, “this property I am conveying is subject to $2,500.” In rebuttal, the plaintiff testified that the house was originally purchased with his money; that Rossman acted in his behalf in taking the title, in executing the mortgage, and in reconveying the premises to him; that he had conveyed the title to his wife at a time when he had placed an express business in her name, and that the conveyance was made for the purpose of giving her a good business credit; that Rossman was a straw man in that transaction; that the $2,500 was borrowed by him for the purpose of purchasing this express business, and after its sale, the proceeds were given to his wife, who deposited the money in a bank account kept in her name; that the $2,500 was subsequently paid off with his money and at his direction, by a check on this bank account; that after this “she told me she had paid the mortgage off and had the other mortgage reassigned back to me — the $4,250 mortgage.” He denied that he had said anything about the property being subject only to $2,500; and stated that he did not know of the recital in the deed to the effect that the $4,250 mortgage was intended to be paid off and satisfied of record, as he “never read it.” Finally, he asserted that it had always been his intention to keep the $4,250 mortgage alive and to hold it for himself. On cross-examination, he admitted that he had sworn in the divorce proceedings “that he had no personal estate;” “that the respondent is in possession of and has title in-her own name to the premises, 1942 N. 11th St.;” and that, “these premises are clear of incumbrance and cost <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>$4,250.” He explained, however, that he did not know that a mortgage was personal estate, and that he only meant that the property was clear of the $2,500 mortgage. The scrivener who drew the deed to Mrs. Waslee was produced by the plaintiff, but no material evidence was elicited from him. The foregoing is a sufficient summary of the testimony material to a proper determination of the legal points involved in this appeal.</p>

Whatever may have been the inducing cause for the conveyance, we must take it, in the present case, that the gift was fully executed; for not only was the institution of this action an implied admission of the defendant’s title, but, in point of fact, Mrs. Waslee is expressly named in the sci. fa. as “the real owner” of the property; and as such she is entitled to all of the benefits of the covenant under consideration.</p>

L. 94, sec. 6, the words “grant, bargain, and sell” in a duly recorded fee simple deed, “shall be adjudged an express covenant to the grantee, his heirs and assigns, to wit: That the grantor was seized of an indefeasible estate in fee simple, free from incumbrance done or suffered from the grantor .... as also for quiet enjoyment against the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, unless limited by express words <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>contained in such deeds.” The covenant is that “the grantor had done no act, nor created any incumbrance, whereby the estate granted by him might be defeated:” Gratz v. Ewalt, 2 Binney, 95; Whitehill v. Gotwalt, 3 Penrose &amp; Watts, 313; Seitzinger v.

In the deed under review there are no “express words” limiting the effect of the words “grant, bargain, and sell,” and the only reference to the mortgage includes the statement that it is to be satisfied. The deed is within the act of 1715, and the mortgage is an “incumbrance suffered from the grantor,” for it was brought into existence by direction of the plaintiff while the property belonged to him. Although Waslee did not physically execute the mortgage, Rossman created it for him; in so doing “he .... (Ross-man) .... was no more than a conduit pipe of the legal title, and bound to give it any direction that .... (Waslee) .... might dictate,” Sergeant v.
