Later, the White Clay Creek Supply Company sold all its property to a new company, the Chester County Electric Company, which company proposed issuing a new mortgage, to take effect as soon as the old mortgage could be gotten out of the way, as soon as the outstanding bonds would be surrendered and the trustee, the defendant here, could properly satisfy that original mortgage. It was important, of course, to that end, that the outstanding bonds of the original company should be turned in to the trustee. And it appears that this plaintiff, being the holder of the twelve bonds in question and some other bonds, about which we need not concern ourselves, he having possession of them at the time, at least, turned them over to the defendant company and received a receipt from the company to the effect that these bonds were held subject to the plaintiff’s order. And the plaintiff testified more specifically as to what the arrangement was, and we understand it is not disputed that he said, at the time that these bonds were turned over, that they were to be held until they should be paid, the under<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>.standing that he intended to convey and that he did convey, if his evidence is true — and we do not understand it to be disputed — being that he did turn in the bonds for the purpose of making it convenient to satisfy the mortgage, but the mortgage was not to be satisfied until the bonds would be paid.</p>
