We are of opinion that this contention cannot be maintained for two reasons: (1) because according to Baxmyer’s account of the matter, and as found by the court, only $10,000 of the money received from the Pittsburg Railways Company was obtained by fraud, the remaining $15,000 of the original payment being, so far as appears, received for legitimate purposes. The fraud of the parties in regard to the $10,000 can furnish no reason why the plaintiff is not entitled to relief in regard <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>to the balance of the money which was obtained for other purposes. The rule that a plaintiff must come into equity with clean hands is confined to misconduct in regard to the matter in litigation; and (2) for the reason that the original bill does not disclose the source of the moneys in dispute, nor does it attempt to collect the same or ask for any account of the same, but asks for an injunction restraining Baxmyer from calling a certain demand note made by a company in which the plaintiff is interested, contrary to his agreement, and the fraud does not appear until Baxmyer sets it up himself as a reason why he should not be interfered with in calling the note. Under these circumstances it would- appear that it is Baxmyer, rather than the plaintiff, who is endeavoring to come into equity contrary to the maxim he invokes.</p>

As to whether a cross bill is proper remedy for the Pitts-burg Railways Company, the question is whether one who discovers that money belonging in equity to himself is in the possession or control of parties who are litigating in equity in regard to that control, may be allowed to intervene in the suit and pursue his equitable rights against both of them, or on the other hand, is bound to bring an original bill against them. We are of opinion that the case is fairly within the rule that a court of equity, when it once obtains jurisdiction of a subject, which in this case is the rightful possession and control of a certain sum of money, not only may, but should, hear and determine all matters concerning it arising between all parties whose <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>claims arise out of the same transaction. The fund in this case is a definite sum of money invested in a note of a certain company. The plaintiff in the cross bill would se.em to us to have a right, if he fears the solvency of the other parties, to ask that the fund and the note representing it should be impounded for his benefit, by an injunction restraining either of the parties from taking the money into their own possession. The plaintiff in the cross bill has not asked for this relief, but that the circumstances are such that it would appear to be entitled to it seems to us to indicate that it is entitled to intervene and maintain its rights in this proceeding, rather than to maintain an original bill. As to the contention that the plaintiff in the cross bill has an adequate remedy at law, we are of opinion that as its claim is founded on a trust ex maleficio it is entitled to relief in equity, whatever may be the present status of the legal remedy in such cases.</p>

The money which the Pitts-burg Railways Company should receive is part of that note, and justice to all the parties would seem to require payment out of it, rather than payment by either of the parties out of his own funds, except upon a loss of the fund itself by the nonpayment of the note.</p>
