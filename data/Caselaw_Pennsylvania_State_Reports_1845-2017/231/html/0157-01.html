Our decree was affirmed and the plaintiff’s cross appeal was dismissed. It appears in that case that the plaintiff asked for a decree not only for the recovery of his stock but for an accounting on the part of the company and for the repayment into the corporate treasury of certain sums of money alleged to have been wrongfully appropriated by certain officers of the company. We heard evidence in said case on all the allegations of the plaintiff’s bill and formulated findings of fact in accordance therewith; but when we had fully considered the merits of the controversy it appeared very clear to us that the only relief plaintiff was then entitled <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>to was a decree reinstating him as a stockholder on certain conditions.

The substance of his complaint is that certain sums of money were unlawfully diverted from the treasury of the company and paid to three individuals under the guise of salaries, and he is seeking the aid of the court to secure the return of the funds so misappropriated into the treasury of the corporation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.6",189,[211,1228,1152,742]]]'>There are two ways in which this can be done. Under certain conditions a stockholder may bring suit on behalf of the corporation without first requesting the managers or directors to bring such proceedings, but this may be done only under exceptional circumstances. A case in point is that of Treat v. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/203/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="203 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="994718" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0021-01">203 Pa. 21</a>. In this case the officers of the insurance company had reinsured all of its risks in another company. The company had no office, solicited no risks and was practically defunct; in other words the business had been abandoned. The officers, it appeared, had appropriated the funds of the company to their own use. It was held, that in such a case it was not necessary for a shareholder to request the manager to apply for a receiver, before filing his bill.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b189-6" data-blocks='[["BL_189.7",189,[210,1980,1148,420]]]'>The facts of the case at bar, as gathered from the bill, are different. The defendant company is a going corporation. It has a president, secretary, treasurer and a board of directors and was carrying on “the business of mining coal” when the bill was filed. It is true that there are new officers, new directors and some new stockholders; but the corporation is an active one and is clothed with the usual corporate powers.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[304,579,1157,1495]]]'>“The first matter for consideration is the status of the plaintiff to maintain such a bill. It is a bill to assert rights of the corporation, and therefore must ordinarily be brought by the corporation, itself. The right of an individual stockholder to act for the corporation is exceptional and only arises on a clear showing of special circumstances, among which inability or unwillingness of the corporation itself, demand upon the regular corporate management, and refusal to act are imperative requisites. And the refusal by the corporate management must appear affirmatively to be a disregard of duty and not an error of judgment, a nonperformance of a manifest official obligation, amounting to a breach of trust: 2 Beach on Private Corporations, sec. 878. There must be averred and proved an actual application to the directors, and a refusal by them to bring suit or to allow plaintiff to do so in the corporate name, and where misconduct of the directors themselves is alleged, the bill must show an effort to secure plaintiff’s rights through meetings of the corporation: 2 Beach on Private Corporations, secs. 882, 885. 'The shareholder should set forth in his bill the efforts that he has made to induce the corporation to act in the matter, should allege its refusal or failure to sue,’ and 'facts showing that he has left undone nothing which in reason he might have done to prevail on the corporate management to bring the action;’ Taylor on Private Corporations, secs. 138, 140.

A copy of the notice is attached to plaintiff’s bill as exhibit “A.” We hold this notice to be insufficient. It is directed to the “Bulls Head <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>Coal Co.; S. S. Spruks, President; C. Comegys, Esq., attorney.

    <p class="summary" id="b191-3" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[197,671,1148,200]]]'>We hold also that the notice ought to state specifically the parties against whom the corporation is to bring suit. Only in an inferential way can this be gathered from the notice in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b191-4" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[193,888,1152,1334]]]'>We are not called upon to decide the question of the right of the plaintiff to bring suit in his own name, rather than in his name for the benefit of the corporation, the Bulls Head Coal Company. If the money alleged to have been misappropriated by the former officers of the company were recovered in legal proceedings, the sum so recovered should go into the treasury of the company, and the plaintiff would thereby reap a profit depending upon the amount of stock held by him and depending also upon the financial condition of the company at the time. The money recovered in such a suit after satisfying creditors would belong to the stockholders of the company and could be distributed among them as dividends. As an illustration wre can use the facts set forth in the bill. During a period of about two years the sum of $49,000 was paid in the form of salaries to three persons who controlled the corporation. Supposing that $4,000 would have been a fair compensation for their services, the balance of $45,000 would be the amount of the misappropriation. Because the plaintiff owns five shares of the stock, or one-forty-fifth of the capital, it does not follow that he would be entitled to that proportion of the money recovered in a suit. His right as a stockholder to a distributive share of the assets of the company would depend on other factors in the equation.</p>
