The court found that its public sale value was $130,000 and reduced the assessment to that amount. He claimed a further reduction on the allegation that the standard of valuation throughout the district was below the market value. The court found that the valuation <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>of $130,000 was uniform with the valuation of other real estate throughout the county. This finding, to which an exception is taken has not only all the weight of a finding of fact by the court, but the rule that such a finding will not be disturbed except for manifest error applies to it with exceptional force because of the nature of the subject of inquiry.</p>
