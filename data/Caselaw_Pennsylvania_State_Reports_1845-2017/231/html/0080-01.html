In the answer it was averred that prior to the making of the agreement, the plaintiff had represented that he had not granted the right to use his patented process to anyone, and that he could give the defendant the exclusive right to use the same, that the contract was entered into because of this assurance; that these representations were untrue, because the plaintiff had previously sold to other persons a patent which differed only slightly from the patent, the use of which he <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>licensed to the defendant and had agreed to give them the exclusive use of any improvements on the patents sold, which he might thereafter make.</p>

He held as matter of law that a licensee, receiving the benefits of a patent, is bound to pay the stipulated royalty.
