The act of 1909 defines two, several and independent offenses: first, the hunting of game by an alien; second, for an alien to either own or be possessed of a shotgun or rifle of any make. The primary subject of the act is the preservation of wild birds, animals and game, and under all our authorities, the privilege of hunting and taking game is limited, under defined restrictions, to our own citizens. Since long-range firearms, — shotguns and rifles, — are generally used in killing wild birds and animals, it is clear that the legislature, in prohibiting a foreign-born, unnaturalized resident from hunting game, intended to make the hunting of game by an alien the more difficult by taking away from such persons the means by which game is usually killed. This prohibition against having deadly and long-range firearms does not in any way deprive the alien of property without due process of law, but simply de<a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>fines and limits his right to use firearms, by restricting such right to the use of short-range firearms, — revolvers, and pistols, and such other weapons, as may be necessary for defense of his person and property. “Whatever one may claim as a right under the Constitution and laws of the United States by virtue of his citizenship, is a privilege of a citizen of the United States. Whatever the Constitution and laws of the United States entitle him to exemption from, he may claim as an exemption in respect to, and such a right or privilege is abridged whenever the state law interferes with any legitimate operation of Federal authority which concerns his interest, whether it be an authority actively exerted, or resting only in the express or implied command or assurance of the Federal Constitution or law. But the United States can neither grant nor secure to its citizens rights or privileges which are not expressly or by reasonable implication placed under its jurisdiction, and all not so placed are left to the exclusive protection of the States:” Cooley’s Principles of Constitutional Law, 246-247.

The rule of construction to be followed in such a case has but recently been considered by our Supreme Court in Deni v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/181/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="181 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="891457" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0525-01">181 Pa. 525</a>, and Maiorano v. B. &amp; O. R. R.

II of the treaty between these countries, “the citizen of each of the high contracting parties have liberty to travel in the States and Territories of the other, to carry on trade, wholesale and retail, to hire and occupy houses and warehouses, to employ agents of their choice and generally to do anything incident to or necessary for trade upon the same terms as natives of the country, submitting themselves to the laws then established.” And art. Ill provides: “The citizens of each of the high contracting parties shall receive, in the States and Territories of the other, the most constant protection and security for their persons and property, and shall enjoy in this respect the same rights and privileges as are or shall be granted to the natives on their submitting themselves to the conditions imposed upon the natives.” As held in the last-cited case, “In construing a treaty the general rule obtains that the court is to be guided by the intention of the parties, and if the words clearly express the meaning and intention no other means of interpretation can be employed.” Is it a reasonable construction to hold that it was intended to clothe unnaturalized foreign-born residents with the same rights, immunities and advantages as are conferred solely as a privilege on citizens? The whole trend of our decisions is against such an interpretation. The terms of the treaty provide for the protection and security of their. <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>persons and property, and in this respect, — to such protection and security, — the enjoyment of the same rights and privileges as are or shall be granted to the natives on their submitting themselves to the conditions imposed on the natives.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b85-3" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[191,633,1148,908]]]'>An unnaturalized foreign-born resident cannot comply with the conditions imposed on a native-born or naturalized resident. Article XIV of the federal constitution defines this condition: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States, and of the States wherein they reside.” It would be a perversion of language to hold that the phrase, — the same rights and privileges as are or shall be granted to the natives, — was intended to or could embrace all the regulations affecting our franchise rights; the administration and execution of our laws; the special rights granted as privileges by our government to particular classes of our citizens. Such a construction would render nugatory the qualification for president of the United States as provided by art. II, sec. 1, par. 5, of our federal constitution and other limitations that are made equally explicit in our fundamental law.</p>
