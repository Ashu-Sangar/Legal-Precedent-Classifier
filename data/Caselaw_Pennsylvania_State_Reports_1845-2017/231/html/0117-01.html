No. 846 stood on the siding running along the ice house. It pulled put five loaded cars, on a curve and on an up grade. The engine labored and there was a heavy exhaust. The smoke was emitted in large volumes, and the wind carried it right over the roof of the ice house. There was no stove or fire in the building and no fire in the neighborhood of the ice house.

In so ruling we were in error. At that trial there was no evidence by any witness making a direct attack upon the style, form or pattern of the spark arrester used in engine 846. There was evidence which showed the bad conduct of this engine for fire throwing. In other words there was negligence shown by the plaintiff company, and the burden was cast upon the defendant company not only to satisfy the jury that the spark arrester was in good repair, and that the engine was operated with due care, but also that the spark arrester in use was of a proper design or pattern.</p>

The railroad company contended there was no negligence or that it was so meager that it did not raise a presumption of negligence. The court then said, “The .evidence was sufficient to send the case to the jury on the question of whether the fire from the engine had been communicated to the house, and the court properly held that it was also sufficient for submission to the jury on the question of the defendant’s negligence.” Again, “When the learned judge ruled the question, the plaintiff had shown, not by a presumption of law arising from the fact that the building had been fired by sparks from the engine, but by affirmative evidence, that through the negligence of the defendant sparks had been emitted which set fire to the plaintiff’s building and caused its destruction.”</p>

There is a marked difference at the very threshold of these cases. In the American Ice Company, “there was no direct evidence to show that the railroad company caused the fire.” “ No locomotive was identified as being near the building when the fire started. Indeed there was no testimony to show how or exactly where the fire started or from what cause it originated.” In our case the conclusion was inevitable that engine 846 caused the fire. It was shown where and how the fire started. The locomotive stood beside the building, and when it moved out, the smoke, and exhaust, the curve, the grade and the puffs, indicated that the en<a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>gine labored. At such time it throws fire, if at any time. The fire almost immediately followed, as the engine moved by the building. No other possible explanation of the fire could be given. <em>‘ ‘ </em>It was not all a guess or conjecture,” as in American Ice Co. v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/224/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="224 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="963042" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0439-01">224 Pa. 439</a>. In that case the jury was asked to find that the fire was caused by the railroad company because of negligent fire throwing before and after the fire. In our case it was shown that the fire was caused by engine 846, and this fact was established clearly, before any evidence was given of negligent fire throwing. The concluding sentence of the opinion in American Ice Co. v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/224/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="224 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="963042" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0439-01">224 Pa. 439</a>, points out the distinction between that case and the one now under consideration: “There can be no recovery in this case, because appellant failed to prove what caused the fire or that the railroad company had anything to do with starting it.”</p>

The air may be full of live sparks at midday and yet the eye cannot detect them. If the defendant’s contention is sound, then there can be no recovery in any case unless sparks are seen to fall on or about the building, immediately before the fire, although there is absolute certainty that a particular engine caused the fire and abundant proof of negligent fire throwing both before and after the fire, by the particular engine in question. If it is necessary to show sparks of unusual size at the building at the time of the fire, then we fail to see any necessity for proof of negligent fire throwing, before and after the fire. The negligence of the company is established by throwing the unusual sized sparks at the time of the fire, without showing the negligent habit of fire throwing.</p>

The plaintiff was not allowed to recover because he could not show any negligent conduct of engine 458, before and after the fire, although he showed negligent fire throwing by some engines, but did not identify any one of them as 458. In Penna. R. R. Co. v. Stranahan, <a href="/pa/79/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="79 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="438415" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0405-01">79 Pa. 405</a>, the evidence was conclusive that the fire was caused by the engines of the railroad company. There was no proof of fire throwing at the time of the fire. The barn was destroyed in the afternoon. The plaintiff recovered, by showing the negligent action of the engines of the company about the time of the fire but at points removed some miles from the place of the fire. In Jennings v. Penna. R.

There was no evidence of negligent fire throwing at the time of the fire. The plaintiff was defeated in his action because the evidence as to the bad conduct of engines before and after the fire did not relate to. the special engine which caused the fire. In Phila. &amp; Reading R. R. Co. v.

There was no evidence of fire throwing at the time of the fire, except the existence of fires along the railroad. The plaintiff recovered by showing the bad fire throwing of the particular engine for a period of two weeks before the fire. In Gowen v. Glaser, 3 Cent. Repr. 109, the plaintiff’s rags were spread out in a field and destroyed by fire from some engine of the railroad company. The only evidence of negligence offered was the proof that the engines of the company repeatedly threw , out sparks of excessive size. A verdict for the plaintiff was sustained.</p>

His careful review of the law and its application to the Henderson case leaves no room for doubt upon the proposition we have endeavored to consider. “Where the injury complained of is shown to have been caused, or, in the nature of the case could only have been caused by sparks from an engine which is known and identified, the evidence should be confined to the condition of that engine, its management and its practical operation.” “Of course, the inquiry in all such cases is as to the existence or condition of the spark arrester at the precise time of the injury; but in order to make this practicable, by proof that it was defective, or threw out sparks of unusual size, a reasonable latitude must be allowed to show its management and operation both before and after.” In the Henderson case a watchman stood by the mill as the engines passed. He did not notice any sparks thrown. The evidence of negligence covered only other times and places when the engines threw sparks or coals of unusual size. The case was reversed and a new trial allowed because the time was not limited by the court during which these other fire throwings occurred. The proof that the Henerdson mill was destroyed by the fire from an engine was not so conclusive as the proof in our case.</p>

The case was tried with great care and ability, by counsel on each side. This being a second trial, each party knew what the other would offer before the jury. There were no surprises of any moment. The defendant company had the advantage in preparing to meet the evidence submitted at the former trial. It had its records of the <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>movements of 846 and was prepared to test the credibility of the evidence given as to fire throwing. Another jury might reach a different conclusion from the same testimony, but this is true in most cases where the charge.is negligence in fire throwing by an engine. There are few cases where the proof of negligence consists of direct or positive evidence of eyewitnesses who saw the spark fall that destroyed the building. The very nature of the case ordinarily admits of nothing more than circumstantial evidence to establish the negligence. As was said in Henderson v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/144/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="144 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="823808" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0461-01">144 Pa. 461</a>, 480 “on account of the great difficulty in proving negligence in such cases, any proper evidence from which negligence may be inferred is sufficient to throw the burden on the defendant.” “It is not required that the fact of negligence be established by direct or positive proof; like any other fact, it may be established by circumstantial evidence.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b154-4" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[316,1300,1153,689]]]'>It is true the evidence of the witnesses who testified to the negligent fire throwing was contradicted by the records produced by the defendant company. The train, however, was known as the pick up and 846 was the engine ordinarily in use. The witnesses, or some of them, identified the engine by its number. Where a witness testifies to fire throwing of an identified engine, he may make a mistake as to the particular night he saw the engine, but unless he is corrupt, it is difficult to believe that he made a mistake as to what he swears he actually saw. The important inquiry is — did he see sparks or live coals within a very short time of the fire, as big as a shellbark, or as big as the end of your thumb?</p>

There was no evidence of any change or repair of the spark arrester, about the time of the fire. Even if a verdict for the defendant would, <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>perhaps, be more in accord with our view of the evidence, we see no good reason for disturbing the trial when we are satisfied that the evidence of the plaintiff, if believed by the jury, fully justified their verdict.

There was an expression in Mr. Fenstermacher’s testimony which may mean that holes of an inch or three-quarters of an inch were not patched in the screen or netting. We left the matter to the jury to determine what meaning should be given to his evidence. We were careful to say that the jury must consider his whole testimony to determine his meaning. We did not affirm this point, except to say that a witness must not be judged by one sentence or one expression in his testimony, the jury are to determine his meaning and this must be done upon a consideration of his whole evidence. We do not see how the defendant was hurt, in any manner, by this instruction. The witness Fenstermacher was called back to make clear his reports and his notes on the reports as to repairs and other matters. The questions were simple and he must have understood them. He testified that he made repairs to the screen but if the holes were as big as six inches then the screen was sent to the boiler shop. It follows that holes under six inches were within his care. The question was then asked “How big would the holes have to be before you would begin to notice them to repair them? A. If they would be only an inch or three-quarters of an inch I would repair them.” This answer was unsatisfactory. It was not clear. Inasmuch as he repaired all holes under six inches, his answer might well mean that holes less than three-quarters of an inch or an inch would be passed without repair. The next question and answer made such a meaning still clearer. “If they get as big as an inch, then you would repair them? A. Yes, sir.” His whole evidence may well <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>show that this meaning was not intended.

    <p class="summary" id="b156-7" data-blocks='[["BL_156.7",156,[285,1816,1156,575]]]'>The building was filled with natural ice. One of thé compartments was empty, because the cars of the defendant company had taken away the ice as a railroad carrier of freight. On the day of the fire the defendant company was attempting to remove more of this ice. That the contents of this building consisted of ice was a fact known to the defendant company. The fire occurred on March 30, 1907. That the winter storage of ice still remained was also pretty evident. The “contents” of an ice house would naturally consist of ice, if it had any' contents at all;</p>

      <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>The defendant cannot say it was unprepared to meet this claim. At a former trial the contents of the ice house were shown as well as the value of the same per ton in the building. We think the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the ice destroyed. The statement filed in the case covered the ice under the claim for “the contents of said ice house.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b157-3" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[214,742,1151,258]]]'>The defendant filed his plea and went to trial without asking for a bill of particulars or a more specific statement. The. test is, did the statement inform the defendant of the nature of the demand so that he was not misled in the preparation of his defense.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[213,1011,1151,367]]]'>The remaining reason for a new trial relates to the question put to the witness, William F. Kiesel. The defendant attempted to give all the circumstances in evidence relating to the fire, and then asked the witness whether the fire could have been caused by a spark from the locomotive stack with a most approved spark arrester and in perfect condition.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.6",157,[208,1389,1153,1017]],["BL_158.1",158,[299,363,1151,103]]]'>In the first place the conditions attending the fire were not fully given. In the second place the answer would not help the jury. Again and again the jury was told that no spark arrester had as yet been discovered which would prevent the throwing of sparks or that would prevent fires. We said “ that the defendant’s locomotive communicated fire to the plaintiff’s premises raises no presumption of negligence.” Therefore, that the fire could have been caused without negligence was not the issue. This was not a matter for an expert opinion. If the witness had given us his experience as to the size and distance sparks may be thrown by an engine properly operated and properly equipped with an efficient spark arrester, the jury would have had all the information the witness was entitled to give upon that branch of his evidence. This we allowed him to do, but when counsel learned that the witness had no practical experience upon the subject whatever, he did not even press the questions which we allowed. Without some experience upon the subject, the <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>opinion of the witness would be no more than a guess. To give us what he read in the books would be mere hearsay.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[297,471,1154,639]]]'>To allow the witness to give an opinion upon the evidence in the case, even if fully stated to him, would mislead the jury. They would consider it as an opinion that the fire, under the circumstances, was caused without any negligence. This was, in effect, the purpose of the question. That fires, along the railroad, occur constantly without negligence, can not be disputed. Ño opinion evidence is needed to establish this proposition. Where there, is an approved spark arrester in use the company “cannot be made liable though it fire every rod of the country through which it runs:” Phila. &amp; Reading R. R. Co. v. Schultz, <a href="/pa/93/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="93 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="442207" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0341-01">93 Pa. 341</a>.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.6",158,[294,1280,1154,1014]]]'>It is always dangerous to cast into the jury box the opinion of witnesses when they can give facts that will enlighten the jurors so they may form their own opinion. Courts, more and more, reject opinion evidence: Reese v. Clark, <a href="/pa/198/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="198 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="920347" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0312-01">198 Pa. 312</a>. Especially is this so where the opinion of the witness is not founded upon experience, but is based upon theory alone: Lineoski v. Susquehanna Coal Co., <a href="/pa/157/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="157 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="846571" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0153-01">157 Pa. 153</a>,172. Counsel for defendant realized this difficulty and when the witness said he could only answer from his study and not from any practical knowledge or experience the questions that we allowed were not pressed. No exception was taken to our ruling at the time. Some time later, on the next day, counsel asked for an exception. We said we would grant it. We made no examination of the record at the time, but in giving the exception, we certainly did not mean to grant an exception to a ruling that was never made. We refused the original question except as modified in our ruling, and to that ruling we now note an exception for the defendant.</p>

What our ruling would have been, at the time, had it been necessary to make it, we are unable to say at this time. We always grant exceptions regardless of technicalities, but in fairness to all parties we cannot allow an exception where no ruling was made.</p>
