The underlying principle in these decisions is that an employer cannot be held responsible for the negligence of a person over whom he has no control and to whom, in all matters of judgment and direction in the management of his property, he is subordinated.</p>
    <p id="b200-4" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[326,858,1157,905]]]'>The employers’ liability act of June 10, 1907, P. L. 523, does not effect a change in the law as before announced. If the words “foreman or any other person in charge or control of the works” for whose negligence the employer is made liable and who in any action for death or injury is made the agent of the employer, apply to a representative of the state, certified by it to be competent, employed by its direction and placed in charge of the works, to carry out its instructions, the act would be unconstitutional. In view of the decisions upon the subject before the passage of the act, it should be assumed that it was not the legislative intent to include a class for whose negligence this court had held an employer cannot be made liable. The act should therefore be so construed as to limit its application to persons over whom an employer has control and who in fact represent him. This is as far as legislation can go.</p>
    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[373,1772,526,45]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
