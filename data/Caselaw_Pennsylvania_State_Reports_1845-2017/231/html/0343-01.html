In appropriate cases they should also be informed concerning the proper bearing of certain references to particular offenses other than the one on trial, that inquiries as to these are for the purpose of ascertaining the opportunities, sources and extent of the knowledge of the respective witnesses on the point of the general reputation of the defendant and not to show that the defendant was probably guilty of these other offenses. Such instructions are peculiarly required in a murder case where defendant’s character witnesses, after testifying to his good reputation as a peaceful, quiet man, are asked on cross-examination concerning defendant’s alleged kidnaping of a girl two years prior to the homicide.</p>

Upon a trial for murder the judge should give a general review of the evidence on the one side and the other, which fairly and adequately presents the respective contentions of the parties, with enough references to the items of evidence to assist the jury in recalling it as a substantial whole, and to appreciate its bearing. But the manner in wMch the evidence shall be dealt with must of necessity depend upon the circumstances in each case, and to a degree upon the line of arguments pursued by counsel in addressing the jury. It is only, in exceptional instances, where, for example, it plainly appears that the charge is misleading, or that it has a tendency to withdraw the attention of the jury from material evidence, or to magnify the importance of the proofs on one side and belittle those on the other, that a trial judge will be reversed for inadequacy of charge in reviewing the evidence.</p>

The offer was refused on the ground that as a whole it tended to introduce “a collateral issue entirely extrinsic to the issue on trial.” While the ordinary rule is that where an offer blends irrelevant and inadmissible matters with a matter relevant and admissible, its rejection as a whole is not error, yet in Com. v. Bezek, <a href="/pa/168/0603-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="168 Pa. 603" data-case-ids="868499" data-case-paths="/pa/168/0603-01">168 Pa. 603</a>, referring to this rule, we said: “But in deciding the question raised by the specification we shall not take into consideration the rule supported by the cases cited. These are civil cases and if the rule stated in them is applicable to, it ought not to be summoned to sustain a ruling prejudicial to the interests of a defendant on trial for murder.” So much of the offer as was relevant should , have been admitted. The fact that some inseparable, incidental, collateral facts, irrelevant in. themselves and prejudicial to the prosecution, might thus be caused to appear, would not make the competent part any the less admissible: Willis v.

To make out that defense he must prove it to your satisfaction. His claim rests on the assertion that Rbcco was on the platform and at the kitchen door, where it is claimed he had fired several shots with a revolver under circumstances that put the defendant in fear of his own life or of great bodily harm. If the evidence so satisfies you, then he is entitled to be acquitted and your verdict will be not guilty, otherwise, you will find him guilty of murder and fix the degree according to instructions to be given you presently. I can see no basis for a claim of self-defense other than that which is put forward by the defendant, and that makes it necessary that he satisfy you that his version of the shooting is correct.” Previous to this the court had said to the jury that self-defense was “the one issue” arising from the evidence, and that the possibility of “manslaughter” was not in the case.</p>

In a murder case the jury are not bound to accept the version of the commonwealth or that of the defense; it is their duty to consider all the testimony and to make up their minds therefrom as to the facts. It was possible in this case that the jury might have found that there was a certain amount of' truth in the evidence produced by the commonwealth and some truth in that produced by the defense, but that neither side was wholly to be believed. On this theory, the jury might have believed the story of the threats to take defendant’s life, and that he was put in great fear by such threats; that when he saw Rocco coming toward him it raised a passion of terror in his mind, and he shot under the control of that passion. Yet, at the same time, they might not have believed that Rocco had crossed the fence and advanced as far as the defendant’s kitchen door, or that he had actually fired pistol shots into the room. Under such a state of facts the prisoner would have been guilty of manslaughter and not of murder.</p>

Heath, 20 Dist. Col. 272, on appeal, the court approved the following instruction: “So that you have two theories that would reduce the crime to manslaughter: One is the blow was struck in the heat of passion . . . . ; the other is, if it was struck under an apprehension of danger, but the apprehension of danger was not reasonable. . . .” This doctrine is also recognized in Howard v.

It was, therefore, error to refuse an instruction as to manslaughter and to instruct the jury that the defendant, having admitted the shooting, was guilty of murder unless he did it in self-defense.

Although in the present case it might have been improbable that the jury would accept the theory of manslaughter, yet where under the evidence such a contingency is possible, it is error to eliminate that grade of homicide from the charge: Com. v. Curcio, <a href="/pa/216/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="216 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="950462" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0380-01">216 Pa. 380</a>. While the evidence might not have been sufficient to satisfy the jury that the plea of self-defense had been sustained, it might have appealed to them as sufficient to negative or to throw such a doubt upon the element of malice as to reduce the crime to manslaughter. Therefore, in addition to the instruction on the law of self-defense, the jury should have been told, if they found that at the time of the shooting the defendant was not actuated by malice, but that he acted under the influence of an uncontrollable mortal fear raised by the threats and conduct of Rocco, and if they thought that the immediate circumstances, though adequate to raise the fear, were not sufficient reasonably to justify a belief on the part of the defendant that he was in immediate' danger of death or great bodily harm, the grade of the crime would not rise higher than manslaughter. The dividing line between self-defense and this character of manslaughter seems to be the existence, as the moving force, of a reasonably founded belief of imminent peril to life or great bodily harm, as distinguished from the influence of an uncontrollable fear or terror, conceivable as existing, but not reasonably justified by the immediate circumstances. If the circumstances are both adequate to raise and sufficient to justify a belief in the necessity to take life in order to save oneself from such a danger’, where the belief exists and is acted upon, the homicide is excusable upon the theory of self-defense: Com. v. McGowan, <a href="/pa/189/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="189 Pa. 641" data-case-ids="903529" data-case-paths="/pa/189/0641-01">189 Pa. 641</a>; while, if the act is committed under the influence of an uncontrollable fear of death or great bodily harm, caused by the circumstances, but without the presence of all the ingredients necessary to excuse the act on the ground of self-defense, <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>the killing is manslaughter: Com. v.

Particularly is this so, when the record discloses more than one offer of evidence for the purpose of showing that the alleged threats and conduct of the deceased had put the defendant “in fear,” and had “scared” the defendant, and when the testimony of the defendant is that he shot because “I was afraid that he would kill me.”</p>

It must be properly proven. The evidence upon which the defendant relies for proof of previous good reputation must satisfy you as a matter of fact that he had such a good reputation.” This, either standing alone or with its context, was putting the matter covered rather too strongly against the defense, for in the criminal law the word “satisfy,” when used without qualification, may be taken to mean, to convince beyond a <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>reasonable doubt: Anderson’s Law Dictionary; 1 Greenleaf on Ev. (13th ed.), p. 4. In the first place, the jury should have been told that the defendant was entitled to begin with the presumption that he had a good reputation: 22 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), p. 1284; Underhill on Crim. Ev., p. 95; Fletcher v. State, <a href="/ind/49/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="49 Ind. 124" data-case-ids="1411850" data-case-paths="/ind/49/0124-01">49 Ind. 124</a>, and that in considering the testimony produced to reinforce this presumption all reasonable doubts were to be resolved in his favor. They should also have been informed concerning the proper bearing of certain references to particular offenses other than the one on trial, that the inquiries as to these were for the purpose of ascertaining the opportunities, sources and extent of the knowledge of the respective witnesses on the point of the general reputation of the defendant, and not to show that the defendant was probably guilty of these other offenses. Such instructions were peculiarly required in view of the cross-examination of the defendant’s character witnesses who, after testifying to his good reputation as a peaceful quiet man, were asked, “Did you know about him kidnaping a girl from Powderly?” — “Do you remember a couple of years ago hearing of an Italian girl being kidnaped at Powderly?” — “Never saw anything in the newspapers about it?” — “Don’t you remember reading that?” Had these questions been objected to it would have been the duty of the court to have excluded them. “Evidence of a good moral character offered by the defendant in a criminal prosecution must be limited to the particular trait of character involved in the commission of the crime charged. So in like manner the cross-examination of his witnesses .... must be limited to the same trait:” 3 Ency. of Evidence, 21; 12 Cyc. 413; Cathcart v.

Furthermore, a witness “cannot be asked questions to elicit his knowledge of particular acts as distinguished from what he has heard:” 12 Cyc. 416; the inquiry must be limited to the general speech of the community on the subject: Kimmel v. Kimmel, 3 S. &amp; R. 336; Wike v. Lightner, 11 S. &amp; R. <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>198; Snyder v.

The issue here involved was as to defendant’s reputation as a man who would or would not be likely to commit a deadly assault upon another; whether or not a witness had knowledge that the defendant had been accused in a newspaper of kidnaping a girl some two years before was wholly irrelevant. The practical effect of such cross-examination may well have been to brand the defendant as a bad man and to cause the jurors to approach a consideration of his defense from that standpoint, or at least to raise doubts in their minds in passing upon his character evidence. Hence the evil in the instructions given, and the necessity for those indicated. (An interesting review of the cases upon this subject will be found in 2 Trickett’s Penna. Crim.
