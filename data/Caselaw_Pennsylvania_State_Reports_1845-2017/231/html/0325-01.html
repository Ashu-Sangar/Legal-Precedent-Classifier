One familiar with the operations of the Boss, and his suckers, guessed all the names before they were made public. It is not to be believed that all the fellows got money. In some cases, it is believed, the money went to somebody else and the other fellow’s name appears. In brief, there is nothing new or surprising so far as local conditions are concerned. Things have been equally as bad within our borough ever since the Boss was made postmaster as a fitting reward for defeating his brother who was the regular Republican nominee for Sheriff. When treason is rewarded instead of punished, conditions soon become too bad for comparison.”</p>

Weaver, plaintiff, does not appear in the list of disseminators referred to in the publication complained of, nor does the article complained of state that it does.</p>

And it claimed further by way of innuendo that the article complained of <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>means that the plaintiff had agreed to receive from some one unknown the office of postmaster as a reward for his vote and influence against his brother George W. Weaver, when a candidate for sheriff of Lycoming county. It does not seem to us that either of these inferences can legitimately be drawn from the publication complained of.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[202,672,1150,637]]]'>It would be placing an undue restraint upon the public press to prohibit publication of the statements filed by candidates for office showing their expenditures as required by law, as one of the manifest purposes of the act requiring it, is publication, and there is nothing in the article complained of that goes further than to reflect upon the condition of morals that does not forbid the voter from accepting money in connection with politics even though received for purposes expressly authorized by law. The inference cannot be legitimately drawn from the article that the plaintiff received money to influence his vote or the vote of anyone else.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b357-6" data-blocks='[["BL_357.5",357,[202,1320,1147,421]]]'>The innuendo relating to his receiving the appointment of postmaster as a reward for opposing his brother for sheriff is, if anything, still further remote and unwarranted. It is not and never has been considered a reflection upon a voter to receive an appointment to office as a reward for political activity, even though such activity might result in the defeat of a brother. No law forbids or prohibits it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b357-7" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[200,1750,1145,582]]]'>It might be some evidence of an unnatural estrangement, but such is not a crime nor does it involve moral turpitude. The article does not say nor can any such inference be drawn therefrom that the plaintiff opposed his brother and voted against him by reason of a promise that he should receive as a compensation therefor the appointment of postmaster. This would be charging him with an offense which is made a misdemeanor. No such charge is made by the defendant, and there is therefore nothing in the publication that can be construed so as to warrant or support the innuendo declared upon.</p>
