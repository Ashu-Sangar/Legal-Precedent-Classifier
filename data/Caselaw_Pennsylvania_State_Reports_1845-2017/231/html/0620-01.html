Boyle, <a href="/pa/152/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="152 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="838106" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0108-01">152 Pa. 108</a>; Bellas’s Est., <a href="/pa/176/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="176 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="882234" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0122-01">176 Pa. 122</a>. What if anything is the effect upon it of the succeeding paragraph above quoted? That question seems to be ruled by Potts v. Kline, <a href="/pa/174/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="174 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="878581" data-case-paths="/pa/174/0513-01">174 Pa. 513</a>. Doubtless, the word “children” is ordinarily a word of purchase; so that the direction that at the death of the first takers the estate is to go to their “children” may be regarded as evincing an intent that the first takers are to have a life estate only: Oyster v. Oyster, <a href="/pa/100/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="100 Pa. 538" data-case-ids="498384" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0538-01">100 Pa. 538</a>. But it may be construed as a word of limitation if the language of the will so requires. Any form of words sufficient to show that the remainder is to go by way of descent to those whom the law points out as the general or lineal heirs of the first takers will enlarge their estate for life to an estate tail by implication, a fee simple under our statute: Pifer v. Locke, <a href="/pa/205/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="205 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="930056" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0616-01">205 Pa. 616</a>. It is to be observed that here there is no gift over should there be no children. Manifestly the gift to them was intended to include the whole line of succession. Moreover, the estate is to “descend” to them. Under Haldeman v. Haldeman, <a href="/pa/40/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="40 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="478140" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0029-01">40 Pa. 29</a>, and other cases, this phrase indicates the character in which they are to take, viz., by inheritance from their parents, and not as a new stock, and thus points to the first takers as vested with an estate of inheritance and to the construction of the word “children” as a word of limitation. It is argued that this effect of the term “descend” is destroyed by the addition “or (i. e., that is to say) go into possession.” But to “descend and go” is the language passed upon in Haldeman v. Haldeman, <a href="/pa/40/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="40 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="478140" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0029-01">40 Pa. 29</a>, and there would appear to be no room for a decisive distinction <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>between the two forms of expression. It cannot be considered that the phrase “descend or go into possession” means anything else than “descend and go to.” Both signify that the estate is to become the property of the persons designated.</p>
