The statement of claim, filed by the plaintiffs, contained all of the items of personal property for which the arbitrators allowed plaintiffs. It does not seem to be material when the articles were bought. The plaintiffs’ claim in their statement was for the articles enumerated in the statement belonging to the plaintiffs, and upon the premises and appropriated by the defendant. It is true that articles of personal property for which plaintiffs were allowed were purchased before the agreement of June 1, 1896, but the plaintiffs’ claim was for all articles enumerated in the, statement which belonged to the plaintiffs and were appropriated by the defendant. The contract relating to such articles provided that the defendant should reimburse the plaintiffs <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>for moneys advanced therefor, but the plaintiffs, although claiming that they had advanced a sum of money greatly exceeding $23,000, waived their right to recover the amount of such moneys and sought only to recover the fair and reasonable value of said articles, which they claimed to be of the value of $22,299.23; but the arbitrators allowed them a very much smaller sum. They were allowed the sum for such articles because they were on the premises and taken possession of by the defendant June 1, 1900. We have no doubt that the items of personal property, allowed for by the arbitrators, were all in plaintiffs’ statement of claim, and properly embraced in this action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b57-3" data-blocks='[["BL_57.4",57,[222,1077,1151,1327]],["BL_58.2",58,[266,370,1171,316]]]'>The defendant claimed, secondly, that the arbitrators allowed plaintiffs for permanent improvements, claimed to have been made under the contract of June 1, 1896, in disregard of the testimony to the effect that they were made prior to the contract, thus going beyond the submission. Under this claim the principal items complained of were: Entry or roof ripping, $371.50, and four pit mouths, $1,549.96. All of the four pit mouths are enumerated in the statement of claim. As to pit mouths Nos. 1 and 2, it seems that originally they were opened prior to the contract of June 1, 1896, but there was a question, under the testimony, whether the claim of the plaintiffs was for work done on the original openings, or for the improvement thereof after the contract of 1896. Under the disputed testimony, the arbitrators answered the question in favor of the plaintiffs, to which finding we can discover no error or objection. It was not contended that pit mouths Nos. 3 and 4 were opened prior to the contract of 1896. As to the entry or roof ripping, plaintiffs’ claim was for 600 yards, all of which plaintiffs claimed was done after the contract of 1896 at ninety-five cents per yard, amounting to $570. The arbitrators allowed the lump sum of $371.50 for the ripping, which, under the disputed testimony, the plaintiffs were entitled to be paid for. We do not think the award of the arbitrators should be dis<a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>turbed for the allowance for permanent improvements. It must be remembered that this submission or reference , is without exception or appeal, and the award of the arbitrators can only be successfully attacked on the ground of fraud. If the arbitrators merely made mistakes, and nothing else is alleged here, the injury is remediless.</p>
