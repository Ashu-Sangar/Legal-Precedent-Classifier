Where a testator creates a trust for the benefit of his widow in such a way that the ultimate distributees of the fund cannot be determined until after her death, the widow and only surviving child are not entitled to a decree terminating the trust at a time when some of the parties who may ultimately participate in the fund may not yet be in existence.</p>

By his will he created a trust of the residue of his estate for his widow for life, and upon her death directed the trustee to divide the corpus into four equal parts, and to pay one part thereof to each of his four children, “if living, or to the issue of such of my children as may then be deceased.” After the testator’s death three of the children died intestate without issue. Subsequently the widow and the other child, a son having two children living, presented a petition to the orphans’ court for a decree terminating the trust. <em>Held, </em>that the orphans’ court committed no error in dismissing the petition.</p>
