In falling he carried the glass bulb with him. He immediately sprang up saying, “ What is that? ” put the bulb to the socket and received a shock which killed him. The evidence showed that at another house 200 feet distant, and on the same incandescent circuit, the occupant on the same evening received a severe shock from an incandescent light. It also appeared that at the latter place on the night in question some arc wire was stripped of insulation and had come in contact with the incandescent wire. There was no evidence, however, that the contact with the naked arc wire would produce any dangerous effect at the house of the deceased. The evidence also showed that the deceased had been a customer of the defendant company, but that the defendant company prior to the accident had leased and transferred its property and contracts, including the contract of deceased, to another electric light, heat and power company. <em>Held, </em>that it was not error to give binding instructions for the defendant.</p>

      <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>At the trial it appeared that the deceased, Henry Crowe, became a customer of the defendant company on November 1, 1896, under a contract which was to continue for one year, and unless notice was given to the contrary, from year to year thereafter. On June 28, 1898, the defendant company leased and transferred its property and contracts to the People’s Electric Heat &amp; Power Company of Nanticoke. On the evening of August 19,1898, the deceased, while in his barroom, reached up to turn on an incandescent electric light which was suspended from the ceiling. He immediately received a severe shock which knocked him down. In falling ho carried with him the glass bulb. He immediately sprang up, saying, “ What is that ? ” and attempted to insert the bulb in the socket, when he received a second shock which killed him. There was evidence that at the house of one Alexander which was on the same circuit, about 200 feet away from the house of the deceased, a person had received a shock at about the same time. There was also evidence that at Alexander’s house some arc wire was stripped of insulation and had come in contact with the incandescent wire. There was no evidence, however, that a contact of a naked arc wire with an incandescent wire would produce dangerous results at the house of the deceased.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b405-3" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[252,1518,765,43]]]'>Plaintiff presented the following points:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b405-4" data-blocks='[["BL_405.5",405,[207,1570,1183,302]]]'>1. There is no statutory provision enabling an electric light company to lease to an electric light, heat and power company. <em>Answer: </em>That may be so; but both these companies were heat, light and power companies, and I believe, under the law in companies of this character, there exists a power to lease. [8]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_405.6",405,[205,1880,1184,513]]]'>2. If there is such statutory authority, it is for the jury to say, under all the evidence, whether the Electric Light, Heat and Power Company were actually in possession of and operating the plant under the lease from the Nanticoke Light Company. <em>Answer: </em>That would be so if there were any evidence to warrant the submission of the matter to you. But there is no evidence of possession in the Nanticoke Light Company after June 29, 1898, and this accident did not happen until August 19, nearly two months after the People’s Company had gone into possession and were running this plant.

The plaintiff having shown continuous disturbances for <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>a considerable time prior to and the same evening of the accident and that the insulation on this circuit was frayed and hung in strips from the wires in places, and further that Cooper, the company’s electrician, was at Crowe’s place immediately after the accident repairing the circuit, and that E. N. Alexander, whose store lights were on the same circuit, was severely injured by receiving a shock at between eight and nine o’clock of the same evening, and that Cooper aforesaid was present at Alexander’s within a few minutes after Alexander was hurt, and that other persons on same circuit received shocks the same night, raises a question which is for the jury to determine, as to whether or not the company had notice of the condition existing and the defective working of the system. <em>Answer : </em>That point I decline to affirm, for the reason stated in my general charge, because even if the company did have notice that wires were out of order up at Alexander’s, and even if the company was negligent in having the wires out of order up at Alexander’s, and even it had not been true that the wrong company had been sued in the lawsuit instead of the right company, then I say it would not make any difference what happened up at Alexander’s unless the plaintiff had gone on and showed that what happened up at Alexander’s was the cause of Harry Crowe’s death. It would not be material, in other words, what happened up at Alexander’s unless there was proof that whatever did happen there was what caused Harry Crowe’s death. [10]</p>

An electric light company furnishing electricity to a contract user for pay, is prima facie liable for injuries to the user if received by him while using the lights in the usual and ordinary manner. <em>Answer: </em>I decline to affirm that point if by prima facie is meant that by reason of the happening of the accident a presumption of negligence arises. That may be the law in some states, but I do not believe it to be the law in Pennsylvania. I do not think that the relation which exists between the company which furnishes a man an electric light on a contract and the consumer of that light is of such a character as warrants the assertion that the law as between them would be that if he gets hurt in using that electric light the presumption immediately arises that they have been guilty of negligence. I believe that the law remains with <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>them as with reference to other parties as a rule, and that where it is alleged that he is hurt by reason of the negligence of the company, it is his duty to prove that he was so hurt.
