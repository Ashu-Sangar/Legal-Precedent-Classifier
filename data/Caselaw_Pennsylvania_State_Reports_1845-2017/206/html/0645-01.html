By far the greater part of this coal is transported from the mines for immediate delivery at points in other states, and is not kept or held in stock in said other states longer than is necessary for the purpose of transferring possession from this company to the purchasers ; but at certain points in other states, as, for instance, at Buffalo, N.

The coal thus on hand awaiting sale between the first and fifteenth days of November, 1899, the date when the company’s capital stock is required by law to be appraised for taxation, was of the value of not less than $1,702,448, and was included in the valuation of the company’s capital stock upon which tax was charged in the auditor general’s account. The coal thus on hand at that date was approximately the amount usually kept in stock at such points. The said coal when shipped from Pennsylvania was destined to said points in other states, with no intention of ever returning the same to Pennsylvania. On the contrary, said coal was intended to, and did, become part of the general mass of property in said other states, and the company is there annually taxed upon or in respect to the same, and was so taxed for 1899. When the coal thus kept in stock in the states of New York, Illinois, and other states outside of Pennsylvania is sold, the proceeds are returned to the company’s treasury in the city and state of New York.</p>

To enable it to sell this commodity in other states, some of its tangible property must be permanently in them, and so much as is so located and permanently serves the corporate purpose of the company, which is the sale of its coal, is not taxable here. But the coal itself is not such exempted property. As soon as it is mined here it enters into the value of the company’s capital stock, upon the actual value of which the commonwealth is entitled to her tax. When shipped out of the state it is for the purpose of sale, and not for permanent storage. As fast as it is received at the wharves and in the yards, the company aims to turn it into money, which will pass at once into its treasury. “ It is not a thing,” as the learned judge below very properly said, “ used in the prosecution of the business of the company.” The business is prosecuted that the coal may be sold, and the exemption from taxation does not extend to the commodity itself, but is confined to such of the corporate property as must be used outside of the state to enable the company to conduct its business. This is the limit of exemption from taxation here, and the appellant’s coal shipped to other states for sale was properly taxed by the commonwealth’s officers.</p>
