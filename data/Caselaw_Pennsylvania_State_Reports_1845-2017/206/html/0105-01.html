    <p class="summary" id="b135-10" data-blocks='[["BL_135.17",135,[215,1413,1178,511]]]'>From the record it appeared that on September 31, 1888, Hastings Gehr was appointed by the orphans’ court guardian of the minor children of Elijah W. Wallace. On June 25,1889, the court appointed Gehr trustee of the estate of William Wallace. Elijah W. Wallace was a son of William Wallace. Gehr continued to act as guardian and trustee until all of his wards became of age. After the last of the minors had become of age, all of the parties in interest in the estate of William Wallace secured a rule on Gehr to show cause why he should not be discharged as trustee.</p>

Wallace’s minor children, his appointment as trustee would not have been allowed, except upon his declining or resigning the other trust. The reasons that would then have operated against his appointment as trustee, however, do not now require his discharge. The children of Elijah W. Wallace are no longer minors. Mr. <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>Gehr is not in charge of conflicting interests, he is simply trustee of an estate in which no one is interested who is not sui juris.</p>
