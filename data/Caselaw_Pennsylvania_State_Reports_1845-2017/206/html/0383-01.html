The drawer wrote to the plaintiff suggesting that he should take notes from the drawee instead of relying upon the acceptance of the order. The plaintiff took the notes, which were never paid. There was evidence that the drawees were in failing circumstances during the whole course of the transaction, but the evidence was not definite as to whether the plaintiff knew this. There was also evidence that the drawer was insane at the time he wrote the letter to the plaintiff, but there was no evidence that plaintiff knew this. The court charged that plaintiff was bound to present the order “in what a prudent business man of reasonable intelligence would say was a reasonable time,” and left the question of reasonable time to the jury. <em>Held, </em>that the instruction was proper.</p>

    <p id="b415-10" data-blocks='[["BL_415.12",415,[187,1351,1183,1034]]]'>The turning point in the case was whether McCullough’s delay in presenting the order for payment, and his acceptance of notes instead of the money when he did present it, amounted to such negligence as should discharge the drawer of the order. This, however, was not a simple question of law as the appellant presents it. The order was not accepted by Mercur &amp; Company for immediate payment, but as Mercur testified not to be paid “ until after the completion of the contract.” That involved the question of indefinite time. In regard to taking notes instead of insisting on money, the defendant Viney himself suggested that course in the letter of July 29. The ease is still further complicated at this point by the claim that Yiney was insane when he wrote that letter. The result of all the evidence was practically to eliminate the application of any general rules of law, and reduce the whole controversy to one of fact which was correctly submitted in the instruction, that McCullough was bound to present the order “ in what a prudent business man, of reasonable intelligence, would say was a reasonable time,” and the direction to the jury to determine the question of his negligence by that standard.</p>
