They are, that the borough of Bradford and the city of Bradford, its corporate successor, had permitted the defendants and <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>their predecessors in ownership for more than twenty-one years to occupy the streets and highways of the said borough and city with poles and wires; that, without protest or objection, the borough and city stood silently by while the defendants were, during this period, making, in good faitlr, an expenditure of from $75,000 to $100,000; that, by numerous resolutions passed by both branches of council, and many of them duly approved by the mayor, consent had been given to the erection and use of the poles,' cross arms, etc., on the streets and highways of the city; that, for the privileges extended by it to the defendants, it had received a valuable consideration in the use of the poles for the carrying of the wires of its fire alarm service; that it had received and duly receipted for license and pole taxes assessed against the defendants; that it had used the telephone instruments furnished by the defendants down to the date of the hearing in the court below ; that it had, by general ordinances, regularly passed, approved and published, regulated the manner in which the poles should be erected and placed ; that a consideration to the city in extending privileges to the defendants was a reservation of “ the topmost gain ” for police and fire alarm wires, and that the city had permitted all the poles of the defendants to be erected under the direction of either the street committee of council, the street coinmissioner or the city engineer.

Attorney General v. Bala and Bryn Mawr Turnpike Co., <a href="/pa/153/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="153 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="840321" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0047-01">153 Pa. 47</a>. In Penna.

Such railways cannot now be torn np or enjoined either by the township officers or at the instance of landowners along their routes. Where such enterprises have been allowed to proceed and the expenditure of large sums of money has been permitted, it would be inequitable to correct at this time what was a mutual mistake under the influence of which these enterprises have been pushed to completion.” What was said in Attorney General v. Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad Co., <a href="/nj-eq/27/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="27 N.J. Eq. 1" data-case-ids="536598" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/27/0001-01">27 N. J. Eq. 1</a>, in denying an injunction asked for by the state, may well be regarded as applicable to the facts in the present case: “ The work has been, from its commencement, a matter of public notoriety, and yet no action has been taken on the part of the state authorities, nor even any warning uttered by them against the work. The defendants have been permitted to make their immense expenditure upon their enterprise, in the confidence of their convictions that they possessed all requisite legislative authority, without even a word of protest or remonstrance. Under such circumstances, equity will refuse its aid, even to the state.” A stronger case of delay or acquiescence is necessary to prevent equitable relief when sought for by the state than when a mere private right is involved; but the doctrine is applied against the public in a proceeding by the attorney general: High on Injunctions (3d ed.), sec. 837. In the present case, the acquiescence and the laches of the appellant are clearly in the way of any equitable relief to it. We pass upon no other question.</p>
