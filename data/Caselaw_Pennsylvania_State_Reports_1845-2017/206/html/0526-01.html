The authorities cited by appellants are all upon the question of the liability of a trustee to account. There is no doubt as to the propositions of law there stated, but the court below has found as a fact that the relation between Hughes and Watkins was that of employer and employee, not that of trustee and cestui que trust.</p>

There was no trust existing between Hughes and Watkins, if the court’s findings of fact are to be sustained and the authorities cited in behalf of the plaintiffs have therefore no application. The testimony of the defendant, Hughes, although it strengthened his case, was not necessary to justify a finding in his favor.
