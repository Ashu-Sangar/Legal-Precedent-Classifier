On May 22,1894, Lloyd S. Wintersteen began an action against Mary L. Knorr, executrix of Samuel Knorr, deceased, and secured a judgment for $20,167.68, which by renewals amounted on October 1, 1900 to $26,372.78. The land was sold in foreclosure proceedings on a mortgage executed by the decedent in his lifetime. J. B. Robinson, Esq., was appointed auditor to distribute the proceeds of the sale. The auditor decided that the Wintersteen judgment was not a lien, and was not entitled to participate in the fund.</p>
