Words of a statute, unless in some way controlled by the context, are to be considered in the ordinary and popular acceptation of the terms used. Statutes or ordinances thereunder in derogation of the common-law right of the citizen and depriving him of his common-law right to use and enjoy his property are to be considered most strictly against the public and in favor of the citizen.

    <p class="summary" id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[192,946,1181,917]]]'>Now let us look at the meaning of the words “ construct ” and “ reconstruct.” Webster says — construct: to put together, in their proper place and order, the constituent parts of, to build, to form, as to construct an edifice, “ to build.” Reconstruct : to construct again, to rebuild, to form again or anew. The Century Dictionary — to construct again, to rebuild. In De Wald et al. v. Woog, <a href="/pa/158/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="158 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="848166" data-case-paths="/pa/158/0497-01">158 Pa. 497</a>, the word “reconstruct” seems to have been judicially considered. In that case the old structure was an old-fashioned two-story house, and it seems to us the changes made were much more important and extensive than those contemplated by the plaintiff in this case, yet it is held that it was not a reconstruction or a new building or a rebuilding. In this case, Landis’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/10/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="962768" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0379-01">10 Pa. 379</a>, is cited. In this ease, Counter, Judge, says on page 380, “In the common understanding and language of the people, when we speak of the erection or construction of a house or building, we mean the erection of a new house or building, not the rebuilding of an old one.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[267,525,1200,1894]]]'>In our opinion the proper legal construction of the words “construct” and “reconstruct” found in-the act of May 23, 1889, as amended by the act of May 16, 1901, section 14, page 224, and embodied in the ordinance of the city of Bradford, No. 907, is to prohibit the construction or building of a wooden structure within the limits fixed by the ordinance. That the word “reconstructed” simply has the legal effect of preventing any evasion of the prohibition created by the words “ no building shall hereafter be constructed,” that is to say, the ordinance cannot be evaded by claiming the right to reconstruct or rebuild a wooden building which had been demolished or destroyed either by accident or design. But the words <em>“ </em>constructed ” or “ reconstructed ” cannot be construed to prohibit an owner from repairing his wooden building which .stands within the fire limits. And we are clearly of the opinion that the repairs contemplated by the plaintiff as set out in our findings of fact, do not amount to construction or reconstruction within the meaning of the law. The building will not be materially enlarged, in. fact it will be no wider and no longer than when the repairs were begun. It will be two feet and six inches higher; but the new front will be galvanized iron and the ceiling and wainscoting will be steel, and certainly this reduces the fire risk, and the roof will be slate in place of wooden shingles. To say that the contemplated repairs amount to a reconstruction or constructing again or rebuilding of the wooden structure seems to us putting a forced and unusual meaning upon these terms. If to put a new front in a building and a new ceiling and a new roof and painting the building is a reconstruction of a building, then we do not understand the meaning of these terms. Having reached this conclusion, it follows that the plaintiff is entitled to repair his building and that the action of the city in refusing to permit him to do so is illegal and must be restrained. We are not, however, disposed to restrain the city from preventing the plaintiff from' putting shingles on the building for a roof, and say that the roof must be of slate or some other noninflammable material.</p>
