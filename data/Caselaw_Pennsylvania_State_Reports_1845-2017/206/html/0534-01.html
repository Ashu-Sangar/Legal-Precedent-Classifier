Prior to 1860, Julius Novial resided on the island of Porto Rico, but about that time he left in a ship bound for San Francisco. He has never been heard from since and has never appeared to claim his legacy, although search and advertisement were made for him. On the settlement of the account of Bousquet’s executrix, the accountant was ordered to invest the legacy and hold it subject to the order of the legatee. The money still remains in the hands of the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Peter Bousquet, deceased, and with its accumulations, now amounts to more than $8,000.</p>
    <p id="b566-6" data-blocks='[["BL_566.8",566,[291,1037,1188,759]]]'>On October 28, 1901, Alexander D. Lauer was commissioned deputy escheator in the case of Julius Novial, deceased, and on December 7, 1901, petitioned the orphans’ court to order Charles Tete, Jr., administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Peter Bousquet, to file an account. This was ordered, and upon the audit on May 8, 1902, the commonwealth by its deputy escheator, claimed the entire fund which was made up solely of the legacy to N ovial and its accumulations. The auditing judge declined to allow this claim on the ground that it was barred by the 26th section of the Act of May 2, 1889, P. L. 66, and awarded the balance in the hands of the accountant to the residuary legatees under the will of Peter Bousquet, deceased. The commonwealth filed exceptions to the adjudication which after argument were dismissed by the court in banc and the adjudication was confirmed.</p>

      <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>■ The fund which is here claimed has not been paid into court and is not in the custody of any depository or officer of the court. It is in the hands of the administrator of Peter Bousquet, by whom it has been held and invested, to await the appearance of the legatee. The facts do not therefore come within the second section of the act. Neither does the third section apply, for that extends to cases where the relation of trustee and cestui que trust exists. There is no such relation here. Upon the death of the testator, the legacy became vested in Julius Novial and it remained as his property, and is not subject to any trust.</p>
    <p id="ARN" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[266,936,1192,1338]]]'>Both the second and third sections would seem to apply only to cases where the owner of a fund in court or the cestui que trust or beneficial owner of a trust fund, have been unknown for a period of seven years. In the present case, the owner of the fund has never been unknown. It is his present whereabouts that are unknown. If there is any escheat, therefore, in this case, it must be under the first section of the act and by reason of the claim that Julius Novial died intestate and without heirs or known kindred, or widow. There is no direct evidence of his death. If a presumption of death exists, it must have arisen at the expiration of seven years from the year 1860, when he was last heard of, or in 1867. The proceedings to es-cheat the fund were not begun until 1901, more than twenty-one years after that date. It can hardly be contended that the twenty-sixth section of the act of 1889 does not apply to cases arising under the first section of that act. The commonwealth itself in providing for the escheat of property has limited the time in which the proceedings must be instituted. Its claim to an escheat in this case is, therefore, clearly barred. The suggestion that the deputy escheator and his counsel should be compensated out of the fund, does not appear to have been made upon the audit, and is not passed upon in the adjudication. Furthermore, the question is not included in the statement in the appellant’s paper-book, of the question involved in the case, and therefore it will not be considered: 5th Ward Bldg. &amp; Loan Asso. v.
