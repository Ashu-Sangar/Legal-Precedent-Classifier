The condition of the obligation was that he should “account for and pay .... the money due and owing to the said brewing company for all sales and shipments made by them and at his request,” and as it is admitted that the business between them was all done the same way from the beginning, it is not apparent how merely calling him agent, erroneously or not, in the recital of the bond, can release him from the plain obligation of the condition. But as this point was not made and therefore not passed upon by the court below, it will be disregarded here.</p>
