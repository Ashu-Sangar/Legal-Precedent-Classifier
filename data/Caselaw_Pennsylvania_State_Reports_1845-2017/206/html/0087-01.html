You said that you were present at the conversation which took place between Dr. Weaver and Mr. Hottle at the time of the execution and delivery of this note, and you had given what you understood to be said at the time. Was there or was there not anything more than a verbal understanding or agreement at that time? A. Yes, sir. Q. What further understanding was there ? A. There was an understanding between the two parties and it was entered on the book. Q. Who entered it there ? A. I did myself. Q. Can you turn to the entry that you made? A. I can. Q. Do so, please. A. I have it. Q. What do you find. Is that a written memorandum there ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Who made it? A. I did.”</p>

    <p id="b119-8" data-blocks='[["BL_119.8",119,[193,781,1180,612]]]'>The memorandum in the defendant’s book of original entries was in form a receipt by defendant for a conditional payment by plaintiff on account of the charges in the book against him. As against the note sued on the condition was in relief of defendant, and even if the receipt had been signed by him, it would not have been evidence in his favor, while being retained in his own possession. A party cannot make evidence for himself in that way. There was nothing therefore to take this entry out of the ordinary category of a written memorandum of a conversation or a contract made by the witness at the time but not signed by the parties, and available to refresh the witness’s recollection, but not in itself evidence.</p>
    <p id="b119-9" data-blocks='[["BL_119.9",119,[192,1405,1181,870]]]'>The second and third assignments of error are substantially that the court held the finding of lunacy by the inquisition to be conclusive. But it.does not appear that any such ruling was made. A witness testified that he was present at a certain date and saw the defendant pay the plaintiff money, and was asked what the plaintiff (now a lunatic) said, when objection was sustained, the ground not appearing on the record but apparently being that the time was within the period covered by the finding of the inquisition. Such finding was prima facie evidence of lunacy at the time referred to by the witness and it does not appear that the court gave it any greater force. In refusing a new trial the judge said: “ The reasons based upon the failure to admit evidence of statements by Mr. Hottle during lucid intervals, fall through their own weakness. There was no offer to prove such statements while lucid, and at the argument for a new trial there was no testimony to show that such evidence could be produced.”</p>
