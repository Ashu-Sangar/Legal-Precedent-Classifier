It is not for the court to declare it as a fact or to determine it. We cannot say as a matter of law that an attempt to pass over a noticeable accumulation of ice, is negligence per se; nor can we say as a matter of law that even though the pavements were generally icy and slippery, plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. These are questions to be decided by the jury under the evidence as to the circumstances and the law as we have declared it. [2]</p>

Mr. Rinehart, it was — he was the occupant of some rooms on the upper story of the defendant’s house — he was called and testified that that night, having reason to believe the weather would be extremely severe, he turned off the water from the house so that there could be no flow through the pipes, and his wife testified that the next morning she went to the place were he had turned the water off and turned it on. If you believe that testimony, it would follow that there was no water in the pipes of that house (I am not speaking of the drain pipe that led from the sink down into the archway) from the time Mr. Rinehart turned it off until his wife turned it on next morning. It was testified by Mr. Rinehart that he had notified the occupants of the Ludwig and Faulkner rooms that they should supply themselves with water, that he was about to turn the water of the house off.</p>

If the ice was formed from water that went down the drain pipe from the sink, it could not have been from water flowing into the. sink from the pipes of the house, but the pipe that led from the sink down to the archway was not connected with the water pipes of that house that night.] [3]</p>

There was considerable testimony as to the source from which the water came which formed the ice in question. The defendant sought to prove that it could not have come from his premises, and the judge called the attention of the jury to the turning off of the water the night before, as tending to sustain that view. He could not have gone further and charged that that single act was a complete defense without disregarding the other evidence. He properly directed the jury to consider it all together.</p>
