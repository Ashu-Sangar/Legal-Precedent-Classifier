Sherwood, a son and heir of the decedent, was established, entered a decree directing the register of wills to issue letters of administration unto Benjamin F. Gilkeson upon the renunciation and request of Robert H. Sherwood and Catherine S. Jones, his only heirs, if he be dead.</p>

Thereupon the administrator petitioned the court for a formal decree of distribution, in accordance with the schedule annexed to the account, which was duly entered and signed. By that distribution the one third or share of Henry F. Sherwood in the personal estate was awarded to Benjamin F. Gilkeson, as administrator, under his appointment by the proceedings pursuant to the act of 1885.</p>

      <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>The petitioner has taken this rule to open the decree of distribution to Mr. Gilkeson as administrator of Henry F. Sherwood, averring that the sum distributed to Mr. Gilkeson should, in law, have been distributed between petitioner and his sister upon the presumption that Henry F. Sherwood, having been absent and unheard from for twenty-nine years, is in fact dead and therefore incapable of inheriting any part of his mother’s estate. The administrator answers that the distribution was lawful, and assented to by the petitioner and his sister, that lie has paid out a portion of the estate of Isabella H. Sherwood pursuant to said decree, to wit: the shares of the petitioner and his sister, and as administrator of Henry F. Sherwood has taken over and administered the share in the personal estate awarded to him, and has filed his account charging himself with the amount of the personal estate received from the estate of Isabella H. Sherwood, under the decree of this court, which account has become confirmed. That he has paid out the sum of $361.90 expenses of settling the estate, and claimed credit in said account for collateral inheritance tax amounting to $465.43, and has now in his hands without deducting the collateral inheritance tax, the sum of $9,308.77, or deducting said tax, the sum of $8,853.34, which sum he is prepared to pay out according to law, upon direction of the court, the same being upon deposit in the Bucks County Trust Company at two per cent interest.</p>

Sherwood, and distributed to Henry F. Sherwood, if alive, if dead to his heirs or legal representatives, remains in his hands and has been separately deposited. It has not been distributed to, or accounted for by him as administrator of Henry F. Sherwood, but he suggests that, as administrator of Henry F. Sherwood, he is entitled to receive and distribute the said sum unless proof is made of the death of the said Henry F. Sherwood or security given. While as to this fund the respondent craves the instruction of the court, the application is not properly a part of this contention and should be made separately. The petitioner has obtained a rule to show cause why the account shall not be opened, as to7 the amount distributed to the administrator of Henry F. Sherwood, but has taken no steps as to the share of the real estate <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>distributed to his heirs or legal representatives.

Sherwood, which is now claimed to be error. To this account the appellant, together with the only other distributee except Henry Sherwood’s administrator, appended a formal statement under seal that he had examined the account and prayed the court to confirm it absolutely as stated. It thus appears that he was instrumental in inducing the court to mate the very decree of which he now complains. He has estopped himself from being heard to do so.</p>

The objection made is to the original decree, and no reasons are assigned for a review that were not available and should have been presented at the original hearing. It is not competent for a party to enlarge or renew the statutory period for appeal by a petition for a bill of review upon such grounds. While it may be conceded that the Orphans’ Court might have entertained such a bill for the correction of a manifest error of fact, it is not clear that it could do so for an error of law which <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>might have been the subject of appeal, and certainly no case has been brought to our attention which holds that it must do so.</p>

Reading School District, ante, p. 469, but the act has no bearing on the present case. Even if it were held unconstitutional under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, the result would be that notwithstanding his absence Henry Sherwood’s rights as an heir could not be disregarded in the distribution of his mother’s estate.</p>
