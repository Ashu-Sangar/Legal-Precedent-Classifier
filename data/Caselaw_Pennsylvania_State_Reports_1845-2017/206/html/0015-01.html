It is an incident of such ownership that common consent is necessary to common enjoyment of the property, and the prior consent of each owner is necessary to bind him to any use of the chattel or expenditure on account of it. In case of vessels, however, the employment of which is deemed by commercial nations a matter of public benefit, after the consent to the appointment of the managing owner is established, the consent of all the owners to his duly authorized acts will be presumed, and they will be bound by all contracts made by him on their behalf within the scope of his authority : Maclachlan, Merchant Shipping (4th ed.), 190. This extends to whatever concerns the employment of the ship, as ap. pointing its master and officers, seeing that the ship is properly repaired, equipped and manned, employing tradesmen to furnish supplies and repairs, procuring freights, preserving the <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>ship’s papers, making necessary entries, adjusting freights and averages, disbursing and receiving moneys, keeping and adjusting the accounts between the parties interested, and the like: Abbott, Merchant Ships (14th ed.), 130; Maclachlan, Merchant Shipping (4th ed.), 186. The institution of proceedings at law, however, is not within the authority of a managing agent, being foreign to the purpose of his employment, and it has accordingly been held that he cannot pledge the credit of the co-owners for the expenses of a lawsuit: Abbott, Merchant Ships, supra, citing Campbell v. Stein, 6 Dow. 116; The Bellcairn, 5 Asp. M. C. 582. A fortiori, it is not within the scope of his authority to institute a criminal prosecution, and the consent of the owners to such action on his part cannot be presumed from the fact of his employment as managing owner. The consent of each must be shown to justify charging him with the incidental expenses. The learned master finds that the criminal prosecution against Stotsenberg was instituted and prosecuted without the authorhy or consent of his wife, or of the plaintiff, her assignee. He also finds that the prosecution was abandoned. It was therefoi’e of no benefit to the owxxers, who could only have been benefited by it, as members of the eornmuixity, through the conviction and punishment of the offender, not in their private capacity as owners, axxd the case not havixxg been brought to trial, there is nothiixg to show tlxat the proceeding was founded upon any proper cause. Uxxder such circumstances, there is no reason in law or equity why any part of the expenses incurred in connection with this criminal prosecutiorx should be imposed upon Mrs. Stotsenberg or the plaintiff. The master finds the total of these expenses to be the sum of $409.60. Credits claimed for all the items aggregating this total must be disallowed to the accountant as against the plaintiff.</p>

The date of August 17, 1897, is that upon which the accountant became the managing owner, and is fixed by the decree as the date when the accounting should begin, because it is his own stewardship of which he is required to render an account, and not that of another. The plaintiff in acquiring the ownership of Mrs. Stotsenberg’s share in the John Reese, acquired also the net earnings or dividends accrued upon that share to the date of his purchase. In determining what the net earnings are, the accountant is entitled to credit for any due and proper application of the earnings of the tugboat received by him. The payment of a valid and subsisting indebtedness of the owners legitimately incurred in connection with the employment of the boat is a due and proper application of her earnings, and it is a matter of no moment when that debt was contracted. Here the validity of the debts is not questioned; the accountant has actually paid them as justly due by the owners, and he is entitled to credits for such payments, as the learned master has properly found.</p>

The master nowhere finds the facts upon which he bases his conclusion that the persons named were merely assistants, nor does he find the facts showing the nature of their employment and duties or the character of the work carried on by the managing owner. To ascertain these facts we must look into the evidence, and that shows that Walker, at the time he was employed about the business of the John Reese, was in business as a tugboat agent and had charge of several other tugboats besides the Reese; that he attended to his duties as agent for the Reese in the same manner as he attended to like duties for other boats; that the business of the boat was carried on in his office, the managing owner not having any office; that Walker kept accounts of her receipts and expenditures, paid the crew, paid some of the bills, hustled to get work for the boat and had general charge of her, and was paid for his services a commission of five per centum upon the gross receipts. Reynolds, his successor, performed the like duties. He acted in the same capacity to this particular boat as lie did in connection with other boats which he had charge of. He was paid also a commission of five per centum, which he testified is a fair commission for the work. The accountant had a general superintendence of the business and directed Walker and Reynolds in their work; he also seems to have assisted in getting employment for the tugboat and to have paid some of the bills; but the character, amount and extent of work done by him independently of his agents does not clearly appear in the evidence.</p>

It was, therefore, Von Boyneburgk’s duty to account. His neglect or refusal to do it caused this suit. For this dereliction of duty he should be punished by imposing upon him all the costs and interest upon the amount retained, to be paid out of his own individual pocket.

It appears from the evidence and was found as a fact by the master that no salary was ever paid any managing owner of the John Reese. The accountant as managing owner employed two agents of the tugboat who performed the duties as such and were compensated bjr commissions upon the gross sums they handled. The business of the boat was carried on at the office of one of the agents, the managing owner having no office. The agents kept the accounts of the boat’s receipts and expenditures, paid the crew, paid some of the bills, solicited and obtained business for the boat, and had general charge of her. It was found as a fact that it was the usual and customary arrangement in the business that the managing owner should serve without charge and the agent of the company should be paid a percentage upon such gross receipts as resulted from the agency. It thus appears that under the facts disclosed by the evidence and found by the court below, the duties of the managing owner were not performed by Yon Boyneburgk but by the agents who received the commissions to which he claims he is entitled for attending to the affairs or the business of the boat.</p>

      <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>The above recited facts would clearly preclude the accountant from claiming a salary for his services as managing owner. He relies, however, on an alleged agreement by the owners of a majority in interest in the tugboat as the basis of his claim for compensation for his services. The evidence shows that neither Mrs. Stotsenberg nor her assignor, the plaintiff, was represented at any meeting when the alleged agreement was made, nor that they, or either of them, had any knowledge that such an agreement had been entered into with Von Boyneburgk. It is equally clear that neither the plaintiff nor his assignor acquiesced in the agreement or consented that Von Boyneburgk should receive a salary for his services as managing owner. But if it be conceded that the majority interest agreed to compensate him for his services and that the minority interest could be bound thereby, the managing owner, however, would be compelled to perform those services before he would be entitled to the compensation. This, as we have seen, he did not do. The two agents conducted the business and. they were paid by commissions upon the gross sums they handled. As said by the court below, these commissions having been paid, it would be inequitable to charge what would virtually be a second compensation for the same services against the plaintiff, neither he nor his assignor having ever consented thereto. It is quite obvious that the appellant did not regard himself as entitled to, nor expect, compensation for his services from the fact that his account shows that he made no charges for them against the boat until more than eighteen months after he assumed the management of the boat and after Mrs. Stotsenberg had sold her interest and this proceeding had been instituted. This taken in connection with the fact that an agent performed the duties and was compensated in the manner in which the managing owner would be paid were he to receive compensation, is convincing proof that the appellant’s right to claim payment for services did not occur to him until the appellee compelled him to account for his management of the business of the boat.</p>

We can see no force in the suggestion of the master that the appellant as managing owner was morally bound to detect and prosecute a copartner for an alleged embezzlement which occurred some time prior to the date when the affairs of the boat were placed in the hands of the appellant. The purpose of a criminal prosecution is to punish the offender for violating the laws of the commonwealth, and not to enforce the payment of money nor, as in civil proceedings, to restore to the owner the property of which he has been defrauded. The criminal process of the court should not be invoked for any such purpose. While the appellant, like any other person, could have instituted the prosecution against Stotsenberg, it was clearly not his duty as managing owner to do so. The scope of his employment did not include a duty nor the authority to prosecute at the expense of the boat owner a_ delinquent or defaulting owner of a minority interest for the violation of the criminal laws of the state. Such action might be most commendable in him as a citizen who is looking after the morals of the community, but as the managing owner of a tugboat his employers would doubtless prefer that he should not consider it a part of his employment to institute criminal prosecutions against them, or if he did so, that they should not be compelled to reimburse him for such services or protect him against costs he was properly condemned to pay.</p>

It was clearly the duty of the managing owner to account not onty to the plaintiff but to all the owners, and when he failed in the performance of this duty and was compelled by legal proceedings to render an account he should be visited personally with the costs.</p>

The learned counsel for appellant misapprehended the purpose of rule 92, which requires the appellant to file in the court below “ a brief statement of the errors he alleges to have been made by the order or decree appealed from.” This, however, does not relieve the appellant from his duty under rule 11 to “ specify in writing the particular errors which he assigns, and to file the same in the prothonotary’s <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>office ” of this court. On an appeal, we can consider only such errors in the record as have been properly assigned under the last mentioned rule. A failure to observe either of these rules may, at tbe instance of the other party or on the court’s own motion, impose on the offending party the penalty of having his writ non prossed.</p>
