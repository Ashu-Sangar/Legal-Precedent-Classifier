The employee becomes his agent or servant and the responsibility rests with the master who controls. On the other hand where one employs a mechanic or .other person to perform a piece of work and does not undertake to direct how or in what manner it is to be done, but vests in the mechanic power to perform the work as he pleases and in his own way without direction, restraint or control of the superior or master, the employer is not responsible for the employee’s negligence, if he be negligent.</p>

If the commissioners employ a tinner to roof this courthouse making no provision as to how the old tin is to be removed or the new tin raised up and placed, and the Commissioners are not present directing the operation or the manner of its performance and have relinquished their power over the work or manner of its performance and an accident befall an employee or other person, the county of Perry would in nowise be responsible for any act, negligent or otherwise, by the employer, whereby some one is injured.

This was manifestly correct. Immediately before using the language objected to, the learned trial judge had called attention to the disagreement of the doctors as to what was the real cause ol the physical troubles of which the plaintiff was complaining, and, in other portions of his charge, he had specifically referred to the testimony in support of plaintiff’s theory that he was suffering from injuries caused by the accident. The doctors called by the plaintiff testified that he was suffering from traumatic neurosis, attributable to the accident; those called by the defendant said his troubles were sclerosis of the arteries and heart trouble, with which he had been affected before the accident. It is not possible that the jury could have understood the court, from what is embraced in the fifteenth assignment, as saying that the defendant’s theory as to the cause of plaintiff’s trouble was the true one, and the assignment complaining of this is overruled. It is perfectly clear that the learned judge was calling attention, in the first portion of the extract from his charge, simply to the defendant’s theory of what was the matter with the plaintiff.</p>

On the contrary, the appellant admits that he finds no fault with it, but insists that the average juryman could not understand it and that the illustration was misleading. In this we cannot concur, for it is not conceivable that the average juror could be so stupid as not to be able to comprehend the court’s very clear definition of an independent contractor, or that the apt illustration used could have had any other effect than to make it perfectly plain what the court meant by the words “ independent contractor.”</p>

It assumed that the jury could have found facts of which there was no proof, and it asked them to give undue effect to others. There was no testimony, by way of illustration, that the board of county commissioners, which had employed Horning to make the repairs on the bridge at the time of the accident, had ever employed him before; and yet the only question was as to the character of the employment in this particular instance. The character of his employment, or the number of times he had been employed by former <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>boards, was not in the case and could have thrown no light on the character of his employment to repair the bridge in May, 1900. Again, that he was employed at $2.00 per day and directed to employ other hands at $1.50 was not necessarily inconsistent with the independent character of his employment : Harrison v. Collins, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20Pa.%20158" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="86 Pa. 158">86 Pa. 158</a>; and, from the court’s affirmative answers- to plaintiff’s fourth and eighth points, the jury could have found what was asked for in the third.
