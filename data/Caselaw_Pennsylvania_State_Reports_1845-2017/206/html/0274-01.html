Three years prior to the infliction of the injuries for which the suit was brought, the company named in the writ had failed, and its property was sold by the sheriff, but at the time of the suit it still existed as a corporation without doing any business. A new corporation known as the Eureka Tempered Copper Works succeeded to the property and business of the copper company. The plaintiff was injured while in the employ of the copper works. The service of a writ was made on the mánager of the copper works, but the sheriff, following the words of the writ, returned it as served on the manager of the copper company. The error in the name was not discovered by the plaintiff until a few days after the statute of limitations had barred a new action. <em>Held, </em>reversing the court below, that permission should have been given to amend the record by striking out the word “company” and inserting the word “ works.”</p>

Its property was sold by the sheriff in 1896, and since then it has not done any business, but still exists as a corporation. In December, 1896, the Eureka Tempered Copper Works was chartered, and this corporation succeeded to the business of the copper company. In 1899, the plaintiff while in the employ of the copper works was injured, and in 1901, three days before his right of action was barred by the statute of limitations, he brought this suit to recover damages. Through a mistake of counsel the defendant named in the writ was the copper company instead of the copper works. The service of the writ was made on the manager of the latter corporation, but the sheriff, following the words of the writ, returned it as <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>served on the manager of the copper company. The error in the name was not discovered by the plaintiff until a few days after the statute of limitations had barred a new action. The plaintiff then obtained a rule to show cause why the record should not be amended by striking out the word “ Company” and inserting the word “Works,” and on the same day the sheriff petitioned for leave to amend his return so as to show service on the manager of the copper works. This appeal is from the order of the court discharging the rule to amend and dismissing the sheriff’s petition.</p>

The plaintiff had never worked for the copper company. His counsel knew of the existence and the history of both companies, that one had gone out of business and had been succeeded by the other. He intended to draw a precipe for a writ against the copper works, and by mistake wrote the word “ Company” instead of “Works.” He served the right party, the manager of the copper works, and thus brought that company into court, but under a wrong name. The mistake in bringing the suit was in the name of the party actually summoned, and not in suing the wrong party, and the amendment should have been allowed.</p>
