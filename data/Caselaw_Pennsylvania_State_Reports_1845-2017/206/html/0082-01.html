The pole was secured by guy ropes to the tracks in such a way that a car passing over the tracks would strike the ropes. The employees of the steel company permitted ears to get beyond their control on the down grade and run into the cars of the construction company, causing them to strike and break the rope, and let down the pole which struck one of the construction company’s workmen and killed him. In an action by the widow of the deceased against the construction company to recover damages for his death, <em>held, </em>(1) that as an accident was inevitable if the rope should be struck by a moving car, it was the construction company’s duty to foresee that cars might get beyond control and to provide for such a contingency; (2) that the defendant had not provided safe machinery or a safe place to work for its employees; (3) that a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff should be sustained.</p>

Previous to that time Butterman had been a confectioner. He only accepted employment with defendants during a strike ; had no previous knowledge of the work required of him, and there was no evidence that he had been instructed, or was aware of the danger connected with the erection of the gin pole.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b113-7" data-blocks='[["BL_113.7",113,[181,1292,1183,353]]]'>The defendant company were engaged in the construction of the steels work at the new plant of the Dunmore Iron and Steel Company, at Dunmore, Pa., and on October 31, their employees were engaged in unloading columns, spans and girders from cars on a siding running from the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad into the Dunmore Iron and Steel Company’s land.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b113-8" data-blocks='[["BL_113.8",113,[179,1655,1182,301]]]'>To facilitate the unloading a pole was erected on the side of the siding and was supported by four guy ropes, two of which were fastened to the tracks of the siding in such manner that when in place a car could not pass without striking the rope. In order to let a car pass it was necessary to loosen the rope and pull it away from the track.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b113-9" data-blocks='[["BL_113.9",113,[175,1965,1183,461]],["BL_114.1",114,[287,378,1186,354]]]'>A crab or windlass was erected about fifty feet from the track and by this articles to be unloaded from a car were hoisted and lowered. Butterman’s work was principally at the crab. The defendant company had arranged with the Iron and Steel Company to give notice when cars were to be moved on the siding so that the ropes could be in position to allow cars to pass in or out. On the day of the accident two cars were being unloaded at the gin pole by the defendant company, and beyond these, about thirty or thirty-five feet distant, were two <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>ears of the Iron and Steel Company being unloaded by the employees of said company. It became necessary to move these last mentioned cars a short distance, and they were placed in motion. Although efforts were made to stop them they got beyond control, and there being a descent in the tracks they ran into the cars at the gin pole, broke the rope, thus letting down the pole which struck Butterman, killing him instantly.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b114-4" data-blocks='[["BL_114.4",114,[284,741,1187,247]]]'>The court submitted the question of the defendant’s negligence in not providing for such contingency, and of Butter-man’s contributory negligence, to the jury. Defendant’s contention is, that the court should have given binding instructions for defendants, for three reasons, viz :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b114-5" data-blocks='[["BL_114.5",114,[285,999,1183,147]]]'>1. The proximate cause of the accident was the negligence or act of the Dunmore Iron and Steel Company gang over whom defendants had no control or power.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b114-6" data-blocks='[["BL_114.6",114,[284,1154,1186,345]]]'>Admittedly the fastening of the guy rope to the track made it dangerous, for an accident was inevitable if the rope should be struck by a moving car. Hence, defendants’ duty to provide against just such a contingency as happened. That this event should have been foreseen and provided against admits of no serious dispute, especially when the way in which the siding was constructed is understood.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b114-7" data-blocks='[["BL_114.7",114,[281,1517,1189,927]],["BL_115.1",115,[204,359,1180,769]]]'>It is agreed that if not struck, the rope would not break, and hence, what caused the accident was the striking of the other cars. The absence of a guard rail alone may not be the cause of an accident, but when a horse becomes frightened and falls down an embankment because of the absence of the guard rail, what is the proximate cause ? The whistle which frightened the horse or the absence of the guard rail ? And why in such cases is the township liable? Because it should have foreseen that horses will become frightened. So in this case, defendants must have foreseen by common experience that cars may get beyond control, or be set in motion by others. Sometimes by their own weight when on a descending grade, or by boys, or as in this case, when not properly managed. “ The rule on this subject may be stated to be, that the defendant is not liable in negligence where no injurious consequence could reasonably have been contemplated as a result of the act or omission complained of, but it is liable where injuries might have been anticipated or foreseen: ” 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>486. The defendants knew that precautions were necessary where cars were to be moved over the siding by providing for notice where such moving was intentional, but made no provision for an involuntary movement of cars or for a movement of cars by any other than the engineer and fireman of a locomotive. They made no provision for accidents, and this was part of their duty. This is a case where the master did not provide suitable safe machinery or a suitable safe place for his employees ; and the fact that this dangerous method was the ordinary method does not excuse, but rather increases the duty to foresee and provide against accidents such as the one that occurred. “ The result must occur in the natural and probable course of events: ” Pittsburg Southern Railway Company v.
