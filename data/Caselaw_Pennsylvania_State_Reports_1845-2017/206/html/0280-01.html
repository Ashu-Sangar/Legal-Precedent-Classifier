The plaintiff claims that the Jacob Kortman tract and the Henry Bozar tract, and in fact all of these tracts should be located by what is known or termed in law a block survey. You will understand by this, that in the early settlement of- this state, and in the early acquisition of titles, a person who desired to obtain title to a certain quantity of land made application to the commonwealth and filed his application in the land office, and while he himself was not able to obtain more than a certain quantity of land, he made application in the name of others, in the name of different members of his family and other persons, for the quantity of land which he desired, and the rights of the nominal applicants were transferred to the person making the application, and thus one person was enabled to obtain a large number of warrants of land. In this case James Wilson applied for a large number of warrants, much larger than is represented on <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>the plaintiff’s map, and those warrants were placed in the hands of the deputy surveyor, Alexander McDowell, whose duty it was to go and survey those warrants upon the ground. His duty was as we understand the law to survey each one of those warrants and mark them on the ground, but that was not always done, sometimes the deputy surveyor only ran the outward lines of a block of warrants and then when that was done that became a block in the legal acceptation of the term. Where a large number of warrants or batch of warrants were run and marked on the ground, in addition to running the exterior lines of the block, it became and was called a block in the popular sense of the term.]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[316,999,1186,1445]],["BL_313.1",313,[216,375,1183,1187]]]'>[To bring this definition more clearly before you I desire to refer to the definition of blocks as defined by the late Judge Williams of the Supreme Court, in the case of Ferguson against Bloom, <a href="/pa/144/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="144 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="823774" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0549-01">144 Pa. 549</a>. Judge Williams was known to be an able land lawyer, and speaking of the manner in which warrants were granted by the commonwealth and the manner in which the surveys were made, he states : “ When more land was desired than could be included in one tract, the person wishing to buy made application in the names of the members of his family, his servants and employees, as well as his own. When this happened, the deputy surveyor would sometimes locate the entire batch of warrants in a body, as one tract, and such a body of surveys, made at one time, for one owner, was called a block.” If the surveyor discharged his duty, and marked the lines of each tract, the word. “ block ” was sometimes used to describe the body of lands held by one owner; but in such cases the location of the tracts comprising the block was made on what may be called the individual system. If only exterior lines of the block were marked, the location of the separate tracts was practicable only upon wbat we have called the “ block system.” Further defining these two systems, he says : “ If no tract corners aré marked on the block lines, they must be run in accordance with the returns of survey. If corners are to be found on the block lines, these will control the courses and distances given in the returns, and the interior lines must be protracted across the block in accordance with them.” Further he states : “ In Mock v. Astley, 13 S. &amp; R. 382, it was said a foundation for its application in any given case must be <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>laid by showing two facts : First, the existence of a block must be established ‘ by the production of documents showing title to the whole body. This shows a grant by the commonwealth of her title to the whole body composing the block. Next, the evidence must show that the tracts composing the alleged block were located in a body without interior lines.’ ” After reciting other cases, he says: “ Upon the authority of these cases, and upon the principle, it is clear that if there are any interior lines on the ground they are of equal value with external ones, as they are equally the ‘ footprints of the surveyor,’ made at the location of the tracts, and for interior members of the block. The general rule is that when there is work on the ground, made for and peculiar to a given tract, such work will control the location of the tract and fix the places of its lines.” Again, “We have thus two systems for ascertaining the proper location of a survey; the natural and general one, which rests on such of the original marks made for the tract as can be found, and on the legal presumption arising from the return of survey as to such as cannot be found; and the block system, which is applicable where no internal lines were run, and where, therefore, no marks exist to guide in the location of internal tracts or lines, except such as may be found on the exterior of the block.”]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[217,1572,1180,611]]]'>[Now, gentlemen of the jury, from the definitions which I have read to you from the decision of the Supreme Court in Ferguson v. Bloom, which is almost the last case in which the systems are clearly defined by the Supreme Court, you will see that a legal block, in the legal sense I mean now, is where the exterior lines only are run and marked upon the ground. However, in the popular sense in which a block is used, it may be used where not only the exterior lines of the block or batch of surveys are run and marked upon the exterior lines, but the warrants themselves, composing the batch of surveys, the lines or corners are marked, and sometimes the lines are run upon the ground.]</p>

The plaintiff has furnished us with a certified copy of a connected draft of warrants lying between the Randolph Spangler on the north and the James Murray on <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>the south. His map, which you see before you, goes farther ip the block than this connected draft, and his surveys went farther north, or up the Allegheny river, than the Randolph Spangler warrant. This connected draft, and the same thing is shown by the copies of the separate warrants, shows the courses and distances running south along the Allegheny river, along all of these warrants. It shows the corners for the warrants marked by trees named in the surveyor’s return of survey on a large number of the warrants, on the east along down the Allegheny river. I think there are seventeen of the warrants shown on this connected draft and some ten of them contain calls for marked trees. On the west there are still more calls for marked trees at the corners of these respective blocks, and I think only three of the warrants are without calls for corners.</p>

Because of these calls for marked trees along on these, separate warrants were actually made by the surveyor upon the ground, then many of these warrants, if not all of them, could be located by marks upon the ground. If this batch of surveys then are to be treated, in the location of one of the warrants, as a block in the legal acceptation of a block, it is because these corners cannot be found now upon the ground sufficient to locate the warrant under consideration.] [4]</p>

That is at the north corner of the Randolph Spangler as you see it upon the map. The surveyors have gone north and have found one or more trees or marks, as I recollect it, north of that, which counted back to 1795. Coming back to the hemlock, the northwest corner of the Randolph Spangler, the surveyors on the part of the plaintiff have traced a line <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>from that point in a southerly direction or south along these various warrants to the James Murray tract or warrant.

And that they having been surveyed by a deputy surveyor of experience, who was the county surveyor of this county for many years, A. H. Ludlow, is evidence of where these warrant are located, and evidence to support his claim that the warrants are located farther north than the defendants claim, and that the Henry Bozar is where the defendants claim the Jacob Kortman to be. And in the David Beaty survey it is claimed that the call is for the Henry Bozar. The words written at the east of the David Beaty on the survey are “ D. Beaty,” and that is the piece of land which lies in the western part of the Jacob Kortman, as placed upon the map of the defendants and that being in the Jacob Kortman it is claimed that this is a call for the Jacob Kortman.

That is the older survey. That calls for the John Kortman, which is the next one south; that must be located then south of the Randolph Spangler; and the principle invoked applies that after twenty-one years there is a legal presumption that the warrant has been located as returned by the deputy sur<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>veyor.

    <p id="b319-6" data-blocks='[["BL_319.8",319,[199,652,1184,1295]]]'>The contention in this issue turned on conflicting evidence as to the location of two tracts of land, the Henry Bozar and Jacob Kortman warrants surveyed and returned in 1795. Both were part of a large block of seventy-six warrants taken out in that year by James Wilson; it is conceded on both sides that their position in the block is that of contiguous tracts having as a division an interior line of the block which on the return of survey, as defendants claim, is a line running from a post on the Allegheny river, the eastern boundary of the block west 522 rods to a white oak marked on the return as a monument on the western line of the block; this then, by the return is also fixed as the southwestern corner of the Kortman and the northwestern corner of the Bozar. The plaintiff claimed title to about 125 acres, part of the Bozar; the defendants claimed the same land under the Kortman and the conflicting claims are determined by a proper location of the dividing line which defendants claim runs from the white oak tó the river; the plaintiff claims that the white oak line is not the true interior line of division between the Bozar and Kortman, but that the true line is one tract north of it. There was a mass of conflicting evidence tending to establish each side of the controversy, and the question of fact was submitted to the jury by the learned judge of the court below in a very full and impartial charge; the jury found for defendants and plaintiff appeals preferring eighteen assignments of error.</p>

Under no view of the evidence could the court have withheld it from the jury. Taking the general lines and return of the block as the evidence and the only evidence of the relative location of those two tracts the weight of it would probably sustain plaintiff’s claim ; but the marks of a block consist of the marks, if such are found, of every tract of the block, and the marks if originally intended as corners for a particular tract become marks for <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>locating the whole block. The simple question is, did the early surveyor in locating the block make the marks of these two surveys at that date as members of the block ? He may establish his leading warrant by undoubted monuments maintained to this day; in running his long block lines from these monuments he may mark corners on these lines for the lines of interior tracts; in running these block lines now, it may be found that these corners are not just where designated in the block lines as returned; the distance from the leading warrant may be longer or shorter than that in the block line; it may not be in the exact course; but this variance of itself does not destroy its significance as a monument; it only demonstrates what is well known, the looseness and want of accuracy in the early surveyors, and the negligence exhibited by them in plotting and returning their surveys. In that day, land in Warren county was cheap ; now the production of millions of dollars worth of oil from beneath it has made it very high priced, but nevertheless, we are compelled in ascertaining titles to take into consideration the loose methods of the early surveyors, otherwise we may make disastrous mistakes. Here, we do not undertake to decide that beyond doubt the line from the white oak to the river was the true dividing line between the two tracts; to our minds the evidence is not clear; but there was competent evidence adduced by defendants, that it was; the jury believed it as they had the right to do and we cannot disturb their verdict.</p>

The location of a block of surveys may be established from a single undoubted monument of the block on the ground if there be no others, by the courses and distances in the return; the interior tracts must then be located relatively wholly from the return of the block; but the return may show marks for corners of the interior tracts; if these be found upon the ground they establish the lines of these interior tracts although this may to some extent disturb the lines of the block; such a location of an interior tract of a block although it may somewhat change the course of the exterior line as plotted in the return or shorten that line running from the leading warrant yet giving effect to that fact, does not dis<a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>regard the established rule, that a member of a block cannot be wrested from its position and be located outside of it; it is not thereby wrested from the block but its position is relatively the same as in the return, although one of the exterior lines of the block has been for a short distance deflected from its course to accord with the established monuments on the ground of the interior tract common to it and the block of which it is a member; but there can be no block of surveys in either a popular or legal sense where the tracts are not contiguous. It was not intended by us in Ferguson v. Bloom, <a href="/pa/144/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="144 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="823774" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0549-01">144 Pa. 549</a>, nor in any other case to change or modify the law as long settled governing the location of a block of surveys and the different members of a block. While we do not concur with what the learned judge of the court below says on this subject, or rather his understanding of the language of the cases cited, we can only say that his instruction did plaintiff no harm, for he distinctly told the jury, that they must be controlled in their verdict by the evidence of the marks made in 1795 on the ground.</p>
