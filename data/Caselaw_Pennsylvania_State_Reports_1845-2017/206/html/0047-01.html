The third son who was a half-brother to the other children was in the habit of attending, under the testator’s direction, to many of the testator’s business affairs and had the custody of his books and papers other than the will. This son aided his father in stating an account against the contestants, and in the books the greater part of the debt was charged against one of the contestants only. A lettey of the testator with which the third <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>son had nothing to do, indicated that testator entertained the idea that there were circumstances which made it proper to charge the debt against both of the contestants, and letters from the contestant not charged in the books, showed a recognition of the fact not only that the testator had entertained the idea of charging him in the will, but also that this idea was not irrational nor without some substantial basis. Testator’s will was drawn by the testator’s regular attorney, was executed before impartial witnesses in the absence of the third son, and remained in the possession of the attorney. <em>Held </em>that the evidence was insufficient to justify the granting of an issue to determine whether undue influence had been exercised upon the testator.</p>

This was followed by another will executed in 1891, wherein he charged his two sons, contestants, with certain sums appearing in his ledger and identified by the pages thereof quoted in the will. No objection is made to its validity. Long prior to the date of this will testator entered into various business enterprises for the benefit of his sons, loaned and advanced them moneys, aided them in real estate investments and by loans and subscriptions to its capital stock, assisted them in the organization and establishment of a national bank at San Antonio, Texas, in which they were interested as stockholders and of which they became the president and cashier. At the request and solicitation of his sons, testator had numerous financial <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>transactions with the bank, consisting of loans and rediscount of notes discounted by the bank in the course of its business. For some years these financial transactions were profitable and satisfactory to the testator. But eventually he became exceedingly dissatisfied with the condition of affairs. The transactions with the bank caused him much solicitude and his account for loans and advances to his sons, particularly his eldest son, was so unsettled and unsecured as to render him anxious and persistent that the same should be closed and settled and the repayment of both the indebtedness of his sons and of the bank secured. The correspondence between testator and his sons in Texas was frequent and continuous in the year 1892. His constant requests for a settlement were met with as frequent promises. Visits were made to the father by the sons, and although settlement was always urged by him and as often acquiesced in by them, no promise was complied with, and no result approved by their father accomplished.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b79-5" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[181,1261,1186,552]]]'>The dissatisfaction of testator increased, but his former urgent and almost pathetic requests became stern, parental demands. As he failed to procure from his sons a statement of their account and that of the bank with him he determined to prepare his own account from his books and the evidence of indebtedness in his possession. Testator was remarkably exact and methodical and his books with the entries all in his handwriting display his care, industry and accuracy to a wonderful degree. He made therein not only accounts with his children, but entries apparently of every investment and financial venture with which he had ever been connected or interested.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b79-6" data-blocks='[["BL_79.5",79,[183,1832,1184,396]]]'>He accordingly requested his youngest son, who with his family and an older daughter of testator, composed the household, to prepare such an account. The account was accordingly carefully and laboriously prepared by testator’s youngest son and with great minuteness included every item of charge testator claimed to be due him from his sons. This was in February, 1898, and resulted in a visit from testator’s eldest son to his father.</p>

Many of the provisions of the prior will were to'be included therein. Testator’s counsel, in pursuance of these instructions, accordingly prepared no less than three drafts, all of which were submitted to testator before the fourth or final draft met with his approval. And then the engrossed will was sent to testator by his counsel for execution. Testator carefully and minutely examined the will and was more critical and observant than his counsel: he discovered an error of the scrivener in a single word and declined to execute the will until it should be corrected. Those who attended as subscribing witnesses were consequently compelled to retire and the will was returned to counsel. Two days afterwards they again visited testator at his residence with the will corrected. A second time he carefully and leisurely examined the.paper. It then met with his satisfaction, and in his own handwriting completed the blank for the names of the executors, signed his name, and declared the paper to be his last will in the presence of the three attending disinterested subscribing witnesses. This was on March 15, 1893. Testator’s request to his sons for a settlement with him continued, but without avail. In the summer of 1893 the Texas bank failed and was forced into liquidation. Testator believed himself to be a creditor of the bank to a very large amount and so declared himself in what is called a “proof of claim.” But to his surprise the receiver of the bank declined to recognize his claim for the full amount upon the ground that the books of the bank showed many of the transactions claimed by testator to be between himself and the bank were in reality between himself and his son, the president of the bank. The “ proof of claim ” was again prepared, but, meeting with the same objection a third time, was corrected so that the testator’s claim against the bank was reduced from over $17,000, as he alleged, to $8,000, upon which he received a dividend of fifty per cent. Testator, wearied with his vain <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>endeavors to obtain security for the payment of the indebtedness of his son and the importunities of both his sons to obtain further loans, finally placed all his books and papers, including the account prepared by his youngest son, in the care and custody of his counsel and employed him to effect the settlement he personally was unable to obtain. The sons were represented by counsel, and after months of negotiation a supposed settlement was reached, but at the last moment repudiated. At this very time, by reason of certain financial difficulties involving testator’s eldest son, he was induced to save him from arrest to agree to advance about $5,000 additional in order to avert the danger.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-4" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[189,995,1180,352]]]'>But testator’s youngest son prevented any further depletion of his father’s estate, and by his personal effort and assumption of liability effected a compromise and final settlement with 1ns brothers’ threatening and dangerous creditor. Still, testator was unsecured by his son for the payment of his indebtedness. And this led to the execution of the first codicil, dated June 27, 1894, fifteen months after the execution of the will.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[189,1357,1178,149]]]'>This was also prepared by testator’s counsel in pursuance of instructions received from him and executed in the presence of two of the subscribing witnesses to the will.</p>

Ho further directed that interest be charged on said sum from the date of the codicil at the rate of four per cent per annum : and in all other respects confirmed and republished the will. And finally, on February 7, 1895, nearly eight months after the date of the first codicil and twenty days prior to his death, testator executed a second codicil, wherein he revoked a bequest in the third item of his will to his youngest son to be expended by him in furthering certain social and benevolent reforms.</p>

On March 21, 1895, the will and codicils were offered for probate. This resulted in a protracted contest and hearing before the register, continuing until July 29, 1895, when the caveat was overruled, petition for an issue dismissed and the will and codicil admitted to probate.</p>

It is true the contestants’ right of appeal is reserved to them by the act of assembly, but their further laches and delay until October 8, 1898, before the presentation of their petition for a citation, etc., is somewhat additionally persuasive of a lack of faith in the propriety and justice of the controversy so long allowed to slumber.</p>

The testimony further shows that the only connection he had with the ascertainment of the amount due testator from his two eldest sons is that at his father’s request he laboriously prepared from his father’s books and papers a statement of the account between him and his sons, and thus ascertained the sum total of their indebtedness. There is no evidence that testator’s youngest son cajoled, instructed, demanded or solicited his father to insert any sum either in his will or codicil and influence him in any manner whatever to charge his two sons therewith.

But that case is clearly to be distinguished from the present. As shown in the prior report in Miller’s Estate, <a href="/pa/179/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="179 Pa. 645" data-case-ids="886928" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0645-01">179 Pa. 645</a>, an appeal from the refusal of an issue, the testator not of extreme old age, was addicted to the inordinate use of intoxicating liquors, afflicted with locomotor ataxia and alleged to be of weakened intellect, the result of dissipation and disease.

From his uncontradicted testimony it appeared that the account of their indebtedness was prepared by him at the request of his father.

To sum up the whole matter, it is simply this, that testator concluded his two eldest sons had already been advanced individually or for their benefit a large proportion of his estate, and, in order to work out an equitable distribution of his property and protect the children not indebted to him, they should be charged jointly with the amount loaned and advanced to them, together with a debt of the Texas National Bank, of which they were the officers. He accordingly so directed, clearly and unmistakably, as he had the undisputed right so to do.</p>

    <p id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.6",88,[315,574,1188,562]]]'>That the making of the will was the testator’s own act was convincingly shown by the preparatory drafts and consultations with his counsel. The directions were his own, and were clearly imparted by himself to counsel who embodied them in his will. The alleged undue influence therefore must have antedated the making of the will, and have been powerful enough to operate in the absence of the influencing party or parties. This is rendered highly improbable bjr the universal and undisputed testimony as to the strong and masterful personality of the testator, and the court have found that there is not a scintilla of evidence to sustain the allegation.</p>
    <p id="b88-7" data-blocks='[["BL_88.7",88,[312,1144,1191,1289]],["BL_89.1",89,[195,363,1184,816]]]'>The only other point on which anything need be said is the testator’s charge in the will and codicil of a large sum as an advancement against the contestant and another son. The learned counsel for the appellants are too well versed in the law to question the right of a father to dispose of his estate even as against his children in such manner as he chooses, but they rest their case on the ground that the provision as to said advancement was made under a mistake of fact, sufficiently material and sufficiently shown by the testator’s assigned reasons, to require the setting aside of this part of his will. The crucial question however is not whether the alleged fact was or might be actually established to the satisfaction of another person or tribunal, but whether it was a clear mistake on the part of testator which misled him, or was a conclusion reached by his own judgment though different from that which the court or a jury might reach on the same information. If the latter it cannot be assailed however unreasonable it may seem. The testator was entitled to form his own judgment and to act upon it without regard to whether it agreed with that of others or not. The evidence shows that the direction as to the charge of the advancement against both his sons was the result of the testator’s deliberate judgment and intention. On this point we adopt the language of the court below: “ It is true that in his family book the debt which the will directs shall be charged jointly against two of his sons, is charged against one of them <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>only; but tbat he entertained the idea that there were circumstances which made it proper to charge it, ultimately, against both, is clearly indicated by his letter to them of December 30, 1892. The suggestion that this letter emanated from another son, the half-brother of the two thus jointly charged by the will, is absolutely without support by the evidence. It was copied, at the instance of the testator, by the sister of the older brothers, the copy being sent, and the original, in his handwriting, retained ; while the letters of January 13 and January 18, 1893, from the son not charged in the book, expressing his willingness that ‘ anything that may be coming ’ to him may be ‘ pledged as security for any advance ’ to the other brother, ‘ in Arizona or Texas,’ or for any of his personal or the bank’s indebtedness, are a clear recognition of the fact not only that the idea was entertained, but that it was not irrational or without some substantial basis.”</p>
