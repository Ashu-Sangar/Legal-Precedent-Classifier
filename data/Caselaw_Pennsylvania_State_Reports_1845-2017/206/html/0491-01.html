If they were lawfully elected, they constitute the session, and the plaintiffs have no case and are not entitled to exercise such control of the property as is claimed. As a matter of fact, the legal title to the property is vested in the trustees of the congregation and not in the session. The function of the session is' to exercise control over the spiritual affairs of the congregation, but not over its temporalities.</p>

The title of the plaintiffs to the office of elders is therefore the real question at issue. The legality of their own election as elders is asserted and that of the defendants is alleged to have been unlawful. The right of the session to control in any way the property of the congregation is only incidental to the right to the office of elder. But this court has decided that a bill in equity to compel the surrender of the property of a corporation cannot be sustained where it appears that the real question in controversy is the validity of the election of the defendants as officers of the corporation. In such a case quo warranto is the appropriate remedy: Bedford Springs Co. v. McKeen, <a href="/pa/161/0639-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="161 Pa. 639" data-case-ids="854168" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0639-01">161 Pa. 639</a>.

Harvey, <a href="/pa/177/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="177 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="883759" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0473-01">177 Pa. 473</a>, as authority for holding that the allegations of complainants that they were displaced from the eldership of the church in violation of the fundamental law of the general ecclesiastical body to which they belong, involving the loss of the control and management, not only of the spiritual affairs of the church, but to a certain extent of its property also, would, if sustained, be ground for equitable relief. But the lack of ground for exercising equitable jurisdiction does not seem to have been suggested or considered in that case. In the present controversy, when the demurrer was considered, there was of course no evidence before the court. In the testimony which has since been taken, nothing appears to show that any attempt was made to divert the church property from the use to which it was originally dedicated, or to exclude the complainants or their adherents from lawful participation in congregational government. The controversy is only as to which of the parties constitute the rightful session of this particular congregation. The question of jurisdiction was not, however, pressed in the argument, and the fact that the court below dismissed the bill, after a full consideration of the merits of the controversy, makes the inquiry into the jurisdictional facts of less importance.</p>

    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[288,577,1184,188]]]'>1. Does a presbytery, regularly convened at a stated meeting, have the constitutional right to direct elders to-cease acting without citing them to appear and be heard in their own behalf?</p>
    <p id="b528-6" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[286,785,1185,406]]]'>This question has been answered in the affirmative by the general assembly, on the authority of chapter 10, section 8, form of government: “ Presbytery has power to visit particular churches .... and to order whatever pertains to their spiritual welfare.” Under this section the right of the presbytery upon its own motion to direct an elder to cease to act, was upheld, and the trial court followed the ruling. See Moore’s Digest, page 538.</p>
    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.6",528,[287,1199,1185,147]]]'>2. Had this pro re nata meeting, called for a special purpose, the legal or constitutional authority for directing the complainants to cease acting ?</p>
    <p id="b528-8" data-blocks='[["BL_528.7",528,[286,1355,1184,405]]]'>Form of government, chapter 10, section 10, after stating how a special meeting is to be called, reads as follows: “Nothing shall be transacted at such special meeting besides the particular business for which the judicatory has been thus convened.” The call for this particular meeting has two specifications, viz : first, “to receive the resignation, of the Rev. James Carter; ” second, “ to take such action as may be deemed advisable in the premises.”</p>
    <p id="b528-9" data-blocks='[["BL_528.8",528,[286,1770,1182,303]]]'>The real constitutional question is this : Was the direction of the presbytery that the session should cease acting so vitally connected with the presbytery’s action on the resignation of the Rev. James Carter as to be rightly considered a part of “ such action as may be deemed advisable in the premises ? ”</p>
    <p id="b528-10" data-blocks='[["BL_528.9",528,[285,2082,1185,359]],["BL_529.1",529,[182,364,1178,515]]]'>The synod of Pennsylvania, when dismissing the appeal of John E. Dayton and others, answers this question definitely in the affirmative, as it says : “ No parties have been aggrieved by the decision,” and “ the Presbytery acted within its constitutional rights.” The general assembly, however, did not affirm this action of the synod, but sustained the appeal of John E. Dayton and others. It failed, however, to give any <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>definite judgment on the question of the constitutionality of the action of presbytery, nor did it definitely reverse that action; it merely remanded the case to the synod of Pennsylvania and directed the synod to send the case back to the presbytery of Northumberland for reconsideration and action, without pointing out wherein the error lay. This action of the general assembly in sustaining the appeal in this peculiar way was an inadequate and unsatisfactory ruling, as the failure to pronounce clearly upon the issue involved led only to additional complaints and appeals.</p>
    <p id="b529-5" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[180,888,1179,198]]]'>But the court below, in seeking to interpret and follow the decision of the general assembly, has declared the action of the presbytery at the pro re nata meeting illegal and invalid, and the defendants have accepted this finding of the court.</p>
    <p id="b529-6" data-blocks='[["BL_529.6",529,[226,1095,874,42]]]'>Two other questions remain for consideration:</p>
    <p id="b529-7" data-blocks='[["BL_529.7",529,[178,1147,1179,147]]]'>1. Were the elections of elders at meetings held in the Church of the Covenant at the regular times, and moderated by the pastor, legal and valid ?</p>
    <p id="b529-8" data-blocks='[["BL_529.8",529,[177,1303,1179,146]]]'>2. Did the members of the old session cease to be active elders at the expiration of their terms of service, in April 1900, 1901 and 1902, or were they legally re-elected and installed?</p>
    <p id="b529-9" data-blocks='[["BL_529.9",529,[177,1459,1179,240]]]'>The complainants admit that the usual elections were held by the congregation in April of each year after two regular announcements from the pulpit at the usual place of worship. These meetings were moderated by the pastor of the church, and at them defendants were elected as elders.</p>
    <p id="b529-10" data-blocks='[["BL_529.10",529,[175,1719,1182,407]]]'>On March 27,1900, the old session attempted by a resolution to postpone the annual election of elders from the 4th day of April following, until after the meeting of the general assembly or its final decision. The meeting at which they attempted to take this action was held at the residence of one of the elders in pursuance of a notice published in a daily newspaper, and the pastor of the church was not present, one of the elders acting as moderator pro tem.</p>
    <p id="b529-11" data-blocks='[["BL_529.11",529,[174,2135,1181,306]]]'>The requirement of the form of government is express, that the pastor of the congregation shall always be the moderator of the session; except when for prudential reasons, it may appear advisable that some other minister should be invited to preside ; in which case, the pastor with the concurrence of the session, is to invite such other minister to preside.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[307,371,1187,709]]]'>
      <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>No good reason is shown why the pastor did not preside at this meeting. It was, therefore, irregular and its action was ineffective. If the pastor refuses to attend the meetings of the session or to name another minister to moderate them, the remedy is by complaint to the presbytery. Moreover, the regular annual election of elders was a matter for the congregation and was not a sessional matter at all. The government of the Presbyterian Church is republican in form, and the elders are simply the representatives of the people, to be chose'n by them in the mode most approved, and in use in that congregation. As the trial court says in its opinion, “ Every Presbyterian Church is a law unto itself in the election of elders and deacons, limited only to the qualification of the persons elected who must be male members in full communion.”</p>
    <p id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[307,1095,1189,201]]]'>There can bé no question that under the rotary or limited term system, the terms of the members of the old session as active elders were definitely fixed, and that these terms expired at the annual elections held in April, 1900, 1901 and 1902.</p>
    <p id="b530-6" data-blocks='[["BL_530.6",530,[306,1306,1194,655]]]'>The trial court was entirely correct in holding that the efforts of the old session to postpone the meeting of the congregation for the election of elders could not invalidate the regular annual elections held at the proper time and place, called and conducted according to the custom of that congregátion. He was equally right in holding that the elections held by the plaintiffs and their adherents at the Y. M. C. A. rooms were irregular and not in accordance with the custom of the church. The announcements were not made from the pulpit of the church, but in the Y. M. C. A. building. They were made not by the pastor, but by certain ministers who officiated from time to time at the meetings held in the Y. M. C. A. rooms.</p>
    <p id="b530-7" data-blocks='[["BL_530.7",530,[308,1978,1185,254]]]'>The evidence shows clearly that the real reason for holding services and meetings at the Y. M. C. A. rooms and elsewhere, was the unwillingness of the plaintiffs and their adherents to recognize and submit to the authority of the defendants as the true and legal session of the church.</p>
