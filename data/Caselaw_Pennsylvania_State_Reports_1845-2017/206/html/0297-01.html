In consideration of which the Goodyears were to locate car shops at Austin. This line was built and appears to have been connected with the plaintiff’s lines. This line was not laid in the streets of Austin, but is entirely on the lands of Goodyear. It appears from the evidence to be managed and' controlled by the Goodyears, and I do not find anything in the evidence connecting the Potter County Water Company with the transaction.</p>

It is difficult to tell why two cases should be brought and tried at great length between substantially the same parties, involving the same questions. Such practice leads to confusion more than it aids in determining either law or facts. The evidence was given in full in both cases, answers having been filed in both cases and at the last hearing it was agreed by and between the parties that the case should be decided by the court the same as though upon the final hearing of the bill' as nothing could be gained by intermediate appeal. I think the ordinance of October 16, 1897, construed with the acceptance by Mclntjue and the subsequent construction and operation of the water plant concludes the borough. It was an exercise of the right formerly in the borough, and the borough cannot disregard the contract and destroy the $40,000 invested in the water plant. I think further that the second section of the act of assembly of 1901 is unconstitutional so far as it undertakes to effect the contract then existing between the water company and the borough, and that the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction restraining the borough from constructing" a water plant either for fire or domestic service, as the ordinance, above cited, clearly applies to the one as much as the other.</p>
