    <p class="summary" id="b132-6" data-blocks='[["BL_132.5",132,[260,589,1184,1290]]]'>It is a primary rule in the construction of wills, that effect is to be given to every clause, and each is to be construed in relation to the whole. The contention on the part of defendant that testator meant to include unborn children of his son, Elijah, as beneficiaries in the trust he created, would render meaningless and nugatory that clause which provides a maintenance for the son in the event of a distribution of the estate during the latter’s life, and which is as explicit and direct as any in the will. Possibility of birth of issue, in contemplation of law, ceases only with the life of the parent; and if unborn children were to be included, it would follow necessarily that no distribution could be made in any event during Elijah’s life; whereas in the plainest way the testator has indicated a different purpose by making what he regarded a suitable provision for the maintenance of Elijah in the event of the distribution occurring before his death. The inference is irresistible that in creating the trust testator had regard to the children of his son then living, or who might be living at testator’s death, and none other. It may have been an omission or oversight not to provide for after-born children if any there might be, we cannot say; if so, it is too late to correct it now; the will as written is anything but obscure; its meaning is plain and obvious. The fact that Elijah has no other children than those who were living at testator’s death, relieves the case of all appearance of hardship and inequality.</p>

Further on, but one of these executors survived. This was the situation when, at the request of Elijah Wallace, and with the assent of the surviving executor, William <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>W. Fisher, Hastings Gehr, Esq., was appointed trustee, not however displacing the executor, but as an associate in the trust. What remained at that time to do, was (1) to invest the remainder of the personal estate, as well as the income and interest therefrom, and the rents and income from testator’s real estate; (2) out of the rents and income of the real estate to keep the real estate in repair, pay the taxes, keep it sufficiently insured, and pay over to the widow the one third of what remained yearly during her life; (3) out of the whole income to provide a suitable support and maintenance for testator’s son Elijah and his family, and a proper education for his children, leaving it to the executors to determine, in their discretion, how much of said income should in this way be expended; (4) upon the arrival at the age of twenty-one years of the youngest child of Elijah, or upon Elijah’s decease, to sell the real estate and distribute the entire estate as follows: in the latter event, to divide the same to and among the said children of Elijah, but if the conversion take place during Elijah’s life then $20,000 to be withheld from distribution, this sum to be invested by the executors in public securities, and the interest thereof, or so much as may be necessary to be expended for the support and maintenance of Elijah and his family remaining with him, and upon his death the principal sum to be divided among Elijah’s children.</p>

The entire balance of the estate, after payment of debts, etc., is given to the executors in trust, to manage, control and dispose of according to testator’s wishes as in his will declared. It is this balance, this trust estate, that we are dealing with, and with this, an administration with will annexed can have no relation whatever. “ The transfer of real property,” says Gibson, G. J., in Ross v. Barclay, <a href="/pa/18/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="969076" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0179-01">18 Pa. 179</a>, “is governed by the lex loci rei sitse : and no statute of Pennsylvania empowers an administrator with the will annexed, to execute a trust of land confided to an executor by title or by name, for any other purpose than to sell for payment of debts. By force of the act of February 24, <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>1834, relating to executors and administrators, he may execute a power to sell in order to bring the land into a course of administration but not to execute a trust for a collateral purpose; for instance to manage the property and invest the proceeds for accumulation; or to maintain the widow and children, or to turn the land into money for the convenience of partition; or to exercise any discretionary power confided to his predecessor in the' administration for his personal fitness and fidelity. For purposes purely administrative, the 13th and 14th sections give the devise of a power the effect of a devise of the title, and the 67th section puts an administrator with the will annexed on a footing with a surviving executor, but not on a footing with a testamentary trustee.” Clearly the administrator with will annexed, in the present case, is without authority to convey the real estate. Has Mr. Gehr, the acting trustee, such authority? That depends on the legal sufficiency of his appointment. Was his appointment within the power of the court? This is answered by the Act of April 9, 1849, sec. 2. It was under this act that he was appointed, and its language is explicit and unmistakable, giving to the court power to appoint a trustee in place of one of several executors, in all cases of trust where any of the executors of the will resign, die or are dismissed, whether the duties of the trust were to be executed by them by virtue of their office, or otherwise. Legally appointed and duly qualified, Mr. Gehr is invested with all the powers committed by the will to the executors, whose successor he is. Included in these is the power and duty to sell testator’s real estate, at a fixed period, which we have decided was reached when the youngest child of Elijah living at testator’s death, attained the age of twenty-one years.</p>
