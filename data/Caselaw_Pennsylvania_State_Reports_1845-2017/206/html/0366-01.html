Testimony was taken before the register and the case proceeded in, and the register filed an opinion on March 10, 1902, refusing to strike off the decree of probate of the will dated March 29, 1884.

At the date of the last will a woman giving her name as Catharine McAndrew, accompanied by Mary Queeney and William J. Lyons, appeared before P. H. Sheridan, an alderman of the city of Pittston, and at the request of the testatrix the alderman drew the paper in question. It was witnessed by Lyons and J. H. McLane, the latter being called in for that purpose and to whom the decedent was unknown. Lyons is dead but his signature was identified. After execution the paper was given by the testatrix to Mary Queeney who died January 20, 1899. After Maiy Quoeney’s death all her few belongings were taken possession of by Bridget Tigue, and among them was a bureau, one drawer of which was filled with bed sheets. For over three years the contents of this drawer were allowed to remain undisturbed, when finally its contents were taken out and examined, the alleged will dropped out and was subsequently offered for probate. Of those present at the signing of the supposed will only Mary Queeney and Lyons knew the testatrix, and both are dead, and there is no one living who can testify to the identity of the testatrix. Although Mary Queeney died eight months after the making of the will and delivery to her for safe-keeping and thirty-three months before Catharine McAndrew died, who attended the funeral of the former, yet there is no testimony showing that the testatrix ever caused any search to be made for the alleged will. It seems natural to suppose that if she had given her friend for safe-keeping so important a document as a will disposing of her entire estate, she would have instituted a search among her dead friend’s effects, or made inquiries for its recovery. Had she done so Bridget Tigue, above all persous in the world, would have known it, yet this witness denies any knowledge of the will previous to its accidental discovery three years later. The husband of the testatrix, Thomas McAn<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>drew, died December 14, 1901, before the last will was produced.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[300,470,1189,1702]]]'>Many wills are witnessed by persons not acquainted with the maker, and that sometimes when the testator signs by mark as in this case, but the attending circumstances must be such as to preclude possibility, or at least probability of fraud. The subsequent custody of the instrument, the relations of the testator and beneficiaries, truthfulness of the witnesses and inherent probability of the instrument itself are circumstances from which its genuineness must be considered. It taxes our credulity very strongly to believe the testimony offered as to the whereabouts of the alleged will. It does not bear the impress of truth or seem probable under the circumstances. The chief beneficiary claims to be a cousin of testatrix, while her own sister denies it, and states emphatically that they had never known Moughan in Ireland at the time he said he knew them, and that his testimony in many respects is false. ' The sister should know the facts, and undoubtedly told the truth. The alleged will cuts off the natural heirs of the testatrix with small bequests and leaves nearly all the estate to a stranger to her blood, who seldom visited her, and so far as the testimony shows had done nothing for her. There is no living witness to show that the maker of the will offered was Catharine McAndrew of Pringle Hill, but it is plain from the instrument itself that she is the person intended. Either Catharine McAndrew from Pringle Hill signed the paper offered or it is a forgery. It does not seem possible that - any other person could fulfill the conditions. That some one purporting to be this Catharine McAndrew did appear before Alderman Sheridan and signed the paper in question seems true from the testimony, but we are of the opinion from all the circumstances in the case that she was an impostor. To admit a will to probate resting on such testimony as this one would be to invite fraud and forgery in every case where an illiterate person died leaving only collateral heirs.</p>
