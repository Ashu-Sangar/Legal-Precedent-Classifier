    "head_matter": "Hogg\u2019s Estate.\nPartition \u2014 Title from, different ancestors \u2014 Defective return.\nIn a partition of equal undivided interests in land devised by different ancestors, a return to the order of inquest is fatally defective which values the entire real estate as that of one ancestor, when in fact the estate of that ancestor is only a two-thirds interest, and all the proceedings are had in the one estate.\nArgued May 20, 1903.\nAppeal, No. 127, Jan. T., 1903, by Edna E. Hogg, from decree of O. C. Lancaster Co., March T., 1902, No. 4, sustaining exceptions to alias inquest in partition in estate of Robert Hogg, deceased.\nBefore Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to alias inquest in partition and return.\nSmith, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nRobert Hogg devised to his son, William H. Hogg, and his granddaughter, Edna E. Hogg, each an undivided one-third interest in a farm in Colerain township. Rachel Hogg devised to each of them the undivided one half of the other undivided one third of the same farm. Thus, William and Edna each owned an undivided one-half interest in a farm, the title to which came' to them from different ancestors.\nIt will serve no purpose to recite the various steps in this somewhat protracted partition proceeding. Our attention is now directed to the alias inquest and return. While the petition for the inquest recites the wills of both Robert and Rachel Hogg, and traces the devisees\u2019 titles, it seems to contemplate a partition only of the undivided interests devised by Robert Hogg. The docket entries, as well as the indorsements on the various papers, filed, so indicate. The oi\u2019der reads: \u201c It is ordered by the court, that the high sheriff of Lancaster county, do again summon a jury, to view the said premises and make partition thereof between the heirs and legal representatives of said deceased,\u201d etc. What deceased? Robert Hogg. Return of the inquest, in these words: \u201c Appraised and valued 188 acres, more or less, (as within described,) at $39.00 per acre, amounting to $7,332.\u201d This return certainly did not imply the parting of or the appraising of several undivided interests in premises devised by different ancestors. The whole was appraised as having come from one. If the two-thirds interest devised by Robert Hogg had been specifically appraised and return thereto made, the exception might have been overruled and partition allowed as to the two-thirds interest; or if the respective interests, which came from the several ancestors, had been separately appraised and- properly distinguished in the return, an amendment might have cured the other defects. Irreconcilable inconsistencies bar the way to a confirmation of this return.\nIf it was the intention to partition the interests devised by both Robert and Rachel Hogg, it ought to have been made to so appear with particularity and the appraisement ought to have been clear and distinguishing. \u201c The return of the inquest should be free of uncertainty or ambiguity. . . . This inquest ought to have been set aside for manifest defects even had no exceptions been filed. Often the sheriff and jurors are unfamiliar with practice in the orphans\u2019 court, and with the statutes relative to partitions. The statute provides that a reasonable allowance to the attorney for the petitioners may be made and taxed as if costs, and in many districts, such at torneys furnish the inquest with proper instructions and forms \u2014a practice to be commended: \u201d Christy\u2019s Appeal, 110 Pa. 538.\nThe confirmation of the inquest and return is refused.\nThe same is set aside at the costs of the petitioner.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nB. F. Davis, for appellant.\nW. U. Eensel, with him B. Frank Kready, for appellee.\nJune 2, 1903 :"
