As the debt was not a lien on the real estate from the sale of which the fund arose, the auditor was right in disallowing the claim.\nThe decree confirming the auditor\u2019s report on this subject is affirmed.",

Knorr\n(No. 2).\nDecedent's estates \u2014 Judgment lien \u2014 Real estate \u2014 Distribution of proceeds of sale.\nA judgment obtained on an action against an executrix begun more than five years after the death of the decedent is not a lien on the decedent\u2019s real estate, and is therefore not entitled to participate in the distribution of a fund arising from the sale of such real estate.\nArgued April 14, 1908.\nAppeal, No. 345, Jan. T., 1903, by E. B. Brower, from order .of C. P. Columbia Co., dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report in case of Bowman et ah, to use of George W. Vansiclen v. Samuel Knorr.\nBefore Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown and Mesteezat, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nFrom the record it appeared that Samuel Knorr died on March 2, 1889, seized of a tract of land in Centre township. On May 22,1894, Lloyd S. Wintersteen began an action against Mary L. Knorr, executrix of Samuel Knorr, deceased, and secured a judgment for $20,167.68, which by renewals amounted on October 1, 1900 to $26,372.78. The land was sold in foreclosure proceedings on a mortgage executed by the decedent in his lifetime. J. B. Robinson, Esq., was appointed auditor to distribute the proceeds of the sale. The auditor decided that the Wintersteen judgment was not a lien, and was not entitled to participate in the fund.\nExceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were dismissed by the court.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nJohn Gr. Freeze, for appellant.\nQ. W. Miller and L. E. Waller, for appellees.\nMay 18, 1903 :"
