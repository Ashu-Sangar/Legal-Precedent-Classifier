It is not necessary, and would serve no useful purpose, to state the facts or review the evidence. After reading the printed testimony, we are not convinced of error; the issues involved were for the jury and it does not appear that there was any abuse of discretion in refusing a new trial.\nThe judgments are affirmed.",
