    <p id="ACo" data-blocks='[["BL_91.11",91,[96,827,1157,1234]]]'>This controversy arises out of the failure of the appellant, Josiah V. Thompson, to make payments to four beneficiaries under the will of Emma Messmore, deceased, of whose estate he was executor. On August 16,1926, the Orphans’ Court of Fayette County awarded certain sums of money, arising from the sale of land belonging to the estate administered by appellant, to the before mentioned legatees, appellees in this case, and directed him to make payment thereof; which awards and order were affirmed by us in Messmore’s Est., <a href="/pa/290/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="290 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1104405" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0107-01">290 Pa. 107</a>. Pending this affirmance, another order to pay was entered on December 27, 1926. Next, a rule was allowed on Thompson, “requiring him to show cause why he should not make payment”; counsel for appellant, “being then in open court,” waived actual issuance of this rule and later filed an answer (all of which will be stated more fully, and discussed, later in this opinion). On February 26, 1927, the answer was held insufficient and the rule was made absolute. Upon appellant’s continued failure to pay, after due proceedings to that end, the court below, on September 12,1927, issued an attachment for contempt, and this appeal followed.</p>

Whether or not he was served with formal notices, appellant’s cognizance of all the above orders is plain beyond question, and his actions in regard to them show him to have been fixed with sufficient notice. First, his former appeal to this court from the original decree of August 16,1926, determining the amount of his indebtedness to appellees and ordering him to pay, shows beyond question his knowledge of the court’s orders up to that time. Next, his petition to set aside the supplemental order of December 27, 1926, to pay the awards notwithstanding his pending appeal (which petition was granted and the above-mentioned rule to show cause substituted in place of the prior order), shows his knowledge of that order. Coming to the order of February, 1927, appellant not only was an accountant in the court below, subject to its directions, but, by his counsel, he also actually appeared in open court on January 12, 1927, and, with knowledge of the former orders to pay the awards then under discussion, .waived the actual issuance of a rule to show cause why he should not make such payments forthwith, thereby placing himself in the court below subject to ,all future actions of that tribunal on the rule (thus by his agreement treated as issued) or in any way connected with the object it was intended to accomplish, which was to force appellant to forthwith make payment of the amounts due appellees notwithstanding his then pending appeal from the awards to them. In fact, the object of all the proceedings supplemental to the original decree of August 16,1926, was to force Thompson to pay the awards made by that decree pending his <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>appeal therefrom. The decree was affirmed by us on May 27, 1927. When this affirmance took place, the various supplemental proceedings, including the order of February, 1927, had no further purpose, for the appeal from the original decree no longer pended and the order to pay the awards comprehended in that decree, of which order Thompson had undoubted knowledge, was in full force and effect. .He was a party to the previous appeal and must be taken to have known of its disposition, which occurred prior to the attachment for contempt now before us on the present appeal. Under these circumstances, appellant’s plea of lack of formal notice of the orders of the court below is unavailing.</p>

This contempt continued till the present attachment issued, and still persists, unless the court below erred in holding appellant’s conduct to be a contempt.

As to this, we conclude that it was entirely right for the court to dispose of the present case on the pleadings, for appellant’s averments as to his inability to pay could avail him nothing: Matter of Kurtzman, 2 N. Y. State Reporter 655. The court below knew that the alleged inability to pay was occasioned by a misuse of funds; for that there was such a misuse had in effect been adjudicated as a matter of law: Messmore’s Est., <a href="/pa/290/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="290 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1104405" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0107-01">290 Pa. 107</a>, 116.

Although not charged with fraud arising malo animo, appellant is guilty of maladministration of trust funds, and this is a species of fraud; he is, therefore, not in the position of one who pleads inability to pay because of poverty which came upon him through no fault of his own. The law is not lenient to those in the position of appellant; we said in Com. ex rel. Di Giacomo v. Heston, <a href="/pa/292/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="292 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="1109682" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0063-01">292 Pa. 63</a>, 68, that “a trustee, who fails to pay over the funds entrusted to his care, is subject to attachment for contempt, as is an executor (Tome’s App., <a href="/pa/50/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="50 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="425143" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0285-01">50 Pa. 285</a>) or guardian: Leiter’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.N.C.%20225" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="10 W.N.C. 225">10 W.

It is well stated in 13 Corpus Juris 20 that, “When the inability [to pay] is due to the wrongful act of the party himself, the contempt is not excused, as where he has misapplied or misappropriated funds held by him as attorney, administrator, receiver, guardian, or in other trust capacity.” This principle is well settled; see Hoffman’s <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>Est., <a href="/pa-super/10/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="10 Pa.

Superior Ct. 290</a>, where it was held that a person attached for contempt for not paying over trust moneys could not purge himself by alleging poverty, the court saying, at page 295, “The mere answer of a trustee that he has wrongfully wasted or otherwise stripped himself of the trust fund may not stay the arm of a chancellor when the day for accounting has arrived, else indeed would his decree be but an empty name, and breaches of trust would become common by reason of their immunity from any dangerous consequences.”</p>

There, where an executor had failed to comply with a decree to pay over moneys, and sought to avoid contempt proceedings by alleging his inability to pay, it appearing that his inability was occasioned by his having lost the money in personal transactions to which he had, — in breach of his trust, — appropriated the funds of the estate, it was held that his poverty was no excuse.
