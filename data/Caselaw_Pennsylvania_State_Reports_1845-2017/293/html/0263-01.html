Before the exceptions were argued or disposed of, plaintiff presented a petition for a declaratory judgment to determine the right of accountants to be allowed the credit just mentioned. The court below entered a declaratory judgment sustaining the exception in question. It is from this judgment that the present appeal is taken, pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act of June 18,1923, P. L. 840.</p>

This principle is applicable to the present case; for here an appropriate remedy was being pursued in the court below, and there was no occasion for a declaratory judgment.
