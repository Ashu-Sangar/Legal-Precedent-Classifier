The rule is thus expressed in the earlier decision, at pages 297, 298: “The manifest import and meaning of the language used is that it should be satisfactory to him.......He did not agree to accept what might be satisfactory to others but what was satisfactory to himself. This was a fact which the contract gave him the right to decide.......[But] to justify a refusal to accept......on the ground that it is not satisfactory, the objection should be made in good faith. It must not be merely capricious.”</p>
