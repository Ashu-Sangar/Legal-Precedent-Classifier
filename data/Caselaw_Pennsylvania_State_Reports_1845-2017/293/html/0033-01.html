The sale thereof took place on the 25th to 28th days of the same month inclusive. Meantime on January 24th, another judgment was entered and execution issued against the same defendant. The writs of execution were all returnable to the first Monday in March, 1927. On January 29, 1927, the sheriff, on receipt of a sufficient bond of indemnity, paid the net proceeds of the sale to the attorneys of the execution creditors, by check on the First National Bank of Indiana, Pa., which was presented to the bank and paid February 5th. That Walker was insolvent was known to the sheriff and the execution creditors, prior to the sale above mentioned, and on February 1st, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against him in the proper United States Court and a restraining order, forbidding the disposal of the fund in suit, issued out of said court, was served on the sheriff and execution creditors on February 4th. Tbe sheriff could then have stopped payment on the check <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>but did not do so. On March 28,1927, Walker was duly adjudged a bankrupt and Howard D. Creps was appointed trustee in bankruptcy of his estate. In May following, the trustee petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Indiana County for an order on the sheriff to turn over to him the net proceeds of the sheriff’s sale, to which an answer was filed and testimony taken. Upon a finding of the facts, inter alia, as above stated, the court granted the prayer of the trustee and therefrom the sheriff brought this appeal.</p>

The purchasers of the Walker property at the sale were presumably bona fide and acquired a good title, but the proceeds took the place of the property and became a part of the Walker Estate, in which all the creditors were entitled to share. Under the existing facts it was the plain duty of the sheriff to retain the fund to answer the demand of the trustee in bankruptcy, who, on qualifying as such, was entitled to its possession. Section 67, clause f of the Federal Bankruptcy Act (U. S. Compiled Statutes Annotated, vol. 9, p. 11,636) provides, inter alia: “That all levies, judgments, attachments, or other liens, obtained through legal proceedings against <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>a person who is insolvent, at any time within four months prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him, shall be deemed null and void in case he is adjudged a bankrupt, and the property affected by the levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien shall be deemed wholly discharged and released from the same, and shall pass to the trustee as a part of the estate of the bankrupt.” Because of this act the judgment creditors in the instant case acquired no preference and the title to the fund raised by the sheriff’s sale vested in the trustee: Clarke v.
