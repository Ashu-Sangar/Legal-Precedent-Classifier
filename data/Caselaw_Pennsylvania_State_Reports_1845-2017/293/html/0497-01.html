His nominees accepted the offices specified, but subsequently one of the trustees resigned, and the rest of them, acting under a power contained in the will, appointed another in his place. The trustee who had resigned then sought and obtained from the executor, with the consent of the trustees, an option, without paying any consideration for it, to purchase the estate’s interest in certain oil properties in Oklahoma, for the sum of $1,800,000. Subsequently, upon payment of $25,000, he obtained an extension of the option; before its expiration he paid the amount agreed upon and received an assignment of the interest. <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>The executor then filed his account, charging himself, inter alia* with the $1,800,000.

Regarding them, the court in banc said “there is no evidence or implication of disqualification or lack of ability or integrity on the part of any of the names suggested.” No others were proposed by the representatives of the remaining actual or possible beneficiaries; but one of the latter, who was a minor in esse, at that time had no one to represent him. The auditing judge did not appoint any of those named, but, on the contrary, selected a bank, of which the executor who had also been trustee was president, and three individuals.

On the contrary, the section seems to recognize this practice, for it provides that the application for the appointment must be by a party in interest, and that notice must be given to all who are interested “so far as such notice can reasonably be given.” We have said, as the legislature is presumed to know, that the tenants for life are “entitled to have [their] interests considered from a friendly and beneficial point of view” (Myers’s Est., supra, III), and the remaindermen are justified in asking for trustees who will not “rack the property for present income at the expense of the inheritance”: Ibid. 115. In emergency cases (section 53, c) an appointment may be made “on the ex parte petition of any creditor or party inter<a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>ested,” without requiring such notice to be given. Contrasting these situations with one like the present, it should not be difficult to determine what was the probable reason for inserting the statutory requirement that, in the latter, actual notice must be given to all parties interested. A reasonable conclusion is that in such cases it was intended “all parties interested” should at least be heard on the question of the appointments to be made. It can hardly be that the provision was simply intended to give them an opportunity to object to those whom the judge proposes to appoint, for if, as the majority state, the court’s discretion is not controllable, it may designate them, as was done in the present instance, without previously disclosing who they are to be; and if names are proposed by the court the parties in interest would probably hesitate to object to those who are thus foreordained to be their trustees, unless they can prove not merely incompatability, but, at least, gross incompetency. They ought not to be put in such a position. Nor was the requirement of notice presumably adopted merely that the court might be advised whom the parties in interest desired, for no statute was needed for such a purpose, and they would naturally be loath to suggest as trustees those who may be turned down without rhyme or reason. It may be said that no self-respecting judge will do this, but a system is bad if one who seeks to control appointments for personal reasons may so act.</p>

The dissenting opinion well says: “The court’s duty is to supervise the preservation and distribution of the trust property. It would be difficult to calculate how many children have appeared before this court in the half century of its existence who were above the age of fou?<a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>teen years [as the present minors are] and selected their own guardians under the supervision of the court. The common law of England gave young people the right and it is now statutory. Not only this; by statute a preference is given to members of families in the grant of letters, and the whole trend of legislation and judicial decision has been to recognize the members of the family and, in so far as it is possible, to let them manage their own affairs. These children were willing to accept the terms of their father’s will when they submitted their choice of trustees. No reason has been given for not appointing them, and I know of none.”</p>

What we decide is that the course pursued in making the present appointments was wrong. All the parties in interest, present and prospective, are entitled to suggest the names of those whom they prefer for trustees, and therefrom the court should select, if of opinion they are thoroughly fit, a sufficient number who are not unfriendly to the life tenants, and yet will not permit anything to interfere with their duty to preserve the principal intact for the benefit of the remaindermen. In making its selections and rejections from the lists presented by the parties in interest, the court is not obliged to place on record its reasons therefor ; necessarily a large discretion must be vested in it, for not otherwise can there be a wise independent determination of the question as to the persons or institutions best qualified to care for the estate, for the benefit not of some but of all the interests concerned. Any other conclusion than that above stated would not only antagonize the unbroken practice referred to, but might also result in the appointment of a trustee whom <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>the judge believes to be personally competent, but whom the parties in interest not unreasonably view with doubt and suspicion. This, indeed, was the situation here, where the chief executive officer of a bank resigned because of actual or apparent negligence in the performance of his duties, and yet the bank itself was appointed as his successor. Under the cases above cited this was error, and to them may be added Lafferty’s Est., <a href="/pa/198/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="198 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="920362" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0433-01">198 Pa. 433</a>.</p>

The daughters, whose shares are also directed to be held upon separate use trusts, are given the income for life, with remainder, as to it, to their children until the latter reach twenty-one years of age, when the principal is to be paid to them. A codicil authorizes the trustees, in case of need, to give a portion of the principal to the daughters.</p>

They are all given to those who were in being when testator died, and the rule only applies to contingent gifts which are to take effect beyond a life or lives in being and twenty-one years thereafter: Lilley’s Est., <a href="/pa/272/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="272 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1068386" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0143-01">272 Pa. 143</a>; Gageby’s Est., <a href="/pa/293/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="293 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1111110" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0109-01">293 Pa. 109</a>; Fenney’s Est., <a href="/pa/293/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="293 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1111143" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0273-01">293 Pa. 273</a>. If, in fixing the time of these payments, testator had simply adopted a term of years, without reference to any life in being, they would probably have been held void (Johnston’s Est., <a href="/pa/185/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="185 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="898030" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0179-01">185 Pa. 179</a>, 184; Linck v.

This being so, they should be treated accordingly, and the application of the rule to a status not <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>now existing should be determined, as in other matters, when it becomes necessary so to do and not before then, unless it appears that the dominant purpose of the will was to tie up the estate beyond the time allowed by law. A number of cases so hold, but this matter has been considered so fully in Feeney’s Est., <a href="/pa/293/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="293 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1111143" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0273-01">293 Pa. 273</a>,— where the life estates were held bad also, because testator’s paramount purpose was to control the disposition of his property beyond \he time allowed by the rule,— that we may be excused from more than restating the principle.</p>

This is made so clear from the résumé of his testamentary provisions above set forth, that we find it difficult even to imagine how he could have done anything else to more certainly show that his paramount purpose was to protect his children and make their future financially secure, unless he had expressly so stated. That purpose is not obscured by the fact that he was not able to learnedly reason regarding the rules against perpetuities and accumulations, vested and contingent remainders, executory devises and the other abstruse questions dwelt upon in the varying opinions of the court below and in the briefs of the respective counsel. His dominant purpose is made absolutely clear by the language of his will, whether or not his gifts in remainder are sustainable, and that is all we are concerned with at the present time. If it appeared that the striking down of the void gifts, would, in vital matters, so emasculate his plan of distribution, as to render it reasonably certain he would not have made the will in the way he did had he known it could not be sustained in the respects in which it must be set aside (Johnston’s Est., supra), this question <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>would be of importance. So far as concerns tbe gifts to tbe children, this is not so, however; whether or not that principle will be applicable to the remainder estates when they are being distributed, will be determined when that time arrives.</p>
