L. 840,.wherein the executor of the will of Andrew Kidd, as also executor of Isabella, his wife, seeks to have determined what interests, if any, their two surviving daughters took in the real estate of which the former died seized. The petitioner claims that, as executor of Mrs. Kidd, he may convey the property in question, as the testatrix acquired a fee simple estate under the terms of the husband’s will, and that, under the powers conferred by her last testament, he is authorized to make sale of the same. The two children, respondents, deny the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>existence of any such right, insisting that their mother’s interest was one for life only.

If he thereby devised to his wife-a fee simple estate, her executor is expressly granted the authority to sell, now sought to be exercised. By the second paragraph he directed: “I devise and bequeath to my beloved wife all my real estate and personal property remaining after my just debts are fully satisfied to hold and enjoy as she thinks best as long as she remains my widow, and to dispose of at her death among the children, as she thinks best except as follows.” In subsequent paragraphs he gave certain legacies to grandchildren, and these were held by Judge Trimble, in a concurring opinion below, to be charges on the absolute estate granted Mrs. Kidd. Counsel for the appellee agreed at the argument this was the proper construction, if a fee was given, and it will be so regarded by us in disposing of the question involved.</p>

It is true that no words of inheritance were used, but this was not necessary under the Act of April 18, 1833, section 9, P. L. 250, now supplied by the Act of June 7, 1917, section 12, P. L. 403, which provides that “all devises of real estate shall pass the whole estate of the testator in the premises devised, although there be no words of inheritance or of perpetuity, unless it appear by a devise over, or by words of limitation or otherwise in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate.” The omission of such words cannot be construed as indicating a lack of intent to give an absolute interest: Cross v.

It is further to be noticed that, subject to certain qualifications which will be later referred to, all of the estate was given to the wife for her use and enjoyment “except” as to certain legacies which were made charges thereon, indicating that the testator had in mind that, by the words preceding, he had made an actual bestowal of his property: Brown’s Est., <a href="/pa/289/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="289 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1103356" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0101-01">289 Pa. 101</a>.</p>

It will be noticed that there is no grant of the remainder over to be found in the will, but only the request that what is left of the estate when she dies? — for by apt words she had previously been given the right to consume, — be given to the children. What was said in Good v. Fichthorn, <a href="/pa/144/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="144 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="823792" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0287-01">144 Pa. 287</a>, 293, where the testator “enjoined and directed” the devisee to make certain disposition of his property, applies here: “The testator gave an absolute fee, with express powers to consume or convey. [In the case before us the words used were the equivalent.] He did not devise the unconsumed residue himself, but desired his wife to do so. He put <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>his request in strong words, ordinarily importing command, but so used as to indicate only an intent, not to reduce the estate previously given, but to control one of its incidents. Where that is the intent, no words, however strong, amount to more than a request which cannot be enforced by law.”</p>
    <p id="b53-5" data-blocks='[["BL_53.5",53,[70,673,1159,1026]]]'>The husband expressed a desire that his wife give the part remaining to the children “as she thinks best.” These words must be considered as precatory only, and do not establish an intention to reduce the fee previously given. Such was the conclusion reached where similar language was considered in Boyle v. Boyle, <a href="/pa/152/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="152 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="838106" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0108-01">152 Pa. 108</a>, an authority controlling the present situation. Mere indication of wish as to the ultimate disposition, and request that it be so made, will not cut down the estate already devised: Miller v. Stubbs, <a href="/pa/244/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="244 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1003434" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0482-01">244 Pa. 482</a>; Smith v. Bloomington Coal Co., supra; Miller v. Cross, <a href="/pa/290/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="290 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1104407" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0213-01">supra.</a> If there had been an express direction that all of the unconsumed property remaining at the death of the one named should pass to others, then the rule of Stanton v. Guest, <a href="/pa/285/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="285 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1095070" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0460-01">285 Pa. 460</a>, and earlier authorities holding likewise, and cited by appellants, would apply, but they cannot control in construing a devise couched in the language found in paragraph two of testator’s will.</p>

The interest acquired passed by her will, by the terms of which the executor was given the power to sell, as now proposed, and he is in position to convey without the joinder or consent of the two surviving children, who are appellants here.</p>
