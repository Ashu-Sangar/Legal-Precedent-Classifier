Finally, he provided that, “in the event of both......children dying without issue,” the property was to go to certain named beneficiaries.</p>

The daughter, who is of full age, married and has two children, claiming that the trust should no longer legally continue, demanded that the trustees turn over the fund to her. The trustees answered that they did not deem it wise and prudent, or for the best interest of the petitioner, “to turn over to her said estate other than the interest thereof for her maintenance”’ which they declared was being regularly done. The trustees averred also that, if the corpus were turned over- to the petitioner, “the same would, in every likelihood, he dissipated and lost.”</p>
