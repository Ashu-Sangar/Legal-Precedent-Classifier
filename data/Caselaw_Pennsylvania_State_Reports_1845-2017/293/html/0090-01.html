As the parties concede that the first lessees continued to be bound by the lease, this attempted substitution is unimportant. The assignment of the lease and the acceptance of rent from an assignee does not relieve the original lessee from liability: Ghegan v.

Counsel for the receivers notified the lessors that the premises would be surrendered on the first day of May, 1921, when the lease had two years to run. All property of the lessee was removed. The lessors subsequently relet the premises to several tenants for rentals that were less than that called for in appellants’ lease. In the last lease, an option was given to the lessees to continue the term for two years beyond that called for in appellees’ lease. It also contained a covenant relative to the heating of a part of the premises, but, even if this sum should be included as rent, all amounts re<a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>ceived by the lessor did not equal the amount called for in the original lease.</p>

A surrender is the yielding up of an estate for years to him who has the immediate reversion, and the effect is to pass the estate of the tenant to the landlord, extinguishing the rent reserved: Milling v. Becker, <a href="/pa/96/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="96 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="494590" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0182-01">96 Pa. 182</a>, 185. Surrender is a contractual act, and it occurs only through the consent of both parties, evidenced by an express agreement or unequivocal act of the parties which implies that they have agreed to consider the surrender as being made: Felker v. Richardson, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.%20830" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="32 A. 830">32 Atl. 830</a>, 831, <a href="/nh/67/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="67 N.H. 509" data-case-ids="1801593" data-case-paths="/nh/67/0509-01">67 N. H. 509</a>, 510. Where assent has been given orally or in writing, no question can arise. The dispute occurs over the acts of the landlord as evidencing assent to the abandonment or a surrender of demised premises by implication of law. To show it there must be evidence of acts so inconsistent with the terms of the first lease that the relation of landlord and tenant, established by the reletting, could not be enforced under the terms of the first lease. Such acts would indicate as a logical and reasonably necessary result that the lessor intended to accept the surrender tendered by the lessees : Whitcomb v. Brant, <a href="/njl/90/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="90 N.J.L. 245" data-case-ids="238838" data-case-paths="/njl/90/0245-01">90 N. J.

These acts must be distinguished from acts of the landlord in protection of the property after an attempted surrender. The burden of showing such acceptance is on the lessee: (Auer v.

The privity of estate, which is part of the completed legal relation of landlord and tenant, is divested when the lessee quits the premises. If the landlord refuses to accept the surrender offered, the privity established by the contract is not terminated. The liability to, pay rent is based on the covenants therein. The landlord, under his common law right, for the protection of the demised premises, has a legal right to enter. On this theory he could permit the premises to remain idle and recover for the balance of the entire term: 16 R. C. L. 969, section 431. Reletting, is not imposed on a landlord as a duty (Auer v.

Bouve, Crawford &amp; Co., supra. Nevertheless, a landlord should be reasonably diligent in securing a desirable tenant for the best rent obtainable to minimize the first lessee’s loss: In re Mullings Clothing Co., supra. Re-letting does not invade the covenants by which lessee was bound, unless it exceeds or is so inconsistent with them that the two leases could not stand together. Re-letting within those covenants is merely the administration of an abandoned estate. When it is done, the landlord should not be held to have accepted the abandon<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>ment merely because he does not notify the lessee that the reletting is for his benefit. Lessees must respond to a liability arising from the covenant of the lease. An act done to minimize that liability does not discharge the lessee from that covenant.</p>

This right was not hostile to the terms of the first lease. Moreover, it was for the benefit of the lessee, as the tenant, in all probability, could not have been procured without this extension. Had the lease disregarded the first lease and created a term extending beyond that in the original lease, it would indicate an intention to accept the abandonment: Rafferty v.
