They were brought in August, 1924, on account of an accident which happened in September, 1923. Section 23 of the Practice Act of May 14,1915, P. L. 483, provides (p. 487) : “The courts of common pleas shall make such rules as they deem advisable for the proper enforcement of this act.” Pursuant thereto the Court of Common Pleas of Bedford County adopted a rule which provides, inter alia: “In actions of assumpsit and trespass....... brought in the court of common pleas......, if the •plaintiff’s statement be not served upon the defendant and filed with the praecipe, it shall be served upon the <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>defendant and filed, in accordance with the Practice Act of 1915, within sixty (60) days from the date of the issuance of the writ of summons.

Uhl and on May 12, 1926, like action was taken in the suit against the defendant Henrietta Uhl, who was abroad when the first writ was issued. Thereafter, on December 21, 1926, plaintiff in each case filed a petition to strike off the judgment of non pros. After answers were filed and testimony taken, the trial eourt, upon due consideration, refused the petitions ; therefrom plaintiff brought these appeals.</p>

Here the appeals also fail, for no valid excuse was offered. Courts are prone to grant relief where the default results from the mistake or oversight of counsel, but its refusal here was fully justified. Plaintiff was represented of record by two attorneys — one a resident of York and the other of Bedford County — both presumed to know the court rules where they sought to practice, and the latter making no pretense that he did not. Moreover, defendants exhibited no undue haste, for prior to entering the non pros in either case their attorney repeatedly called the attention of plaintiff’s local counsel to the matter and suggested the filing of statements. These suggestions were as often made known to the counsel at York (the original attorney for plaintiff and familiar with the facts) with urgent requests that he either forward to the local counsel the statements, or the necessary data from which they could be prepared. These requests were ignored and the excuse given by the attorney at York is that he was ignorant of the sixty-day rule in Bedford County and had sickness in his family, — neither sufficient. There is also the suggestion that meantime there were some unsuccessful negotiations with Mr. Uhl?s insurance carrier, looking to an adjustment, which, of course, would not prejudice the defendants. If for such unsubstantial reasons a salutary rule of court could be set at nought, it would be useless, and a defendant would be unable to protect himself from intolerable delays.

There the summons was issued and served on July 26th, returnable to the first Monday in September and the judgment for want of an affidavit of defense was entered nineteen days after the writ issued. The defendant’s petition to open the judgment, accompanied by a sufficient affidavit of defense, was presented within six days and it was shown that the default resulted from the oversight of counsel, who was away on his vacation, relying on the unwritten rule of the local bar association that judgment by default would not be taken at that season, and also being of the opinion that judgment could not be taken against the defendant prior to the return day of the writ. Under such circumstances we held the trial court should have opened the judgment. But neither the facts of that case, nor anything there said, gives countenance to appellant’s contention here.</p>
