Although he failed to board the car, his hand <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>remained on its floor and was 'caught between the floor and the archway at the top of the entrance door, as the car continued to ascend, inflicting on the young man’s hand the injury here complained of. The lower court granted a nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off and this appeal followed.</p>

He could, easily have avoided injury by removing his hand; this any prudent person would have done. His failure to do so was gross negligence on Ms part. The trial judge based the nonsuit (1) on failure of the testimony to show negligence on part of defendants and (2) on the contributory negligence of plaintiff. In both findings he was clearly sustained by the evidence and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>
