In the present instance, not only was the trustee, who is to take the remainder, given a vested legal estate, but also, since the trust is limited to the life of appellant and her children, if any, all of whom must die at some time or times, the remainder gift to the charity necessarily depended on a certainty and not on a contingency, and hence the equitable estate was also vested: Packer’s Est.

It is a matter of no moment that a too literal reading of the will might lead to the conclusion that the charity is actually given the remainder- only after the precedent life estates end, for a more careful examination shows that the particular clause of the will being considered only postpones the delivery of possession by the trustee which holds the legal title, and not the actual'gift by testatrix; which postponement, is, moreover, for the purpose of letting in the possible interest of the unborn grandchildren, and hence does not operate to defer the vesting: Marshall’s Est., <a href="/pa/262/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="262 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1044445" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0145-01">262 Pa. 145</a>, 149; Groninger’s Est., <a href="/pa/268/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="268 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1061559" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0184-01">268 Pa. 184</a>.

In Ledwith v. Hurst, <a href="/pa/284/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="284 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="1092036" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0094-01">supra,</a> the will, as we construed it (page 98), gave the precedent estate not only to the daughter and her “children for life, but also to her descendants without limit, and [only] in the event of their final extinction, [an uncertain fact, did it] create a perpetual trust” for the charities designated.</p>
    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[303,1003,1153,1459]],["BL_141.1",141,[84,349,1153,142]]]'>It is next argued that the charitable gift wholly failed, because, while the will provided that the remainder was “given to the trustees of the Jacob Pend Home, the purposes and object of which are fully and specifically set forth in the last joint will and testament” of testatrix and her sister, no such corporation existed, the joint will referred to was not produced, and “the purposes and object” expressed in it, were not properly proved. To this also we cannot agree. It was clearly shown that there had been, and perhaps there still is, such a will in existence, but that it had been mislaid by the Johnstown Trust Company, to whose custody it had been committed. Its contents were proved by testatrix’s surviving sister, the other party to it, by an official of the trust company, in whose care it had been left, and by a joint deed executed by testatrix and her sister, which declared the same trusts, and had attached to it the draft of an application for a charter for “The Jacob Pend Home,” setting forth at length the purposes and objects of the charity. Unless," therefore, we should hold, as we certainly cannot do, that the trust company’s mislaying of the joint will must result in wholly defeating the present testamentary disposition, we could not sustain the present contention. It being clear, therefore, that the charitable bequest is not void for uncertainty,, and that the object of the trust is legally ascertainable, the gift will be sustained as against any attack <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>by appellant, who claims tbe estate as next of kin only: Hunter’s Est., <a href="/pa/279/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="279 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1083575" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0349-01">279 Pa. 349</a>; Kortright’s Est.

    <p id="b141-5" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[79,513,1158,1902]],["BL_142.1",142,[285,347,1151,1016]]]'>The final question presented for our consideration is whether or not the requirement of section 6 of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, 406, has been complied with, in so far as it provides that a will, in order to be valid as respects a charitable gift contained in it, must be “attested by two credible, and, at the time, disinterested witnesses.” It appeared that one of the two attesting witnesses was a stockholder, treasurer and trust officer of the Johnstown Trust Company, the trustee named in the will for the life estates which preceded the charitable gift in remainder. Admittedly this alone would be a matter of no importance: Baughman’s Est., <a href="/pa/281/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="281 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1086979" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0023-01">281 Pa. 23</a>. It is alleged, however, that the trust company is more than a mere trustee of the life estates, because the draft of the proposed charter of the Jacob Fend Home provides that three of the five primary directors of the charity “shall be reputable business men, and officers and directors of the Johnstown Trust Company, and the other two chosen by these three.” It is not probable that this clause will be construed as appellant claims, namely that each of these three first directors must be reputable business men who are also directors and officers of the trust company. A better interpretation would seem to be that they must be chosen from a class consisting of “reputable business men and officers and directors” of the company. Even though we were to conclude otherwise, however, appellant would not be helped. In addition to the foregoing quotation, section 6 of-the Wills Act, supra, further provides that “a disinterested witness, within the meaning of this section, is a witness not interested in such religious or charitable use.” The witness here objected to may never become a director in the charity, he certainly was not “at the time” of attestation, for the charity was not then incorporated. Nor is he interested in his capacity as a <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>stockholder and officer of the trust company, for the obvious reason that “at the time” of his attestation it was not an interested party. The fact that three of its officers and directors may, in the future, become directors of the charity, cannot give to it a present legal interest, even if it be imagined that it may then have some kind of an interest. Moreover, the interest, whether of the subscribing witness or of the trustee, if it is to effect the present question, must be in the “nature of a direct property right in the testamentary fund, or [have] such an immediate, certain, close and intimate connection with the legacy as leads to the inevitable conclusion that the witness [or the trustee] will pecuniarily profit by the legacy......[which connection must have existed] at the time of the execution and attestation of the will”: Channon’s Est., <a href="/pa/266/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="266 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1056077" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0417-01">266 Pa. 417</a>, 424; Darlington’s Est., <a href="/pa/289/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="289 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1103302" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0297-01">289 Pa. 297</a>. No such interest appears in this case. Certainly that asserted here falls far short of being of such a character.</p>
