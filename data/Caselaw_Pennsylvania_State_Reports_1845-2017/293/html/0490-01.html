Here, the will not only lacks an indication that the word “heirs” was meant in other than its legal sense, but followed as it is by the expression “or legal representatives,” these latter words reinforce the presumption, flowing from the use of the technical word “heirs,” that testator intended the ancestor of such heirs as a source of inheritable succession, the heirs representing by succession their ancestor, the first devisee.</p>

Lyman a fee in the land, then [the] provision [containing them] ......could have been omitted entirely from the will, in so far as it is taken as expressing any purpose on the part of the testator.” The answer to this position is: The same thing might be said of every devise to a man and his heirs, — that, unless the “heirs” were treated as purchasers, the word could be eliminated “so far as expressing any purpose on the part of the testator.” But, as already suggested and as held in the authorities, the purpose expressed by such words as are here used is that testator intends the first devisee, even though named by him as a life tenant (Grimes v. Shirk, <a href="/pa/169/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="169 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="870643" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0074-01">169 Pa. 74</a>, 89), to take as a source of inheritable succession; and, under <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>the rule in Shelley’s Case, the expression of such a purpose creates a fee. This rule, as said in Bassett v. Hawk, <a href="/pa/118/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="118 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="556741" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0094-01">118 Pa. 94</a>, 107, is “so thoroughly fixed in our law, and upon it depends so many valuable land titles, that it would be a very serious breach of our judicial duty to even hesitate to enforce it.” The court below concluded that the testamentary clause before us expressed an intention that those who may hereafter be ascertained to be the heirs of William L. Lyman should take a remainder directly from the testator, and that Lyman himself possessed only a life estate, having previously inserted in its opinion the following excerpt from Stout v. Good, <a href="/pa/245/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="245 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="326013" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0383-01">supra:</a> “If the words of the will show that the testator intended the remainderman to take directly from him and not by inheritance from the devisee of the life estate, then the rule [in Shelley’s Case] has no application (Kemp v.

Both the particular devise there before the court for construction and other parts of the will showed testator’s intention not to give a fee to ¿he individual named as life tenant, and that, at the end of the life estate, the remainder should pass directly from testator to a designated class; the words of devise and the will as a whole were essentially different from those, now before us. Under the present will, the heirs of the first named devisee are to take simply because they are such heirs; in other words, as representing the next in the line of inheritance, or, in that sense, as the natural inheritors of property given to the particular devisee. Designation as such natural inheritors is what is meant by the expression “inheritance from the devisee of the life estate,” used in <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>Stout v. Good, <a href="/pa/245/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="245 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="326013" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0383-01">245 Pa. 383</a>, 387, and quoted above at tbe end of the immediately preceding paragraph. Before a “devise to one and his heirs” is removed from the rule in Shelley’s Case, on the ground that the heirs take directly from testator, they must take independently of the, fact that they are heirs of the person named as life tenant; that is to say, it must affirmatively appear that the words “heirs” was used simply as a convenient way of designating testator’s ultimate devisees, and it must not appear, as here, that he treated the first devisee as a source of inheritable succession: Shapley v. Diehl, <a href="/pa/203/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="203 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="994757" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0566-01">203 Pa. 566</a>. In the Laurer Case, — also cited in Stout v. Good, — because the testator made it plain that he intended the first devisee, named as a life tenant, to be a source of inheritable succession, even though he in plain words added that “in no event whatever shall the fee simple......vest” in such devisee, we nevertheless held that the devisee took a fee simple under the rule in Shelley’s Case.</p>
