A verdict was rendered in his favor, upon which judgment was entered, and this appeal followed. The only assignments of error referred to in the statement of questions involved, and pressed on argument, relate, to the admission of the testimony of one Krantz, who gave evidence as to the earning capacity of plaintiff, and to this complaint alone reference need be made in disposing of the present controversy.</p>

He testified that his rate of pay in the various cities where exhibitions were held was usually fixed by contract, or special arrangement with the houses where he was employed. His average earnings, after paying his assistants, amounted to $200 a week, and net compensation of this amount had been earned by him for a considerable period of time.</p>

He had known McCullough for several years, and was acquainted with the character of work performed by him, and on at least two occasions had seen his exhibition. He was permitted to testify as to the rate of pay usually earned by magicians, giving performances similar to that of plaintiff, in cities of the approximate size of New Castle, the latter having stated that the compensation received in communities of like population was the average sum received by him. He testified that though performers of the character of plaintiff were usually hired on a contract basis, yet there was a general market price in the theatrical profession for such acts as supplied by him, and that the minimum compensation in cities comparable to the one mentioned would be $350 for three days and $600 for a full week. From this amount the cost of assistants and other expenses, already fixed by McCullough, must be deducted. The offer of this evidence was objected to on the ground that all of the towns in which plaintiff appeared were not of the same size as New Castle, some being larger and others smaller, and, further, because of the limited number of times in which the witness had seen plaintiff perform.</p>

There was a market value for the services such as he supplied. Krantz was in position to testify to the amount paid for similar work in theaters located in cities of the size of New Castle, and other testimony showed that the plaintiff exhibited usually in places having approximately the same population.

    <p id="b76-5" data-blocks='[["BL_76.6",76,[264,1857,1154,537]],["BL_77.1",77,[88,348,1159,1246]]]'>An additional assignment was filed at the argument with leave of court. It is based on an objection to a question which was subsequently withdrawn. Assuming the matter is before us on proper exception, the complaint is without merit. It is urged that, since it appeared the pay for employment, of the character furnished by plaintiff, was customarily fixed by special contract, therefore evidence as to market value of such services was not admissible. This was not a suit upon a contract, nor is it averred that the arrangements, made <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>from time to time, had been reduced to writing, but merely that an agreement as to pay was made at each place where the performance was held. “Evidence relating to a matter which does not form the foundation of action or defense, but is collateral to the issue, does not properly fall within the best evidence rule, and, although secondary in its character, cannot be excluded on the ground that primary evidence is obtainable”: 22 C. J. 978. “The rule that excludes secondary evidence in a contest with primary, does not mean that everything is secondary which is not of the highest grade of proof, but only that which discloses the existence of other evidence, the nonproduction of which may be supposed to be on the ground that if produced would work against the party offering it”: Exrs. of Shoenberger v.

The testimony did not show that there were written contracts fixing compensation for performances, but merely that special arrangements were made before each exhibition, a course customarily followed where any professional employment is undertaken. This practice did not render incompetent the testimony of Krantz as to the general market value, and the additional assignment filed is also overruled.</p>
