During the period involved in the present controversy its capital stock has consisted of 12,500 shares, having a par value of $100 each, with an actual worth of $553. It made returns from year to year to the auditor general <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>
      <em>for taxation </em>purposes, and had paid at the rate of ten mills on the par value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1925, as permitted by the Act of 1897 (July 15th, P. L. 292), making its settlement prior to March 1st, thus securing exemption from local taxation. The statute referred to followed the plan of those preceding in authorizing alternative methods to determine the amount of liability. Thus, the Act of June 8, 1891 (P. L. 229), provided for payment of eight mills on the par value of bank stock, if paid prior to March 1st of each year, in which case exemption from local taxation followed, or, in lieu thereof, a tax of four mills was placed on the actual value in the hands of the holders.</p>
    <p id="b433-3" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[110,1040,1157,1345]]]'>The Act of 1897 increased the levy where based on par, but permitted the selection of similar options. It directed an annual statement to be filed at the same time (June 20th in each year), making the tax payable at four mills on actual value if paid forty days thereafter; or, secondly, permitted the payment before March 1st at the same rate on actual value, in which case exemption from local tax was given, and, thirdly, if paid before the same date, on the basis of ten mills on par value, with like exemption. All three methods are designated in the same section, the second being preceded with the phrase “provided further,” and the third with the word “except,” but the clear intention was to provide distinct ways of satisfying the annual liability to the Commonwealth, either one of which could be taken advantage of. As was said by this court, in discussing the Act of 1907 (June 13th, P. L. 640), relating to trust companies; “This act [of 1891] provided alternative methods of levying a tax on bank shares,” and the later act (of 1897), remedial in character, was passed to correct some of the inequalities concerning the manner of determining actual value, when necessary: Com. v.

No further instructions were furnished, as promised, but this failure of the Commonwealth’s officers cannot be held to prejudice any rights which the State may have to collect: Delaware Div.

Its payment of the full amount, on the ten-mill basis, was refused on January 26th. Later, the bank tendered an additional sum, covering the further claim due if tax was charged on actual value from January 1st to June 20, 1926, but refused to pay on that plan from June 20, 1925, to January 1, 1926. On appeal from the settlement made by the Commonwealth, the court entered judgment for the full claim, with interest and commissions, less sums already advanced by defendant, and this appeal followed.</p>

Such legislation was prospective in its nature, and the provisions of the Act of 1897 were clearly applicable until the date fixed. “We think the sound rule is, especially as to acts which provide for the assessment and collection of annual taxes, that a statute repealing former laws on the same subject does not abolish all rights and remedies under the repealed acts, if the legislative intent not to abolish them appears”: Com. v. Mortgage Trust Co., supra, p. 183. That a repealing statute, so far as it provides for a change of procedure, may and does apply to actions pending, is a proposition which will not be disputed, for no one can claim a vested right in a particular mode of procedure for an enforcement or defense of his rights, but the act before us cannot be so classed. “It is entirely competent for the legislature to make changes, and impose liability where none was before, but legislation of this kind cannot operate retrospectively, but must be confined to future occurrences”: Lewis v.

Its right to do so was fixed, but the obligation to actually secure a formal settlement and pay on this plan did not expire until March 1st, the date fixed in the Act of 1897, under which its right was asserted. Had it delayed in tendering payment beyond that time, its privilege would have been lost (Com. v.

Plainly it would have been entitled to a proper adjustment of its tax, and to pay under the earlier act prior to the date of its effective repeal, for such a charge is apportionable (Com. v.

This is generally the rule of construction to be applied in the case of statutory exceptions later repealed, as held in Butler v. Palmer, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Hill%20324" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="1 Hill 324">1 Hill 324</a>, relied on below. We cannot agree, however, that the method of settlement provided by the Act of 1897 was merely an exception, but, on the contrary, was one of three alternative methods of taxation fixed, as recognized by this court in Com. v. Mortgage Trust Co., supra. In the Act of 1891 the flat tax on par value is named first, and the optional method, based on actual value, second. In that of 1897, the latter is named first, followed by the other two, introduced by the words “provided further,” and “except.” These expressions are frequently used, as here, not as qualifying the operation of the statute, but as conjunc<a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>tive to an independent paragraph: Georgia R. &amp; Banking Co. v.

Under such circumstances, the legislative right to pay on the permitted basis to that time existed, and the company performed its duty if it tendered settlement prior to March 1st. To hold otherwise would be to make the Act of 1925 retrospective as to the period from June 20, 1925, to January 1, 1926, when it was expressly declared not to be effective until the later date.</p>

Nothing then remained to be done but report and pay, the time for doing which was fixed as March 1st following. The annuling Act of 1925 did not purport to fix the tax for the period prior to the first of the year, but only for the period thereafter. Had the taxpayer been compelled by the Act of 1897 to take some affirmative action before January 1,1926, the effective date of the repeal; then a failure to so proceed would have deprived it of power to invoke its provisions thereafter, and the rulings in Butler v.
