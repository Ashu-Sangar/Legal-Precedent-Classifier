Tbe plaintiff, an employee of a hosiery mill, entered tbe car of tbe transit company as a passenger, intending to go to her usual place of work. It proceeded west along Allegheny Avenue at a rate of speed found by tbe jury to be excessive under tbe circumstances. Jasper Street, crossing at right-angles, was approached without tbe sounding of a gong, or tbe giving of other warning. As it was reached, a truck of tbe United Freight Motor Company advanced from tbe right, moving north on tbe intersecting highway at a rapid rate. Though tbe oncoming trolley was in sight, tbe driver attempted to cross in front, and bad reached tbe second rail, when tbe rear of tbe automobile was bit. Though weighing, with its load, twelve tons, tbe force of tbe impact was such as to cause it to overturn, after first moving across tbe avenue to tbe northwest corner.

Under careful instructions, tbe jury found tbe latter to be tbe fact, and rendered verdicts accordingly. There was evidence to show a lack of due care on tbe part of tbe transit company, and tbe same can be said of tbe codefendant. Evidently tbe motorman thought be had superior rights <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>on the highway, but this did not relieve him from the duty to use due care to prevent the impending collision: Woomer v.

On the other hand, the driver of the truck apparently believed he was entitled to the right of way ?ince he was approaching the intersection, at the same time, from the right (Act June 30, 1919, P. L. 678), but this did not justify him in proceeding without proper caution: Alperdt v.

There was sufficient evidence to show negligence by both parties, which concurring caused the accident. Without further discussion, the first assignment of error of the transit company, in which complaint is made of the failure of the court below to grant its motion for a new trial because of lack of sufficient proof of carelessness to justify a verdict in so far as it, was concerned, must be dismissed. It cannot be said that there was an abuse of discretion in refusing to granj; this request, and it is only in such case that we will ihterfere: Schuck v. West Side Belt R.

The lack of care of the freight company rested on the failure of the driver of its truck to observe caution in crossing Allegheny Avenue in front of the trolley, which was advancing in plain sight, but this alone did not result in harm to the plaintiff. “What injured her was the collision, which was the direct result of the combined negligence of the two defendants, and, for the immediate consequences of what they jointly brought about, they are and ought to be jointly accountable, even though the plaintiff might have sued them separately, joint wrongdoers being liable both jointly and severally”: O’Malley v.

It is true, the carrier may be subjected to a higher degree of care than his cotort-feasor, but this affords no reason why either or both of them should not be held to that degree of care, respectively, which the law imposes upon them, and to be answerable in damages accordingly. The general rule undoubtedly is, if a person suffers injury from the joint negligence of two parties, and both are negligent in a manner which contributes to the injury, they are liable jointly and severally, and it would seem in principle to be a matter of no consequence that one of them is a common carrier. Neither the comparative degrees of care required, nor <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>the comparative degrees of culpability established, can affect the liability of either.”</p>

Traction Co., <a href="/pa/179/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="179 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="886997" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0327-01">179 Pa. 327</a>), or a common carrier and the owner of a truck or other vehicle: O’Malley v. P. R. T. Co., supra; Cleary v. Quaker City Cab Co., supra; Harkin v. Toy and P. R. T. Co., supra. But appellant urges that these are not cases where a passenger was injured in a vehicle of one of the defendants, who was a carrier owing a higher degree of care to plaintiff than did the other tort-feasor. Such situation is found in Goldman v. Mitchell-Fletcher Co., <a href="/pa/285/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="285 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1095119" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0116-01">285 Pa. 116</a>, and in Caplan v.

The refusal of the request did the freight company no harm. If the verdict had been adverse to plaintiff, she might have complained that, as to one of the defendants, there was a greater responsibility <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>than defined in the charge, but no one else could have been injured by the omission. The question for the jury was whether the loss was the result of a joint negligence of the two defendants, and, as to this, adequate instructions were given, with admonition that, if either was not guilty of any negligence, or did not participate in a joint tort contributing to the accident, no recovery could be had against such party. The charge was sufficient (O’Malley v. P. R. T. Co., supra, p. 298) and no error was committed in declining to read the third point, which would have tended only to confuse.</p>

It is the duty of the court below to see that no oppressive verdict is permitted to stand, and, if so large as to indicate that the jury has misused its power, to set aside or cause it to be reduced: Goldman v. Mitchell-Fletcher Co., supra. But the appellate court will not interfere in such cases unless the amount named is so grossly exorbitant as to be clearly unjust, and the refusal to grant relief below evidences an abuse of discretion: Dziak v. Swaney, <a href="/pa/289/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="289 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1103280" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0246-01">289 Pa. 246</a>; Petrie v. Kaufmann &amp; Baer Co., <a href="/pa/291/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="291 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="1107269" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0211-01">291 Pa. 211</a>. In the instant case, it is apparent that the court in banc scrutinized the testimony, as was its duty, to prevent the entry of an unreasonable judgment. It reduced the verdict rendered from $22,000 to $6,500, and we cannot say that there was no testimony to justify such award. The plaintiff was earning $25 a week at the time of the collision, and had not recovered when the trial took place. She had been in good health before the accident, and has since suffered from various injuries described by her physician. The court below was convinced of loss to the extent of the recovery permitted, and the amount finally allowed is not so large as to justify interference by us. A like conclusion is reached in the case of the judgment for the father in the sum of $3,000. His daughter’s wages from the time of the injury to her majority, 117 weeks in all, with the sum paid for medi<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>cal expenses, would equal this amount, and, until the date of trial, he had furnished her support.</p>
