A verdict was rendered in plaintiff’s favor, but for less than the amount claimed. Plaintiff filed a motion foF judgment n. o. v., to obtain the full amount of his claim; defendant filed motions for judgment n. o. v. and for new trial. The court below dismissed both motions for judgment n. o. v., and, without filing an opinion, awarded a new trial on defendant’s motion to that effect. Plaintiff has appealed from the refusal to give her judgment in full n. o. v., and from the order granting a new trial; defendant has appealed from the refusal of her motion for judgment n. o. v.</p>
