The writ was duly served on defendants, for whom an appearance was entered. Plaintiffs’ statement of claim and abstract of title were filed with the praecipe and served with the writ. On November 22, 1926, defendants having failed to file either a plea, answer or abstract of title, plaintiffs entered a rule for judgment, service of which was accepted and the case was placed on the December argument list. On January 18, 1927, the trial court filed an opinion and entered a decree as follows: “Now, rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered to be made absolute within ten days from this date, unless the defendants within said ten days file a proper answer as required by rules of court and the Act of Assembly. Failure to file said answer, upon presentation of proper order setting forth the premises, etc., judgment will be entered on the same.” Ten days later defendants filed what purported to be an answer which the trial court, deeming insufficient, disregarded and entered a final decree as follows: “February 1, 1927......Now, It appearing to the court the defendants have not filed answer to the action in ejectment as required by the order of this court made January 18, 1927, it is therefore ordered and decreed that judgment be and the same is hereby entered in favor of the plaintiffs, M. C. Porter, C. S. Russell and E. C. Blandy, trustees, and against the defendants, Nell E. Hayes, Kathryn E. Evans and Henrietta G. Dyer, for the premises described as follows: [describing the land]. This for the reasons heretofore set forth in the decree of the court under date of January 18, 1927.” A writ of possession followed and, on April 28, 1927, defendants appealed.</p>

This is not seriously controverted but appellants urge that plaintiffs’ statement of claim and abstract of title are insufficient. The statement of claim avers that, “The plaintiffs above named claim the title and right of possession to the following described real estate: [describing the premises and the improvements thereon]. That the defendants above named unjustly and unlawfully detain possession of the premises aforesaid from the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs declare for, and seek to recover in this action, the mesne profits of which they have been deprived, by reason of the unlawful determination of the defendants, and state the fair value thereof to be one hundred ($100) dollars per month, dating from the date of .the issuance of this writ.” It sets forth a general averment of title and right of possession, which are not affected by the special claim of mesne profits. The statement of claim is sufficient both for the land and the mesne profits.</p>

Dyer and wife to the plaintiffs, embracing the land in suit, and that it was recorded May 22, 1925; it also avers that “The title of both plaintiffs and defendants is from a common source, both claiming under Fred J. Dyer, who was the owner of said premises prior to the 8th day of May, 1925.” The answer filed January 28, 1927, says, inter alia, “Defendants admit the facts stated in plaintiffs’ pleadings.” It being thus admitted that Fred J. Dyer was the common source of title, it was unnecessary to go back of him and aver a prior title out of the Commonwealth. In Sallada et al. v. Mock et al., <a href="/pa/271/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="271 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="295646" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0212-01">271 Pa. 212</a>, 214, Mr. Justice Schaffer, speaking for the court, says: “Since both claimants go back to a common source of title, the questions raised by appellants as to the insufficiency of the proofs of plaintiffs’ paper title, prior to Mary Ann Snyder’s ownership, fade out of the case; for it was not necessary to show title back of the common source.” See also Carroll v.

True, they deny unlawful possession and allege a full and complete defense, but wholly fail to set it out.
