For purposes of convenience it allotted a portion of the property to Mine No. 3, and another part to one known as No. 4. This was the situation on August 1, 1905, when it entered into an agreement with an ad joiner, the Big Bend Coal Mining Company, which contract gives rise to the present litigation. By its terms the latter company contracted to buy power from the former until such time as connection with some commercial line could be made, the right to then terminate the arrangement being specified. It was further agreed that the Big Bend Company should have “the right and privilege to connect its mine with the water level heading” of the Commercial Company, so long as the former purchased electricity, but, when this ceased, then the latter <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>agreed to furnish drainage “through the water level heading referred to” at a fixed price based on the. tonnage removed, later modified to a lump sum. “Said drainage to be furnished by the Commercial Coal Mining Company if required by the Big Bend Coal Mining Company until all of the No. 3 mine coal of the Commercial Coal Mining Company has been worked out.”</p>
    <p id="b67-3" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[95,713,1153,858]]]'>When this agreement was made the No. 3 operation covered 439.7 acres of land, the remaining part owned by plaintiff being included for mining purposes within No. 4. In 1910, or thereabout, additional property was purchased, and subsequently worked with No. 3, but this need not be considered in the present proceeding, since it is only the mine as it existed on August 1, 1905, when thé contract was entered into, with which we are concerned. Later, in 1918, an additional slope on newly acquired acreage, known as No. 16, was developed, and coal from it was moved through a new opening, as well as the mouth of No. 3, and through the latter the ventilating system for No. 16 was constructed. A portion of the coal land, part of No. 3 in 1905, was later allotted to the additional working, and is now used in connection therewith.</p>

It filed a bill in equity praying that the contract be declared no longer enforceable, and asking that the Big Bend Company be restrained from depositing water on its property, or making use of the old drainage heading. It will be noted that the contract gave the Big Bend Company the right to terminate the agreement as to the purchasing of electric power, but the Commercial Company reserved no privilege to cease at' its option from supplying drainage, so long as the consideration agreed on was paid, before the coal in No. 3 was “worked out.” The learned court below <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>granted the relief prayed for, and from its decree this appeal was taken.</p>

The Commercial Company apparently had no thought of keeping intact a drainage heading for the benefit of the adjoiner, when it had removed all of the coal within the lines fixed. As in the case of all contracts, where the agreement is of a continuing character, dependent upon the continued existence of a particular thing, or the continued ability of the obligor to perform, subsequent destruction or disability will excuse the obligor from compliance with the terms of the understanding, though there be no express stipulation to this effect: Bastian v.

    <p id="b69-3" data-blocks='[["BL_69.4",69,[108,555,1158,1734]]]'>The court below has found that certain outcrop coal within the lines of No. 3 mine is not merchantable, and cannot be worked at an expense practicable in a business sense, and it therefore need not be removed by plaintiff, as such course could not have been within the contemplation of the parties, and with this conclusion we agree: 3 Williston on Contracts 3336. It also held that it could not have been the intention that the pillars and supports of the drainage heading must be removed before cutting off the drainage system, and 'manifestly this is correct. It also found that there was other mine-able coal within the lines of No. 3, as it existed when the contract of 1905 was executed, which could be removed, but holds that such had been transferred or allotted to the new No. 16 mine in good faith, or was required to be kept in place for the maintenance of the ventilating system of the latter. These facts are expressly found by the court in answer to the exceptions filed by the defendant to the nisi decree entered, and counsel for appellee frankly stated on argument before us that there was coal within the lines of the original tract which could still be worked. The condition justifying the abrogation of the agreement has not, therefore, as yet arisen. All of the workable coal within the original lines of No. 3 in 1905, — not the land added thereafter, — • must be exhausted, and plaintiff cannot be relieved of his obligation by transferring a portion thereof to No. 16 mine, and operating it in connection therewith. Nor can it be said to have “worked out” all of the coal when it was reserving in place a part, not for the benefit of No. 3 mine, but solely to make more convenient the mining in No. 16.</p>

We cannot agree with the construction suggested, but hold that, in the absence of an agreement of the contracting parties, the marketable coal within the lines of No. 3. must be “worked out” before there can be a legal declaration of the termination of the obligations undertaken.</p>

J. 211. “The reason is that if parties, for valuable consideration, with their eyes open, contract that a particular thing shall not be done, all that a court of equity has to do is to say by way of injunction that which the parties have already said by way of covenant, that the thing shall not be done; and in such case the injunction does nothing more than give the sanction of the process of the court to that which already is the contract between the parties. It is not, then, a question of convenience or inconvenience, — or of the amount of damage or injury, — it is the specific performance, by the court, of that bargain which the parties have made, with their eyes open, between themselves”: Spilling v. Hutcheson, <a href="/va/111/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="111 Va. 179" data-case-ids="466088" data-case-paths="/va/111/0179-01">111 Va. 179</a>, 182, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20S.E.%20250" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="68 S.E. 250">68 S.
