Plaintiffs claim, through various mesne conveyances, from one Parmalee, who obtained title by a deed from the administrator of Cobham’s Estate, executed and delivered in compliance with a decree of the orphans’ court, after the land had been sold, by virtue of an earlier decree, in order to realize a fund to pay his debts. We have already decided in this estate that the appointment of the administrator was legal, and the record of the orphans’ court was sufficient to support the order of sale and the proceedings under it: Sager v.

    <p id="b490-4" data-blocks='[["BL_490.5",490,[271,516,1157,1559]]]'>It is not asserted that there was in the recorder of deeds’ office anything adversely affecting plaintiffs’ title, and the only thing bearing upon the matter, which had ever appeared in a court of record, was an ejectment brought by defendant’s mother and others in 1891, sixteen years before plaintiffs' herein purchased the land, and eleven years after the defendant in that suit had parted with his title to it and the deed from him had been recorded. Plaintiffs were not. required to search those records for entries against him as of that long-past date, however, and the fact that he was the husband of the present plaintiffs’ grantor does not affect the matter: Garis v. Fish, <a href="/pa/133/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="133 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="812886" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0555-01">133 Pa. 555</a>; Kirby v.

L. 532); and, furthermore, the final judgment in favor of the defendant in that suit, entered twelve years before these plaintiffs purchased, wholly destroyed any effect which could otherwise be given to its commencement and entry in the judgment index: Penna. Co. for Ins. on Lives, etc., v. Halpern, <a href="/pa/273/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="273 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1070873" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0451-01">273 Pa. 451</a>. Besides, the entry on that index was not put in evidence, and when plaintiffs offered the record of the case it was excluded on the objection of defendant, who cannot, therefore, now claim anything by virtue of its existence.</p>

Upon this point the facts are not in dispute. When plaintiffs bought and obtained title, they gave, as a consideration therefor, an agreement to pay their grantor and her hus<a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>band $1,400 per annum as long as they both should live, and thereafter $700 yearly to the survivor as long as he or she should live. It is not necessary to refer to the other considerations specified, since $11,200 was paid on account of that stated, long before any claim was made by defendant. The only objection alleged as to this, is that the deed was to The Incorporated Trustees of the Salvation Army in Pennsylvania, whereas the agreement to pay was by the parent body, a New York corporation named The Salvation Army. This, however, is a matter of indifference. Plaintiffs gave the contract agreed upon as the consideration, for the conveyance, and upon the faith of the grant the amounts stipulated were paid. If the equitable title is in the New York corporation because it paid the specified purchase money, then plaintiffs are holders of the legal title for its benefit, and can maintain ejectment as against defendant and all others except the New York corporation, so long as the two titles have not been merged by a deed or decree. With these things, however, defendant is not concerned, and hence, at the trial below, it made no inquiry touching them.</p>
