The assignments of error raise the question here. The jury were instructed \u201c that nothing short of an actual, continued, visible, notorious, distinct and hostile or adverse possession for twenty-one years will give title under the statute of limitations.\u201d Under this proper instruction they found from the evidence, which was sufficient to justify their finding, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and the judgment on their verdict is therefore affirmed.",
