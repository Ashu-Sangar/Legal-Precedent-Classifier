This petition was refused.\nJudge Willson in his answer to the petition for a rule for mandamus stated that his reason for refusing the application was, that in his judgment there was no authority given by the statutes, or in the law of Pennsylvania, to allow the same.\nT. Fernley Brooks and William J. Wagenknight, for the rule.\n\u2014If the appeal acted as a supersedeas then all proceedings in the lower court were stayed, and the thirty days ceased to run against the petitioner upon the issuing of the certiorari: Rochester Bank v.
