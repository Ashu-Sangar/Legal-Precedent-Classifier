    "head_matter": "Waechter v. Second Avenue Traction Company.\nNegligence\u2014Street railways\u2014Position of sudden danger\u2014Motorman\u2014 Province of court and jury.\nIn an action against a street railway company to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s wife, the case is for the jury where the evidence shows that the plaintiff and his wife were driving a buggy on the westbound track of defendant\u2019s railway, that the horse became frightened by the whistle of a locomotive, and shied on to the east-bound track where it ran for some distance; that the plaintiff\u2019s wife made signals of distress in plain view of a motorman on a car on the east-bound track, and that the motorman without slackening the rapid speed of his car, although having ample space to do so, ran into the buggy and killed the woman.\nNegligence\u2014Damages\u2014Death of wife.\nIn an action to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s wife caused by negligence, the trial judge cannot be convicted of error in charging the jury, without elaboration, that it could give the plaintiff only the money value of the wife\u2019s life to him, unaffected by sentimental consideration.\nArgued Oct. 23, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 90, Oct. T., 1900, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 3, Allegheny Co., Aug. Term, 1897, No. 238, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Christ Waechter v. Second Avenue Traction Company.\nBefore Mc-Collum, C. J., Mitchell, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for death of plaintiff\u2019s wife.\nAt the trial it appeared that on April 25,1897, plaintiff and his wife were driving a buggy on the west-bound track of de- \u25a0 fendant\u2019s railway on Second avenue in the city of Pittsburg. The horse became frightened by the whistle of a locomotive and shied on to the east-bound track, where it ran for some distance. The wife made signals of distress in view of a motorman of a car approaching on the east-bound track. The motorman did not slacken the speed of his car which was goring at a rapid rate, although he had ample opportunity to do so, and the buggy was struck and the woman killed.\nThe court charged in part as follows:\n[But if the motorman saw this party coming down that track, if he saw, either that the horse was keeping to the left hand track, that is, the track towards the river, the track on' which he was, or that the horse was swaying back and forth to that track, and that he might happen to be there at the time he got up with his car, and if he saw that the horse was not in control of the driver of the buggy, then it would be evidence of negligence ; it would be negligence for him to drive his car right on and run into him, as a matter of course.] [2]\n- \u2022'[If you find that it did, then you come to the matter of damages, \u00e1nd that is simply a matter of dollars and cents. You \u00bfan only give to this man the money value of his wife\u2019s life to him. Of course, it is somewhat difficult for you to determine what that is. You have, however, the circumstances in life of these parties, you have the age of the parties\u2014perhaps not the age of the husband, but you have the husband before you\u2014you see what sort of a.man he is, you have the age of the wife. What is the money value of her life to him ? It is not a question of sentiment; it is a question of pecuniary compensation. I can give you very little aid. You must, of course, be cautious and conservative; you must not allow yourselves to be carried away by any considerations which are not proper in the case \u00a1 but in the exercise of a calm judgment, determine what the damages should be, if you conclude, under the instructions that I have given you, that damages should be awarded in this case.] [8]\nDefendant presented this point:\nUnder the pleadings and evidence in this case, the verdict must be for the defendant. Answer: Refused. [1]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $5,000. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1-3) above instructions, quoting them.\nGeorge E. Shaw, with him P. 0. Knox and James II. Reed, for appellant.\nThe evidence does not establish negligence and the court should have affirmed the defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury to find for the defendant: Yingst v. Lebanon, etc., Ry. Co., 167 Pa. 438 ; Hestonville, etc., R. R. Co. v. Kelley, 102 Pa. 120.\nThe court erred in its charge to the jury as to what constituted negligence in this case: Phillips v. People\u2019s Pass. Ry. Co., 190 Pa. 222.\nThe court erred in its instruction to the jury upon the measure of damages: Kelley v. Mayberry Twp., 154 Pa. 440.\nGeorge II. Stengel, with him Thomas M. $ Rody P. Marshall, for appellee.\nThis is not such a case as requires plaintiff to establish unreasonable speed: Harkins v. Pittsburg, etc., Traction Co., 173 Pa. 149.\nIt is the duty of the passenger railway companies to exercise such watchful care as will prevent accidents or injuries to persons who, without negligence on their own part, may not at the moment be able to get out of the way of a passing car: Gilmore v. Federal St., etc., Pass. Ry. Co., 153 Pa. 31; Thatcher v. Central Traction Co., 166 Pa. 66; Hestonville, etc., R. R. Co. v. Kelley, 102 Pa. 120; Phillips v. People\u2019s Pass. Ry. Co., 190 Pa. 222.\nLife by law has a value for the loss of which the survivors have a right to be compensated, in view of its circumstances: Penna. R. Co. v. Keller, 67 Pa. 300.\nJanuary 7, 1901:"
