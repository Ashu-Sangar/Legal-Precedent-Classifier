T., 1900, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1899, No. 783, refusing to take off nonsuit, in case of WyattS. Miller, a minor, and Robert G. Miller, his father, v. Union Traction Company.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before Biddle, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on October 10, 1899, plaintiff, then a boy about eleven years of age, in going home from school, walked east on the north side of Filbert street and turned north on Thirty-eighth street, and when he had gone about the length of a pavement or some eighteen or twenty feet, turned suddenly and ran diagonally into the street in such a manner as to come in contact with the side of a passing car near its front end, or between the fender and front steps.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was in refusing to take off nonsuit.\nWilliam C. Gross, for appellants.\nThomas Learning, with him Russell Duane, for appellee.\nApril 1, 1901:"
