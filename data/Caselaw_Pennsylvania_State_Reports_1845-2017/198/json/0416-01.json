P.\u2014Affidavit of defense\u2014Contract.\nIn an action for goods sold and delivered, an affidavit of defense is sufficient, which avers that plaintiff had failed to deliver in the time provided by the contract, certain iron, in consequence of which defendant was compelled to go into the market and purchase iron elsewhere, which it did at an advance of a specified price per ton, and that the loss thus sustained should be set off against plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nArgued Jan. 16, 1901.\nAppeal, No. 294, Jan. T., 1900, by-plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 2, Pbila. Co., June T., 1900, No. 359, discharging rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense in case of Edward H. Wilson, trading as E. H. Wilson & Company, v. The Phoenix Iron Company.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Fell, Blown, Mestlezat and Pottee, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nRule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, in action for goods sold and delivered.\nThe affidavit of defense was as follows :\nAbout July 8, 1899, the defendants made a contract with the plaintiff, that he, the plaintiff, should ship them 1,000 gross tons of old iron car wheels for delivery in about equal quantities during the months of July, August and September, 1899, all of the said car wheels to be delivered prior to the end of September, 1899.\nThat the said car wheels were not delivered as per the contract during the month of September, and during the first two weeks of October, the defendants were constantly urging the plaintiff to ship the balance of the wheels. That up to the middle of October, only about 545 tons had been delivered, and the defendants then being in urgent need of the balance of the said wheels, and the plaintiff neglecting and refusing to ship the same, the defendants were compelled to go into the market and purchase wheels elsewhere, which they did at an advance in price of $4.75 per ton, which was the market price of the said wheels and which was the lowest price they could obtain them for at that time.\nThe defendants claim to offset therefore against the plaintiff\u2019s claim, 445 tons of old car wheels purchased by them at $22.25 per ton, being $4.75 per ton in excess of the contract price, making a total sum of $2,161.25.\nError assigned was the order of the court discharging rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nBernard, Gilpin, for appellant.\nJohn Weaver, with him John SparhawJe, Jr., for appellee.\nFebruary 18, 1901:"
