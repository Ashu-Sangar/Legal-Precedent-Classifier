Sulzner.\nSchool law\u2014Treasurer of school board\u2014Appointed officer\u2014Removal.\nThe office of treasurer of a school board is an appointed office within the meaning of the constitution, and the occupant is removable at the pleasure of the board. '\nArgued Jan. 29, 1901.\nAppeal, No. 166, Oct. T., 1900, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 3, Allegheny Co., Aug. T., 1900, No. 630, awarding writ of mandamus in case of Commonwealth ex rel. The Board of Directors of the Home-wood Subschool District, in the 21st Ward of the City of Pittsburg v. A. F. Sulzner.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for mandamus to compel payment of money to a school district.\nFrom the record it appeared that the board of directors of the Homewood subschool district, in the city of Pittsburg, at its organization in June, 1900, chose the respondent treasurer of the board. At a subsequent meeting this action was reconsidered and another person chosen in. his place.. The respondent refused to turn over the money in his hands to the person chosen as his successor and these proceedings were commenced to compel him so to do. The court awarded a peremptory mandamus directing the defendant to pay over the funds in his hand to the board of directors, or to his successor in the office of treasurer.\nError assigned was the order of the court.\nJohns Mo Cleave, of Watson $ Me Cleave, for appellant.\nThe treasurer of a school board having charge of public moneys raised by public taxation is an officer within article 6, section'4, of the constitution: Com. v. Evans, 74 Pa. 124; Houseman v. Com., 100 Pa. 222; Com. v. Morrisey, 86 Pa. 416.\nThe word \u201c appoint \u201d cannot be found to be used in connection with the selection of any officer by the people, or by any body composed of representatives of the people.\nBoth the constitutions of Kentucky and Indiana, in the use of these terms, almost identical with the constitution of Pennsylvania, have been construed finally in accordance with our contention : Speed v. Crawford, 3 Metc. (Ky.) 207; State v. Harrison, 113 Ind. 434.\nAs the defendant does not hold his office of treasurer by appointment, he cannot bo removed except for cause: Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137; Ewing v. Thompson, 43 Pa. 372; Field v. Com., 32 Pa. 478 ; Page v. Hardin, 8 B. Monroe (Ky.), 672; Foster v. Kansas, 112 U. S. 201; Mechem on Public Officers, sec. 454; Hallgren v. Campbell, 82 Mich. 260.\nThe court has no jurisdiction in this form of action. The proper remedy of the plaintiffs is quo warranto and not mandamus : Com. v. Supervisors of Colley Twp., 29 Pa. 121; Heffner v. Com., 28 Pa. 112; High on Extraordinary Legal Remedies, secs. 49, 50, 53 ; Rex v. Ward, 2 Strange, 893; King v. Harris, 3 Burr. 1423; Com. v. O\u2019Day, 6 Kulp, 177; Com. v. Perkins, 7 Pa. 42; Gaul v. Commissioners of Philadelphia, 2 Parsons, 220; St. Louis County Court v. Sparks, 10 Mo. 120; Hagner v. Heyberger, 7 W. & S. 104; Updegraff v. Crans, 47 Pa. 103; Gilroy\u2019s Appeal, 100 Pa. 5 ; Goldsworthy v. Boyle, 175 Pa. 246; Com. v. County Commissioners, 5 Rawle, 77; Com. of Kentucky v.

Overseers of Jersey Shore Borough, 82 Pa. 275.\nJ. MeF. Carpenter, for appellee.\nThat the power to appoint carries with it the power to remove, cannot be questioned: Constitution of Penna., art. 6, sec. 4; Houseman v. Com., 100 Pa. 222; Com. et al. v. Lynch, 8 Pa. Dist. Rep. 347; Com. et al. v. Rutherford, 8 Pa. Dist. Rep. 349; People v. City of Brooklyn, 149 N. Y. 215.\n.- There'is fto contract relation between the parties which requires the consent of both to rescind it: Kenny v. Hudspeth, 36 Atl. Repr. 662; Thomas v. Scranton Poor Dist., 4 C. P. Rep. 155.\nEven though the appointee has entered on the discharge of hi.s duties at a fixed salary, and the office is abolished by the legislature, no action for salary will lie for an unexpired term: Com. v. McCombs, 56 Pa. 436, approved in Com. v. Weir, 165 Pa. 284.\nMarch 11, 1901:"
