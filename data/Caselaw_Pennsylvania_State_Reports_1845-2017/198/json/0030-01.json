The testimony was the same in both cases and we find nothing in it which would warrant the withdrawal of the case from the jury on the ground that the plaintiff was negligent in not selecting a proper caretaker for his child or that the person in whose care she was placed was under the circumstances negligent.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

New Castle Electric Street Railway Company\n(No. 2).\nNegligence\u2014Infant of tender years\u2014Parents\u2014 Contributory negligence\u2014 Province of court and jury. <?\nIn an action against a street railway company to recover damages for personal injuries to a child four years old, the question of the parent\u2019s contributory negligence is for the jury, where the evidence shows that before the child went upon the cartway of the street, where it was injured by a car, it was seated in a chair on the sidewalk, that its mother was at an open window about twenty-five feet away, and that the child\u2019s nurse was standing on the pavement not far from the child.\nArgued Oct. 18, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 79, Oct. T., 1900, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Lawrence Co., June T., 1898, No. 47, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Elanor Alice Kroesen, a minor, by Edward Kroesen, her father and next friend, and Edward Kroesen in his own right, v. New Castle Electric Street Railway Company.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Wallace, P. J.\nIn addition to the facts appearing by the report of Kroesen v. New Castle Electric Street Railway Company (No. 1), ante, p. 26, it appeared that immediately prior to the accident the child, Alice, was seated in a chair on the sidewalk, that its mother and father were at an open window about twenty-five feet away, and that the child\u2019s nurse was standing on the pavement near the child.\n. The court refused binding instructions for defendant.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $850. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in refusing binding instructions for defendant.\nB. A. Winternitz, with him John G-. Mo Oonahy and B. B. \u00a3 L. T. Kurtz, for appellant.\nA parent owes a reasonable duty of protection to his children and cannot cast the whole of that duty upon strangers. If he permits them, when of tender years, to wander off in places of known danger, and by reason thereof an accident occurs to them, he lias no just claim to make others bear the consequences of his own neglect: Westerberg v. Kinzua, etc., E. R. Co., 142 Pa. 471; Johnson v. Reading City Pass. Ry. Co., 160 Pa. 648.\nOsear L. Jackson, for appellees.\nThere is nothing to show contributory negligence on the part of either of the parents, and the case was properly submitted to the jury, who had abundant evidence to support their verdict: Phila. & Reading R. R. Co. v. Long, 75 Pa. 257; Penna. R. Co. v. James, 81* Pa. 194; Dunseath v. Pitts., etc., Traction Co., 161 Pa. 124; Woeckner v. Erie Electric Motor Co., 182 Pa. 182.\nJanuary 7, 1901:"
