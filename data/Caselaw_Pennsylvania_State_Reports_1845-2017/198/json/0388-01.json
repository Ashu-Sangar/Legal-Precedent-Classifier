The plaintiffs then appealed to this court alleging that the affidavit of defense is insufficient. An order discharging a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense will not be reversed by the Supreme Court in doubtful and uncertain cases, but only such as are very clear and free of doubt: Ensign et al. to use of Paine v. Kindred, 163 Pa. 638. In \u00c6tna Ins. Co. v. Confer, 158 Pa. 604, it was said, \u201c It must be a very plain case of error in law, if we sustain appeals in such cases from the decree of the common pleas discharging the rule.\u201d The case at bar is within the rule established by the above cases.\nJudgment affirmed.",
