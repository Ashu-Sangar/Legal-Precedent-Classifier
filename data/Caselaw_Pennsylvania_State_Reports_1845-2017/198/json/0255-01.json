T., 1900, by James McKee, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., June T., 1900, No. 393, dismissing petition to declare a trust ended in estate of David McKee, deceased.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAf-\nfirmed.\nPetition to declare a trust ended.\nOver, J., filed the following opinion:\nDavid McKee died testate on April 4, 1886, leaving to survive him two children, Mrs. Bell McCroskey and James McKee. He made the following disposition of his estate:\n\u201c First. I give and bequeath to my grandson, John D. McKee, all my homestead on which I now live, houses and grounds, fourteen acres more or less, bounded by lands of John Herron, Stanton Avenue, etc., the same to be his forever, for his own proper use, but not to be sold until he is thirty years of age, but he to have the use and income from the time of my decease. I appoint Harry Mason guardian until he is of age, he and his family to live on the place until that time.\n\u201c To my sisters, Nancy and Margaret, and Brother John, Three Hundred Dollars per year during their lives, to be paid from the time of my decease semi-annually; that will be One Hundred Dollars, each one, per year.\n\u201c To my daughter, Bell McCroskey, Fifty Dollars per month during her life; to my son, James McKee, Fifty Dollars per month during his life, and the house now occupied by him free of rent.\n\u201c I appoint as Executors to this my last Will and Testament my brother, James McKee, and Rev. Sands, Pastor of U. P. Church on 44th street, City of Pittsburgh.\n\u201c On the death of my heirs herein named, all property and Bank Stocks to be sold and divided among all the heirs. Should my grandson, John D. McKee, die before he is thirty without -leaving any heirs, his estate to be divided pro ratio among the heirs.\n\u201cI give in addition to my grandson, John D. McKee, one half of the income of my Bank Stock in the Bank of Commerce.\n\u201cTo my brother, James McKee, of the Twelfth ward, City of Pittsburgh, the other half of the income from this same stock in the Bank of Commerce, Wood and Sixth street, the stock is seventy shares.\n\u201c The balance of the income, after paying these legacies and taxes, to be spent in keeping up the houses in good condition; should there be more than will do this, the money to be placed in bank to accumulate.\u201d\nThe executors, acting as trustees under the will, have had charge of the real and personal estate since testator\u2019s death, collecting the rents and income and paying the annuities. All of the persons designated by name in the will as beneficiaries have died, except testator\u2019s sister, Nancy McKee, daughter, Bell McCroskey, and his brother, James McKee, who has purchased all of their interest in the estate, as well as the interest of the estate of James McKee, testator\u2019s deceased son. In this petition of James McKee, the brother, in which Mrs. Bell Mc-Croskey and her husband, Nancy McKee and Fanny K. McKee, only child of James McKee, deceased, testator\u2019s son, join, he alleges that all the interests in the estate are vested in him, and prays that the trust may be terminated and the trustees directed to file an account and deliver the trust estate to him.\nIf the testator intended that the heirs to whom distribution of his estate should be made were to be ascertained as of the time of his death, the residue of the estate vested in his son and daughter as his sole heirs; and in that event all the interests are now vested in the petitioner, and under the authorities the trust should no doubt be terminated. We think, however, that he intended his estate should be distributed among his heirs as ascertained at the period fixed by him for distribution. In Yost v. Dwelling House Insurance Company, 179 Pa. 381, where a portion of this will was construed, Mr. Justice McCollum, referring to the clause providing that \u201c on the death of my heirs herein named all property and bank stocks to be sold and divided among all the heirs,\u201d said \u201cit is quite clear that by \u2018 My heirs herein named,\u2019 the testator meant the annuitants.\u201d\nThe testator intended then that distribution should not be made until after the death of his two children, his sole heirs at the time of his death who were also annuitants. Had he intended that they should take under this clause of his will as his heirs, would he not have provided for distribution immediately upon the death of the other beneficiaries, and limited to their lifetime the annuities given to his children. He gave them directly the annuities only, and although he would expect naturally that they would survive their aunts and uncles, the other beneficiaries, he expressly provided that the annuities should be paid to his children during their lives, and that conversion and distribution of his estate should not be made until after their death. It seems reasonably clear that the testator intended that they or their personal representatives should not receive anything more from his estate than the annuities, and that his heirs were to be ascertained as of the period of distribution.\nIn Donohue v. McNichol, 61 Pa. 73, where the testatrix provided that after the death of the son\u2019s lawful issue or in the event of his death without such issue, that all his real and personal estate should be held in trust by his executor for their lawful heirs, their heirs and assigns forever, the court said (see pages 80 and 81), that the \u201c better opinion was \u201d that the testatrix\u2019s heirs were to be ascertained as of the date of the death of her son or of his issue; and that, therefore, the limitation was too remote, and that he took the estate as heir at law by descent.\nIn Pierce v. Hubbard, 152 Pa. 18, testator directed as to the disposition of certain property: \u201cI desire it to be invested in mortgages, ground rent, real estate, and the interest to be regularly paid to her, Caroline McKey, free from control, liabilities and debts of her husband, notwithstanding her coverture, to be good and valid. And in case of her death without issue or issues of her children, then reversible to my right consanguinary heirs.\u201d Mr. Justice McCollum said: \u201c The obvious meaning of the paragraph in question is that if his daughter Caroline died without children or their issue living at her death, the remainder should vest in the persons who at that time answered the description of his right consanguinary heirs. It was contingent ; it could not be known until her death that anything should pass by it, and on the happening of the contingency of her death- without children or their issue surviving her, the persons entitled to take under it were those who were then the right heirs of the testator.\u201d\nIn Forrest v. Porch, 100 Tenn. 391, testator gave a tract of land to his widow, for life, and \u201c at her death the said land is to be divided between my heirs at law.\u201d It was held that the estate went in fee to such persons as, at the widow\u2019s death, answered to the description as heirs at law of the testator.\nIn Welsh v. Brimmer, 169 Mass. 204, and Heard v. Bead, 169 Mass. 216, it was also held that the heirs of the testator were to be ascertained as of the period of distribution and not as of the date of testator\u2019s death; and also in the following English cases where the devisee for life was the sole heir: Jones v. Colbeck, 8 Yes. 38; Briden v. Hewlett, 2 My. & K. 90 ; King v. Frost, 3 Barn. & Aid. 546.\nIf our conclusion, that the testator intended to give the residue of his estate upon the death of all the annuitants to such persons as then answered to the description of his heirs be correct, as they cannot now be ascertained, the trust must be sustained for their protection, and the petition dismissed.\nAnd now, to wit: September 19, 1900, this matter came on to be heard and was argued by counsel, and upon consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the within petition be dismissed at the costs of the petitioner.\nError assigned was the decree dismissing the petition.\nWilliam Yost, for appellant.\nIt is quite clear that by \u201c my heirs herein named \u201d the testator meant the annuitants, and that \u201c all the heirs \u201d included John D. McKee: Porter\u2019s App., 45 Pa. 207; Etter\u2019s Est., 23 Pa. 381; Baskin\u2019s App., 3 Pa. 304; McKee\u2019s Est., 26 P. L. J. (N. S.) 385.\nWhere the interpretation is doubtful, the heir is to be preferred : 1 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, 450; Fitzwater\u2019s App., 94 Pa. 141; Bruekman\u2019s Est., 195 Pa. 363; Rupp v. Eberly, 79 Pa. 144.\nAs a general rule of construction, it is well settled that a devise or bequest to heirs or heirs at law of the testator, or to his next of kin, will be construed as referring to those who are such at the time of the testator\u2019s decease unless a different intent is plainly manifest by the will; and if the tenant for life be such' next of kin, either solely or jointly with other persons, he will not be on that account only excluded: Buzby\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. 111; Richie\u2019s Appeal, 54 Pa. 97; Stewart\u2019s Estate, 147 Pa. 383; Grantz v.
