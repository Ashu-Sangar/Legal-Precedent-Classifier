    "head_matter": "Heist v. Blaisdell.\nContract\u2014Breach of contract\u2014Usury\u2014Compensation for services.\nParties may blend compensation for services and payment of interest upon a loan in one contract, and the fact that the compensation' for services is for an indefinite amount does not taint the contract with usury.\nArgued Jan. 7, 1901.\nAppeal, No. 419, Jan. T., 1899, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 4, Phila. Co., Dec. T., 1895, No. 425, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Thomas H. Heist v. Frederick E. Blaisdell.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit for breach of contract. Before Audenreed, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that plaintiff claimed to recover the value of certain shares of stock in a corporation, which he averred that defendant had agreed to deliver to him as compensation for services. Defendant denied the contract as alleged by plaintiff, and averred that the stock which plaintiff was to receive was to be partly in payment for money loaned, and partly in payment for services rendered; that the money loaned had been repaid with legal interest, and that the present demand was usurious. The evidence was conflicting in character.\nThe court charged in part as follows:\nWhere a man loans money and agrees, in addition, to perform services of an indefinite value, a value which is hard to fix, there he may properly stipulate for some additional compensation for what he is giving under a contract over and above simple interest, and he may recover whatever he has a right to expect under the contract, in addition to simple interest.\nYerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $7,500. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1-25) various rulings on evidence and instruction.\nEclwin 0. Michener, for appellant.\nJohn Scott, Jr., and John 6r. Johnson, for appellee, filed a printed brief but submitted no oral argument.\nFebruary 18, 1901:"
