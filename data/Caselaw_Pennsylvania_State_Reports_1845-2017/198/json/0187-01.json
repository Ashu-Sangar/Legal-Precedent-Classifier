The injuries received were the cause of his death within twenty-four hours of the occurrence. A clear case of contributory negligence was established by the evidence which plainly showed that the deceased had full opportunity to see the approaching car and to avoid contact with it. The case is fairly within Watkins v. Union Traction Co., 194 Pa. 564, Blaney v. Electric Traction Co., 184 Pa. 524, Gilmartin v. Lackawanna, etc., Ry.

The evidence tended to show that he did not stop or look, and that as he stepped on the track he was instantly struck.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was in refusing to take off nonsuit. \u25a0\nA.
