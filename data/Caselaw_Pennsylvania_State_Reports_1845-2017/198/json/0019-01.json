The East End Electric Light Company.\nNegligence\u2014Electric light wire\u2014Improper insulation\u2014Notice.\nAn electric light company is not liable for the death of a person who is killed by touching a defectively insulated wire while painting a roof, where there is no evidence that the company had notice of the defective insulation and there is no evidence as to the cause of the defect.\nSubmitted Oct. 22, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 28, Oct. T., 1900, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 3, Allegheny Co., Aug. T., 1899, No. 163, refusing- to take off nonsuit in case of David Smith, administrator of the estate of Mattie Driver v. The East End Electric Light Company, Allegheny County Light Company and the Philadelphia Company.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, and Potter, J J.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for the death of husband of plaintiff\u2019s decedent. Before Evans, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on March 27, 1899, George W. Driver who was the husband of plaintiff\u2019s decedent was killed by touching an electric wire while painting the roof of the house of S. Zoch in Pittsburg. The evidence showed that the wire at the point where the deceased was found clutching it was defectively insulated, but there was no evidence as to the cause of the defective insulation, or that the defendant had notice of the defect. The action was originally brought by the widow of the decedent, who died before the trial leaving minor children, and her administrator was substituted.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nRichard A. Kennedy,\ncited in his printed brief: Griffin v. United Electric Light Co., 164 Mass. 492; s. c., 6 Am. Elec. Cases, 252; McLaughlin v. Louisville Electric Light Co., 6 Am. Elec.
