        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe plaintiff alleges that the court erred in refusing to take off the nonsuit, and in sustaining the objection to the question put by his counsel to George L. Digman as follows, to wit: \u201c Do you know the duties of a railroad engineer as to railroad crossings ? \u201d As there is no intimation that he was a railroad engineer or was qualified to furnish information on that subject, there was no error committed by the court in saying, \u201c It is very vague testimony; I do not think it admissible.\u201d The testimony presented a clear case of contributory negligence which plainly justified the nonsuit and the refusal to take it off. In Gleim v. Harris et al., Receivers of the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company, 181 Pa. 887, it was held that \u201c in an action against a railroad company to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband at a grade crossing, a non-suit is properly entered where it appears that the deceased in driving along a public road stopped at a point about 330 feet from the railroad, and then continued without again stopping to look and listen, although at a number of places within the 330 feet he could have seen the train by which he was killed.\u201d In the case at bar the opportunity for observation of an approaching train enabled the party approaching the crossing in the exercise of care and discretion to pass over it safely. If Mrs. Born and her sister had exercised the. care required by the law and the rules governing the approach -to the crossing, they could have easily avoided the collision which resulted in their untimely death. In the nonobservance of the duty which rested upon them, their negligence was essentially the same as in Gleim v. Harris et al., supra, and led to like results. It was an unfortunate and sad occurrence, but it did not authorize a judgment against the defendant.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company.\nNegligence\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014Grade-crossing\u2014\u201c Stop, look atid listen.\u201d\nIn an action against a railroad company to recover damages for death of plaintiff\u2019s wife at a grade-crossing, a nonsuit is properly entered where it appears that the plaintiff\u2019s wife, in driving along a public road, stopped at a point variously estimated at from 29] to 820 feet from the track, and then continued without stopping to look or listen, although the view of the track for 8,675 feet was not obstructed.\n' Evidence\u2014Witness\u2014Competency of witness.\nIt is not error for the court to refuse to permit a witness to be asked whether he knows the duties of a railroad engineer as to railroad crossings, where there is no intimation tiial the witness is a railroad engineer, or is qualified to furnish information on the subject.\nArgued Jan. 14, 1901.\nAppeal, No. 281, Jan. T., 1900, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., March T., 1897, No. 1080, refusing to take off nonsuit in case of Henry Born v. Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company.\nBefore McCollum:, C. J., Mitchell, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for death of plaintiff\u2019s wife.\nAt the trial it appeared that on the morning of December 23, 1896, plaintiff\u2019s wife and sister were driving in a wagon on a public road towards a crossing of the defendant company. They stopped at a point variously estimated at frota 291 to 320 feet from the track, and then continued without again stopping to look or listen, although the view of the track for 3,675 feet was not obstructed. A passing train struck the wagon and Mrs. Born was killed.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nErrors assigned were (1) refusal to take off nonsuit; (2) ruling on the offer of evidence referred to in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nW.
