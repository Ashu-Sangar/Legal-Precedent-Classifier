J., Mitchell, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that testator gave his executors the power to sell at public or private sale the whole or any portion of his real estate. He further directed his executors to keep his real estate in good order and repair, pay taxes, water rent and interest on incumbrances, and pay to his wife the net rents and income during her life. He also directed that his executors \u201c shall be entitled to deduct from the gross income of my estate for their services as such executors the sum of five per cent thereon.\u201d In their account filed ten years after the death of testator, the executors claimed in addition to the five per cent on gross rentals, a percentage on mortgages which they had executed of the real estate.\nThe auditing judge, Hanna, P. J., disallowed the claim for commissions on mortgages.\nExceptions to the adjudication were dismissed by the court.\nError assigned was in refusing the compensation claimed.\nWilliam A. Gray, with him Alfred S. Miller, for appellants.\nJoseph T. Bunting, for appellees, was not heard.\nApril 1, 1901:"
