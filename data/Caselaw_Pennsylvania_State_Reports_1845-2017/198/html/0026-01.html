It was Sunday evening and children were playing on the sidewalk. The street was but twenty-nine feet in width between the curbs; it was entirely free of vehicles, and there was nothing to obstruct the view. The motorman was not looking ahead, but to one side toward a passenger who was riding on the front platform. <em>Held </em>(1) that the case was for the jury; (2) that the jury might well infer that if the motorman failed to look ahead he was negligent, or that if he looked he saw the child and was negligent in not controlling the motion of the car so as to avoid injuring her; (3) that a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff should be sustained.</p>
