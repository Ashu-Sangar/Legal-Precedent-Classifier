The representations made by the plaintiff to the defendants if true would have been of a consideration and value sufficient for the amount of notes, but at the time the defendants had no means of ascertaining whether true or false, therefore were compelled to rely upon what the plaintiff told them in this regard. If the representations were true, the saloon would have been a profitable business, but in truth and in fact the representations were made for the single purpose of making a sale, and proved to be false and fraudulent. Among other representations that the receipts from the saloon ran from $130 to $150 per week, and calculated upon experienced tables would prove that the profit would be thirty-three and one third per cent of receipts, but it <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>appears that the actual receipts of the business were only $60.00 or $70.00 per week, and the profit upon that sum would scarcely pay the rent. On learning this the defendants determined to abandon the business, notwithstanding at the time of the purchase they had paid in $500 in cash, and did so withdraw from the place ; and although more than five years have elapsed, the plaintiff made no demand upon these defendants for the payment of the notes, well knowing that these affiants claim that the said notes were obtained from them by false and fraudulent representations, therefore they are not in any wise indebted to the plaintiff.</p>
