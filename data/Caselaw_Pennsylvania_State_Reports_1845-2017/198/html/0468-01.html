On the trial of this appeal, the first question to be disposed of by the jury is the necessity of the proposed railroad on the route marked out by the defendant. The burden of establishing the fact that such railroad is necessary, is on the defendant who petitions for the road. This necessity, within the meaning of the act of assembly, is not an absolute, but a reasonable one. In determining it, you will take into consideration, not only the testimony of the witnesses, as you have heard it during the trial, but also the physical conditions of the property as you saw them on the ground. If you determine that the present railroad, on the route selected and marked by the defendant, is not so necessary for the development of the property of the defendant, you will so find, and this will relieve you from any further consideration of the case. <em>Answer: </em>We see nothing wrong with that point, except in the one sentence about the middle of it, and on the argument on these points the significance of that was further emphasized. You probably heard in the early part of this case, and, if that is not too remote for you to recollect, you may remember, that the question then ruled was whether certain evidence which the plaintiff proposed to introduce, tending to show that the route proposed by the defendants in this case did greater damage to the plaintiff in the case than was necessary, and therefore that the road was not necessary at this point. This sentence in the <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>point that I refer to is designed, as we are informed, to invoke a ruling upon substantially the same question, not based, however, on the evidence (that you did not get), but based upon what you observed on the land yourselves.</p>

The. necessity contemplated by that act of assembly is not the kind of necessity that is contemplated by this point, namely, some physical necessity that may be apparent on the plaintiff’s land, which necessity has relation to the extent of the damages that would accrue to the plaintiffs. Damages are one thing. Location is another and distinct thing. Necessity for a resort to the power of eminent domain is still another thing. We cannot say that you are entitled, in disposing of the question of damage, to decide what has not been committed to you. You have a right to dispose of the question of damages. You have a right to dispose of the kind of necessity that we have already defined, but you have not the right to dispose of the question of location and say that, according to your judgment, some other location could have been selected that would have done less damage and, therefore, that there is no necessity for this location.

The law of Pennsylvania only gives to one person in the property of another the right or privilege claimed here, when such right or privilege will not disturb the mining operations of another; if, therefore, you find from the evidence in the present case, that the construction and operation of this lateral railroad will disturb or interfere with the mining operations of the plaintiff, either by subjecting its employees to increased danger <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>in mining its coal, or by requiring a change of present or projected plans of operating the mines, or by polluting or curtailing its water supply, your verdict must be for the plaintiff, on this point, and further inquiry on the subject of damages would be unnecessary. <em>Answer: </em>You will observe that this point goes further than the other and attempts to specify the mode of interference, and this point asks us to say that such mode of interference would require you to find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in this case. This point and the one immediately preceding it, is based on an express provision of the act of assembly passed in 1888, and not on the original lateral railroad act according to the form that was then adopted. This provides “ that it shall be lawful for the owners or lessees of iron ore or coal mines to construct lateral railroads.” There were acts before this that enabled owners of iron ore or coal mines to construct lateral railroads. This act goes further and says owners or lessees shall have the right. It broadens the scope of the other acts in that respect. This was enacted in view of the fact that sometimes coal mines and iron ore mines were leased to persons who were operating such mines and the interests of such lessees required that they have the right to construct lateral railroads as well as owners. Therefore, this act was passed, or at least, that is one of the respects wherein it enlarged the scope of the previous legislation. This act, as well as some previous acts, provided that these lateral railroads could be constructed “from said lands to any railroad, public road or navigable stream, over or under, or partly over and partly under, the surface of intervening lands.” So that this legislation contemplates the fact that owners and lessees can construct railroads under the land of another person as well as over the lands of another person. They are not confined to the placing of their structure upon the surface. They may go under the land.</p>

Shall not pass through, disturb the operating, or endanger <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>the safety of any other mine.” That is the clause upon which these propositions are based.</p>

We do not recall that there is evidence that in the property under your consideration there is at present any coal mine. There is coal there that may be mined. The feature which we think vivifies this proviso is the fact that there was a possibility of running through mines, operated by the owners of them, wherein they may have their own railroads and tramways and so on, along which their own workmen may pass and repass, and that such operating by the owner of the mines might be interfered with, by the exercise of the right hereby given to another, and it was to forbid such interference, in the mines of another, that this proviso was appended. A different arrangement of substantially the same words would perhaps emphasize this still more strongly when we say “ that they shall not disturb the operating of any other mine or endanger the safety thereof ”—■“ they shall not pass through so as to disturb the operating or endanger the safety of any other mine ”—is the thing that we attempt to say. We think that this “ passing through ” is a very expressive phrase, in the mind of the draftsman of this act, and the “disturbing and endangering the safety ” takes something of the same-coloring as the “ passing through tire mine of another.”</p>

I do not think that the respects wherein interference may take place, that are adverted to in this point, are the kind of things that forbid the construction of this railroad. The point is refused.

    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.8",508,[264,753,1182,821]]]'>This case was most carefully tried by the court below, and every point raised by the learned counsel was not only considered and determined, but elaborately discussed by the court. The charge was exceptionally clear and comprehensive, and reviewed at length all the questions arising in the case. The investigation of these questions by the court as well as by the learned counsel was painstaking and exhaustive, and none of the many cases on the subject in this court escaped their attention and consideration. In his answer to the points for charge submitted by the plaintiff, as well as in the charge itself, the trial judge followed the law as enunciated in the numerous cases on the subject decided by this court. We are satisfied with the result of the trial; and the elaborate discussion of the questions by the learned judge, being in line with our own dicisions,. relieves us of the necessity of referring specifically to the assignments of error.</p>
    <p id="b508-6" data-blocks='[["BL_508.9",508,[254,1580,1192,819]],["BL_509.1",509,[156,370,1181,872]]]'>The necessity for the lateral railroad on the route selected by the petitioner was a question for the jury under proper instructions by the court. The nature and character of the necessity contemplated by the statutory provisions in order to .enable the petitioner to secure the benefit of the legislation was correctly and fully explained to the jury. This was done not only .in the general charge, but also in answer to the points for charge. The plaintiff’s contention, however, is that in submitting the question of the necessity for the road to the jury, the court erred in holding that they could not take into consideration ■that a better, cheaper and more convenient route might have been selected. But this position is clearly untenable. The ■Act of May 5,1832, P. L. 501, Purd. 1816, and its supplements, require the petitioner or petitioners for a lateral railroad 'to “ survey and mark such route as he or they shall think proper to adopt; ” and thereupon the viewers, and subsequently on <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>appeal, the court and jury shall determine the necessity for the road, and the damages sustained by the owner of the intervening lands by its construction and use. This undoubtedly excludes from the consideration of the viewers and the jury, any other route as bearing on the necessity of the location adopted by the petitioner. There may be a bettor and less expensive route; but that is a matter entirely with the petitioner and not with the landowner, and - cannot avail the latter in the determination of the necessity for the selected route. The learned counsel for the plaintiff concede that the ruling of the court below on this branch of the case is in harmony with the law as laid down by this court in Hays v. Risher, <a href="/pa/32/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="32 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="986763" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0169-01">32 Pa. 169</a>, but they deny the soundness of that decision. The argument of the learned counsel, however, has not convinced us that the reasoning of the court is unsound as alleged ; on the contrary, we think it logical, and the conclusion fully warranted by a fair interpretation of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[158,1251,1180,1179]],["BL_510.1",510,[257,366,1184,460]]]'>Under the pleadings and evidence in the case, we are not convinced that the learned court erred in its rulings on the question of damages. The statement avers that the plaintiff is the owner in fee of a large tract of land over which the proposed railroad will pass for a distance of 250 rods; that a considerable portion of the land is underlaid with the Connellsville vein of coking coal, of especial value to the plaintiff company, which is engaged in mining and operating the same from several large works in the vicinity thereof; that the surface of the land is of good quality and productive; that a certain portion of it is especially adapted as a site for a reservoir for the collection and storage of water, and has been utilized for that purpose by the plaintiff. In the general charge the court called the attention of the jury to the manner in which the plaintiff claimed that its property would be changed and affected by the location and construction of the proposed road; that it was essential that they consider all the elements of depreciation, and then determine “ whether or not the property, as a whole, has been depreciated in the market.” The learned judge directed the jury’s attention to the reservoir, its present and prospective use and value to the plaintiff, and the alleged curtailment of its capacity, and thereby the depreciation of the value of the land by the construction of the road on the plaintiff’s property. <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>He also called attention to the alleged pollution of the water flowing into the reservoir, by the construction of the road, as an element of damage to be considered by the jury. The interference in the mode of using the land for mining purposes, the Cost of fencing and the division of the land, were likewise adverted to as proper elements of damage. In short, the charge required the jury, in ascertaining the damage sustained by the plaintiff, to consider everything that injuriously affected the plaintiff’s property.</p>
    <p id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[256,831,1185,1490]]]'>It will thus be observed that the trial judge’s instructions followed the well established rules in cases of this character that the measure of damages was the difference in the market value of the whole property immediately before and after the construction of the road as affected’ thereby. The land declared in the statement to be affected is “ a large tract of land .... traversed by the proposed road.” It seems that prior to its present ownership, this land was divided into two separate farms owned by different parties. The court below, however, very properly treated them as one tract in the hands of the plaintiff in assessing the damages occasioned by the construction of the defendant’s road. The contention of the plaintiff is that the benefits and damages should have been considered not upon this property only, but upon this and other property of the plaintiff, together known as the Mammoth plant. It is alleged that the plaintiff’s testimony shows that damages were claimed because of the injury to the Mammoth plant in its entirety and that such was the proper rule to be observed in assessing the damages in this case. The trial judge however rejected this view because it was not supported by the .pleadings, and the trial had proceeded upon the theory that the damages were to be assessed for the land formerly known as the two tracts. We cannot say that this was error. The statement does not show that the land claimed to be injured is connected with or a part of the Mammoth plant. The averment that the coal under the tract is mined and operated from works in the vicinity of the tract, and that the reservoir is the only available supply for several large works of the plaintiff, does not show that it has any connection with the Mammoth plant.</p>

We are of opinion that the appellant has failed to convict the court below of error, and the assignments are therefore overruled, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
