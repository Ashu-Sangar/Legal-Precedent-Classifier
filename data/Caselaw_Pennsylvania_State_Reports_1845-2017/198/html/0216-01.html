These bonds were a part of an issue of 150 bonds of $1,000 each, with a condition that the company should, commencing with the year 1898, redeem eight of them annually, those redeemed to be determined by lot. On December 24, 1897, he sold or surrendered the said bonds at a premium of $17,750, and reinvested the proceeds of said sale, to wit: $92,750, in other securities which yield interest at the rate of five per cent per annum.</p>

The trustee has received $98.00 per share on 898 shares held by him, being $50,288 in excess of the appraised value. No part of this amount represents surplus earnings or income. In his account he claims credit for this excess and the premium received on the Fox Pressed Steel Company bonds as part of the corpus, to which exceptions are filed by the legatees for life, it being claimed that both should be distributed to them as income.</p>

A trust fund is its own insurer against all risks except the negligence of the trustee, and especially so here, as the trustees are not to be held responsible for any losses that might arise out of investments made by them in good faith, and have great discretion in making investments. The hazard of the risk is borne by both the legatee for life' and in remainder, for if there <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>be a diminution of the corpus by reason of unfortunate investments, the income as well as the corpus is thereby depleted and the loss falls on both, the former receiving less income and the latter less corpus. ’ If then, in case of a loss by reason of an unfortunate investment, it falls on both the legatees for life and in remainder, it seems but equitable that if there be a profit arising from the sale of a trust security, they should both participate in it in the same manner they would bear a loss, the former receiving more income from the increased corpus and the latter more corpus. If the profit in such a case be given as income to the legatee for life, a case might arise which would be disastrous to the legatee in remainder whilst the former would be greatly benefited. To illustrate: Suppose that this estate consisted of $10,000 invested in these bonds; that they were sold for $20,000 and the premium of $10,000 distributed as income. The next investment might prove unfortunate, the whole of the original corpus be lost, and the legatee in remainder receive nothing, whilst the legatee for life would have received absolutely the amount of the original investment. As a loss on a trust investment is deducted from the corpus, on the other hand if there be a profit surely it should be held to be an accretion to the corpus and part of it.</p>
