The person receiving the paper joined with him the other two defendants, and the three contracted in writing to give an option on the land to other persons at an advance in price over the agreement with plaintiff, but did not reveal to plaintiff the names of the purchasers. Shortly afterwards plaintiff notified the principal defendant that he had revoked the power to sell the property given to him in the agreement, and thereafter gave an option to another party to purchase the land. The defendants filed a bill in equity against plaintiff for specific performance, which bill was dismissed because the terms of the sale were never fully understood and agreed upon by the parties ; because the terms of the sale were not reduced to writing and signed by the party to be charged; and because the plaintiffs in the equity suit were not in court with clean hands. The evidence in the trespass suit showed that the plaintiff admitted substantially that it made no difference to him who became the purchaser so that he received the sum mentioned in the agreement. The evidence also showed that the principal defendant thought tha.t he had an option under his agreement with plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was not sufficient to establish the charge of conspiracy to defraud, and that a nonsuit was properly entered</p>

Also for a nonsuit as regards all of the defendants, because, whatever may be the construction placed on the agreement of August 8, 1892, it was revoked by the plaintiff on January 9, 1893. Up to that time there had been no sale of plaintiff’s farm; all that existed at that time were negotiations. Lowry was not bound to inform plaintiff of these negotiations any more than he did, either before or at the time when he revoked the contract; nor did the plaintiff make any inquiry as to any of the details in relation thereto.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b144-9" data-blocks='[["BL_144.9",144,[278,1732,1185,249]]]'>3. There is no evidence as to any damage at all to the plaintiff, prior to the filing of the bill.

The testimony of Pollock throughout shows great anxiety on his part to dispose of his farm to any person who would pay his price therefor. In 1890, a contract to sell the farm was given to Lowry in which the price was fixed at $12,000 ; some time after the expiration of that contract another was given in which the price was fixed at $12,500. No purchaser was obtained under these contracts, and a third agreement, that of August 8, 1892, was executed by Pollock and Lowry.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.7",145,[198,1209,1178,714]]]'>Under the last agreement Lowry and the other defendants were exceedingly active in their endeavors to procure a purchaser ; Lowry advised Pollock from time to time that he expected to consummate the sale, and upon several occasions told him that if the prospective purchasers failed to purchase, “ we will take it ourselves.” Sui'ely Pollock understood by that language that Lowry and some one associated with him contemplated becoming purchasers of the farm under certain contingencies at the price named in the contract of August 8. He also had conversations with Stewart about the sale and the terms of payment, and at Stewart’s request notified the tenant to quit, and at the trial of this case admitted substantially that it made no difference to him who became the purchaser, so that he received $13,000.</p>

That Lowry’s construction of the agreement of August 8, 1892, was erroneous is undeniable, but his error in that respect did not amount to fraud, and what his liability would have been to Pollock in the event of a sale to Chaudon and Crawford at $250 per acre does not arise in this case.</p>
