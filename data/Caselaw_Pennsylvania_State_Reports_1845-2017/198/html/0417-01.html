There was nothing in the church records to show a dedication. Plaintiff offered to show by declarations of members of the congregation who were also trustees of the church that the land in controversy was included in the burial ground, and that the church building was not to be extended over the land. All of these persons were dead at the time of the hearing before the master, and there was no evidence that they had authority to bind the corporation. Plaintiff did not purchase her lots until many years after these declarations were made. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the declarations offered in evidence were inadmissible; (2) that the plaintiff was bound by the records of the church; (3) that there was no error in dismissing plaintiff’s bill.</p>

The church was erected upon the front of tlie lot, and the rear portion was-used as a burial ground. By the act of February 26, 1861, the church was given authority to sell burial lots. Plaintiff owned two lots, one of which she bought in 1871, and the other in 1889. One of the avenues in the church land was known as West avenue. All interments were made east of this avenue, and the space between the church wall and the west line of West avenue was an unoccupied strip of ground in the shape of a sodded terrace, and had never been used for interments. This is the land in controversy. In 1889 the church proposed to extend the pulpit projection so as to cover a portion of' this space. The proposed extension did not affect plaintiff’s lots nor did it in any way encroach upon West avenue. There was offered in evidence a plan prepared by Samuel Wakeling in 1861, which did not show any burial lots laid out on the land in controversy. No record of the church was produced showing any dedication of the land for burial purposes. Samuel Wakeling testified as to declarations made by certain trustees of the church in 1859 which tended to show that they understood that the space in controversy was part of the burial grounds. The master recommended that the bill should be dismissed. On exceptions to his report the master filed a supplemental report which was in part as follows :</p>

All these four persons were deceased at the time Mr. Wakeling was examined, and their declarations were offered in evidence as within the exception to the rule against hearsay, which allows such testimony in respect to boundaries, and in support of his position the counsel for the plaintiff cited Starkie on Evidence, 47, 51, 52, Wharton on Evidence, sec. 191, Cauffman v.
