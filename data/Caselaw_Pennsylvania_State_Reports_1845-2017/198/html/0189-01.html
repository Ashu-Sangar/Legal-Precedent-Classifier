The plaintiff was engaged in the manufacture and sale of building bricks and had in contemplation the test and purchase of clays suitable to the manufacture of sewer pipe, terra-cotta, fireproofing, etc. The defendant was engaged in the manufacture and sale of fire brick and sewer pipe. The New Jersey corporation was registered under the same name as the Pennsylvania corporation in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth and thereby obtained a license to transact business under that name in Pennsylvania. It established its main office in the city of Pittsburg and carried on an extensive business. Both companies in advertisements, letter-heads, envelopes and all other similar matters used the same name, but after the attention of the New Jersey company had been called to the matter, it added the words “ Of New Jersey ” in red ink under its <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>name. The result of the similarity of names was great confusion between the parties in the matter of telephone address and delivery of mail, and in the making of checks and drafts by their correspondents. It was not alleged that the defendant company chose its name and was incorporated with a fraudulent intention, or with the object of competing with the plaintiff, or for the purpose of inducing the public to purchase its wares under the impression that they were those of the plaintiff.</p>

It frequently happens, however, that persons or companies have the same name, or names so similar as to be, in effect, the same; and this must necessarily give rise to confusion and annoyance to the parties themselves, and often to persons dealing with them, and sometimes to an unfair and fraudulent advantage to one party and loss to the other, by reason of such confusion in the minds of third persons. In the case of individuals whose names are acquired by usage from their parents and used from infancy, long before their holders entered upon any business, there can usually be no complaint of such an accidental similarity of names, although it may give rise to annoyance and loss. In the case of associations voluntarily formed and named, whether chartered or not, there is an opportunity to avoid such difficulty by refraining from choosing a name identical with or similar to that of associations already in existence. In the case of partnerships this is usually, perhaps always, done by those forming new associations, unless they have carelessly omitted to ascertain the existence of the prior named association, or have adopted its name with a fraudulent purpose. The same may be said of the formation of corporations, with the additional circumstance that the law requires those who desire to be incorporated to give public notice, which includes the name by which they desire to be chartered; and the authorities empowered to grant charters will not allow the use of a name theretofore appropriated. It seems, however, that the law of Pennsylvania does not provide for notice of the proposed registration of a foreign corporation, or enable the registering officer to refuse such registration where <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>the name of the corporation has already been used in creating a domestic corporation. This would seem to be an omission calling for a legislative remedy. There is no doubt, and it is not necessary to cite cases to the effect that, where a name is used, even that of an individual, for a fraudulent purpose, its use will be enjoined, and this notwithstanding the issuance of a charter by the public authorities allowing the use of the name. We know of no case, however, in which it has been held that the use of a name which merely produces confusion in correspondence and inconvenience to the parties and those dealing with them has been made a ground of equitable interference. In every case which has been cited and in which an injunction has been granted, there has been an allegation of fraudulent advantage taken or intended to be taken by the new association over the old. While the circumstances of this case are unfortunate and sure to give rise to trouble to both parties, and we think that the defendant company exercised but little care in its choice of a name, yet, under the circumstances, we do not see that the plaintiff is entitled to a remedy in equity.</p>

    <p id="b218-4" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[278,775,1187,1646]]]'>In the very recent case of North Cheshire <em>&amp; </em>Manchester Brewing Co. v. Manchester Brewing Co., supra, the house of lords affirmed the decision of the court of appeal, enjoining the defendant from taking even as a second or subordinate part of its corporate title, the name of an older corporation. The facts as stated in the syllabus were that the Manchester Brewing Company, Limited, had carried on business under that name for years. The appellants bought an old business called the North Cheshire Brewing Company, Limited, and then (without intending to deceive) got themselves incorporated and registered under the name North Cheshire and Manchester Brewing Company, Limited. It was held that as a matter of fact the name of the appellant company was calculated to deceive, and that the appellant must, therefore, be restrained by injunction in the usual way. Halsbuky, Lord Chancellor, said, “ The real question is in a single sentence. Is this name so nearly resembling the name of another firm as to be likely to deceive ? ” And again, “ It is not necessary to consider what the statute has done in respect of registration, or the known state of the law as it existed before the statute was passed, because here it seems to me to be the same question; This being a limited company, in order to have a title you must register your title, and if you register your title in such a way as is calculated to deceive, that is the same question that the' court would have had to decide before the act of parliament had passed at all. ... In the result it is perfectly immaterial to my mind for the purpose of the decision of this case whether they were fraudulent or not. The question is whether this is an injury to the plaintiff’s right. If it is an injury to the plaintiff’s right it is perfectly immaterial whether they intended it or not. The court must restrain them from that which is injuring another person, however inadvertently they may have done it.”</p>

A company had been formed including in its corporate title the names of Holmes and Booth, two of its stockholders and directors. Some years later, Holmes, Booth and other stockholders formed a new corporation which assumed the name of Holmes, Booth &amp; Atwood Mfg. Co. On a bill by the first corporation the supreme court of errors of Connecticut enjoined the use of Holmes and Booth’s names in the title, saying, “ The law having authorized the selection of a name and having declared the name so selected to be the name of the corporation, we see no reason why the law should not protect the corporation in the use of that name, on the same principle and to the same extent that individuals are protected in the use of trade-marks. Hence it necessarily follows that corporations in the exercise of discretionary powers conferred by the statute, must so exercise them as not to infringe upon the established legal rights of others. . . .The existence of the consequences does not necessarily depend upon the question whether fraud or an evil intent does or does not exist. The quo animo therefore would seem to be an immaterial inquiry.”</p>

It is conceded that the defendant could not have been chartered as a Pennsylvania corporation by its present name, because that name was already appropriated by the plaintiff. The law requires notice to be published among other things of the name of an intended corporation, and the authority granting the charter is required to see that the corporation will not be “injurious to the community.” Part of the intent of the act has always been understood to be to prevent confusion of titles and to protect the first taker of the name which has assumed the responsibilities and paid for the privileges of incorporation.

In these days of telephone, telegraph and fast transportation, when it may be said more’ significantly than ever before that time is money, such confusion and delay are manifestly a serious business injury. But even without this, the authorities have settled that <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>the exclusive right of a corporation to its name is one that of itself carries the presumption of injury by interference and will therefore be protected./In Fort Pitt Bldg. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Model Plan Bldg. &amp; Loan Assn., <a href="/pa/159/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="159 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="850158" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0308-01">159 Pa. 308</a>, there was a bill to enjoin the defendant from using the name “ Fort Pitt ” which had been added to its original title by a decree of court. The bill averred irreparable injury by interference, etc., and on demurrer this court awarded a perpetual injunction. It was held that the jurisdiction of the courts to grant the amendment to defendant’s charter had been taken away by a later statute, and defendant therefore had not even color of right to the title. Except for that difference the case is on all fours with the present and would be controlling authority without further argument. But on the question of damage to bring the case within equity jurisdiction, Sterbett, C. J., said, “ The name being an essential in plaintiff’s corporate existence, its further wrongful use by defendant will have the natural tendency to injuriously affect plaintiff’s identity and business. For this the law has no adequate remedy, and resort was taken to the equitable remedy by injunction,” citing Newby v. Oregon R. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Deady%20609" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="1 Deady 609">1 Deady, 609</a>, where it was said “ under the law the corporate name is a necessary element of the corporation’s existence. Without it a corporation cannot exist. Any act which produces confusion or uncertainty concerning this name is well calculated to injuriously affect the identity and business of a corporation. And as a matter of fact, in some degree at least, the natural and necessary consequence of the wrongful appropriation of a corporate name is to injure the business and rights of the corporation by destroying or confusing its identity. The motives of the persons attempting the wrongful appropriation are not material.”</p>
