    <p class="summary" id="b422-8" data-blocks='[["BL_422.14",422,[254,1041,1183,552]]]'>The attorney general, on behalf of the commonwealth, has filed a bill to restrain the defendant from using the name “University of Philadelphia ” in connection with his business of keeping a school for commercial instruction. The facts as averred in the bill, and admitted to be true by the demurrer, are that the defendant is the proprietor of a business school in this city, and formerly carried on his school under the name of “ Banks’ Business College,” but recently he has assumed the name and title of the University of Philadelphia. In a pamphlet or prospectus in which he advertises his business, the defendant states that:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b422-9" data-blocks='[["BL_422.15",422,[252,1611,1186,355]]]'>“ The aim of the University is to thoroughly equip young men and young women to fill satisfactorily to themselves and their employers, any position of a clerical nature which may be open to them, to develop every latent quality or talent they possess which could increase their efficiency and so train them by actual, practical work as to enable them to fill intelligently the higher' grades of positions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b422-10" data-blocks='[["BL_422.16",422,[252,1973,1186,394]]]'>“We have no desire to make the school a machine for the transformation of students into mechanical bookkeepers and stenographers, but train our pupils to think and reason along broad lines and give them a liberal education, endeavoring to be not merely teachers of book facts, but of common sense, sound judgment and the underlying principles of business which open up wide avenues of success and usefulness in the bush ness world.</p>

In one class of schools you are too much of a theorist and not enough of a practician. The other extreme is pursued by another class, too much of a virtue being made of ‘Actual business from the start,’ ‘ Learn by doing,’ ” etc.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[281,558,1185,290]]]'>Two questions arise upon these facts: First, Has the defendant a right to use the word “ University ” as descriptive of the institution or business conducted, by him ? and, second, Is the method adopted in this case proper for preventing the defendant from calling his institution a university, in case he is not entitled to use that word ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b424-6" data-blocks='[["BL_424.6",424,[273,867,1190,1436]]]'>A short but comprehensive definition of the word “university” is an aggregation or union of colleges. It is an institution in which the education imparted is universal, embracing many branches, such as the arts, sciences and all manner of learning, and possessing power to confer degrees which indicate proficiency in the branches taught. In the collegiate department, or department of arts, as it has been called, the ordinary scholastic education is imparted, upon which the degree of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts is conferred; in the medical department the degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred, and in the law department the degree of Bachelor of Laws. The medical department is also subdivided into branches or special departments, such as dental surgery and veterinary medicine, etc. The words “school,” “academy” and “ college ” are applied to institutions which are confined to some special course of instruction. These words, “school,” “academy” and “college,” have become common dictionary words which maybe appropriated by any person. Thus we see the term swimming school, skating school, bicycle school, dancing academy, business college, and the like in common use. In some of the western states, it is true, the word “ university ” is also freely adopted and used by institutions which do not include all departments of learning, but as no complaint seems to have been made against them, and no laws have been passed to prevent the use of that word in those states, we know of no instance in which an attempt has been made to prevent the use of the word “university” as applied to an institution which is confined to a special course of instruction.</p>

L. 327, for the incorporation of institutions of learning, with power to <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>confer degrees in art, science, philosophy, literature, medicine, law and theology, and for the supervision and regulation of such institutions, there was created a board styled the College and University Council, which shall consist of twelve members, viz: the governor, attorney general and the superintendent of public instruction, who shall be members ex officio, three persons selected from the presiding officers of undenominational colleges or universities of this commonwealth, three persons selected from the presiding officers of denominational colleges or universities of this commonwealth, and three persons holding official relationship to the common schools of the state. No new institution shall be authorized to confer degrees until the college and university council shall have considered its application and approved the same. The rights of previously existing colleges to confer degrees are preserved. As a university is an institution authorized to confer degrees, and no university can be established without the approval of the college and university council, and as the defendant has no such authority conferred upon him, therefore he has no right to use the name and title of University of Philadelphia in connection with his business.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[170,1464,1182,717]]]'>There is located in the city of Philadelphia an institution entitled the University of Pennsylvania, and it is averred in the bill that the school of the defendant has been frequently mistaken for the University of Pennsylvania, and numerous letters intended for the provost of the University of Pennsylvania, and members of its faculty, have been directed by persons residing in other states and countries to the University of Philadelphia. The similarity of name between the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Philadelphia misleads persons into making mistakes in correspondence, and those mistakes would entitle the University of Pennsylvania, and persons dealing with it, to protection under the law relating to trade-marks, against the use of a name which is similar in point of territorial designation and misleads the public.</p>
