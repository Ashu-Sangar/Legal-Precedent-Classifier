At the time the agreement was made, they concealed from their cotenants the fact that they had an offer from one R. to take the property and pay the owners one half of the proceeds of the sale of the gas. On the same day that they made the agreement with the cotenants, they entered into a contract with R. by which they were to receive one half of the proceeds. The contract with R. was subsequently assigned to a corporation. The cotenants after they discovered the fraud notified the corporation of the facts, and warned the corporation not to make further payment to A. and B. Subsequently a bill in equity was filed by the owners against A. and B. and the corpol'ation. In this proceeding an account was stated between A. and B. and the owners, in which A. and B. were charged with a large sum under the R. contract, and given credit for various expenses. A decree was then entered that A. and B. should pay to the owners the net amount found due by the master less their own share as owners, and in default of such payment by them that the corporation should pay such amount. <em>Held, </em>that there was no error in the decree.</p>

This offer they concealed from their co-owners, and on the same day on which they entered into the agreement, they entered into a contract with Redic in accordance with the terms of his offer.
