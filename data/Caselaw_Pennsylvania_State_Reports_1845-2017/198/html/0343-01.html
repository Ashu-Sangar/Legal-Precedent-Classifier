    <p class="syllabus" id="b367-7" data-blocks='[["BL_367.7",367,[168,959,1179,731]]]'>A coal mining company, mining coal under a lease, was sued by the owner of the surface for injuries to the surface, and judgment was entered against it, which judgment was paid. Subsequently the coal company brought an action against its lessor to recover the amount of the judgment which it had paid. In its statement of claim it set up the payment of the judgment, and also the lease, which contained the following words: “ And all damages direct or consequential, and claims therefor resulting from the mining and removal of said coal in the doing of any and all matters and things hereinbefore described, are hereby waived and relinquished by the said party of the first part, provided that the party of the second part takes all ordinai’y precautions usually taken in mining and removing coal.” The defendant demurred to the statement. <em>Held </em>(1) that plaintiff was bound under the lease to afford proper support to the overlying surface ; (2) that the admission by plaintiff in its statement that there had been a recovery against it for failing to afford support, was an admission that it had not used all ordinary precautions in giving proper support to the surface; (3) that there was no error in sustaining the demurrer.</p>

Thereupon this coal company brought the present suit to compel Hopkins, the appellee, and its lessor, to pay what it, in pursuance of the judgment against it, had paid to Robertson, together with costs and expenses. The judgment now reviewed was in favor of the defendant on his demurrer to plaintiff’s statement. Turning to it, we find the following clause from the lease, upon which the right to recover depends: “ And together .with said coal, and as appurtenant thereto is hereby granted and conveyed the free and uninterrupted right of way over, into, under and through the said tract as above described, at, to and from such point or points, and in such manner as may be necessary, proper or convenient for the purpose of digging, mining and transporting or carrying away any and all of the said veins or strata of coal hereby demised.

And all damages direct or consequential and claims therefor, resulting from the mining and removal of said coal in the doing of any and all the matters and things hereinbefore described are hereby waived and relinquished by the said party of the first part, provided the party of the second part takes all ordinary precautions usually taken in mining and removing coal.”</p>

The question is, therefore, simply whether under the lease by Hopkins to the coal company he is bound to reimburse it for the damages recovered against it by Robertson, a stranger to the agreement, whose surface had subsided as a result of the removal of the coal beneath it. The contention of the plaintiff is that Hopkins must pay, because a covenant to protect it is found in the following words of the clause quoted: “And all damages direct or consequential and claims therefor, resulting from the mining and removal of said coal, in the doing of any and all the matters and things hereinbefore described, are hereby waived and relinquished by the said party of the first part; ” but, even if it be true that such covenant is there found, the concluding words, “ provided the party of the second part takes all ordinary precautions usually taken in mining and removing coal,” seem to be overlooked. “ Ordinary precautions ” mean, in mining coal, proper support to the overlying surface: Jones v.

Such admission was fatal. The court below properly so regarded it in denying the appellant’s right to recover. We need consider nothing else brought to our attention by the appellant or the appellee, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
