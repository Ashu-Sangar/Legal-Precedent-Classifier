At the time he was being drawn on the sled by a little girl ten years old, who was the only person who saw the accident. She said that the boy fell from the sled, but did not explain what caused him to fall. She stated that there was a slope in the sidewalk towards the street at the point where the boy fell. At this point there had been a cut after the sidewalk was built and alongside of it to the extent of from two to three feet. This cut had been made by a street railway company. The plaintiff failed to show that there was any defect in the construction or repair of the sidewalk, and the evidence on the part of the defendant was that the walk was in good repair, level and not broken at the time and place of the accident.</p>
