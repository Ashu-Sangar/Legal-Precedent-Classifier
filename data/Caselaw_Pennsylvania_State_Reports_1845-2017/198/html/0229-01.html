The plaintiff and defendant on April 1,1896, entered into a contract of partnership in the business of civil and mining engineering and surveying, by the firm name of Edeburn, Cooper &amp; Company, the partnership to begin the first of January, 1897, and to be terminated at any time by any of the parties upon thirty days’ notice. It was provided by the articles of the association of that date, that the plans, maps, etc., .then in their possession, should be valued at $12,000, and that upon the death of either of the parties, the firm should pay to his heirs and assigns his proportion of that amount increased by $400 a year, as an estimated increase in the value of the stock, and that if either W. A. Edeburn or C. A. Cooper should conclude to retire from the firm, the retiring member should offer to the remaining member one half' of his interest in the firm on the basis aforesaid, and that the other members of the firm, being the other two plaintiffs, should take the remaining one half of the stock on the same basis, and that the purchase money bear interest until paid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b254-9" data-blocks='[["BL_254.14",254,[268,1934,1184,508]]]'>2. On January 8, 1899, an agreement under seal was made between the parties, plaintiff and defendant, whereby, in consideration of the sum of $4,517.68, the defendant bargained and sold to the plaintiffs all his right and interest in the business and property of the firm of Edeburn, Cooper &amp; Company, and agreed that he would not again engage in the same business in the county of Allegheny without the consent of the plaintiffs, but provided that this agreement should not prevent his surveying lots of which he should have exclusive control, as real estate agent.</p>

At tbe time of tbe making of this contract Mr. Edebnrn intended to engage in the business of real estate agent in partnership with one J. R. Cooper, a brother of C. A.

    <p class="summary" id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[194,686,1179,603]]]'>4. At the time of the signing of this contract Mr. Edeburn knew that it contained the agreement not to engage in business in the county, and suggested the provision allowing him to survey lots of which he should be exclusive agent for sale. He alleges that before the signing of the paper it was agreed between himself and at least some of the plaintiffs, that in case he should want to go out of the real estate business upon some contingency which is not explained, he should be taken back into the firm upon repaying the money taken out by him and a reasonable addition ; this is denied by all three of the plaintiffs, and there is no evidence to sustain the allegation except that of the defendant himself.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b255-10" data-blocks='[["BL_255.10",255,[193,2031,1180,292]]]'>1. The agreement that is alleged by the defendant to allow him to re-enter the firm upon payment of certain moneys, if he should desire to retire from the real estate business, is not claimed to have been made with all the parties plaintiff, and the proof is manifestly insufficient to vary or alter the written instrument.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[268,531,1186,919]]]'>8. It is earnestly contended by the defendant that no good and sufficient consideration has been shown for a contract in restraint of trade. It is claimed that because the purchase money of $4,517.63, paid by the plaintiffs to the defendant, is the exact amount of the interest of the defendant in the firm, calculated bjr valuing the maps, plans, etc., at $12,000 with an increase of $400 per year on January 1, 1899, it therefore appears that the plaintiffs were bound by the original contract of partnership to pay Edeburn, the defendant, upon his retirement from the firm, this exact amount, and that therefore, its payment furnishes no consideration for the contract which is in partial restraint of trade. This, however, is founded upon a misunderstanding as we take it, of the contract of partnership which does not bind C. A. Cooper to take from W. A. Edeburn one half of his stock on the basis above mentioned upon the dissolution of the firm, but only binds Edeburn, if he shall conclude to retire from the firm, to offer the one half of his stock to C. A. Cooper at that price.</p>
