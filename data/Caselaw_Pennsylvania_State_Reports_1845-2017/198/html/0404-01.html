    <p class="syllabus" id="b428-7" data-blocks='[["BL_428.7",428,[295,632,1185,590]]]'>On a bill in equity for an accounting of a partnership, it appeared that plaintiff and defendant had been engaged in business, and while so engaged they executed an agreement by the terms of which plaintiff assigned to defendant his interest in the stock, good-will and fixtures of the business, agreeing, however, to remain as manager, receiving as compensation one half of the net profits of the business. It was also provided that instead of plaintiff’s name, which had heretofore been used, a trade-name should be adopted. Plaintiff averred that when this agreement was executed, it was not intended to work a dissolution, that there was no consideration for it, and that he was induced to sign it as a favor to defendant, who was a sergeant of police, and who was desirous of concealing the fact that he was engaged in business. The evidence tended to establish the facts as claimed by the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that a decree in favor of plaintiff should be sustained.</p>
