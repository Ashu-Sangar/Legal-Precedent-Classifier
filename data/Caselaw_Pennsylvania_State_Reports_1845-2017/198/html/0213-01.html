    <p class="syllabus" id="b237-8" data-blocks='[["BL_237.8",237,[191,1383,1179,1023]]]'>On the trial of an issue devisavit vel non, it appeared that the plaintiff was the nephew and sole heir of testatrix, and that he and his aunt were tenants in common of the land upon which his aunt resided. The defendant was alleged by plaintiff to have been the confidential adviser of the testatrix with whom she consulted about all her affairs, and with whom she consulted about making her will. By her will she gave practically all of her estate to the defendant. The evidence tended to show that on the day after testatrix had consulted with defendant about her will, defendant took a scrivener to the hospital where the testatrix was ill, that he remained in the room while preparations were being made for drawing the will, and that during the writing of the will he remained in a nearby corridor. After the will was drawn defendant and the scrivener retained possession of the paper until after the death of testatrix. There was evidence that the testatrix at the time of signing the will was weakened from illness, and from the use of liquor. After the will was probated, but before an appeal was taken, plaintiff joined with defendant in two general warranty deeds for a portion of the land to a railroad company. In these deeds there was a recital that the defendant held an interest in the land as devisee of testatrix. It also appeared that at the time of the execution of these deeds, defendant released mortgages on portions'of the land conveyed to the railroad. The case was submitted to the jury and a verdict and judgment rendered for the plaintiff. The six judges of the Supreme Court who heard the case were equally divided in opinion and the judgment was affirmed.</p>
