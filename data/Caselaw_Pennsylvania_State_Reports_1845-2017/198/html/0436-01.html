Coburn, was on August 23, 1893, a passenger on a train of defendant, and that as the train approached Ridgely where the plaintiff intended to alight, he went out on the platform of the car on which he was riding, and while the train was slowing down he descended the steps holding the hand rail, and when he reached the third step, it either broke under his weight or was not in position, so that he fell under the wheels of the car and was injured. Defendant’s evidence tended to show that the step was in position and in good condition, and that the plaintiff fell as the result of hurriedly endeavoring to alight from the train before it stopped.</p>

A man cannot shut his eyes and walk downstairs and if he falls say, I thought there was a step there and there was not, but as the place he walks in becomes more dangerous, he must become more careful and look out for the safety of himself and other people.] [4]</p>

It was a charge which presented to the consideration of the jury every possible phase of the case which assisted them in the ascertainment of the facts disclosed by the testimony. It was a case in which they undoubtedly sympathized with the plaintiff, but in which they were constrained by the evidence to render a verdict against him. As nothing appears in the evidence which would justify a reversal of the <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>verdict, it remains to be seen whether the court erred in any material respect in its instructions in the general charge, or in its answers to the plaintiff’s first, sixth and seventh points. We find nothing in either of the matters referred to which requires or calls for a. new trial. All the specifications of error are accordingly dismissed.</p>
