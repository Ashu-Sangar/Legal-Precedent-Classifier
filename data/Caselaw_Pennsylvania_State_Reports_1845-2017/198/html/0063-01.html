Brent Swearingen, assignee of Fleming Brothers, a creditor of the Sewickley Dairy Company, sought to surcharge the accountant with the amount of unpaid stock subscriptions which he had not collected from the dairy company. The assignment to the accountant was made on January 5, 1891, and his final account was filed on June 13, 1897. On the subject of the failure of the assignee to collect the unpaid stock subscriptions, the auditor found the following facts:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b88-3" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[268,364,1185,351]]]'>
      <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>1. The stockholders of the Sewickley Dairy Company, at a meeting held on. September 15, 1888, for the purpose of increasing the- capital stock from $7,000 to $400,000, passed a resolution “ that the directors of the company be and are hereby authorized to issue said stock from time to time in such manner as they may deem proper for property, real and personal, to be purchased by the company or upon subscription.”</p>

From time to time thereafter, to and including May 14, 1889, the board of directors made certain calls or assessments upon the capital stock, aggregating seventy-five per cent of the par value thereof, which assessments were duly paid by the stockholders.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.6",88,[270,982,1182,189]]]'>3. On May 14, 1889, at a meeting of the board of directors, it was resolved “ that 300 shares of the capital stock of the company be reserved as treasury stock only to be sold at par on order of the board of directors.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.7",88,[270,1188,1183,460]]]'>4. On June 11, 1889, at a regular meeting of the board of directors, the following resolution was adopted: “Resolved, That the company purchase from J. K. Fleming the right of way for a road from the borough of Sewickley to the property of the company, running through the property of John C. and David Anderson and others, for the sum of $42,500 in cash. On motion of Mr. Duncan, the treasurer was authorized to call an assessment of $25.00 per share on the stock subscribed, payable July 1, 1889, to pay for the above right of way.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b88-7" data-blocks='[["BL_88.8",88,[269,1654,1183,252]]]'>5. The right of way referred to in the resolution was a right for the construction of a highway through certain properties leading from the borough of Sewickley to a dairy farm, by which the latter could be reached over a shorter and better route than any already existing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b88-8" data-blocks='[["BL_88.9",88,[268,1912,1181,459]]]'>6. This right of way Mr. J. Kidd Fleming, vice president and active manager of the company, proposed to deliver to the company at an estimated value of $42,500, being twenty-five per cent of the par value of 1,700 shares of stock, making said stock full paid. This proposed transfer was to be made by Mr. Fleming on behalf and for the benefit of the individual holders of the 1,700 shares of stock, the company to credit said stockholders with $25.00 per share upon each share of stock held by them.</p>

The stock thus sold, together with the 300 shares reserved as treasury stock, left unissued, at the date of the assignment on January 5, 1891, 340 shares.</p>

The special facts in regard to those stockholders will be considered in the case of Swearingen v. Sowickley Dairy Company, Byer’s Appeal, post, p. , and are not material here.</p>
    <p id="b91-4" data-blocks='[["BL_91.5",91,[169,700,1183,912]]]'>The accountant was assignee for the benefit of the creditors of the Sewickley Dairy Company. When he took charge as assignee he found that although the company was insolvent in the sense that it could not pay its debts currently as they fell due, yet its assets were apparently nearly double its liabilities. He sold the personalty for nearly twice its appraised value, and a part of the realty, also at a price above its appraisement. The largest part of the assets, however, was in land, which was still in his hands, when owing to dissatisfaction and differences of opinion he resigned and filed his account. The auditor found expressly that the assignee had used ordinary care, prudence and diligence in his management of the estate, and in reference to the particular item on which it is now sought to surcharge him, the auditor found that he had taken the opinion of counsel and had been advised that if he had any right to sue on behalf of the company, which was at least doubtful, it could not be exercised until the other assets had been administered and shown to be insufficient.</p>
