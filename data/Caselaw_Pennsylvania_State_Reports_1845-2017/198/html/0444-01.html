M. It. Muckle, Jr. &amp; Company, contracted with Payne &amp; Company to put in the mechanical plant consisting of heating, lighting, power elevators, etc. Wilson Brothers and Company were the architects employed by the owner to design and superintend the construction of the building. The contract called for elevators of the Sprague-Pratt multiple sheave style, to be equipped with Ellithorpe’s air cushions.

In the answers of the court to the defendants’ points, nothing appears which seems to require a new trial. The motion for the latter was carefully considered in an opinion filed, and resulted in a refusal of it. The specifications of error are accordingly dismissed.</p>
