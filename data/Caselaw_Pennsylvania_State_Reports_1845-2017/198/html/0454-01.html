By will the cestui que trust devised the property in trust until the decease of the last survivor of her children, to pay the net income to her children, and after the death of the last survivor to divide the principal in a manner specified among the descendants of her children. By a codicil she excluded a son and his descendants from sharing in her estate, but directed that the son should be paid a specified annuity during his life, and also gave her husband an annuity. After the death of testatrix a petition was presented to the orphans’ court for the sale of the real estate covered by (he deed of trust. The son who had been excluded by the codicil resisted the petition. <em>Held, </em>that the orphans’ court had jurisdiction to order the sale for the benefit of the estate, and as the proceeds of the sale would be held in trust in the exact place of the property sold, the question of the validity of the appointments by the will of the cestui que trust was premature.</p>
