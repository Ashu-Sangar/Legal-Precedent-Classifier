Kuhn had been sold by the sheriff in August, 1895, and purchased by Emma S. Kuhn, who used it in her business until she made a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors to J ames H. Scott on May 22, 1897. Defendant claimed that there had been an actual sale of the fountain to D. C. Kuhn, and that the lease was merely given as security for the payment of notes that Kuhn had made to cover the monthly instalments.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b309-5" data-blocks='[["BL_309.6",309,[274,1135,700,44]]]'>The court charged in part as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b309-6" data-blocks='[["BL_309.7",309,[229,1186,1176,1028]]]'>[Now, unless there was an absolute purchase, and that purchase consummated before this lease was signed, the defense would fall on that head. But according to Mr. Kuhn’s own testimony, I hardly think there was any consummation of this negotiation or arrangement for the purchase of this until this paper was signed, and it was signed as a lease. The paper says so. He admits he signed this, and the testimony of the other two witnesses for the plaintiff is to the effect that there never was any sale except this agreement. It will not do for the jury to take his testimony against the testimony of two other men and also the paper itself. A man is presumed to know what he signs—is bound by it. The paper was signed by Mr. Kuhn, and, in addition to signing the agreement, he signed this note at the bottom of it: “I have received a copy of the above agreement, and have no understanding, verbal or otherwise, different from it.” And yet he comes into court and sets up a totally different agreement from this that he signed, and from that note that he signed at the bottom of this paper. If this was the contract between the parties, that defense of its being a purchase in place of a lease falls to the ground.] [4]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b309-7" data-blocks='[["BL_309.8",309,[231,2222,1175,199]],["BL_310.1",310,[262,359,1183,822]]]'>[The other ground is that there was a sheriff’s sale. According to the testimony, and admitted even by Mr. Kuhn himself, when he failed in business there was a sheriff’s sale of his premises. Notice had been given to the sheriff by Lippincott <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>&amp; Company that they claimed this soda water apparatus, and that it was not the property of D. C. Kuhn. He said that no notice was given at the sheriff’s sale about it, but the witness for the plaintiff testifies that express notice was given at the sale, and that the sheriff refused to sell it, when Kuhn or his attorney insisted upon the sheriff selling the interest of D. C. Kuhn, and, according to that witness, the sheriff knocked it down at $1.00, as Mr. Kuhn says, in the name of his wife. Why, the very fact shows that it was not a bona fide sale of this, and it is admitted by .the defendant that Mrs. Kuhn knew of this lease. She bought with knowledge of this lease. She had no rights therein superior to D. C. Kuhn himself; and it is the same as if D. C. Kuhn was to-day defending in this action, because her title or rights do not rise any higher than his. She bought simply his interest, whatever it was, and that interest is subject to this lease.] [5]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[257,1188,1186,925]]]'>[From the testimony it seems that Kuhn had paid the $1,000 at the time the lease was signed, and he paid for some fourteen or fifteen months the notes that he gave at the time, amounting altogether to $2,800 of payments. It is said that Kuhn gave notes for these and future payments. That is perfectly proper, perfectly proper to give the notes, if it was a lease, and the lease would be security for the unpaid purchase money, that is, the unpaid money on the arrangement to purchase this apparatus. I say the lease itself is security for those future payments, and so the notes would simply be for the same purpose, and there is no impropriety in speaking of the leas'e being security for those notes, because the notes correspond precisely with the payments set forth in the lease. Notes were given, I suppose, simply as a matter of convenience, because when he paid a note he would lift it. If he had not given any notes there would have to be a credit and receipt for each payment; but when he lifted the note it was evidence of payment—evidence of the monthly payment according to the lease.] [6]</p>

Occasionally it is a great hardship. We sometimes have in court a case where a woman has got a sewing machine on a lease, or furniture for the house, and after paying one half or two thirds, perhaps, of the amount, got a little in arrears, and the landlord comes and <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>levies upon it and takes it, and the person forfeits what has been paid—a great hardship in that, and our sympathies are often with the poor, who are then made the victims ; and sometimes they are the victims of unconscionable landlords in cases of this kind. But this is not a case of that kind. Very evidently it was the design of Mr. Kuhn to get this property without paying the future instalments. The defendant contends that that sheriff’s sale to his wife for $1.00, paying nothing afterward, cut out entirely the plaintiff’s claim here, and that not a dollar more could be recovered by the plaintiff. Mrs. Kuhn could, as a matter of course, have continued to pay these instalments, and in that way finally got a perfect title to this apparatus; but not a dollar was paid by her; but, relying presumably upon that sheriff’s sale, she wanted to claim title under that, and in that way prevent the plaintiff from ever getting another dollar on his contract. In addition to that, Mr. Kuhn moved this apparatus from the place where it was put up, in direct violation of the covenant in this lease that he would not move it without the consent of the lessor. The agent here assisted in moving it to the place on Wood street, but says that Mr. Kuhn told him that he had the consent of Lippincott &amp; Company for the removal of it. There is no evidence that he ever got the consent of Lippincott &amp; Company for the removal of it.] [7]</p>

    <p id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.6",312,[254,389,1184,768]]]'>The appellant asserts that the principal question for consideration in this case is whether the agreement for the transfer of the soda water fountain was a bailment' or a conditional sale. The jury found by their verdict that it was a bailment. If the verdict was warranted by the evidence and no error was committed in the instructions to the jury, the verdict and the judgment thereon must prevail against the appellant’s claim. The written agreement of the parties appears on its face as a bailment. It is clearly within Rowe v.
