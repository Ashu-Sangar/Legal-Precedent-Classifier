The assignee has not yet completed the conversion of the assets or made any final distribution of the proceeds thereof, and the deficiency as regards payment to the creditors is not ascertained. The statute of Colorado fixing the liability of shareholders in institutions of this kind, declares that “shareholders in banks, savings banks, trust, deposit and security associations, shall be held individually responsible for debts, contracts and engagements of said association, in double the amount of the par value of the stock owned by them respectively.”</p>
    <p id="b540-5" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[276,882,1182,247]]]'>In construing this statute, the Supreme Court of Colorado in the case of Zang v.

The bill is not filed by all of the creditors, but by a few of them. The corporation itself is not made a party defendant, neither are the shareholders other than the one resident in Pennsylvania. The question now to be determined is, whether the suit as thus instituted, may be maintained here. It may be conceded, in accordance with the opinion of the learned court below, that the liability of the stockholders in the Colorado Savings Bank may properly be enforced in the present proceeding, if all proper parties to the action be joined. But no authority has been cited to sustain the right to a separate bill in equity, in a foreign jurisdiction, by part of the creditors, against part of the stockholders, where the corporation is not a party. On the contrary, the trend of judicial opinion is the other way. In Cushing v. Perot, <a href="/pa/175/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="175 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="880503" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0078-01">175 Pa. 78</a>, our Brother Mitchell points out the advantage of an action for the benefit of all creditors, saying, “ in this manner, the rights of all will be <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>protected and justice be done in a single proceeding, in which every one will get what is his due, but no one will be called upon to pay more than his fair proportion, and the expense, delay, and inevitable occasional injustice of separate actions by different creditors, against different stockholders, with their attendant legion of resulting actions for contribution, will be avoided. This is so consonant with convenience and natural justice, as well as with our own settled procedure in analogous cases, that we will not be easily moved to depart from it.” In Bank of Virginia v. Adams, 1 Parsons’ Select Equity Cases, 5B4, a bill was filed in Pennsylvania on behalf of certain creditors of a Virginia corporation against certain stockholders resident in Pennsylvania. The court sustained a demurrer and dismissed the bill upon the ground that the proceeding was in the nature of the collection of a general fund for the payment of the corporate creditors, and could only be enforced in a suit to which the corporation itself, and all the other stockholders were parties.</p>

A creditor of the loan company, which was a Minnesota corporation, filed a bill in equity in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, against certain stockholders of the corporation, who were resident in Pennsylvania. The bill alleged that the company had been adjudged insolvent in Minnesota ; that by the laws of Minnesota, the stockholders were personally liable, each in an amount equal to the par value of the stock, and that the deficiency of assets was greater than the whole amount payable by the stockholders.</p>

This is the only question presented. . . . To enable the court to make a decree, it must take an account, determine the amount of assets, the extent of indebtedness, and the names and situations of the stockholders, the number of shares held by each, and thus determine what each should contribute, if contribution is found to be necessary. Can it be done in the <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>absence of the loan company, and the nonresident stockholders ?
