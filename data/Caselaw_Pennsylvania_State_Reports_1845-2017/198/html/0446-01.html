Hill, the plaintiff, recovered a judgment against the Standard Telephone Manufacturing Company for $652.52, on a suit which lie had instituted on December 21, 1897, to recover for salary due to him as electrician. The defendants were stockholders and directors of the Standard Telephone Manufacturing Company, and prior to December 28, 1897, had advanced to the company $36,667.23. These advancements had been made without any stipulation for security. At a meeting of <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>the stockholders on December 31, 1897, the directors of the company were authorized to confess judgment in favor of defendants, and to make payment upon the debt to them of all of the property of the corporation. Subsequently the directors authorized the bill of sale and assignment of the company’s property to the defendants. This bill of sale and assignment were subsequently executed. The court in an opinion by Aubenbied, J., entered a decree declaring defendants trustees of the property transferred to them for all the creditors of the Standard Telephone Manufacturing Company, and ordered defendants to file an account as such trustees within thirty days.</p>
