The conveyance was intentionally made absolute to enable Helmke tó make good title to purchasers. The property consisted of a lot of ground fronting on Windsor street, upon which were erected some five houses, Nos. 29, 31, 33, 35 and 39. The conveyance also included a piece of ground fronting on Ridge avenue, 75x200 feet. The only portion concerned in this litigation is that at Nos. 29 and 31 Windsor street. Helmke made sales of different pieces of the property until in November, 1881, a paper which is referred to in this case as exhibit “ No. 1” was executed by Braun and wife, and Helmke. and wife.

It appears from defendant’s abstract of title, that Helmke and wife on June 6, 1879, more than two years prior to the date of this paper, had conveyed the premises at Nos. 29 and 31 Windsor street to William D. Porter, who by his deed dated the same day conveyed the same property to Wilhelmina Helmke, and she by her will, probated March 6, 1887, devised the same to her husband William Helmke, who by his will probated May 26, 1896, devised the property to the First German Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sharpsburg, Pa., the defendant herein.

    <p id="b180-4" data-blocks='[["BL_180.5",180,[243,482,1191,1850]]]'>In any aspect of it the plaintiff’s case is an attempt to create a trust in land by parol testimony, and that at a period of time more than twenty-one years after the inception of the alleged trust. And this in the face of the admission that there was no imputation of fraud whatever upon the part of Helmke in the original transaction between himself and Braun. He accepted an absolute conveyance of the property made for the express purpose of enabling him to make sales, to pay off the indebtedness, and if possible save something out of the proceeds for Braun. There was no deception or trickery practised and none is alleged. Braun relied upon the good faith of Helmke to appropriate the proceeds of sales to the use specified. A breach of such duty, however, upon the part of Helmke would not convert him into a trustee: Danzeisen’s App., <a href="/pa/73/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="73 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1032279" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0065-01">73 Pa. 65</a>. If, therefore, any trust exists, it must be by reason of a declaration subsequent to the taking of the title, and such declaration must be in writing. The only offer of proof in writing made by the plaintiff was exhibit “No. 1.” This paper does not bear out her contention. The definite statement is made in it, that all the property has been sold except Nos. 33 and 35, which had been saved by Helmke for Braun, and which he would deed to Braun, in the coming January. So far as the record shows this was done, and there is no complaint in this respect. Clearly then the court was right in rejecting the offer of exhibit “ No. 1 ” as not tending in any way to prove a declaration of trust in the property at Nos. 29 and 31, the premises in dispute. It will not do to say that the offer should have been received, as contended by appellant, and oral testimony then admitted to contradict its terms. It is said by Justice Pax son, in Dyer’s App., <a href="/pa/107/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="107 Pa. 446" data-case-ids="8858119" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0446-01">107 Pa. 446</a>: “We regard the true intent and meaning of the act of 1856 to be, that when a trust is set up, the written evidence thereof, signed by the party holding the legal title, should contain within itself all that is necessary to enable a chancellor to declare the trust, and make a decree in favor of the beneficiaries, and that oral evidence cannot be introduced to support any missing links in the chain of testimony.”</p>

But even if there were a parol contract to convey the property, which is the subject of this litigation, a mere refusal to perform is not sufficient to create a trust. This court said in Barry v. Hill, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20Pa.%20318" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="166 Pa. 318">166 Pa. 318</a>, “ A trust ex maleficio can only result from some act of bad faith, and a mere refusal to perform a parol contract to hold or convey land is not sufficient to create such a trust.”</p>
    <p id="b181-3" data-blocks='[["BL_181.4",181,[217,721,1177,251]]]'>In the case just cited, the grantee held the title for nearly four years, from its inception until his death. And this was deemed an ample period in which to permit the grantor to assert and secure his claim of title. Not having done so within that time it was held impossible to raise a trust ex maleficio.</p>
    <p id="b181-4" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[219,980,1178,513]]]'>In the case at bar no attempt to assert or secure title by Braun or by his widow, the plaintiff here, was made for more than twenty-one years. It would seem that the trust, as set up by the plaintiff, would be barred by the 6th section of the act of April 29, 1856, which prohibits any right of entry by reason of any implied or resulting trust, but within five years after the trust accrued.
