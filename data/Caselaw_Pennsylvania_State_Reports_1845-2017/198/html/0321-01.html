The trustee died without having made any conveyance of the laud, and his son was appointed successor in the trust. Subsequently the son obtained an order from the court of common pleas directing him to convey the land to an Evangelical Lutheran Church which had been established in the borough where the land was situated. In pursuance of the order the substituted trustee conveyed the laud to the church mentioned in the order. Subsequently the church was authorized by an order of court to sell the land. <em>Held, </em>that the church had a good marketable title to the land, and that the original grantors and their heirs or representatives had no interest in the land.</p>

William A. Passavant in trust “ for the sole use, benefit and behoof of any Evangelical Lutheran Church and school which might be thereafter established.” It was also provided therein that on the establishment of said church and school said Passavant his heirs and assigns should execute and deliver a deed of said land to the Evangelical Lutheran Church or their trustees or other legal representatives and their succes<a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>sors. Rev. William A. Passavant died on June 8, 1894, without having made any conveyance of said land. On January 23, 1897, his son William was appointed trustee by the court of common pleas No. 1, of Allegheny county, who on October 17, 1898, petitioned said court, inter alia, to make an order directing him to convey said land to St. Paul’s Evangelical Lutheran Church which is now the plaintiff in said suit. That the plaintiff was the proper party to receive the conveyance of the land from the trustee is undisputed, and that the title obtained by it was a marketable title admits of no question or doubt. We therefore dismiss the assignment of error and affirm the judgment entered by the court below.</p>
