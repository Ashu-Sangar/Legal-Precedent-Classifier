The decedent was a wholesale and retail commission merchant, duly licensed as such, and paying an <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>annual license of $150. His place of business in Pennsylvania was in Philadelphia, but he also carried on the same business in Maryland and, perhaps, in Virginia. For many years he had sold the goods of the Merrick Thread Company as a commission merchant, at first receiving a salary, but afterwards, as long ago as 1882, upon a commission of seven and one half per cent, with the allowance of certain actual expenses. In consideration of this commission all of his sales were guaranteed. The Merrick Thread Company sold its goods through commission merchants in various parts of the country. Those sold by the decedent were sent to him from time to time, with proper invoices, and were entered to its credit upon his books. His billheads and letterheads stated that he was agent for this company and for some others, and the same thing appeared on a sign at his place of business; but the company had nothing whatever to- do with the renting or location of this place, which was under his exclusive control—the only relation between him and it being that of commission merchant and consignor. During the whole course of dealing between them, covering a period of many years, he rendered monthly accounts of sales, and from time to time made remittances. Twice a year he rendered an additional account; and these accounts, monthly and semiannual, were examined by the company or its officers, and after certain trifling corrections in a few cases, were marked “approved” or “correct.” The business thus done was a very large one, exceeding $1,000,000, and for a number of years the balances due by the decedent to the company, including his guaranteed sales, amounted to many thousand dollars. At the time of his death, the balance so due, as shown by his general books of account, was $80,956.84, and this corresponded with the books of the company, as made up from the accounts so rendered by him to it.</p>

Notwithstanding the able and earnest argument of counsel for the excepting creditors, we are well satisfied that the foreign creditor, whose standing and right of recovery are so strongly contested, is entitled to recognition and to share with the other creditors. Its claim is to recover moneys due by decedent as agent and factor, upon his contract as guarantor, and for goods sold by him, yet surely this is not such a carrying on business by a foreign corporation as is contemplated by the act of April 22, 1874, and will defeat its right to sue or present its claim. Decedent was not the representative or agent of the foreign corporation in the strict sense of the term, nor was his store or office its place of business; he was a commission merchant, and selling in his own name the goods manufactured by the creditor claimant and others in the same line of business consigned to him for sale. This was the nature of his agency. As said by Justice Fell in Wolff Dryer Co. v. Bigler &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/192/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="192 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="908964" data-case-paths="/pa/192/0466-01">192 Pa. 466</a>, the foreign corporation “ had no office or place of business in Pennsylvania, and no part of its capital was here,” citing also Mearshon &amp; Co. v.
