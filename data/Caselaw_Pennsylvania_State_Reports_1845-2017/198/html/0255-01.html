In this petition of James McKee, the brother, in which Mrs. Bell Mc-Croskey and her husband, Nancy McKee and Fanny K.

We think, however, that he intended his estate should be distributed among his <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>heirs as ascertained at the period fixed by him for distribution.

    <p class="summary" id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[188,727,1179,859]]]'>The testator intended then that distribution should not be made until after the death of his two children, his sole heirs at the time of his death who were also annuitants. Had he intended that they should take under this clause of his will as his heirs, would he not have provided for distribution immediately upon the death of the other beneficiaries, and limited to their lifetime the annuities given to his children. He gave them directly the annuities only, and although he would expect naturally that they would survive their aunts and uncles, the other beneficiaries, he expressly provided that the annuities should be paid to his children during their lives, and that conversion and distribution of his estate should not be made until after their death. It seems reasonably clear that the testator intended that they or their personal representatives should not receive anything more from his estate than the annuities, and that his heirs were to be ascertained as of the period of distribution.</p>

It was contingent ; it could not be known until her death that anything should pass by it, and on the happening of the contingency of her death- without children or their issue surviving her, the persons entitled to take under it were those who were then the right heirs of the testator.”</p>
