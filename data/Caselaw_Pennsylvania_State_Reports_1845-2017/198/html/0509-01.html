    <p class="summary" id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.6",534,[271,575,1197,603]]]'>The appellant was adjudged guilty, and a judgment was entered against him by an alderman in a suit for a penalty for selling oleomargarine in imitation of yellow butter, contrary to the provisions of the Act of May 5, 1899, P. L. 241. He wa's legally licensed as provided in that act, and had complied with all the requirements of the act, except that the oleomargarine sold by him was colored yellow by the addition thereto-of analyne, a foreign substance, but not injurious to health. The only defense he set up on his trial was the unconstitutionality of the act. His exceptions to the record of the alderman on certiorari ' in the court below, as well as his assignments- of error in this court were all to the same effect. ‘ -</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b534-6" data-blocks='[["BL_534.7",534,[280,1195,1186,976]]]'>One of the most important as well as most familiar rules for the construction of statutes is that a legislative intent to violate the constitution is never to be assumed; therefore wherever a statute is susceptible of two constructions, of which the one would make it unconstitutional, the other constitutional, the latter is to be adopted. Another elementary rule is, that construction is to be made of all the parts together, and not of one part only by itself. It is the duty of the courts to take a survey of the entire statute, “ for the true meaning of any passage is that which best harmonizes with the subject and with every other passage of the statute.” Another rulé to be noticed is, that a penal statute must be construed strictly and should not be extended beyond legislation as expressed on its face. The act of May 5, 1899, needs construction, and in view of the appellant’s contention that the construction he puts upon, ft makes it unconstitutional, all these familiar principles are to be kept in mind in determining its true scope and-intent. As was said by Judge Arnold, whose judgment was affirmed in Com. v. Vandyke, <a href="/pa-super/13/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Pa. Super. 484" data-case-ids="825571" data-case-paths="/pa-super/13/0484-01">13 Pa. Superior Ct. 484</a>:</p>

Perhaps a strict construction of the statute . would prohibit the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine in its natural state, because it looks like butter, but as the act is in<a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>tended to repeal the prohibitory statute of 1885, and authorizes the manufacture as well as the sale of oleomargarine in the state, we are to give the act such construction as will afford the relief and prevent the mischief it intended to prevent. The word ‘ coloration ’ means the act or practice of coloring, or the state of being colored, and it is the act or practice of coloring oleomargarine, which the act of 1899 intended to prohibit. The use of the words ‘ admixture or addition ’ in the statute, indicates that the intention of the legislature is to prohibit the imitation of yellow butter by any admixture or addition to oleomargarine during or after manufacture.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[166,920,1178,301]]]'>We adopt this as the true construction of the act; and if we are correct in this conclusion, none of the constitutional objections that have been urged against it can bo sustained. As was said by the Supreme Court of the United States in construing a Massachusetts statute which differs in no essential particular from ours, so it may be said here:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b535-6" data-blocks='[["BL_535.6",535,[166,1231,1177,404]]]'>“ It will be observed that the statute .... does not prohibit the manufacture or sale of all oleomargarine, but only such as is colored in imitation of yellow butter produced from pure unadulterated milk or cream of such milk.

Such being the scope and intent of the statute, the contention that it is an absolute prohibition of the sale and manufacture of oleomargarine, and that the title gives no notice of such legislation, is not well founded. The act is what its title indicates, a regulation, not a prohibition of the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine. We held in Com. v.
