Subsequently she and her daughter became reconciled, and she was on friendly terms with her until the daughter’s death, and with the Maxwell children until her death. There is no evidence, however, that she forgave Mr. Maxwell, and she made careful provisions in two wills made subsequently to the marriage to prevent him from receiving any part of her estate. By the will of 1882, the estate was divided into four parts, three equal—the income of one equal part being given to Mrs. Maxwell under a separate use trust; by a codicil made in 1890, subsequent to Mrs. Maxwell’s death, the share given her was given to James W. and Harry T. Friend in trust for her three children, with remainder to the survivors, if any died without issue before arriving at the age of twenty-five, and if all so died, with remainder to James W. and Harry T. Friend. As under the will admitted to probate the Maxwell children and Porter 0. Friend’s wife and child receive much less than under the codicil of 1890, it is evident that Mrs. Friend’s feelings towards them had changed, but there is no evidence that this change was produced by undue influence.</p>

However, in one of the transactions complained of, Mrs. Friend herself made a profit of $10,000, and she certainly would not want that questioned. There had been a proceeding in court against her brother, Theodore Wood, who was her trustee under her father’s will, with the result of which she was very much dissatisfied — thinking he had been harshly treated; and it appears from her declarations to J. W. Friend that she desired to protect him from trouble of that kind and • made this provision for that purpose.</p>

William Bakewell, Esq., who prepared all of the testamentary papers made by decedent, testified that it was prepared from instructions received from her, his impression being that they were in a letter; that he sent the will to her, and that she subsequently brought it to the office of Mr. Jackson, president of the Fidelity Title and Trust Company; that he there wrote a short addendum to the will, and that it was signed by her and witnessed by him, Dr. McClelland and Mr. Jackson.</p>
