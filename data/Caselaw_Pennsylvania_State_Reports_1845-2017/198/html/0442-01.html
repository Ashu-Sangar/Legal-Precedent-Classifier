The separate amount insured by the defendant was $119.04. It was conceded that all of the premiums had been paid, and that the plaintiff had sustained a loss by fire within the terms of the policy. The court of common pleas entered judgment for plaintiffs on a case stated. On appeal the Superior Court reversed the judgment.

The intention of the legislature is too clear to admit of doubt, and there is no room for construction. Both parties are bound by the legislative prohibition. Presumably they both knew the law and entered into the contract knowing they were doing a prohibited thing. The contract being unlawful and void in its inception, there is no ground of equitable estoppel because of the receipt of premiums by the insurer. The plaintiffs could not rightfully disregard the prohibition when the contract was made, and they cannot now ask to have it set aside in their favor.</p>
