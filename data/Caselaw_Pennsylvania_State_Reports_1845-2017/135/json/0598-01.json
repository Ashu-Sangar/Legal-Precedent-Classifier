    "head_matter": "W. H. ROLAND v. LANCASTER CO. N. BANK.\nAPPEAL BY PLAINTIEE FROM THE COURT OE COMMON PLEAS OE LANCASTER COUNTY.\nArgued May 21, 1890\nDecided June 2, 1890.\nWhere shares of stock, having a market value, are pledged to secure a particular indebtedness, with power to sell and apply, there is no jurisdiction in equity to compel a re-transfer of the pledge and an account, the transaction being single and the pledgor having a complete and adequate remedy at law.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Clark and Mc-Collum, JJT.\nNo. 51 July Term 1890, Sup. Ct.; court below, Eq. D. No. 2, p. 335.\nOn November 14, 1888, Wm. H. Roland, assignee for the benefit of creditors of Peter Boffenmyer, by deed of assignment of August 3, 1888, filed'a bill in equity averring in substance as follows:\nThat on July 9, 1888, D. M. Boffenmyer gave to the defendant bank a promissory note for $1,000, payable at ninety days, and at the same time deposited with said bank, as collateral security, ten shares of the stock of the Quarryville National Bank, with power, in the said note given, to sell the said stock \u201cat the brokers\u2019 board, or at public or private sale, without demanding payment of this note or the debt due thereon, and without further notice, and apply proceeds or as much thereof as may be necessary to the payment of this note, and all necessary expenses and charges, holding myself responsible for any deficiency; \u201d that on August 3, 1888, said D. M. Boffenmyer by writing under seal assigned his right, title, and interest in and to the said shares of stock to Peter Boffenmyer, and constituted him, his assigns and substitutes, his attorney and attorneys, with power to receive the same, etc., etc., and the said shares of stock, by virtue of the deed of voluntary assignment to the plaintiff passed to the plaintiff as the assignee of the said Peter Boffenmyer, of all which the defendant had notice; that at the time of the maturity of said note, to wit, on October 8, 1888, the plaintiff made a tender to the defendant, in lawful money of the United States, of the amount of said note, and at the same time demanded a return of the said shares of stock held as aforesaid as collateral security; praying: 1. That the defendant be decreed to surrender and transfer to the plaintiff the said ten shares of stock, or, in lieu thereof, the like number of other shares of the stock of said Quarryville National Bank, on the payment by the plaintiff of the amount due on the said note. 2. For further relief.\nAn answer having been filed, the defendant submitting that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief in equity, issue was joined and the cause referred to Mr. W. F. Beyer, as examiner and master.\nSubsequently, the master filed a report finding certain facts, inter alia, that the stock of the Quarryville National Bank had a market value; that on August 9, 1888, that value was $124.50 per share, and that on that date said stock had been sold by the defendant and the proceeds of sale, over and above the amount required to pay the said note of $1,000, to wit, $265, was applied in part payment of a note for $315 owned by defendant, upon which said D. M. Boffenmyer was an indorser, due and protested on August 6, 1888; and, as a conclusion of law, citing Pittsb. Drove-yard Co.\u2019s App., 123 Pa. 250; Conyngham\u2019s App., 57 Pa. 474; Sunbury etc. R. Co. v. Cooper, 33 Pa. 278; Foil\u2019s App., 91 Pa. 434; Phila. etc. R. Co. v. Stichter, 11 W. N. 325; Lewis on Stock and Bonds, 144-157, the master ruled that, the stock having a known market value and the transaction single, no ground for jurisdiction in equity existed, and recommended that the bill be dismissed.\nVarious exceptions were filed by the plaintiff to the report, as to the findings of fact and law. These exceptions being overruled by the master, were filed to his report in court, and after argument thereof were dismissed, without opinion filed, the master\u2019s report confirmed and a decree dismissing the bill signed, as recommended by the master. Thereupon, the plaintiff took this appeal, assigning the dismissal of his exceptions and the final decree for error.\nMr. B. F. Davis and Mr. Win. B. Wilson, for the appellant.\nCounsel cited: Conyngham\u2019s App., 57 Pa. 474 ; Story\u2019s Eq. \u201eJ., \u00a7 1032; 3 Pomeroy\u2019s Eq. J., \u00a7 131; Story on Bailments, \u00a7 346; Hart v.
