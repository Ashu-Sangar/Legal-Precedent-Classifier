Some years prior thereto, the city became the owner of a lot of ground on the west side of said street, erected thereon a building for the use of its fire department, and at the time named the building was in use for fire department purposes, a fire engine and other apparatus being kept therein. The building was so constructed and arranged that the doors, through which the fire engine and other apparatus would be drawn to a fire, opened outwardly, swinging over and across the sidewalk of the street. There were two doors, each nearly six feet wide. The sidewalk was nearly twelve and one half feet in width; so that the doors, if opened and standing at right angles with the building, would occupy nearly half of the width of the pavement, and when in that position the bottoms of" the doors would be at an average distance of about four inches above the sidewalk. The doors were rather heavy, tlieir frame work being two inches thick. To assist in opening them, springs were affixed to them on the outside. The only testimony describing the operation of these springs was that of John Onslow, who testified as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b165-7" data-blocks='[["BL_165.7",165,[214,1847,1160,450]]]'>“Q. How are they opened? A. They are opened with a rope that pulls the bolt above and one below, at the same time. Q. When the bolts are pulled what takes place? A. You have to start the door a little bit, and then the spring takes hold and helps swing the door open. Q. State whether or not it is opened quickly on to the sidewalk ? A. Sometimes they are opened quick and sometimes not so quick; if the wind is blowing it is difficult, and you have to follow the door and push it along; and when there is no wind they swing freely.”</p>

What, if any knowledge, had you, prior to these doors being opened at that time, that they opened out that way into the street? A. I was never aware of it. Q. You knew nothing about it? A. No, sir.

A building built that way, and the doors not opening at all, of course could not have caused the injury. It was not the act of the city which caused the injury. It was not its negligence in building the building as it was, or arranging the doors as they were; it was the operation of the doors, and not the construction of the building or the doors; and that opera<a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>tion of the doors, if the evidence is true, was by an emploj-ee of the fire department. That he might be liable individually under the evidence, and under the facts as shown by the plaintiff, would be unquestioned. A right of action would exist against him. But the principles which are laid down in the decisions cited by counsel for the defendant show conclusively that the city is not liable for the act of an employee of the fire department. It was his act. It was the operation of the doors, and not their construction, which caused the injury; for that reason I think this motion will have to be granted.</p>

The legal question to be determined is, whether the city had a right so to construct a building, in such close proximity to the sidewalk, that its ordinary use by the city, for any purpose, was dangerous to the safety of persons lawfully passing along the sidewalk in front of it.

There was no evidence that the building, or any part of it, was a dangerous obstruction to the sidewalk, and the testimony submitted naturally and reasonably suggests the conclusion that the doors could have been opened by the persons using them without any danger to passers by. Moreover, this is positively shown by the testimony of the plaintiff’s mother. Nor is there any evidence that the building could have been otherwise constructed for the uses to which it was devoted. All of the testimony, and the inferences legitimately to be drawn therefrom, showed that the plaintiff’s injury was due to the negligence of an employee of the fire department, for which the city was not responsible.</p>

In other words, the doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply in such cases. It is sufficient to refer to Knight v. City of Philadelphia, 15 W. N. 307, and Fire Insurance Patrol v. Boyd, <a href="/pa/120/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="120 Pa. 624" data-case-ids="559800" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0624-01">120 Pa. 624</a>.</p>
    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[256,571,1167,1819]]]'>It was urged, however, that the injury of which the plaintiff complains was not the result of the negligence of the firemen, but of the manner in which the building was constructed. If this were so, it might present a different question. But the evidence does not sustain this allegation. It is true, the doors of the engine house opened outwards, and were operated by springs, which, when certain bolts were pulled, opened, or assisted in opening the doors. The case was argued upon the theory that when the bolts were pulled the springs opened the doors suddenly and with great violence. In such case, as they swept across a considerable portion of the pavement in opening, it can be readily seen that they might be a dangerous trap to injure persons passing along the said pavement. The only testimony on the part of the plaintiff upon this subject was substantially as follows: “ When the bolts are pulled, you have to start the doors a little bit, and then the spring takes holt, and helps swing the door open. Sometimes they are opened quick, and sometimes not so quick. If the wind is blowing, it is difficult, and you have to follow the door, and push it along; and when there is no wind, they swing freely.” As the plaintiff was nonsuited, she is entitled to all the deductions which can fairly be drawn from this evidence. Tested by this rule, however, it is not sufficient to justify a jury in finding that the doors of the engine house were defectively constructed, and dangerous to citizens using the pavement. It is evident the only object and effect of the <em>springs </em>was to aid the firemen in swinging open the heavy doors. It is not only possible, but probable, that on the occasion referred to, if the door was opened violently and rapidly, as contended by the plaintiff, it was the result of a push by the person who opened it. For his carelessness or negligence, the city, under all the authorities, is not liable; and we have already said there was not sufficient evidence of the faulty construction of the building to submit to the jury. We would gladly help the plaintiff, but we can only do so at the expense of sound legal principles, which are of too much value to sacrifice to the hardship of a particular case.</p>
