At the same time he delivered to them a paid-up policy of insurance upon his own life, for $730, with an assignment thereof absolute upon its face. On August 19, 1880, Mell’s real estate being advertised for sale under an execution issued upon a judgment in favor of one Dykeman, Ira Long, one of the members of the firm of Long &amp; Johnson, obtained from his partner an assignment of said note and policy, and entered judgment on the note. He also <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>purchased the Dykeman judgment and two other judgments entered prior thereto, thus becoming the owner of all the judgment liens standing against Mell’s property. The sheriff’s sale proceeding, Long became the purchaser of the real estate, which he subsequently sold to Barner, the defendant in the present ease. Mell had made a claim for the benefit of the debtor’s exemption law, prior to the entry of the judgment for $134.66 in favor of Long, and had received, on account of the $300 exemption, the sum of $45 out of his personal property. The effect of entering the judgment, containing the waiver of the exemption, was to prevent Mell’s receiving the remaining $255 from the proceeds of the real estate, and the moneys arising from the sale were all appropriated to the first and second liens which had been entered before the Dykeman judgment.</p>

Q. What did he say to that ? A. He said to me, <em>‘ </em>Don’t say a word to the old man about it.’ I told him that they were holding a life insurance policy that I thought ought to come to me, inasmuch as Ira Long used that note against me the second time.

Accordingly Barner caused a writ of execution to be issued upon the judgment, under which the stock of goods in a confectionery store, kept by Mell, was levied on and taken possession of lw the sheriff. Mell thereupon petitioned the court to open the judgment to let him into a defence. The court granted a rule upon Barner to show cause why the relief prayed for by Mali should not be granted, and stayed further proceedings upon the writ of execution.

The offer did not in any way connect the defendant with the alleged agreement, nor was any purpose expressed of following it with evidence to show knowledge on his part. He was sued for a malicious use of legal process. The offer virtually -was to show that Long, the plaintiff in the judgment, had knowledge that the debt was paid, because he had agreed with the defendant that it should be canceled by the acceptance of the insurance policy if not actually paid at maturity. But it would avail nothing to show knowledge on Long’s part. The action was not against him but against Barner, who, as Long’s administrator, had caused the execution to be issued. It may be said that the offer was only a first step, but we had no promise that any step further in the direction of this defendant was to be taken. We see no greater relevancy in the offer now than we did upon the trial.</p>

We felt constrained to take the ease from the jury because the evidence wholly failed to show malice on the part of the defendant. It is not pretended that there was any direct evidence of malice. The effort was to show certain facts from <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>which .it might be inferred. Now, actual knowledge on Earner’s part that the judgment was paid, and that he therefore bad no right to issue execution, became absolutely essential, for without such knowledge be was in the exact line of bis duty in proceeding to collect the judgment. It is not as though Long bad issued the execution, for he being the plaintiff would be charged with a knowledge of payment. Barner stands in a wholly different position. It was for the plaintiff to show, as against him, not only that the judgment was paid, but that be knew it was paid. Upon satisfactory evidence showing these facts the jury might very properly infer malice; but not only did the evidence with respect to Barner’s knowledge fall short of being satisfactory, but there was, in point of fact, no evidence at all, and a verdict for the plaintiff, under the circumstances, could not have been sustained.</p>

But this falls very far short of the knowledge which the law requires in such cases. The administrator was not bound to stay bis hand, simply because the defendant in. the judgment claimed that he had paid it to the plaintiff in his lifetime. On the other hand, be was at liberty to disregard a notice such as this, if there was nothing else to put him on his guard. If executors and administrators can proceed only at their peril to enforce payment, after they have received notice from the debtor that the claim has been paid, the settlement of dead men’s estates would be attended witb risks sufficient to deter prudent men from accepting such trusts.</p>

To say that be was bound to investigate further before proceeding, is to shift the burden from the one upon whom it properly rests, to the shoulders of one who has all the presumptions in his favor.

Mell, in his own right, sued Barner for a trespass committed by the latter. No one but the parties to the record could be affected by the result of the suit. Both of these were alive at the time of the trial, as well as at the time of the injury. The fact that Long was dead when the cause was tried, did not bring Mell within the exception to competency under clause <em>(e), </em>§ 5, act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158. It was impossible that Long’s estate could be affected by the result of this suit. The direction to find for the defendant must have been based upon the proposition that an administrator is required to reject all evidence and notice of the payment of a judgment in favor of his decedent, if it stand upon the record unsatisfied, and that nothing but direct proof of malevolence toward the defendant in the judgment can support an action against him for issuing an execution upon a judgment which in fact is paid. The proposition is certainly untenable. The law requires of an administrator merely common prudence and caution in preserving the property and rights of his decedent, and no more. From Palmer v. Jones, 1 Vern. 144, to Stewart’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=110%20Pa.%20425" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="110 Pa. 425">110 Pa. 425</a>, this doctrine has uniformly been held and applied.</p>

Like a sheriff, an administrator is not compelled to disregard a notice which would bind him if he were acting for himself. He is not required to seize the property and destroy the business of one who is not a debtor to his decedent, to ascertain whether the statement of that person that he owes nothing, is true. The notice to Barner that this note had been paid to Long was direct and positive, and if he had satisfied <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>the judgment, as Mell requested, lie could not have been surcharged with it. The most that he would have been justified in doing against Mell, would have been to issue a writ of scire facias and permit Mell to make defence.

If we concede that the facts offered to be proved were competent evidence, the offer was to prove them by an incompetent witness. Ira Long, one of the parties to the note, was dead; the witness was the maker of the note, and a party to the record. The lips of Long were sealed by death; the lips of the witness were sealed by the law.</p>
    <p id="b179-8" data-blocks='[["BL_179.7",179,[200,1700,1166,699]]]'>The second and third assignments allege error in the charge of the court. The extracts given do not disclose any. There was nothing in the case to show that the defendant acted with malice, or without probable cause. The note of Mell came into defendant’s hands as executor of Long. It was an asset of the estate, with nothing to show payment upon its face. It was his duty to attempt to collect it, in the absence of actual knowledge on his part that it had been paid. Had he neglected this duty, he would have been liable to a surcharge in his accounts, which, if not successful, would have subjected him to litigation and expense. He was not bound to incur this peril. The only sure way to avoid it was to proceed to collect the note, when, if Mell had paid it, he could take defence and show it.</p>
