After sundry provisions for others in his will, the testator directs that the balance of his estate be divided into two equal shares, one of which he bequeaths in trust for his son Nathaniel; he then proceeds : “ And from the other aforesaid divided share of my estate, all the just debts and claims that I have and hold against my son Moses Stambaugh, are to be subtracted from the same, and the balance thereof is to be placed in the hands of Henry Shaffer, of Jackson township, whom I hereby appoint trustee for to hold the said sum for my son, Moses Stambaugh; the said Henry Shaffer is to pay the interest yearly accruing from the same to my son Moses Stambaugh, after deducting taxes and necessary expenses, and after the death of my son Moses Stambaugh, I bequeath the principal to the heirs of my son Moses Stambaugh, share and share alike.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b608-6" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[254,575,1169,450]]]'>It sufficiently appears from the evidence, that Moses Stambaugh received the income and profits of a certain farm which he occupied, down to April 1,1887, in lieu of the interest of the trust fund, under an agreement to that effect with the trustee. Since that date, he has received neither interest nor proceeds of the land, as the latter was sold on April 4,1887, by the executors of John Wolford, deceased, to another party. Whatever interest he may now be entitled to receive on the trust fund, or any portion of it, begins therefore with said date.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b608-7" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[250,1034,1172,905]]]'>The main contention, however, relates to the credit claimed on the part of the accountants, for the $1,529.50, paid out to the three children of Moses Stambaugh, in March, 1877, the receipt of which they acknowledge in their release of that date, in which they are joined by Moses Stambaugh, the cestui que trust. One of these children, Mary 0. Stambaugh, now Mary C. Arnsberger, asks to be relieved from the operation of this instrument because she was a minor at the time when she executed it, which fact she has established to the satisfaction of the auditor. The other two have not appeared, nor has the validity of this release as to them and their interest in the trust fund been impeached. For the purpose of this investigation it therefore stands good as against them, and will prevent their participation hereafter in the trust fund to the extent of the payments already made to them. The auditor is of the opinion, however, that the infancy of the other petitioner, Mary C. Arnsberger, avoids the release as to her, and the trustee should be surcharged with the amount for which she released him, to wit, $509.88.</p>

Accountants’ counsel contended, that this was a dry trust, and that under the operation of the rule in Shelley’s Case, Moses Stambaugh took an absolute estate in this fund, both principal and interest, so that he could dispose of it; and that the trustee was therefore protected in the payment of the $1,529.50, by the release of the cestui que trust and his children, and entitled to credit for the same in his account.</p>

It is only after the death of Moses that he gives the corpus of the fund to his heirs.</p>

He may release the trustee by a formal release for a breach of trust, which will relieve both the trustee and his sureties: 2 Perry on Trusts, § 851. This is only true, however, where the cestui que trust is sui juris, aware of his legal rights, and not imposed upon by the trustee. The evidence does not show that Moses Stambaugh was ignorant of his rights under the will, or overreached by the trustee in the procurement of this release.

The trust in this case is an active one beyond question: Watson’s App., <a href="/pa/125/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="125 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="563920" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0340-01">125 Pa. 340</a>. As in Watson’s Appeal, there is no gift of the corpus of the estate for the life of the first beneficiary, and the testator evidently did not intend that he should touch a dollar of it. There is even stronger reason, in the present case, for holding that the will creates a spendthrift trust, as it appears upon the face of the will that Moses owed the testator debts amounting to |2,884.19, but was unable to discharge them. The language preceding the trust clause plainly indicates that the testator knew of the assignment made by Moses live months before, and of his inability to manage his affairs providently, and that such knowledge was the reason for not giving Moses more than the interest of the fund for life. A spendthrift trust was clearly intended, and such intent may be gathered from the general scope of the trust; it is not necessary that there should be an express provision protecting the income from the claims of creditors: Yaux v.

But whatever might be the effect of an attack by innocent creditors upon the principal or income of a trust estate, as between the trustee and the cestui que trust it is the duty of the former to protect the corpus of the estate, even against the solicitation of the latter, and to prevent its going where the testator had prohibited it from going: Phila.

The facts and circumstances relating to the family of the testator, and known to him, may be proved to aid in the construction of his will, and hence evidence of the necessity which existed in this case for the creation of a spendthrift trust was admissible: Barr’s Est., <a href="/pa/2/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="2 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="951305" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0428-01">2 Pa. 428</a>; Rewalt v.

But the auditor and the court below held otherwise, and we acquiesced. The conduct of the exceptants to the account is iniquitous, and their claim should not prevail, unless through unbending rules of law. The auditor finds that the payment of a portion of the fund to certain heirs of Moses Stambaugh during his lifetime was a breach of trust, but he finds, at the same time, that the cestui que trust <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>concurred in it.

      <em>2. </em>Moses Stambaugh must be presumed sane and capable of transacting business, and aware of his legal rights. He does not allege or prove the contrary.

    <p id="b615-8" data-blocks='[["BL_615.8",615,[207,1480,1163,550]]]'>“ And from the other aforesaid divided share of my estate all the just debts and claims that I have and hold against my son Moses Stambaugh are to be subtracted from the same, and the balance thereof is to be placed in the hands of Henry Shaffer, of Jackson township, whom I hereby appoint trustee for to hold the said sum for my son Moses Stambaugh; the said Henry Shaffer is to pay the interest yearly accruing from the same to my son Moses Stambaugh after deducting taxes and necessary expenses, and after the death of my son Moses Stambaugh I bequeath the principal to the heirs of my son Moses Stambaugh, share and share alike.”</p>
    <p id="b615-9" data-blocks='[["BL_615.9",615,[207,2040,1161,401]],["BL_616.1",616,[283,429,1170,98]]]'>We think it manifest from this will that the testator intended (a) to sever the product from the fund producing it, and that he wished the former only to be paid to his son during his life; and (5) after his death the principal to go to his children. By the words “ heirs ” he evidently meant “ children.” It was urged, however, that this was a mere dry trust; that there is nothing upon the face of the will to indicate an intent to create a spendthrift trust, and that, as the fund was given to Moses <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>and Ms heirs, there is no purpose for which the trust should be kept alive, and that it is executed in Moses.</p>
    <p id="b616-6" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[280,534,1175,863]]]'>It is settled by a line of authority that a trust to invest money, collect the interest, and pay over the same to a cestui que trust during life, with remainder over after his death, creates an active trust, and vests the legal title in the trustee during the life of the cestui que trust: Girard L. Ins. Co. v. Chambers, <a href="/pa/46/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="46 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="420649" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0485-01">46 Pa. 485</a>. Cases to the same point might be cited by the score. It was urged that there was no authority given in this will to invest the fund. It is true there is no such direction in terms, but the duty to do so arises by necessary implication from the order to pay over the interest. How could interest be earned or paid over, without an investment of the principal ? The legal effect of the will is precisely the same as if it Had formally directed the trustee to invest the fund from time to time, and pay over the net income to Moses during his life. A neglect to do so on the part of the trustee would have rendered him liable to a surcharge in his accounts. There is nothing in this position.</p>
    <p id="b616-7" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[280,1402,1173,1057]],["BL_617.1",617,[209,368,1169,1472]]]'>Is this a spendthrift trust ? It may be admitted that it lacks some of the usual provisions of such a paper, notably the absence of any clause protecting the income from attachment, etc. If, however, we can gather from the will itself, and from the light of the circumstances surrounding the testator at the time he made it, that his intent was to create a spendthrift trust, such intent ought not to be defeated because his conveyancer blundered. That he was an ignorant man appears from his signature, which was by mark only; that the conveyancer did not possess more than the average skill of a country justice of the peace, the will itself abundantly shows. When we come to examine this will, we find that as to several of the legatees, children of deceased sons, the legacies are given absolutely. This is so even as to the females, whose shares a testator is more likely to place in trust than those of male legatees. But When it comes to the shares of his two sons, Nathaniel and Moses, he places their shares in trust, in precisely the same terms. We have no concern with Nathaniel’s share, and it is referred to incidentally in ascertaining the intent of the testator. The latter had certainly some object in creating this trust for Moses. What was it? We do not think the answer difii<a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>cult. The mere fact of the gift only of the income, and the interposition of a trustee, implies distrust as to his son. There was reason for it. Upon the face of the will it appears that Moses was indebted to his father, for it directs that “ all the just ctebts-and claims that I have and hold against my son Moses Stambaugh ” shall be deducted from his share before it is placed in trust. Had the testator had confidence in his son financially, it is not likely he would have given this direction. The key to it is found wdien we turn to the evidence, where it appears that Moses Stambaugh failed and made an assignment fórthe benefit of his creditors a few months before the testator made his will. This throws a flood of light upon his intentions. He was providing for an insolvent son; and, in view of the circumstances surrounding him at the time, who can doubt that he intended this as a spendthrift trust ? This intent is not to be set aside because it is not clearly expressed by his scrivener. It is said, however, that we must search only for the intent of a testator within the four corners of the will. This is true, but, when we come to consider the will and interpret its meaning, we must do so in the light of all the circumstances by which the testator was surrounded when he made it,- and by which he was probably influenced. It was said by Justice Sharswood, in Postlethwaite’s App., <a href="/pa/68/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="68 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1024532" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0477-01">68 Pa. 477</a>: “ It has been long and well settled, and indeed it is a principle so consonant to reason that the only wonder is that it should ever have been questioned, that all the surrounding circumstances of a testator—his family, the amount and character of his property—may and ought to be taken into consideration in giving a construction to the provisions of his will.”</p>
    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[210,1849,1162,550]],["BL_618.1",618,[259,376,1173,810]]]'>Regarding it, then, as plain that this testator intended to create a spendthrift trust for his son Moses, we have the additional fact that he certainly did create an active trust. The income only was to be paid to his son, “ after deducting taxes and necessary expenses.” The legal title was in the trustee, and therefore the legal and equitable title could not coalesce under the rule in Shelley’s Case. Under such circumstances, it requires neither argument nor authority to show that the trustee had no right to pay over any portion of the corpus of the estate to his cestui que trust. That was not what the testator directed him to do; and, as he procured no order from <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>the court, having jurisdiction of his account, to make such payment, it follows necessarily that such disposition of the trust estate was unlawfully and improvidently made. It was at his own risk, and in direct violation of the trust. The release of the' life-tenant does not bind him; the release of the alleged remainder-men does not protect the trustee. Non constat that the releasors will be the remainder-men at the death of Moses Stambaugh. If the trustee suffers by this ruling, it is the result of his own folly. He was entitled to procure competent legal advice, and pay for it out of the trust fund. Moreover, he could have been protected by an application to the court. The law does not deal harshly with trustees. It affords them every facility to ascertain and follow the proper legal path in the administration of their trusts. When they unlawfully part with the trust funds committed to their care, they cannot justly complain if they are held responsible.</p>
