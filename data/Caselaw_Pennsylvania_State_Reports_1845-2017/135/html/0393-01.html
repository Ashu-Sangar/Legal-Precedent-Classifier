He proceeds to explain the reason of this alteration; that in the years 1717 and 1734, there was no provincial-tax, and therefore a settlement was gained by payment of county tax; that in 1771 there was a provincial tax, and that the legislature used the word public, instead of county <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>meaning to comprehend in that expression both provincial and comity taxes.

A person charged with and paying “his proportion of any public taxes or levies for two years successively,” in any poor district, gains a settlement thereby: § 9, act of June 13,1836, P. L. 541. In Directors of Poor v. Guardians of Poor, 5 S. &amp; R.417, upon which the court below based its decision, the phrase “public tax ” was construed only as used in the act of March 9,1771, 1 Sm. L. 338, and it was not intended to declare its general meaning, for all time to come, as restricted to provincial, or state and county taxes. The effect of the decision of the court below would bo that one residing in a county which of itself was a poor district, might gain a settlement by the payment of a poor tax, because it is levied by the county; whereas, one might live in an adjoining county, where the townships constitute poor districts, and pay poor taxes for a lifetime, without acquiring a settlement thereby.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b415-11" data-blocks='[["BL_415.11",415,[213,2310,1161,149]],["BL_416.1",416,[276,380,1167,655]]]'>2. The statutory provision should be considered in the light of its reason and purpose. The reason for it is because the payment of taxes furnishes indisputable proof of actual resi<a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>dence, just as the leasing of real estate, or an indenture to serve, does. And is not this shown by the payment of a township tax, as well as by payment of a county tax? Is it reasonable to say that one actually residing in a township, and contributing to its poor rates his proportion thereof, shall not be entitled to relief from the fund he has helped to create ? It seems to us that the very reason given by Mr. Chief Justice Tilghman, in the case.cited, for the introduction of the word public into the act of 1771, is in harmony with our theory. It was undoubtedly the intention of the act of 1836 to embrace more than state and county taxes. In the case at bar, the settlement is sought to be established bjr the payment of a road tax, but the principle is the same as if it were a poor tax.</p>

L. 46. There was in this case no exception made or point presented to the court at the hearing or argument, and none was noted by the court and filed of record.

To gain a settlement there must be a strict compliance with all the requirements of the statute: Beaver Tp. Poor D. v. Rose Tp.

The act of 1717,1 Weiss &amp; Miller’s L. 72, and that of 1734, Idem 138, provided that a settlement might be gained by the payment of “ county taxes or levies for the poor.” By § 17, act of March 9, 1771, 1 Sm. L. 338, the expression was altered to “public taxes or levies for the poor,” so as to comprehend provincial taxes, which had been imposed in the meantime, as well as county taxes: Directors of Poor v. Guardians of Poor, 5 S. &amp; R. 417. The language of clause II., § 9, act of June 13,1836, P. L. 543, is, <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>“ any public taxes or levies for two years successively,” designedly omitting tlxe words “for tlie poor.” The judicial construction of the words “public taxes,” as meaning state and county taxes, in the case last cited, must be applied to them in the act of 1836.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[219,633,1161,760]]]'>3. Again, if the construction of the act of 1836, contended for by the appellant, is to be adopted, the word “public,” might as well have been omitted entirely. But that word has a well defined meaning, viz., concerning the whole body politic, or all the citizens of the state: 2 Bouv. Law D., 484; 1 Green!. Ev., § 188. State and county taxes are a burden on each and every individual in the state, and are annual throughout tlxe state; while road and poor taxes are local in their nature, and tlxe subjects of taxation upon which they are assessed are more restricted. The office of the word “any ” is simply to preclude all question as to what public taxes, state or county, must be paid. But tlxe four acts referred to are in pari materia and must be construed together: Keeling’s Road, <a href="/pa/59/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="59 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="426952" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0358-01">59 Pa. 358</a>.

There is no question made as to the competency of the witnesses, the relevancy of tlxe evidence, or as to tlxe facts ; the whole case rests upon the point of law set forth in the exception noted by the judge.

We are called upon, therefore, to determine what is and what is not a “public tax,” within the meaning of the act of 1836.</p>
    <p id="b418-6" data-blocks='[["BL_418.4",418,[252,930,1176,860]]]'>The word “public” is a convertible term, and when used in an act of assembly may refer to the whole body politic; that is to say, to all the inhabitants of the state, or to the inhabitants of a particular place only; it may be properly applied to the affairs of the state or of a county or of a community. The state-house, the county court-house, and the ward schoolhouse are alike public property; the governor, the sheriff, and the constable are all public officers, and the state, county, and township taxes 'are public taxes. In a general sense, all taxes are state taxes, for they are all assessed and levied under the general laws of the state; and counties, cities, boroughs, and townships are but subordinate divisions or departments ancillary to the general government of the state. The word public, in its most comprehensive sense, is the opposite of private; and, as city, borough, and township taxes, whether road, school, or poor, are certainly not imposed for any merely private purpose, they must certainly be considered public taxes.</p>

Laws, 96, and 1734; Idem 181, a settlement was gained by any person who was charged with and had paid his or her share towards “ the county taxes or levies for the poor ” for two years, successively; but in the act of 1771, 1 Sm. L. 338, the expression “ county taxes ” was changed to “ public taxes.” A question afterwards arose in Directors of the Poor v. Guardians of the Poor, 5 S. &amp; R. 417, whether a county tax was a public tax, within the meaning of the act of-1771; and it was decided that a legal settlement might be gained under the act of 1771 by payment of a county tax only. In stating the probable reason for changing “ county” to “public,” Chief Justice Tilghmam said that in the years 1717 and 1734, when the first two acts were passed, there <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>was no provincial tax, and therefore a settlement was gained by payment of a county tax; but in 1771 there was a provincial tax, and it was therefore right that a settlement should be gained by paying either a provincial or a county tax; and the legislature used the word “ public ” instead of “ county,” meaning to comprehend in that expression both provincial and county taxes. The only point decided was that a county tax was a public tax. We do not understand the learned chief justice to say that this was the full extent to which the rule of construction would apply: he simply decided the case before him ; the language employed by him in his opinion in terms covered that ground, and no more. But, if a tax can only be considered a public tax when it is imposed throughout the whole state, as the appellee appears to contend, how could a county tax have been so considered ? and if, as that case explicity decides, a county tax is a public tax, then upon what system of argumentation shall it be maintained that a township tax is not also a public tax ?</p>
    <p id="b419-5" data-blocks='[["BL_419.4",419,[208,1289,1164,748]]]'>A settlement under the poor laws is a residence of such permanent and continuous character as, under certain circumstances, will entitle a person to support or assistance as a pauper. When not derived by birth or marriage, or from the relation of parent and child, when it is gained through the residence of others, it is acquired generally upon the basis of a settled personal residence, the permanency of which must be shown in a certain way, specified by law. This being so, we cannot see why any greater significance attaches to the payment of a county or state tax than to the payment of a poor or road tax, as these are levied upon the general valuation or assessment for county purposes, upon all such subjects as are taxable for the purposes mentioned. The appellee’s contention cannot be sustained upon any rule of law or logic, and the decree of the court below must be reversed.</p>
