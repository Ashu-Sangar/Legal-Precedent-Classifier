This house faced east on Prince street, and extended back west. What I put up was an addition on the west end. I used the old west wall for the whole height, and made three new walls : a south wall twelve feet long, a north wall twelve feet long, and a new west wall fourteen feet long; and in this addition I put two floors and a tin roof over it. Then I cut doors leading from the old building into this new addition. The lower room was intended as an additional kitchen; the upper room was a bath-room, with a wardrobe and water-closet in it; and the whole of it was used in connection with the old house, and had no use or service except in connection with the old building.”</p>

The syllabus of Hancock’s Appeal does say the said acts of 1861 and 1865 are not amendatory of the act of 1836, but Justice Paxson in his opinion says: “ We are of opinion, however, that the act of 1861 was amendatory, not explanatory.” And Mr. Justice McCollum, in Thomas v.

L. 1168, amendatory of the act of 1836, and applying to the city of Philadelphia only, and which extended the act of 1836 to cover repairs, alterations or additions, in language almost identical with that of the act of 1861, says: “ As amended and applicable to the city of Philadelphia, the act of 1836 creates two kinds or classes of mechanics’ liens. The first class embraces debts contracted for work done or materials furnished for or about the construction of a building; the second, debts contracted for work done or materials furnished for or about the repair, alteration of or addition to the same. The liens thus given differ materially in their extent and qualities.....It cannot be doubted that the amendment places all repairs, alterations and additions upon the same footing, and we think the case presented by the plaintiff is within it. The fact that the original act was deemed broad enough to include new additions, does not interfere with this conclusion. Where there are in an act specific provisions relating to a particular subject, they must govern in respect of that subject as against general provisions in other parts of the statute, although the latter standing alone would be broad enough to include the subject to which the particular provisions relate. Hence, if there are two acts, of which one is special and particular, and clearly includes the matter in controversy, whilst the other is general and would, if standing alone, include it also, and if, reading the general provision side by side with the particular one, the inclusion of that matter in the former would produce a conflict between it and the special provision, it must be taken that the latter was designed as an exception to the general provision.”</p>

A lien for an addition can be sustained only under the act of May 18, 1887, P. L. 118, and notice as therein required is essential: Best v.

So far as my research goes, no lien <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>has been sustained under the general law, prior to the act of 1887, for additions, alterations or repairs, in any county in which there was a special or local act regulating these matters. Swaney v. Washington Oil Co., 7 Pa. C. C. R. 353, cited for the claimants, arose under the act of June 17, 1887, P. L. 409, relating to liens on leaseholds, by the express terms of which notice of an intention to file a lien is required only when the work and materials are furnished by others than the original contractor. Under the same act, it was held in McKeever v. Albert, 4 Pa. C. C. R. 251, that when the work is not let out by contract, even a person employed by the owner must give the notice. Harbolsheimer v. Totten, 7 Pa. C. C. R. 665, was decided under the act of June 17, 1887, P. L. 413, since held unconstitutional. Its provisions as to notice apply only to material-men, and the claimant in that ease did not belong to that class. Mechanics’ liens are purely the creatures of statute, and the law should not be strained in their favor. By the act of May 18, 1.887, notice is explicitly made a condition of the right to claim its benefits, and such condition must be observed: Best v. Baumgardner, <a href="/pa/122/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="122 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1948381" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0017-01">supra.</a></p>

The said claim was filed for a new addition, or back building, to an old building; and it was held that it came within the act of May 18, 1887, P. L. 118, the proviso of which requires “ that, to entitle any one to the benefits of this act, he shall give notice to the owner, or reputed owner of the property, or his or her agent, at the time of furnishing the materials, or performing work in and about the repairs, alterations, or additions to any house or other building, óf his intention to file a lien under the provisions of this act.” The auditor found that no notice was given as required by said act. The act of 1887 received a construction in Best v. Baumgardner, <a href="/pa/122/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="122 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1948381" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0017-01">122 Pa. 17</a>, where it was held that it repealed the acts of 1861 and 1865 by necessary implication, and that, under it, notice to the owner or reputed owner, was a necessary prerequisite to the filing of a lien. See, also, Thomas v. Hinkle, <a href="/pa/126/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="126 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="968935" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0478-01">126 Pa. 478</a>. <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>We are satisfied that both the auditor and the court below were right in their conclusions.</p>
