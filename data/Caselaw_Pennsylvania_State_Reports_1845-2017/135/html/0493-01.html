The action of the associates, as shown by the record, is as follows, to wit:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b516-9" data-blocks='[["BL_516.8",516,[242,1196,1168,439]]]'>“ And now, August 5, 1889, it is hereby ordered and decreed that the assessment of taxes appealed from in this case be affirmed, and that the lands mentioned in said appeal be and remain assessed at the amounts or valuations they were severally assessed at (as revised by the county commissioners) at the time the appeal in this case was taken, as shown by the appeal filed in the case, and the records in the county commissioners’ office ; all costs of this appeal to be paid by the appellants.”</p>

It is simply an affirmance of the judgment of the commissioners, and a dismissal of the appeals wholesale. Not a single change is made, nor reason given for this attempted blotting out in one fell sweep of the alleged rights of the appellants. Their duty was prescribed by the act of April 19, 1889, P. L. 37, which declares: “They shall hear the said appeals and proofs in the case, and make such orders and decrees touching the matter complained of as to the judges of said court may seem just and equitable, having due regard to the valuation and assessment made of other real estate in such county or city.” The legislature evidently contemplated some action upon the part of the judges. They were not simply to affirm the judgment of other parties, and thus render the appeals nugatory. <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>This action of the associates is so irregular that it ought to be set aside.</p>

      <em>We </em>have left, then, the opinion of the court, and the decree in legal form by the presiding judge. He is the legal head of the court, and has not only his integrity but his professional reputation constantly before him, as a warning to himself and a pledge to the people that his decisions are unbiased. As was said by Justice Woodward in Glamorgan Iron Co. v. Snyder, <a href="/pa/84/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="84 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1053574" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0397-01">84 Pa. 397</a>: “ The purely legal business of a court of original jurisdiction must be left to the control of a single judge, if efficiency, promptitude and official responsibility are worth mentioning. If the deliberately formed purpose of a president judge may be thwarted and overturned by action on the part of his associates, which must necessarily be ill-considered and very often be prejudiced, rules of law will be subordinated to individual caprice.” Was not the examination and disposition of these appeals as much a trial of matters of fact, under the rules of law, as if a jury had been empaneled to try the facts? The presiding judge took notes of testimony, passed upon its competency and relevancy, admitted or rejected it, answered points of counsel, which were filed, filed the opinion .of the court, as was his duty, and made a decree in proper, legal form.</p>
