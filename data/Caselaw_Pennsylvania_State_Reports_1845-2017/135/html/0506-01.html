The ore, as it now exists in the mine, is quite deep below the surface; in fact, it is much deeper than when I began; then there is an enormous amount of what is technically called “ stripping,” that is, the removing of earth, which is on top of the ore. The amount of earth to be removed is so very great that, even if the ore were much more valuable than it is, it would not pay to take it out. It would not be worth the price of its cost of mining at the mine, taking the ordinary average price of iron ore as a criterion.</p>

In addition to admitting the receipts without proof of consideration, the court erred in not admitting our offer to show a fraudulent explanation of their contents. The idea of over-payment was evidently an afterthought, as is evidenced by the defendant’s exacting, when he bought the lease, a stipulation that his assignors should pay the rent due April 1, 1880; by his paying $600 a year for three years, and by his assigning, in the notice to Garman of March 27,1884, as his sole reason for refusing to pay rent, the alleged fact that the ore could not be advantageously mined. The truth of the allegation of over-payment was therefore for the jury.

Henning, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20Pa.%20143" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="116 Pa. 143">116 Pa. 143</a>. The court submitted the question whether the ore could be advantageously mined to the jury, and the verdict having expressly determined that it could not be, the plaintiff’s case is at an end, and it is difficult to see how he can be aided by any review of the charge or by any erroneous admissions of testimony as to the state of accounts between himself and the defendant.</p>

The receipt of March 31,1880, was given by Garman to the <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>Smiths. Potts was a stranger to it, and cannot be charged with any connection with the drawing of it. Over his own signature Garman acknowledged that $3,527.04 had been overpaid on the royalty, and agreed that the same should be applied to future settlements for ore to be mined and carried away by Potts. On the faith of that, Potts paid the sum named to the Smiths. In subsequent settlements, Garman admitted again and again tire correctness of the account, and acquiesced in the terms of the receipts. The receipts subsequently given by Garman to Potts are in the exact words of that given to the Smiths. The court certainly committed no error in adopting the view of the matter taken by the parties themselves.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b540-6" data-blocks='[["BL_540.4",540,[238,966,1177,756]]]'>3. No offer was ever made to prove fraud practiced on Gar-man by the defendant’s managers. Garman can read and write, and signed these receipts with intervals of a year for reflection between them. They in no way changed the lease. The lease says nothing about crediting payments, but simply provides that the rental shall be forty cents per ton on the ore mined and carried away. This is to be paid annually, but only on the ore carried away annually, and no money becomes due until the ore is taken away. Hence any payments in excess of the forty cents upon ore actually hauled, must be offset by ore to be hauled away in the future. Garman’s letter, which the court rejected, was merely an expression of his view of the situation and has no bearing on the case. The plaintiff cannot complain upon the subject of the burden of proof. In his pleadings and his testimony, he assumed that burden.</p>

    <p id="b540-8" data-blocks='[["BL_540.7",540,[235,1833,1168,246]]]'>The clause in the lease which gives rise to the present contention is as follows: “ The parties of the second part agree to mine the iron ore at the rate of fifteen hundred tons per annum, on an average, provided the iron ore can be advantageously mined, and as much more as they see fit to mine.”</p>
    <p id="b540-9" data-blocks='[["BL_540.8",540,[233,2086,1167,301]],["BL_541.1",541,[218,369,1163,553]]]'>As the lease was in writing, its proper construction was for the court. The contention arises upon the words “ advantageously mined.” This language is peculiar, and was evidently intended for the benefit of the lessees. The plaintiff contends that its only effect is to relieve the lessees from hidden defects in the mine, such as a fault, or some physical difficulty in get<a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>ting out the ore, not contemplated by the parties, but which is liable to exist in any mine. The court below gave the language in question a broader construction, and held that it meant that the defendant was not liable under the lease unless the ore could be “ advantageously, that is, beneficially, conveniently, profitably, and gainfully mined,” (see fifth assignment ;) and further instructed the jury that, “ under the terms of the lease given in evidence, the defendant was not liable for any rent or royalty, unless the ore would have been worth when mined as much as it cost to mine it,” (see eighth assignment.)</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[217,933,1163,1014]]]'>We are unable to see any error in this instruction. The court below gave to the word “ advantageously ” its common and popular meaning. It is not a technical word or term of art, and the parties must be presumed to have used it in its known sense. As before observed, it was for the relief of the lessees; hence, if the mining was no longer advantageous to them, they had a right to cease their operations. After defining, as we think properly, the meaning of the word, the court submitted to the jury the question whether the defendant could further work the mine to advantage, and they found specially that he could not. This settles the question of fact adversely to the plaintiff. It is to be observed that the cost of getting the ore to the market was not allowed to enter info the case. It was only the cost of the ore at the mouth of the mine that went to the jury. Surely, if it was not worth as much there as it cost to mine it, the defendant could not mine it advantageously to himself, however beneficial it might be to the plaintiff. We must take this contract as the parties have made it: they might have stipulated for a different rule ; it is our duty to construe the lease according to its plain meaning.</p>
    <p id="b541-6" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[218,1951,1163,452]],["BL_542.1",542,[246,381,1168,238]]]'>There are several other assignments, but the two referred to raise the pivotal question in the case. We find no error in the admission of the testimony referred to in the first four assignments. Under the construction we have placed upon the lease, it was not error to allow the defendant to prove that the ore could not be mined advantageously, why it could not be done, the cost of mining and putting the ore on the bank, and that, when it was so placed, it was not merchantable. Nor was it error to admit in evidence the papers referred to in the tenth <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>assignment. The object was to prove that, in any view of the case, there was no royalty due under the lease. Upon this ground alone the defendant was entitled to a verdict. The remaining assignments do not require discussion. A careful examination of them discloses no error.</p>
    <p id="b542-6" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[1006,638,360,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
