The hall was reached by a flight of stairs leading from Main street in the front directly to the second story, and thence by a hallway upon the second floor to the rear wall of the building, where there were two stairways, one to the right and the other to the left leading to the hall above. At the end of tbe hallway, there was a doorway opening upon a platform hanging over an alley and connected with a stairway leading to the sidewalk on Wain street. This platform was one step lower than tbe door-sill. There were no guards or railing about it. The janitor was directed by tbe defendant to keep the rear door fastened and kept closed during the dances, and he had done so before tbe night of the plaintiff’s injury, but that night he saw it open during the evening and before tbe accident, and left it open.</p>

      <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>The plaintiff was familiar with the means of access to the hall. On September 23d, early in the evening, he had been in the hall where a dance was going on, but went away and returned soon afterwards with a companion. The hallway on the second floor was well lighted, as were also the stairways. The door in the rear wall was open, and outside it was very dark. When they were in the hallway, the plaintiff asked his companion to wait a moment, and stepped out upon the platform for a private purpose. When reaching for the railing which he supposed was there, he fell to the ground below and sustained severe injuries. Afterwards, a railing was put about the platform.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b238-8" data-blocks='[["BL_238.6",238,[256,1284,1176,553]]]'>1. That the evidence in this case shows that the place where the injury occurred was dangerous in the night time ; that the fact that the defendant gave instructions to his servant that the door in the rear of the building should be fastened and' kept closed, is evidence that the defendant knew at the time of the accident that the platform on the rear of the building was dangerous to persons visiting the building; and that the defendant cannot now shield himself from liability for the injury which occurred on account of the negligence or carelessness of the servant in not carrying out his instructions and by means of which neglect the plaintiff was injured.</p>

If the case had been different; if it had been that of an individual visiting the place without any knowledge of the proper, way to the hall above, where the dance was in progress, and if there had been no light to guide him in that way, the questions proposed in this point would be important; for, in such a case as that which is contemplated by this point, it would be necessary to submit the matter to the jury for their determination. But, whether Mr. Wilcox regarded that place as dangerous upon that occasion, and so as a matter of precaution against <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>the danger directed his janitor to close up that door, is not a matter of importance as we view this case, and under the directions which we intend to make in relation to it. It would carry with it the conclusion reasonably enough to the minds of the jurymen that Mr. Wilcox did regard that a dangerous place for people to be going out, but we determine this case on a different view of it; that is, as we have stated, that the plaintiff in this case took the hazard upon himself, when he departed from the regular way of going to the dance above, and went out of the open door into the dark and received this injury.1</p>

There was, therefore, a safe way to go and come, and had he followed it, he would have suffered no harm. He saw proper to leave this way and step through a door into the dark, upon a platform, under the belief that the platform was protected by a railing. In this he was unfortunately mistaken, and he fell and was injured. The owner of the platform owed him no duty of protecting it.
