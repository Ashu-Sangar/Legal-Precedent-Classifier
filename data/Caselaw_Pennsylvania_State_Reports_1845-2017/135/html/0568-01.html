L. 780, affidavits of defence are required in actions of scire facias sur mortgage in York county, and motions for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence are authorized. The general act of April 18, 1874, P. L. 64, authorizes the review by this court of a refusal of such a motion. The affidavit filed by Mrs. Herbst is vague, prolix and conflicting in its statements. It consists of voluminous expressions of opinion and strong assertions of conclusions of law, but contains no statements of fact sufficient to found a valid legal defence upon. The circumstances by which she alleges that she was coerced, are not sufficient, separately or together, to constitute legal duress. She does not deny that the magistrate’s certificate of the acknowledgment contains the whole truth; nor does she assert that Radcliffe ever made the threats which her husband reported to her, or that he had any knowledge of her husband’s prior persuasions. But such a threat against a third person, even if made directly to the mortgagor, is not duress which will invalidate the instrument: Fulton v.

The reasonable conclusion, therefore, is that these payments were taken into consideration in fixing the amounts for which the mortgage was given, and the fact that they were made is far from conclusive that the whole of the mortgage debt is not justly due: Bruner v.

Its effect is often to produce two writs of error in the same cause, instead of one, and is not to be encouraged. Such writs should be confined to plain errors of law. In doubtful cases, and especially in those requiring broad inquiry into facts, where the court refuses judgment the matter in controversy should go to the jury, as the. proper tribunal to decide the cause, under proper instructions from the court.”</p>
