We will not enlarge anymore than to make it intelligible. Our courts have so interpreted that statute as to not make it the means of fraud and wrong, but to do equity and right; and have excepted from its operations certain kinds of verbal arrangements to be proved, indicating that where a contract by parol has been made between parties about the purchase and sale of land and has been so far executed by the purchaser taking possession of the land whose boundaries are clearly defined, paying the purchase money or a portion of it, or making improvements resulting in such a condition that it would be inequitable to disturb the matter, a contract which is executed ; these are exceptions to the ordinary rules. When a contention about that arises in court, the party setting up that arrangement must satisfy the court by evidence showing that an arrangement or contract was made in such a way that the court, if it is true, would execute it. We say it is the duty of the court, on a survey of the facts, to see if they are sufficient and then to submit the facts to the jury to pass upon their truth or otherwise.</p>

The testimony must be clear, distinct and indubitable ; that is to say, the contract must be clearly set out or must clearly appear. It must be precise, so that if it is true, it can be executed. It must be indubitable; that is to <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>say, must come from witnesses who are credible and believed, and who testify under such circumstances as to cany the conviction of a knowledge of what they speak and that they speak truthfully. We do not say, however, that the rule is that it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, as in criminal cases. It is sufficient to say we have indicated the rule. That is the rule in relation to transactions about the purchase and sale of real estate, ordinarily. While the contention here is about real estate, yet the sharp and particular rule indicated by the statute of frauds and perjuries, in our adjudications on that subject, is not required, we say to you, where a partition of real estate is alleged to have been made by parol between tenants in common. Why? We will not enlarge upon the reason or the logic about it more than to say that, inasmuch as both the owners, the tenants in common, owned title to the 'whole of it, when they divided it it was merely separating between them in severalty, a concentrating of the title which they have to the whole of the land. To relieve ourselves of any doubts upon that subject and to be perfectly safe, we will quote one of the latest utterances of the Supreme Court in discussing this question.</p>

Satisfactory as to the fact that there was a partition made between the parties owning the land as tenants in common; actually agreed upon and made, not merely in prospect; and that after the partition was agreed upon, it was actually executed between the two parties, each taking possession or control of the part that was set off to him and which he accepted to himself.

We recognize, to its fullest extent, the very fair and equitable doctrine of estoppel..... That equitable estoppel prevails; but there must bo sufficient facts to raise that.. What exists here? Allen McCartney is the purchaser. What was done to him by Robert? Several years ago he came there and talked to Robert about a bill that he owed the firm of which McCartney was a member. Allen McCartney is a brother-in-law of Robert. Robert said he had not the money, and proposed to sell him his land and spoke about this part being his. Mr. McCartney said he would not buy that, unless he could buy the other, that is, William’s. Robert replied, “You can buy that, too.” The subject matter of the conversation was the payment of this bill. That was several years before the sheriff’s sale. Survey the record, and where do we find any evidence connecting this sheriff’s sale or the purchase of McCartney with this remark or conversation of Robert several years before? We look in vain to discover <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>any. Perchance the relations between the parties may'have changed in the meantime. When the sheriff’s sale took place, it is unquestionable that Robert was not in the country. The fact that an understanding existed in the country, among the people, we cannot say that the law would recognize as a circumstance to be considered as against Robert, unless Robert’s agency in it was clearly established, and that was connected as an inducement to McCartney to make the purchase. We have to wonder and speculate about that, because that was not stated. Those are the only circumstances relied upon, that we can recollect, that raises the question of estoppel. ■ ,.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b386-5" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[268,953,1171,806]]]'>Now, why is an estoppel raised? Because it is a fraud to allow a man to assert a claim to property that he has induced another, or done acts that had induced another, to buy. . It is a very plain principle that we cannot presume fraud; so, then; we must have some testimony from which we can infer that such a condition of things existed as that it would be a fraud to- allow Robert to assert his title against the purchaser at the sherA iff’s sale. Then, again, a certain degree of vigilance is required on the part of the purchaser of real estate when he knows of some question about the title. Yigilantibus, non dormientibiis, jura subveniunt, is a maxim of the law, and it means, “ the law assists those who are vigilant, not those who sleep over their rights.” It has been decided by the Supreme Court, that whatever puts a party upon inquiry amounts to a notice, provided the inquiry would lead to a knowledge of the requisite facts by the exercise of ordinary diligence. -</p>

The idea that he was sitting as a chancellor, pervaded the entire charge of the learned judge. We submit that this idea was incorrect; that an ejectment suit in which the subject of controversy is whether a parol partition has been made or not, is but an ordinary ejectment, involving simply a legal title, and governed by the rules applicable to such proceedings. This proposition is sustained both by reason and by the weight of the authorities. A parol partition is not an ordinary sale or transfer of land; after it, each of the tenants in common <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>has as much land as he had before, and the change is in form only and not in substance.

We contend, however, that the defendant made out a case which, if true, should have satisfied the conscience of a chancellor, and that its truth should have been submitted to the jury. The testimony for the plaintiff, it is true, tended to rebut a part of the defendant’s case, but the credibility of the witnesses and the conflict of the evidence were for the jury: Cullmans v. Lindsay, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20Pa.%20171" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="114 Pa. 171">114 Pa. 171</a>. The court erred, therefore, in deciding, as a matter of law, that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the submission of the case. Again; whether a verdict and judgment in an action of trespass, between the same parties, is conclusive in a subsequent ejgctment involving the same question, is left undecided by the cases of Kerr v.

If, however, the court should be adverse to deciding this' question, or even if it should be decided against us, we assert that the former verdict and judgment are a bar to the present suit, if the learned judge was right when he undertook to sit and decide this case as a chancellor. One judgment as to title is conclusive when the title passed on is equitable: Win-penny v. Winpenny, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20Pa.%20442" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="92 Pa. 442">92 Pa. 442</a>. It is conceded that the ques<a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>tion tried in the trespass suit was identically the same as that involved in the case at bar. If it be objected that the plea of not guilty was on the record of the former action, we reply that said plea was virtually abandoned or withdrawn. Such was the case in Stevens v. Hughes, supra, and the Supreme Court so treated it. A court of equity regards substance, not form; and the former action was in substance a trial of title. If this be an equitable controversy, the former judgment was a bar; if it be a legal controversy, the question was for the jury. Upon the question of estoppel, raised by the fifth specification, we would simply say that from the acts and conduct of William and Robert Me Knight, and from Robert’s express declarations, the defendant was led and had reason to believe that there had been a parol partition, and to buy the land in good faith, paying a fair price for the whole, not the half.</p>

At best there is room for inconvenience. Purchasers may have trouble to prove the partition. The uncertainty of proof might be a serious cloud upon the title, which could be removed only by a decree for a conveyance, and that certainly would not be granted on the evidence in this case. The testimony utterly fails to make a case, and the defendant is endeavoring to torture a vague understanding as to how William and Robert intended at some future time to divide the land, into an actual division, which, in fact, never was made.</p>

On the 16th March, 1875, when the youngest son came of age, an amicable partition of the testator’s lands was made among them in writing, by the terms of which Blair, William, and Robert took as their share of the estate the 174 acres of land already mentioned, agreeing to pay, in the nature of owelty, to their brothers Wilson and Reuben, each the sum of $750, and to John <em>$100; </em>the widow’s dower in the entire estate, adjusted at $420 annually, to remain a charge, payable in equal parts by all the heirs. On the 23d March, 1875, Blair, William, and Robert, by agreement in writing, subdivided their purpart, Blair taking as his share all that portion of their land lying east of the old township road, containing 96 acres 149 perches, upon which were the buildings, and William and Robert taking the balancé of the tract, lying west of the township road, containing 78 acres 148 perches; Blair assuming payment of the $1,500 to Reuben and William, and of the $100 to John, and agreeing, besides, to give to William and Robert $1,000 worth of the timber land off his tract, according to, the adjustment of three of their neighbors named. An old lane, running in a westerly direction from the township road, divided the purpart of William and Robert into two nearly equal parts. The 39 acre piece, lying north of the lane, was subsequently taken in execution at the suit of Mary McKnight, by the sheriff of Blair county, as the property of William McKnight, and at the June Term, 1884, was sold, and a sheriff’s deed dated 20th June, 1884, was executed and delivered to A. L. McCartney, who on the 15th June, 1885, conveyed to Edward Bell the defendant.

If tenants in common, intending to make a partition of their lands, run a line, which is marked on the ground as a division line, and actually take possession of their respective parts in pursuance thereof, and the partition is fully excuted between them, it is sufficient to vest the title in severalty. In Rider v.

The learned judge refused so to charge, saying that the evidence of a parol partition or division was not sufficient to take the case out of the statute of frauds and perjuries, and, further, that the jury should disregard it altogether, and treat Jacobs and Rider as tenants in common. When the case came into this court the judgment was reversed.

A parol partition, when fair and equal, and followed by due execution, has been held to bind even infants and femes covert; and a judgment or a mortgage or the lien of a legacy against one of the tenants in common will, after the partition, ipso facto cease to bind the whole as an entirety, and attach to his purpart: Williard v.

McGhee, <a href="/pa/36/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="36 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="992235" data-case-paths="/pa/36/0453-01">36 Pa. 453</a>, which is a case very similar to the present, it was held that a recovery in an action of trespass quare clausum fregit, where the only plea was liberum tenementum, is not conclusive of the title in a subsequent action of ejectment <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>for the same land. The rule of Stevens v. Hughes, <a href="/pa/31/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="31 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="985066" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0381-01">supra,</a> was there held to Have no application to actions of ejectment. In this case, moreover, the plea of “not guilty” renders the doctrine of Stevens v. Hughes, inapplicable, even if this were trespass.</p>
    <p id="b394-6" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[279,649,1170,603]]]'>Apart from the effect of an executed partition, we think there is no ground for an estoppel. The declaration to Allen L. McCartney was made in 1878 or 1879, long before any purchase by him was in contemplation; indeed, the judgment, which was the instrument of sale, was not entered until 1881, and there is not the slightest proof that McCartney purchased the land, relying on Robert’s statement that he owned the land on one side, and William the land on the other side of the lane, or that he was in any way thereby misled to his injury. We see no ground for a technical estoppel, but this declaration of Robert, with his other acts and declarations, were, of course, proper for the consideration of the jury.</p>
