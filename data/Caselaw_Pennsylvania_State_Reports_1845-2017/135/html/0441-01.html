    <p class="summary" id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[206,779,1164,967]]]'>The first question is, does the said Milton Hendricks in right of his mother, Henrietta Hendricks, deceased, come in as one of the heirs mentioned and intended by the said testators among whom the said $2,000 was to be equally divided on the death of the widow? The maxim is imbedded in the common law that an heir can be disinherited only by express devise or necessary implication, and that implication has been defined to be such a strong probability that an intention to the contrary cannot be supposed: Rupp v. Eberly, <a href="/pa/79/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="79 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="438428" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0141-01">79 Pa. 141</a>; 1 Jarman on Wills, 464; McIntyre v.

The devisee, Milton Hendricks, in right of his mother, Henrietta, deceased, is one of the testator’s heirs at law, and, as he directs the $2,000 to be equally divided among his heirs at law, it is very clear that all who appear in that character are entitled to share. The fund was fixed at $2,000 to maintain the widow by its interest, and that is why the sum was rounded up at $2,000. We have no reason to think that his grandson was to be excluded from heirship, because he had devised him the land, charged as it is with this legacy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[203,1750,1165,658]]]'>The next question is, can the indebtedness of Joel and Samuel Harman to testator be set off against their shares in the $2,000; or rather, can they demand the aid of the Orphans’ Court to recover their shares without first doing equity to it, paying what they owe the estate out of the fund demanded ? And this seems settled in Thompson’s App., <a href="/pa/42/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="42 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="481471" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0345-01">42 Pa. 345</a>-357.
