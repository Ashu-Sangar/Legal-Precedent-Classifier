The court held, that from the time of receiving Moore’s letter, ordering specific sums to be paid to certain enumerated creditors, the party receiving the bill became a trustee for those creditors, and that, thereupon, those creditors acquired such an interest in the fund as could not be divested or affected by plaintiff’s (Sharpless) attachment.

At that meeting, the creditors present made two propositions to Mr. Burger. 1. They proposed that they would accept 38j per cent of their claims, as in full payment of the claims they held against him, and that <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>they would give him until January 1, 1888 to accept or reject this proposition; they also agreed that they would bring no suits against him until January 1,1888. 2. If he rejected that proposition, or offer, they next proposed that he should make an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, at the latter date, January 1, 1888, or soon thereafter. And, as an act of good faith on his part in the premises, those creditors present required that Henry Burger should deposit at once with Mr. Bausman, the garnishee, certain money, then in Mr. Burger’s possession, realized on certain fire insurance policies. If the first proposition was accepted, said money was to be applied to the payment of the 33‡ per cent of their claims; if not, then on the assignment being made, it was to be paid to the assignee for the benefit of creditors. Mr. Burger did at once deposit with Mr. Bausman the sum of $1,737.50, which Mr. Bausman deposited in bank to the credit of “ J. W. B. Bausman, attorney for Henry Burger,” and he still holds it subject to “ his order, as attorney for Henry Burger.” In his answer, the garnishee also states that John A. Burger, the plaintiff, was not present when the above propositions were made on December 1,1887, at his office, and we have nothing before us to show that he ever had any knowledge of such proposals.</p>

Henry Burger does not appear to have accepted the first proposition, nor did he make an assignment until February 16, 1888, after this attachment was issued and served. John A.

Upon this judgment he issued this attachment, which was served prior to the execution of the deed of assignment by Henry Burger.</p>

In Watson v.

Such assignment is within the purview of the acts regulating transfers for the benefit of creditors; and the provision of one of those acts, requiring such assignments to be recorded, not having been complied with, the moneys collected were held liable to attachment by a creditor of the assignor. In Blabon v. Lewis, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Phila.%20454" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Phila. 454">3 Phila. 454</a>, it is said that where a deposit of money is made by a debtor in the hands óf a third person, for the purpose of equal distribution among his creditors, he is the agent, of the debtor, and is not responsible to the creditors unless the transaction takes effect as a trust for creditors, when it will be invalid unless recorded.</p>

A plea of nulla bona would not avail the garnishee under the facts, if presented as stated in his answer. There is no appropriation, no equitable assignment in this case, such as would estop an attaching creditor of Henry Burger, the depositor. The -money was, as stated in the answer, handed over by Mr. Burger to Mr. Bausman, and Mr. Bausman deposited it in bank, in the name of J. W. B.

The arrangement made on December 1,1887, between Burger and his creditors, was perfectly proper and honest, and it would encourage dishonesty to declare it invalid. The attaching creditor stands in no better position than Henry Burger. The latter could not recover the money from Mr. Bausman, as it was placed in the latter’s hands as the result of a contract, made for a valuable consideration. The method of deposit in bank could destroy nobody’s rights.</p>

Unless this is held to be a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, Mr. Bausman must keep the fund, to be used as agreed upon. An assignment of one particular fund has never been held to be a general assignment, and it is difficult to see how a parol contract can be recorded. Even in the cases cited by the court below, assignments of funds for the specific use of creditors have been held good, except in one case, which has since been doubted: Sharpless v. Welsh, 4 Dali.

Drum, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 9" data-case-ids="483392" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0009-01">8 W. &amp; S. 9</a>; Guthrie’s App., <a href="/pa/92/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="92 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="490994" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0269-01">92 Pa. 269</a>; Watson v.

The question for determination is whether, by placing a sum of money in the hands of a third person, pending negotiations with creditors, who agree not to bring suit for a certain time, a debtor can put the fund beyond the reach of a bona fide creditor who was not a party to the arrangement. There was in this- case no specific and direct appropriation of specified amounts to the payment of specific claims of certain enumerated persons, nor was there any written transfer or equitable ¿assignment or declaration of trust. It is not even claimed that <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>the money was deposited for the sole benefit of the creditors who were parties to the arrangement.</p>

If Burger elected not to compromise at 33|- per cent, the arrangement would be binding on no one unless assented to by all his creditors; and, in the event of his declining to compromise, and refusing to make an assignment, it vested no power of control over the fund in any one. Therefore, it was still the property of Burger: Beans v. Bullitt, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20Pa.%20231" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="57 Pa. 231">57 Pa. 231</a>. The utmost effect that could be given to the arrangement, is that the fund be kept intact so as not to be beyond the reach of legal process at the end of the period given Burger for deliberation, and so that no creditor would be the worse for waiting thirty days. This was accomplished. It remained in Bausman’s hands for six weeks after January 1, 1888, and if the other creditors, by their laches, permitted the plaintiff to obtain judgment and attach it, they can blame themselves only:</p>

It might, perhaps, have succeeded, had there been- an irrevocable appropriation of the money to particular creditors. Until so appropriated, the money remained the money of Burger, and was liable to the attachment. Mr. Bausman, if an agent or trustee at all, was only so for Mr. Burger. As was said in Beans v.
