As the statute prescribes the essential ingredients of the offence, the averments of the indictment must specially bring the defendant within all the material words of the act, and nothing can be taken by intendment: Wharton Cr. PL, § 220. The description of the offence contained in the statute must be pursued in the indictment: Respublica v. Tryer, <a href="/yeates/3/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Yeates 451" data-case-ids="6775006" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0451-01">3 Y. 451</a>; Douglass v.

Clark, 2 Ashm. 105; 2 Chitty Cr. Law, 231.

The binding instructions complained of in the second specification were error. The testimony for the commonwealth did not show any duress, or threats, or putting in fear, so as to deter the girl from resistance; and, although she may not actually have assented, mere passiveuoss, or the absence of assent on her part, would not be sufficient to constitute the crime of rape. A mixed case will not do; the connection must be absolutely against her will: Commonwealth v. Childs, 2 Pittsb. 397; People v. Abbott, <a href="/wend/19/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="19 Wend. 192" data-case-ids="2023421" data-case-paths="/wend/19/0192-01">19 Wend. 192</a>. Again; the act of May 19, 1887, construed as a whole, as every statute must be, requires, in order that there may be a conviction of the offence it creates, that the female shall be of good repute. Therefore, it was incumbent on the commonwealth to prove the good repute of this girl, that being an essential ingredient of the offence: Oliver v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/101/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="101 Pa. 215" data-case-ids="500930" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0215-01">101 Pa. 215</a>. The ordinary presumption of good reputation was not sufficient. But even if that presumption applied, it was a question for the jury to decide <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>whether a girl oí the age of this one who would use the vulgar language which she is shown to have used, was of good repute or not, especially when taken into consideration with her acts at the time of the alleged connection.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[252,573,1174,962]]]'>4. The jury had a right, if they found that the girl was not of good repute, and that the carnal knowledge was with her consent, to convict of fornication only; but the instructions of the court tended to prevent this, and therefore they impinged too strongly on the province of the jury: Lane v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/59/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="59 Pa. 376" data-case-ids="426975" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0376-01">59 Pa. 376</a>. The testimony of Dr. Buck should not have been admitted, as the examination was not made within a reasonable time. On account of the great probability that the conditions disclosed by an examination, made at such a remote period, may have arisen from fraudulent or natural causes, or from intercourse with others than the defendant, the testimony was more likely to lead to erroneous results than to correct ones, and its admission would be a dangerous precedent. The offer of the defendant to show that the prosecution prevented an examination at or about the time when it was alleged that the girl had been outraged was competent, on the principle that the suppression of evidence raises a presumption adverse to the party suppressing it, and also to rebut or weaken the effect of the testimony concerning the examination by Dr. Buck.</p>

L. 30, is clearly a matter of discretion, and the exercise of discretion in granting or refusing it is not reviewable by the Supreme Court: Newlin’s Petition, <a href="/pa/123/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="123 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="967139" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0541-01">123 Pa. 541</a>. The act of May 19, 1887, P. L. 128, does not create a new offence, but simply defines the offence of rape, changing the age of consent and some of the other boundaries of the crime, without creating any new degrees of it punishable by different penalties. It leaves the one crime, rape, and prescribes a single penalty. Over-nice exceptions are not encouraged when life is not at stake, and certainty to a common intent in general is all that is required: Sherban v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%20212" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="8 W. 212">8 W. 212</a>; Commonwealth v. Keenan, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20Pa.%20206" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="67 Pa. 206">67 Pa. 206</a>; Commonwealth v. Ramsey, 1 Brewst. 422. An indictment is good, if it substantially charge the offence, <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>,nd objections to formal defects must be taken before the jury :s sworn: § 11, act of March 31, 1860, P. L. <em>433; </em>Commonwealth v. Jessup, <a href="/pa/63/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="63 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1019086" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0034-01">63 Pa. 34</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.4",511,[200,525,1161,1067]]]'>2. Prior to the act of 1887, carnal knowledge, forcibly and against the will, was sufficiently shown if it appeared that the person upon whom the offence was committed was under eleven years of age, as she was presumed incapable of consenting. Yet, in such case, it was never thought necessary to set forth the age, even of the girl, the word rape being sufficient: Commonwealth v. Sugland, <a href="/mass/70/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="4 Gray 7" data-case-ids="2075622" data-case-paths="/mass/70/0007-01">4 Gray 7</a>; a fortiori, the age of the defendant need not be set out. Although it has long been the law that a boy less than fourteen years old is presumed incapable of committing the offence of rape, it has never been held necessary to aver that a defendant charged with its commission was over that age. In this indictment, however, the defendant is charged as a man. The general acceptation of that word is an adult male, and one of its recognized meanings is a male of legal age. And, moreover, he is described as a married man. If he wanted a more specific statement he could have applied for a bill of particulars: Williams v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/91/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="91 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="488080" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0493-01">91 Pa. 493</a>; Commonwealth v. Hill, 2 Pears. 432. At most, there was an imperfect statement of his age, -which is cured by the verdict, as it was supplied by evidence: Whart. Cr. Pr. &amp; PL, §§ 760, 762.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b511-7" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[199,1599,1162,803]],["BL_512.1",512,[308,369,1166,142]]]'>3. There was sufficient evidence to sustain a charge of rape at common law. The girl lived in the family of the defendant, was under his domination and control, in fear of his punishment, and with no friend to whom she could go for protection. The clause in the act of May 19, 1887, P. L. 128, relating to the effect of a finding by the jury that the woman child was not of good repute and consented to the intercourse, is a saving clause in the nature of a justification, and therefore bad repute is matter of defence to be proved by the defendant. And it was competent to corroborate the girl by physical evidence that her story might be true. The offer to show that an earlier examination was prevented by “the prosecution,” was bad for indefiniteness, if for no other cause; it did not give the name of a single person who in any way interfered. But there is no law requiring a prosecutrix to undergo a physical examination at the instance of the defendant, and therefore her refusal to do <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>so, or the interposition of her friends, preventing the granting of what the defendant had no right to ask, would not be competent as matter of defence.</p>

    <p id="AEhq" data-blocks='[["BL_512.7",512,[296,777,1173,808]]]'>The motion to change the venue was in the sound discretion of the court below. The application was made upon the ground that a fair trial of the defendant could not be had in Potter county. The act of March 18, 1875, P. L. 30, provides that in criminal prosecutions the venue may be changed, for the causes enumerated in the act, when it “is made to appear to the satisfaction of the court” that the grounds upon which such application is made are well founded. In this casé, we are bound to presume that it did not appear to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant could not have a fair trial in Potter county. For anything the record discloses, the discretion of the learned judge was properly exercised. In any event, there was no such abuse of discretion as would justify our interference. It would seriously disturb the administration of the criminal law if, by merely filing an affidavit, a defendant could have a change of venue as a matter of right.</p>
    <p id="b512-9" data-blocks='[["BL_512.8",512,[281,1589,1180,811]],["BL_513.1",513,[183,389,1162,97]]]'>It was alleged that there could be no conviction because . there was no evidence that the child, Myra Lebar, upon whom • the rape had been committed, was of good repute. There was no need for the commonwealth to prove her to be of good repute until her character had been attacked. The law presumes •it to be good. If it was not, that was a matter of defence. We think this is the proper construction of the act of May 19, 1887, P. L. 128, the proviso of which is as follows: “That, upon the trial of any defendant charged with the unlawful carnal knowledge and abuse of a woman child under the age of sixteen years, if the jury shall find that such woman child was not of good repute, and that the carnal knowledge was with her consent, the defendant shall be acquitted of the felonious rape, and convicted of fornication only.” A man who seeks to escape conviction for an offence of this nature, upon the ground that the female child he has abused is not of good <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>repute, must show it; the law will not help him out with presumptions.</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[185,493,1160,299]]]'>We are not prepared to say that it was error to admit the evidence of .Dr. Buck, referred to in the eighth assignment. It is true the medical examination was made at a very late day, and, to the extent of the delay, the force of the evidence was very much weakened. The learned judge very properly called the attention of the jury to this circumstance, in his charge.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[182,800,1162,493]]]'>Nor do we think there was error in the exclusion of the testimony referred to in the eleventh assignment. At the time the defendant took the child to Dr. Meine for the purpose of having a medical examination, she was under his control, living in his house. In taking her alone to a physican of his own selection, he may have been attempting to manufacture testimony for himself. The offer was also vague. It was not stated who had interposed the objection to the medical examination. The offer amounts to nothing more than that the doctor had refused to make an examination.</p>
    <p id="b513-7" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[182,1310,1161,147]]]'>There is nothing in the remaining assignments which we think requires notice. The subject, as before observed, is unsavory <em>; </em>and we gladly end the discussion.</p>
    <p id="b513-8" data-blocks='[["BL_513.7",513,[443,1464,899,237]]]'>The judgment is affirmed, and it is ordered that the defendant surrender himself forthwith to the custody of the sheriff of Potter county, under and in obedience to the sentence of the court below.</p>
