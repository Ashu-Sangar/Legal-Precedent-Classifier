The proof of loss was received October 80th; ■ and in no event would the loss be due under ninety days from that date, and presume the money will be paid if the same is found to be correct and just.” No further communication took place-between the parties until about the last of January 1888, when McKee again wrote to the secretary of the company. In response, he received a letter from Huntzinger dated February 2, 1888, as follows: “ Our board has not yet taken final action' on your claim; they will meet on the second Saturday, 11th <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>of February, and I would suggest that you had better come to Harrisburg on that day and bring with you the books which you exhibited to me, and the inventory taken last June; and I believe that the matter can then be closed, at least the board can take final action in the premises.” On February 11th, McKee sent his counsel, Mr. A.

On February 18, 28 and 27, 1888, McKee went to Harrisburg and had interviews with Huntzinger to whom the matter had been committed by the company. On these occasions, McKee took with him such of his books and papers as had not been destroyed by the fire, submitted them to Huntzinger’s inspection, and answered such inquiries as were made of him by Huntzinger. The latter, however, alleged that he was not afforded sufficient time to complete his examination of McKee for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of stock on hand at the time of the fire, as McKee always arrived at Harrisburg about eleven o’clock in the morning, and left at four in the afternoon. The testimony for the plaintiff tended to show that on February 23d, Huntzinger, after going out to dinner at noon, remained away from his office for between two and three hours, and kept McKee waiting for him for that length of time.

Such a change in a building as is shown by the undisputed evidence in this case, makes a risk much more hazardous. The court should have admitted our offers to show this, by a witness having accurate knowledge of the subject, and to show by expert testimony that insurance men would regard and treat this building, after the changes were made in it, as a more hazardous risk than before the making of them: Hartman v.

However, upon a proper construction of the policy, we do not believe that the question, whether the alteration in the building increased the risk or not, should have been submitted to the jury. According to the plain meaning of the language used, any change should be communicated to the company, whether the insured thinks it material to the risk or not, so that the company can exercise its own judgment upon that question and its option to continue or cancel the policy: Calvert v.

No matter by what means the risk was changed, the company was entitled to notice. The condition in the policy is not limited to an act personal or permissive on the part of the insured, and it was McKee’s duty to give notice, no matter by whom the change in the risk was caused. Under the ruling of the court below, a part of the building might have been, changed into a dynamite factory or a powder magazine, increasing the risk a thousand fold, and yet the insurer would have been entitled to no notice unless such change was made by the insured or by some one under his control.

The evident intention of the clause providing for notice to the company of any change, is that it shall apply, not to a change in the occupancy of the building merely, but only to a change in the risk taken by the company into one of greater hazard. It is manifest that in this instance the hazard was diminished, instead of being increased. The plaintiff knew that the occupancy of the building by the barber and his son was a protection, both to the building and to the stock of goods insured. But, even if the risk was in fact increased by the alterations in the building, there is not a particle of evidence that the plaintiff knew this. There may be cases in which the increase of risk is so palpable and plain that knowledge of it <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>by the insured must necessarily be inferred; but this inference must be drawn from evidence, direct or circumstantial, and there is none such in this case. The plaintiff was not bound to give notice of a change in the building, which, in the fair exercise of his own knowledge and judgment, be believed would not increase the hazard: Rife v. Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=115%20Pa.%20532" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="115 Pa. 532">115 Pa. 532</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="Aah2" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[270,725,1172,1060]]]'>2. As there was no evidence that McKee knew the risk was increased, the offers of the defendant referred to in the first five assignments of error were inadmissible, and the defendant has no cause to complain of the answers of the court which are the subjects of the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and thirteenth assignments. Those answers could work no harm to it. In giving them, the court below followed Breuner v. Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=51%20Cal.%20107" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="51 Cal. 107">51 Cal. 107</a> (<a href="/citations/?q=21%20Am.%20Rep.%20703" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="21 Am. Rep. 703">21 Am. Rep. 703</a>). The doctrine laid down in that case, that a change occasioned by a cause not within the control of the insured is not within a provision like the one in question here, is in accordance with reason and justice and is supported by the principle, reaffirmed in Rife v. Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=115%20Pa.%20532" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="115 Pa. 532">115 Pa. 532</a>, that the conditions of a policy must be construed most strongly against the company. The conduct of the defendant’s secretary, after the fire, has the unmistakable flavor of sharp practice, and manifests an intention to impede the settlement of the loss. There can be no error in submitting to the jury the question whether the plaintiff appeared a sufficient number of times to enable the company to examine him and it failed to do so with due diligence, though it seems to us the court should promptly have disposed of this as a matter of law.</p>

On October 29,1887, the plaintiff furnished the company with sworn proofs of loss, amounting to $4,518.16. The company declined to pay, and in the court below defended principally upon two grounds, viz.: <em>(a) </em>That the risk had been changed in the occupation of the building or premises insured, of which change no notice had been given to the company as <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>required by tbe policy; and (b) that the plaintiff did not submit himself, his books, papers, etc., to the company for examination, as also required by the policy.</p>

Prior to this occupancy by the barber, no one had slept there; the building was wholly unprotected at night. It also appeared that a stove had been placed in the barber shop, and a galvanized iron pipe or smoke-stack had been carried up outside the building, and about two feet therefrom, to a point some distance above the roof. This was, briefly stated, the change of occupancy of which the company complains; a change with which the plaintiff had nothing to do, and which did not occur in any part of the premises occupied by him, and covered by the policy. Under these circumstances, the learned counsel asked the court to instruct the jury that the change referred to “ was a violation of the condition of the policy, and the verdict must be for the defendant; ” (see defendant’s first point, with assignment of error.) This was answered by the court as follows : “ Refused, there being no evidence to the effect that the insured changed the risk in the occupation of the building or premises described, etc., or that any change of the risk was made or permitted by him to be made by any person, thing, or circumstance over which he had any control, or for the making of which he had any right to ask the consent of the company.” This answer was clearly correct. The insured had made no change of occupancy; he had no control over that portion of the building; he might or might not have known of it; and, if he had, there is nothing to show that he knew the risk would be increased. On the contrary, he might well have supposed that it would be decreased by having some one to sleep in and protect it at night. The condition in the policy in regard to a change of occupancy contemplates an increase of the risk. Be-' fore the insured can be held to the duty of notifying the com<a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>pany of such increase, he must be shown to have known of it: Leb.

    <p id="b578-6" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[267,533,1179,900]]]'>The first above stated ground of defence was flimsy enough, but the second is more so. The company had the books of the insured, and ample opportunity to examine them and him in regard to the loss. The insured not only left his books at the office of the company, but called there more than once in person for the purpose of explanation or examination. We need not go into detail upon this point. It is sufficient to say that the action of the officers of the company was indicative of delay and an intention of lulling the insured into security, rather than a desire to promptly adjust and pay the loss. Their conduct in this respect is the more remarkable from the fact, asserted in the argument at bar and not denied, that the company had re-insured |1,500 of this risk in the Phoenixville Fire Insurance Company; had used these same proofs of loss in making their claim upon that company, and had collected therefrom the full amount of such re-insurance. Under such circumstances, ■ a quibble over the proofs of loss is unbecoming. We find no error in this record.</p>
