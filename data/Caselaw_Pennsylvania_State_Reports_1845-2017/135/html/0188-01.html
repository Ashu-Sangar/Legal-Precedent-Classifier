    <p class="summary" id="b210-15" data-blocks='[["BL_210.13",210,[281,1747,1171,96]]]'>We have been asked by the defendant’s counsel to answer a point in writing which we will answer now:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b210-16" data-blocks='[["BL_210.14",210,[280,1851,1171,298]]]'>1. The defendant respectfully requests the court to charge that a failure on the part of the plaintiff to fully comply with the terms of his contract is a bar to recovery in this case; and, if the jury believe from the evidence that he so failed, then, without regard to the matter of account between the parties, the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b210-17" data-blocks='[["BL_210.15",210,[280,2156,1171,247]],["BL_211.1",211,[235,375,1168,1826]]]'>[In answer to this point, the jury are instructed that the plaintiff cannot recover in this case, unless the jury find from the evidence that he has substantially complied with his contract. A mere technical failure to comply, by the leaving back of a few logs that were so covered with brush or snow that <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>they could not be found and got out by using reasonable care and diligence, would not be such a substantial failure as would defeat the plaintiff’s right to recover upon that ground. It is an action of covenant, and the plaintiff cannot compel the defendant to keep his covenants, unless the plaintiff himself shows that he has kept the covenants on his part. If the plaintiff substantially failed to comply with his contract, then, in the language of this point and without regard to the accounts between the parties, the plaintiff could not recover, because he cannot call the defendant to account until he has himself complied. But a mere technical failure would not defeat his right to recover. If a contract was let for the construction of a building, and in some unsubstantial and inconsequential particular the contract was not carried out, if it was substantially in accordance with the contract, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover for the value of the labor on the building. And so in this log contract; if the plaintiff substantially fulfilled his contract by cutting the logs and delivering them, substantially as he had agreed to, then he can recover although there may be a few logs that were not delivered. If they were logs that were covered by the fallings of the trees so that they could not be seen at the time of hauling the logs, or logs that were covered deep in the snow so that they could not be well found, a small amount I mean, that would not be a substantial failure to comply. But, if there was a large amount of logs left on the land, and the job was so carelessly and recklessly done that you could say it was only partially done, the plaintiff could not recover at all.] 4 [This question is one of fact for the jury, and not of law for the court, and that depends somewhat on the custom of lumbermen. Was this lot cleared from the timber as closely as it is the custom of prudent and economical lumbermen to clear it ? If it was, it was a substantial compliance ; and, if not, it was a failure to comply, and as such would defeat the plaintiff’s right to recover; and that is a question for you to determine from the evidence.] 3</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b211-6" data-blocks='[["BL_211.4",211,[236,2209,1164,197]],["BL_212.1",212,[261,373,1172,756]]]'>The plaintiff testifies himself that he cleared the lot very clean. And several witnesses testify on that point. The defendant’s witnesses show that there was a considerable amount of timber left back; that there were 77 logs, or timber that <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>would have made 77 logs, that were not got in, and that there were eight or ten or twelve that were measured and marked with Smith’s mark that were not got in; while the evidence for the plaintiff makes the amount that was left back on the lot a much less amount than that. The evidence of two witnesses, whose names I do not remember, and it is not necessary that I should go over this evidence in exact detail, is that there were some eight or ten very small logs that were left back, that were measured to Smith and confessedly included in his general item of the quantity which the plaintiff alleges that he has delivered, and the evidence of the witnesses is that it amounted to 208 feet or thereabouts; logs that were cut and marked with Smith’s mark and measured and went into this account; and they in any event should be measured out because Smith did not get them and should not pay for them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b212-6" data-blocks='[["BL_212.4",212,[259,1137,1172,858]]]'>Then there is considerable evidence on the part of the plaintiff as to the quantity of timber left back on the lot that was not marked to Smith, making it a far less amount than the testimony of the defendant would indicate. You will have to find on this question from the evidence of the witnesses, which is somewhat contradictory. [The quantity of lumber that was left back on the lot and not measured to Smith and therefore was not charged to him in this account, would be of no consequence in this case, because confessedly Smith has not been charged with that; it would be of no consequence except as bearing on the question of whether there was a substantial compliance with the contract, and in that view you Avill examine that evidence. Whatever is measured for Mr. Smith and not draAvn in should be deducted from the grand aggregate which Smith alleges he got in, because it Avould be charged in.] 6 And that is all that it is necessary for me to charge upon that point.</p>

[If you should find, as I have said to you already, that there was such an utter failure to comply on the part of the plaintiff here, or such a failure to comply as that he did not substantially comply with his contract, you would not go any further, but your verdict would be for the defendant. But if you should find that although there were some logs left back, yet that notwith<a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>standing that fact, it was a substantial compliance with the terms of the covenant that Mr. Pallman had entered into, then you would proceed to the question of how much did the plaintiff really deliver to the defendant,] <em>7 </em>and upon that question the evidence is a good deal conflicting.....</p>
