The judgment had been opened, proceedings to stay in the meantime. The issue had been tried in the court below with the result of a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. A motion was made for a new trial, and pending this motion the execution was issued. The case was not determined. The pendency of a motion for a new trial left it open. Under such circumstances, it was not only irregular to issue the writ of venditioni exponas, but it came dangerously near being a contempt of court. It was probably not so intended.</p>
