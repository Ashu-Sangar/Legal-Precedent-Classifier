During the conversation with Tillman, the defendant remarked that he wished Paul would come along; he would like to put a ball in him, displaying a revolver while saying this. Tillman and other witnesses who saw the defendant about this time, testified that he did not exhibit much evidence of drunkenness.</p>

All the boys, except the defendant, started off in obedience to Paul’s directions, but when he returned after starting Belford away, he found the defendant still standing there. The defendant made some remark, which was not heard by any of the witnesses, after which the officer said, “ Well, I will take you; ” and seizing hold of him, started with him to the lock-up. On the way, the defendant was heard complaining about being choked, and talking in a loud voice. Soon after, a pistol shot was heard, when the defendant was seen to run out of the narrow street or alley in which the lock-up was situated, and Paul’s body was discovered.

His uncle accompanied him as far as a deserted hunter’s camp, six miles distant, and there left him. On the succeeding afternoon, in consequence of the impassable condition of the roads, the defendant concluded to take to the railroad and get upon a freight train. He did so, was put off the train several times, but each time got on again. Being questioned by one of the train hands he gave a false name and a false account as to the occasion of his journey. The flagman recognizing him, he was about to jump off the train, which was moving at a rapid rate, but was dissuaded by promises that if ho would remain on it he would be assisted to escape. The flagman engaged him in conversation about the killing. What the defendant said about it was related upon the trial, by the flagman, as follows:</p>

And thou, he said, two fellows came and shoved him into Paul’s arms and then he took him down to the lock-up and wanted to put him in; and “ I shot him.” And he says, “ I don’t know how I happened to have the revolver in my pocket, it was my brother’s revolver;” but he says, “it is something! never carry,” and he says “ I didn’t mean to kill that man; ” says, “ I wanted to shoot over his head and stun him;” says “I don’t know how I came to get so low.” Q.

He testified on his own behalf that he had no recollection of firing the shot, or of anything else that occurred at the lock-up, except his hearing a shot, falling, or being pushed down, and getting up and seeing Paul lying there, after which he remembered nothing more until he found himself awake on the outside of the town; that he remembered making no threats against Paul that evening, and had made none previous thereto ; that he was first informed that Paul was dead while upon the freight train, previous to his arrest, and when he saw the officers were going to arrest him, he had “ a kind of an idea ” what it was for; thought it was “ for having trouble with Paul or breaking away from him, something of that kind; ” that he did not recollect making the statements testified to by the flagman.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.4",90,[267,673,1184,759]]]'>Murder, as defined by the common law, is where a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being and in the peace of the commonwealth, with malice prepense or aforethought, either express or implied. The distinguishing criterion of murder is malice aforethought. But it is not malice in its ordinary understanding alone,—a .particular ill-will, a spite or a grudge. Malice is a legal term, implying much more. It comprehends not only a particular ill-will, but every case where there is a wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty, although a particular person may not be intended to be injured. Murder, therefore, at common law, embraces cases where no intent to kill existed, but where the state or frame of mind termed malice, in its legal sense, prevailed.</p>

By the act of March 31, 1860, “ all murder' which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery or burglary, shall be deemed murder of the first degree, and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder of the second degree.” [When not committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate any one of the felonies named in the statute, the intention to kill is the essence of murder in the first degree.] 6</p>

The law fixes upon no length of time as necessary to form the intention to kill, but leaves the existence of a fully formed intent as a fact to be determined by the jury, from all the facts and circumstances in evidence. A learned judge has said: “ It is equally true, both in fact and from experience, that no time is too short for a wicked man to frame in his mind his scheme of murder, and to contrive the means of accomplishing it.” But this expression must be qualified, lest it mislead. It is true that such is the swiftness of human thought that no time is so short in which a wicked man may not form a design to kill and frame the means of executing his purpose, yet this suddenness is opposed to premeditation, and the jury must be well convinced, upon the evidence, that there was time to deliberate and premeditate. The law regards, and the jury must find, the actual intent; that is to say, the fully-formed purpose to kill, with so much time for deliberation and premeditation as to convince them that this purpose is not the immediate offspring of rashness and impetuous temper, and that the mind has become fully conscious of its own design. If there be time to frame in the mind, fully and consciously, the intention to kill, and select the weapon or means of death, and to think and know beforehand, though the time be short, the use to be made of it, there is time to deliberate and premeditate.</p>

But this proof need not be express or positive. It may be inferred from the circumstances. If, from all the facts attending the killing, the jury can fully, reasonably and satisfactorily infer the existence of the intention to kill, and the malice, of heart with which it was done, they will be warranted in so doing. He who uses upon the body of another, at some vital part, with a manifest intention to use it upon him, a deadly weapon, as an axe, a gun, a knife or pistol, must, in the absence of qualifying facts, <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>be presumed to know that his blow is likely to kill, and, knowing this, must be presumed to intend the death, which is the probable and ordinary consequence of such an act. He who so uses a deadly weapon, without a sufficient cause of provocation, must be presumed to do it wickedly, or from a bad heart. Therefore, he who takes the life of another with a deadly weapon, and with a manifest design thus to use it upon him, with sufficient time to deliberate and fully to form the conscious purpose of killing, and without any sufficient reason or cause of extenuation, is guilty of murder in the first degree.</p>

All murder not of the first degree is necessarily of the second degree, and includes all unlawful killing under circumstances of depravity of heart, and a disposition of mind regardless of social duty, but where no intention to kill exists, or can be reasonably or fully inferred; therefore, in all cases of murder, if no intention to kill can be inferred or collected from the circumstances, the verdict must be murder in the second degree.</p>

But, though a homicide is presumed to be murder, it is not presumed to be murder of the first degree. The presumption against the prisoner rises no higher than murder of the second degree, till it is shown by the commonwealth to be murder of the first degree. It, therefore, lies on the commonwealth to satisfy the jury of those facts and circumstances which indicate a deliberate intention to kill, and the cool depravity of heart and conscious purpose which constitutes, as before stated, the crime of murder in the first degree. And in the solution of the question of the intent with which the act was done, the nature of the weapon and the place and character of the wound are matters to be considered by the jury. The deadliness of the weapon tends to indicate the intent with which it was used. And, as evidence bearing also upon the question of intent, the commonwealth has introduced the testimony of witnesses going to show that, prior to the commission of the crime, the prisoner made threats at different times and to different persons that he would take the life of the deceased.</p>

It must be remembered, however, that although the prisoner is made a competent witness under the act of assembly, the credibility of his testimony is for the jury. He is a witness deeply interested in the result of the prosecution; his life or his liberty is dependent upon the result, and he is testifying under a great temptation to shield himself from the consequences of his crime. His evidence must be closely and carefully scrutinized by the jury, when weighed in the balance against the evidence of disinterested witnesses.</p>

In deciding upon the case, it is the duty of the jury to give the prisoner the benefit of any reasonable doubt, arising out of the evidence, which prevents them from coming to a satisfactory conclusion, a doubt which causes your minds to pause and hesitate. But this doubt must fairly arise out of the evidence, and not be merely fancied or conjured up. It must be an honest doubt; such a difficulty as fairly strikes a conscientious mind and clouds the judgment. Presumptions are in favor of innocence until proof has fairly established guilt. If the mind be fairly satisfied of a fact on the evidence, as much so as would induce a man of reasonable firmness and judgment to take the fact as true and to act upon it in a matter of importance to himself, it would be sufficient to rest a verdict upon.</p>

While intoxication of itself is no defence to the fact of guilt, yet it is evidence to be considered by the jury upon the question of intent or premeditation, for the purpose of determining the degree of the crime. In this state, where the act of assembly resolves murder into two degrees, in which the distinguishing test between murder in the first and murder in the second degree is a specific intent to take life, [the intoxication of the prisoner may be material, and is evidence to be considered by the jury for the purpose of enabling them to determine whether at the time of the commission of the crime the prisoner was so much intoxicated and his intellect so clouded, as to deprive him of the power to think and weigh the nature of the act committed.] 3 The intent to take life, with a full and conscious knowledge of the purpose to do so, is the distinguishing criterion of murder in the first degree; and this consciousness of the purpose of the heart is defined hy the words, deliberately, and premeditatedly. It therefore becomes important for the jury to ascertain and determine from the evidence what was tlie frame or state of mind of the prisoner at the time the deadly shot was fired. [Was he able to deliberate and premeditate the homicide?] 3 And the jury should carefully examine and consider the evidence bearing upon the intoxication of the prisoner, both that which has been adduced by the prisoner and by the commonwealth.</p>

That act made radical changes, but the construction placed upon it by judges whose habits of thought had crystalized under the old régime was harsh, instead of liberal, as it should have been. The words, “ by any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing,” should not have been lifted out of their connection and set up as an independent sentence, nor distorted, as they have been, from their usual, ordinary meaning. The intention of the legislature was that only in extreme cases of cool, deliberate, heartless killing, should the death penalty be inflicted. They named certain forms of killing, and the words “ any other kind,” etc., should be applied only to a killing of a character and nature similar to these: Monongahela Bridge Co. v. Railway Co., <a href="/pa/114/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="114 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="550066" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0478-01">114 Pa. 478</a>.

The facts show very clearly that the killing was the result, not of deliberation and premeditation, nor of a spirit of revenge awaiting its opportunity, but of rashness and impetuous temper, aggravated and inflamed by drunkenness.

It is true that the court, in some parts of the charge and in the answer to the defendant’s points, correctly defined murder in the first degree; but how were the jury to decide between the different statements ? See Pistorius v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/84/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="84 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1053551" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0158-01">84 Pa. 158</a>; Forker v.

If the sixth point of the defendant; which the court affirmed, was not in harmony with the general charge, any error committed in this respect was against the commonwealth and in favor of the prisoner. The court might very properly have refused that point: People v. Mills, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20N.Y.%20178" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="98 N.Y. 178">98 N. Y. 178</a>.

    <p id="b102-7" data-blocks='[["BL_102.6",102,[275,985,1184,658]]]'>But for a single error, this judgment might have been affirmed. The learned judge below instructed the jury, in his general charge, that “ good character is always of importance and is evidence to be duly considered by the jury, and may turn the scale where there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree or grade of the crime.” See second assignment. This is all the charge contains upon this subject; there was no point put to the court in regard to it. The fact that the homicide was committed by the appellant was not disputed below nor here, nor was there any attempt to show that the offence was manslaughter. The sole question was as to the degree of murder. The jury convicted appellant of murder in the first degree.</p>
    <p id="b102-8" data-blocks='[["BL_102.7",102,[273,1648,1173,758]],["BL_103.1",103,[184,382,1167,350]]]'>' We think the evidence of good character is applicable both to the commission of the offence and the grade of the crime. So far, we are in accord with the trial judge. But we think he stated inaccurately the law as applicable to good character. In Heine v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/91/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="91 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="488319" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0145-01">91 Pa. 145</a>, the court below instructed the jury: “ If a man is guilty, his previous good character has nothing to do with the case, but if you have reasonable doubts as to his guilt, then character steps in, and aids in determining that doubt.” This ruling was reversed by this court, Mr. Justice Gordon saying: “ The effect of this was to give the evidence of good character no weight whatever ; for, if the other testimony left in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt, this of itself, without more, entitled him to an acquittal. Evidence of good character is not a mere make-weight, thrown in to assist in the production of a result <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>that would happen at all events; but it is positive evidence, and may of itself, by the creation of a reasonable doubt, produce an acquittal: ” citing Whart., Crim. Law, § 643. In Hanney v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20Pa.%20323" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="116 Pa. 323">116 Pa. 323</a>, the court below fell into the same error as in Heine v. Commonwealth, supra, and upon its review in this court the judgment was reversed, Justice Gordon repeating and amplifying his remarks in the former case.</p>
    <p id="b103-5" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[179,741,1173,1667]]]'>It was urged, however, that Kilpatrick v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/31/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="31 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="985092" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0198-01">31 Pa. 198</a>, sustains the ruling of the court below. The portion of the charge assigned as error in that case is as follows: “ The evidence proves the defendant to have borne an excellent reputation ; originally, evidence of good character was not allowed to <em>go </em>to the jury, when there was positive proof of the commission of an offence, for if one was seen to commit a murder with deliberation, although he had borne an irreproachable character, and were even an angel, he would yet be guilty. The rule of law in this state, however, permits evidence of good character to be submitted to the jury in every case of homicide, no matter what may be the other testimony in the cause. But when a doubt suggests itself to your minds, as to the prisoner’s guilt upon the facts of the case as presented by the evidence, the' law easts the whole weight of the prisoner’s former good character in mercy’s scale, and settles the question in favor of the accused.” In commenting upon this language, this court said, through Mr. Justice Strong : “ The final exception is that the court erred in the instruction which they gave to the jury, respecting the evidence of the prisoner’s good character. This, like the former, is based upon a misconception of the eharge. We do not understand the purport of the instruction to have been such as it is contended to have been by the counsel for the plaintiff in error. The substance of the charge was that the law permitted evidence of good character to be submitted to the jury (of course for their consideration) in every ease of homicide, no matter what might be the other testimony in the cause, and that, when a doubt arises as to the guilt of the accused, such doubt was conclusive in his favor. This by no means confined the jury to attaching importance to the evidence only in cases of reasonable doubt. On the contrary, it left them at liberty to make it a basis for the formation of a doubt.” •</p>
    <p id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.3",104,[294,380,1173,1116]]]'>
      <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>I have been thus careful to quote the exact language of the court below and of this court in Kilpatrick v. Commonwealth, as I fear it has been misunderstood in some instances. The distinction between the two cases, briefly stated, is this: In the case in hand, the benefit of good character was limited to cases where there is a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, or, in the precise language of the court below, “ may turn the scale where there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree or grade of the crime; ” while in Kilpatrick v. Commonwealth, the language of the court below, while not as explicit as in some of the later cases,—to repeat again the language of Justice Strong,—“by no means confined the jury to attaching importance to the evidence only in cases of reasonable doubt. On the contrary, it left them at liberty to make it a basis for the formation of a doubt.” There is nothing in the charge of the court below from which the jury could fairly infer that the evidence of good character might <em>create </em>the reasonable doubt which entitles the prisoner to a safe deliverance. It is true that the difference in phraseology in the two cases is apparently slight. There is, however, a real and substantial difference ; and, where a man’s life may depend upon a single word, the use of language cannot be attended with too much care.</p>
    <p id="b104-6" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[293,1503,1173,910]],["BL_105.1",105,[202,364,1165,299]]]'>We might cite numerous other cases upon this point, but the law is too well settled to require it. The rule' deducible from the authorities may be briefly stated thus: Evidence of good character is always admissible for the defendant in a criminal case ; it is to be weighed and considered in connection with all the other evidence in the cause,—it may of itself, in some instances, create the reasonable doubt which would entitle the accused to an acquittal. The rule itself is not mei’ely merciful. It is both reasonable and just. There may be cases in which, owing to the peculiar circumstances in which a man is placed, evidence of good character may be all he can offer in answer to a charge of crime. Of what avail is a good character, which a man may have been a lifetime in acquiring, if it is to benefit him nothing in his hour of peril ? The vice of this portion of the charge is in the instruction that good character “ may turn the scale where there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree or grade of the crime.” But, if the other evidence .is such .as to raise a reasonable doubt whether the grade of crime was mur<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>der in the first degree, then the jury are bound to acquit of that offence; so that, as was observed in the cases cited, “ this was to give the evidence of good character no weight whatever.” The evidence of good character is to be considered with the other evidence in the case, and if it all combined creates a reasonable doubt, the defendant is entitled to an acquittal.</p>
    <p id="b105-5" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[195,671,1170,1724]],["BL_106.1",106,[274,362,1171,250]]]'>The learned judge below evidently was of opinion that the evidence of good character had little bearing upon the case. I gather this from his opinion refusing a new trial, in which he said, in commenting upon this portion of his charge : “ Of this instruction the defendant has no cause of complaint. It was as favorable to him as he could ask. In fact, as the commission of the crime by the defendant was not disputed, and the only question for the jury to determine was the grade or degree of the crime, and as the determination of that question depended upon the mental condition of the defendant, whether intoxicated or not, we are of opinion that the evidence of the defendant’s good character had little relevancy.” We do not think the premises upon which this conclusion was drawn are entirely accurate. We do not understand that the commission of the crime was undisputed by the defendant. It is true the commission of the homicide was conceded, but not the commission of murder in the first degree. That was the crime for which he was on trial, and of which he was convicted. The commission of that offence was disputed below, and also in this court. Nor did the question of the degree depend alone “upon the mental condition of the defendant, whether intoxicated or not.” The jury found that he was not intoxicated to the extent of preventing his forming the wilful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to take the life of the deceased. J ust here is the place where the evidence of good character was entitled to come in, and have its due weight. Here was his supreme peril. The defence of intoxication had failed. If a man’s good character is to avail him at all, when does he need it more than when a jury is deliberating upon the question whether he had formed in his mind the deliberate intent to take a human life ? It might not have availed anything in this case; we are not considering the weight of the evidence upon this point, that was for the jury; but it should have been submitted to them is such manner as to give them a proper understanding as to how they should <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>apply it. We cannot treat this as an immaterial matter which did not prejudice the defendant. It may not have done so, but we caunot say so. The issue of life and death is so vast, both as to this world and the next, that it is our duty to weigh every word carefully, and leave nothing to conjecture.</p>
    <p id="b106-6" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[273,619,1172,552]]]'>As the case must go back for another trial, it is proper to say that we do not discover any error in the remaining assignments. The testimony of Dr. Reese, referred to in the first assignment, was properly rejected. It was not competent to prove the defendant’s intoxication by showing the condition of Belford, who was with him, and had taken the same number of drinks. Some men can drink twice as much as others without showing it. The inquiry would have involved a collateral issue which might have confused, if not misled, the jury. The remaining assignments refer to the charge. With the single exception above noted, we find no error in it.</p>
    <p id="b106-7" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[536,1179,907,86]]]'>Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>
