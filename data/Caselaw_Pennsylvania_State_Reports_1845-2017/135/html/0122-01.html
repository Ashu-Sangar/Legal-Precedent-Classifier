Upon the acre so purchased was a very strong spring of water, known as “Lord's Spring.” The purchase was made subject to a reservation to the grantor of sufficient water from the spring for a certain watering trough. In June, 1888, the defendant laid a pipe connecting the spring with the mains by which it supplied water to the inhabitants of the city of Meadville and vicinity. The testimony for the plaintiff was to the effect that for at least sixty years a stream of water from that spring had been accustomed to flow, in a natural channel, upon and through the tract of land alleged to belong to the plaintiff, and to irrigate four or five acres thereof; that in the months of June, July, August and September, 1888, in consequence of the diversion of the water into the defendant’s pipes, and the resulting loss of the use of the water for purposes of irrigation and watering stock, the plaintiff suffered a loss of more than §40. The plaintiff did not put in evidence any paper title, but several witnesses, among whom was her husband, Richard Lord, testified on her behalf, without objection, that the farm was owned by her and that both she and her husband resided upon it.

The use of the water which flows along land in a natural water-course, a natural flow of water, is appurtenant to the land over which it flows, and the owner of the land has a right to the use of that water for the usual and ordinary purposes of agriculture and domestic life. He has no right to divert the stream to the prejudice of an owner further down the stream, without that owner’s consent. The law holds that the water may be used by the person over whose land it flows, but that it is in a sense a flowing good, as it passes from the land of one person to that of another; and, inasmuch as it is the order of Divine Providence that it move from place to place, and is necessary to existence and the comfortable enjoyment of life, its use shall not be interfered with or obstructed further than is necessary for the ordinary purposes to which the water may be applied by the owner of the land over which it flows. The flowing of this stream from the south side of the state road, over on to the north side, and through this field naturally, for a long time, by consent of the owner of the spring from which the stream flows, gives the owner of the land on the north side the right to a continuous use of the stream for the customary purposes of agriculture; and, if the owner of the spring on the opposite side, or any person claiming under him, divert the stream from its natural channel, leading it off from the land and appropriating it for other purposes than those of agriculture, for which it had been theretofore used, the person so diverting it subjects himself to an action for damages, such as the person injured may have sustained.] 6</p>

In this particular case, so far as appeared at the trial, no bond was tendered to Mrs. Lord, and no effort made to acquire the right she had, or to compensate her, or secure her any damages which might he sustained by reason of the diversion of the stream. The defendant has not complied with the provisions of the act and has acquired no rights to the appropriation of private property for corporate uses under that act. It is a constitutional provision in this state that private property shall not be taken for public use, without compensation ; and, until that compensation has been made, or until provision has been made for securing its payment, as provided by law, no right of acquisition of private property exists.

The rule that when husband and wife are in joint possession of land, the law presumes the property to belong to the husband, applies only in case of a contest between the wife and the husband’s creditors. In this case, the plaintiff showed title to and possession of the land; it was neither alleged nor claimed that any one else owned or was in possession of it, and the husband’s testimony in support of his wife’s claim would estop him from making any claim against the defendant. Moreover, there is no pretence that the defendant took the water by right of eminent domain. As it gave to the plaintiff neither compensation nor security, its act was wrongful and trespass lies: Bethlehem etc. Water Co. v.

    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[298,432,1169,401]]]'>We need not discuss the question presented by the second assignment, for the reason that an examination of the testimony shows conclusively that the jury did not give punitive damages. The verdict, $41, is within the range of the undisputed testimony. The remaining assignments refer to the charge of the court and the answers to points. It is not essential to consider them separately. We can better dispose of them by giving our views generally upon the law of the case.</p>
    <p id="b150-5" data-blocks='[["BL_150.6",150,[301,839,1167,859]]]'>This was an action of trespass, 'brought by Mrs. Lord, a married woman, against the Meadville Water Company, to recover damages for the diversion of a stream of water which, before the injury complained of, flowed over her land. The Mead-ville Water Company, appellant, was incorporated under the act of 1874, and, it was alleged, had the right of eminent domain for the purpose of supplying the city of Meadville with water. In order to'aid in procuring such supply, the company, in the year 1888, purchased an acre of land near said city, on which was a flowing spring of water, and carried the water from said spring to the city by means of pipes. The plaintiff owns land near this spring, over which the water thereof was accustomed to flow prior to its diversion by the company. She claims that it no longer flows there, and that, by reason of its being diverted out of its natural channel, she is deprived of its use for irrigation and other purposes. This suit was brought to recover damages for such injury.</p>
    <p id="b150-6" data-blocks='[["BL_150.7",150,[303,1704,1168,706]],["BL_151.1",151,[201,379,1160,347]]]'>The questions thus presented are not difficult of solution. By the purchase of this acre of land on which the spring is situate, the company acquired the rights of a riparian owner ; neither more, nor less. What its rights as riparian owner are, were sufficiently defined in the recent case, of Haupt’s App., <a href="/pa/125/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="125 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="563971" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0211-01">125 Pa. 211</a>, where it was said: “ If the authority of the plaintiff were measured by its rights as riparian owner, it would be slender enough. It might indeed use the water for the domestic purposes incident to the said ten acres of land. If there was a tenant.thereon, he could use it for watering his stock, and for household purposes; for any useful, necessary, and proper purpose incident to the land itself, and essential to its enjoyment. But that the rights of a riparian owner would justify the plaintiff in carrying the water for miles out of its <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>channel, to supply the borough of Ashland with water, is a proposition so palpably erroneous that it would be a waste of time to discuss it.” So we say here. The purchase of the acre of land, including the sjoring-, gave the company the rights of a riparian owner1. But such rights were not a justification for the diversion of the water from its natural channel to supply the city of Meadville.</p>
    <p id="b151-5" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[191,735,1170,1523]]]'>It was conceded upon the argument that the company had the right to divert it under its power of eminent domain. But it has never exercised such right. To do so involves compensation to those who are or may be injured by such diversion. Compensation was not made, nor security tendered. While a city or borough, or a company having the right of eminent domain, may take a spring or stream of water to supply a municipality, it can only do so by making compensation to those who are deprived of the use of the water, as provided by the constitution. A. taking without compensation is a trespass; as much so as the taking of land by a railroad company to construct its road without making compensation or filing a bond with security, as provided by law. Where the power to take exists, it must be exorcised according to law. If it is not, the corporation so taking becomes a trespasser, and may be proceeded against as such. It is a mistake to assume that the purchase of this acre of land gave the company an absolute right to the spring of water. The water did not pass by the deed beyond its reasonable use by the vendee as a riparian owner. As was said in Haupt’s Appeal, supra : “ There can be no such thing as ownership in flowing water; the riparian owner may use it as it flows; he may dip it up, and become the owner by confining it in barrels or tanks, but, so long as it flows, it is as free to all as the light and the air.” The company might have taken this spring under its right of eminent domain, if it possessed such right; for aught that appears, it may do so still, and, after having done so and made compensation to the riparian owners who are injured thereby, it will be free from suits of this nature. Had it done so in this instance, it would not have had this judgment against it.</p>
