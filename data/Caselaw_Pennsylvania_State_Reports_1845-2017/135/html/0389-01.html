On the other hand, a special act of assembly was offered in evidence by the defendant, by the terms of which the courts are forbidden to grant license to any person to sell liquors in that borough. The second section of that act makes it a misdemeanor for any person to sell liquors in Conneautville, and provides a penalty'l'or persons who so offend. In a case recently decided in the Supreme Court of this commonwealth, it was held that a similar act of assembly was unconstitutional as to the second section of the act, because of the fact that the title to the act did not refer to or include the subject matter of the second section. Persons, therefore, who offend against the law by selling liquor without license, in places where there is a prohibitory law of the same form as that in force in the borough of Conneautville, are liable to indictment under the general laws of the commonwealth, by reason of the fact that there is no definition of a different offence <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>for selling without authority in these places, from that which prevails generally throughout the commonwealth.

The second count charges him with selling without a license, contrary to the act of assembly in such cases made and provided. At the trial, a nolle prosequi was entered by leave of court on the first count, and appellant, having been convicted on the second count, was sentenced, under the fifteenth section of the act of 1887, to pay a fine of $500, and undergo imprisonment for three months.</p>

The only subject expressed in the title of the act referred to is prohibiting the issuing of licenses in the two boroughs named therein, and to that the first section expressly relates; but there is nothing in the title to give notice of such legislation as we find in the second section. It follows, therefore, that, while the first section of the act is constitutional, the second is not. It is unnecessary to discuss the question, because the principle involved was considered and decided in Hatfield v.
