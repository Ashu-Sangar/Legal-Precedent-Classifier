You have a right to consider the probability and the reasonableness of the stories that the different witnesses tell, in endeavoring to arrive at the truth in this matter. [You have already seen that it is of very vital importance whether the defendant was sleeping down-stairs and the young woman sleeping up-stairs, as she and her father testify, or whether she was sleeping down-stairs and was near her bedroom door when ■Tadder came in, as he. says, and Avhether the defendant was getting up in the room where Mrs. Clayton slept.. It is of vital importance. The explanation made by the young lady of why she came down, is that she heard this alarm of burglars and Avanted to get down where the men folks were. The explanation of the defendant, is, if we understand it, that he went up stairs to get his revolver. Now, it is for you to consider in arriving at the truth of this, who is telling the reasonable story. There is a contradiction here between Tadder’s testimony and the theory of the commonwealth, and the defendant’s theory. If persons were breaking into the house supposed to be burglars, would the defendant be likely to go up-stairs and remain there dressing in the manner described, or would he remain down-stairs? Would the young lady, Avho was upstairs as she sajrs, if she thought burglars had broken in down below, be likely to run down there in the dark where the burglars were ? These are for you to consider. It is not for us to say who is telling the truth or testifying falsely. Either Miss Mosier slept up-stairs Avith that woman, or else she and her father and the defendant, it would seem to us, are testifying falsely. It would seem that they ought to knoAV where the different parties slept in the house that night.] 3 It is also in evidence that the trunk of the defendant, and the trunk of the allegedparticeps criminis, were up-stairs in this bedroom; and it is also testified to by some one that he went up there to look for'his revolver, and that Mrs. Clayton said it was in his trunk. <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>All of these circumstances you should recall, and everything that is testified to, and try to get at the truth in this matter.</p>

A defendant has a right to a trial by the jurors called, unless they be stood aside or peremptorily challenged by the commonwealth, or some disqualifying cause be shown against them. To sustain a challenge proper affectum, when the objection is not on account of relationship, it must be shown that the party holds a position in which he might exercise a control over the juror: Cummings v. Gann, <a href="/pa/52/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="52 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="1002237" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0484-01">52 Pa. 484</a>.

As to the refusal to quash the indictment, the fair presumption from the appearance of the name of the defendant’s wife among the names of the witnesses on the back of the indictment, is that she was sworn generally and examined as they were. The grand jury, in the absence of special instruction, would see no difference between her and the others. She was incompetent, except to prove marriage: § 2 (5), act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158.

The reason given by the court for permitting the cross-examination of the defendant respecting occurrences in Ohio, was that he had denied the commission of adultery with Mrs. Clayton “at any place.” The assumption that he had so testified was an error. The scope of the inquiry involved in the prosecution was whether he had committed adultery with her within the county of McKean. Neither the question put to him, nor his answer, had reference to a crime committed at any other place. Both referred only to the place named in the indictment, and they can by no fair interpretation be tortured into a reference to Ohio, or any other place. This was not proper cross-examination, and was not admissible for the purpose stated by the learned judge. The proper method of proving á crime to affect the credit of a witness, is to offer the record of his conviction: Buck v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/107/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="107 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="8858286" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0486-01">107 Pa. 486</a>.

In the parts of the charge embraced in the fourth and fifth assignments, the court improperly argued in favor of the theory of the commonwealth, and cast doubt and discredit upon the testimony of the defendant and his witnesses. Moreover, the statements of the learned judge were erroneous. He assumed that Miss Mosier testified she did not come down stairs until the supposed burglars had broken in. Such an inaccurate statement is ground of reversal: Collins v. Leafey, <a href="/pa/124/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="124 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="563053" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0203-01">124 Pa. 203</a>.

The court commented unfairly on the weight to be given to the testimony of the defendant, his relatives, and his alleged paramour. These persons were all competent witnesses, and their credibility was for the jury, to be gauged by the same tests as that of any other witness. The adverse criticism and references to relationship, etc., were improper. And the request of the juror for information should have been complied with.</p>

He had no right to have this particular juror sworn in the cause. He had a right to be tried by an impartial jury; nothing more.

The question upon cross-examination was asked, not to show a conviction in Ohio of the offence, but to contradict the witness by showing that he had pleaded guilty in that state to a charge of adultery with Mrs. Clayton. This went directly to contradict and discredit the witness, and we think it was competent.
