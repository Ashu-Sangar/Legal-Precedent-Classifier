On March 24,1883, DuBois informed Dorrier by letter that he had placed to the credit of the latter $1,000, as a payment in part on the note. Dorrier’s account on the books of the bank was credited with the amount stated, as of the date stated. On April 12,1883, DuBois again-wrote to Dorrier, stating: “ I place to your credit to-day $1,000, which makes $2,000 on my note.” The books of the bank did not show this credit to defendant.
