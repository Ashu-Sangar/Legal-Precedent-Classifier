Witnesses for the defendant testified that the train was in motion when the plaintiff began to descend the steps, and the brakeman testified that he warned the ladies not to alight and informed them that he would stop the train; that he assisted the plaintiff’s mother and kept her from falling, and that the plaintiff jumped, and in so doing was thrown down and sustained the injuries complained of.</p>

It is the duty of a railroad company engaged in the transportation of passengers, to conduct them safely and to afford them an opportunity to stop at the station to which they have taken passage. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant disregarded the duty it owed her, and if you are satisfied that such is the fact, then the allegation of negligence is sustained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[272,737,1170,1052]]]'>The law does not prescribe how long a train of cars shall be stopped to enable passengers to leave; the length of time must necessarily depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, of which the jury are to judge. What would be negligence under given circumstances might not be under others. Passengers alighting from a train at a station where a large number get on and off, should be given more time than those alighting at a station where only a few passengers get on and off. The rule we lay down for your guidance is, that if the train at the time of the accident to the plaintiff, taking into consideration the number of persons to alight at Columbus station, and the number on the platform to take passage, stopped a sufficient length of time to enable the plaintiff, using reasonable care and reasonable expedition, to leave with safety, then the defendant is not chargeable with carelessness, and the plaintiff should not recover. On the other hand, if, taking all the circumstances into account, such sufficient length of time was not given, then the defendant was guilty of carelessness ; and if the plaintiff, without fault on her part, sustained injury as the consequence of such carelessness, she is entitled to a verdict.</p>

It may be that the defendant was guilty of negligence in consequence of which the plaintiff sustained injury, and yet that other facts existed which, in law, prevent her recovering. It is the law, that although the defendant may have been guilty of negligence resulting in injury to the plaintiff, yet if the plaintiff was also guilty of negligence, which contributed in any degree to the injury sustained, she cannot recover. Such negligence on the part of a plaintiff, the law calls contributory negligence. Contributory negligence consists in the want or omission by the plaintiff, of such a de<a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>groe of care as the circumstances of the case demand from a person of ordinary prudence and having a proper and reasonable regard to personal safety. The care a person must take in leaving a railroad train, must be in proportion to the ordinary risk incurred in such leaving. It was the duty of the plaintiff when the train stopped at Columbus station, to leave her seat with reasonable expedition and go out, using reasonable care in so doing. If she did this, she is not chargeable with contributory negligence. If she did not, and her omission in this respect contributed in any degree to the injuries sustained, she cannot recover.....</p>

The testimony on the part of the plaintiff, as to the distance the plaintiff was thrown from the train, the direction, swiftness and whirling motion of her fall, the striking the depot platform in such a manner and with such violence as to hurt and bruise her on all parts of the body, is sufficient to prove that the accident was caused by the plaintiff leaving the car after it had started, and if believed by the jury the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>

Were we to send the case back for another trial, it is quite possible it would be increased. This, however, would be no reason why we should not reverse the judgment, were there legal reasons why we should do so. A careful examination of the record fails to disclose any. An ingenious argument was made, based upon philosophical reasons, to show that the manner of the plaintiff’s fall was evidence that she must have attempted to leave the car while it was in motion, and that a ball thrown in a particular manner would rebound at a certain angle. This may be so, but a woman is not a ball, and her rebound is an unknown quantity. This theory, moreover, was not sustained by the evidence; and, in the face of positive testimony, theories are not of much value. We find no error in the rulings of the court, and it is not our province to correct the finding of the jury-</p>
