On the afternoon of that day, between 4 and 5 o’clock, one of the defendant’s trains passed over that part of its road near the scene of the plaintiff's operations, and soon afterwards smoke was seen issuing from a stump which stood upon the defendant’s right of way and about twenty feet from the track. The testimony for the plaintiff tended to show that the engine which drew the train was not provided with a proper spark arrester ; that, in consequence of this lack, it threw out sparks of great size and in large quantities, and that the firing of the stump was caused thereby. The stump was an old hemlock stump, quite rotten and punky. There was quite a bed of dead grass around it, though not a great deal immediately beside it. When the smoke was discovered, one of the plaintiffs employees was sent to extinguish the fire, and on his return he reported that he had done so. No smoke was seen after that, until the next <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>morning, about ten o’clock, when the plaintiff sent another employee to look after the fire. Finding the stump burning about the roots, the man threw water upon it until, as he supposed, the fire was extinguished. He remained there, however, for half or three quarters of an hour, to satisfy himself that no fire remained, and went away so believing. About noon the same day a wind arose and a fire broke out in the vicinity of the stump, which the plaintiff and his employees were unable to control on account of the wind and the dryness of the weather, and which burned over the tract on which the plaintiff was operating, destroying his logs and lumber.</p>

The defendant claims that a party is only liable for the fire which he causes, and not for any fires which accidentally result from it. This is the law. And it is an important question in this case for you to determine whether the setting fire to the stump was the proximate, or the remote cause of the burning of the logs. That is, was the burning of the logs the natural and probable consequence of the firing of the stump, in the light of the attending circumstances ?</p>

The burning of each separate blade is not a fire by itself. The whole burning would be considered as one fire, and the cause which started the fire would be the proximate, and not the remote cause of the burning of the whole field. The size of the burning bodies, whether grass or trees, or house, does not affect the principle. It is founded upon the success sion of events. Where one house was burned by the negligence of a railroad company, and the sparks from it were carried by the wind over intervening buildings to a distant house which was burned, it was held that the burning of the second house was the remote, and not the immediate effect of <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>the burning of the first; that the party committing the negligent act could not be supposed to know, or expect that the second house would be burned by his act. But if the buildings burned are so near each other that by burning one you would think it natural and probable that the other should be consumed, the party committing the negligent act would be liable for both. Otherwise, not.</p>

If you find that the railroad company negligently fired the stump, you will consider its situation and surroundings; the season of the year, the condition of the grass; and find whether the burning of the tract and logs was the natural and probable consequence of the firing of the stump, and find whether the fire spread from the stump by the continuous and successive burning of bodies so situated that from the burning of one you would naturally anticipate and expect the burning of the others. If you so find, the defendant can be made responsible for the loss which his negligence inflicted. If, on. the other hand, from the situation of the stump, and its surroundings, it would not be considered natural and probable that the fire would spread from the stump to the land where the logs were skidded, the plaintiff cannot recover, even if by accidental circumstances the fire was cor • muni&amp;afced from the stump to the plaintiff’s logs.

If the plaintiff saw the fire burning in this stump, and it was likely to spread, as the natural and probable consequence of the burning of the stump, and burn over the plaintiff’s land, then it was his duty to put it out. And if he sent a man there to put it out, and did all that a reasonable and prudent man, under the circumstances, would be expected to do in order to put it out, then you could not find tbat the plaintiff was guilty of concurring negligence.

R. Co. v. Kerr, <a href="/pa/62/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="62 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="1017240" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0353-01">62 Pa. 353</a>; Penna. R. Co. v.

It is most elaborately expressed by Chief Justice Agnew in Penna. R. Co. v. Hope, in the following language: “The jury must determine, therefore, whether the facts constitute a continuous succession of events, so linked together that they become a natural whole, or whether the chain of events is so broken that they become independent, and the final result cannot be said to be the natural and probable consequence of the primary cause,—the negligence of the <em>defendants; </em>” and the rule is again put somewhat more tersely by the present Chief Justice in Hoag v. Railroad Co., as follows: “ The injury must be the natural and probable consequence of the negligence; such a <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>consequence as ... . might and ought to have been foreseen by the wrong-doer as likely to flow from his act.”</p>
    <p id="b78-6" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[256,471,1181,1220]]]'>The three leading cases above referred to, though frequently cited on opposite sides of the same argument, are not at all in conflict in principle. The different results which were reached in them depended not on any different view of the law, but of the facts, and on the application of the familiar doctrine that, where a plain inference is to be drawn from undisputed facts, the court will decide it as a matter of law. In Penna. R. Co. v. Kerr, the negligence had been held by the court below to be the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s loss. This court held that it was remote, and did not award a new venire, but said that it would do so if plaintiff should desire it' upon grounds shown. The question was then new; and, from what was said about the venire, the court itself does not seem to have been entirely clear that it should be decided as matter of law. It may be doubted whether, on the same facts, the court would not now send it to a jury. Certainly no subsequent case has assumed to decide where the facts were so near the line. Hoag v. Railroad Co. was a much clearer case, and so were Pittsburgh etc. Ry. Co. v. Taylor, <a href="/pa/104/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="104 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="452206" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0306-01">104 Pa. 306</a>; West Mahanoy Tp. v.

    <p id="b78-7" data-blocks='[["BL_78.5",78,[255,1699,1175,706]],["BL_79.1",79,[185,372,1176,1373]]]'>In the present case, the learned judge left the question of proximate or remote cause to the jury, in substantial conformity with the doctrine of Penna. R. Co. v. Hope. Appellant, however, claims that the succession of events was so broken as to bring the case under Hoag v. Railroad Co., and require the judge to direct the jury in its favor. The break in the chain of events was merely a gap in the time. Had the fire extended from the stump to plaintiff’s lumber without interval, on the same afternoon, this case would have been exactly parallel with Penna. R. Co. v. Hope. But the fact that the fire smouldered awhile in the stump, and, after it was supposed to have been extinguished, broke out again the next day, while it makes the conclusion less obvious that the damage was done by the same fire, does not interpose any new cause, or enable <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>the court to say as matter of law that the causal connection was broken. The sequence from the original fire to the burning of plaintiff’s logs was interrupted by two apparent cessations of the fire, but the jury have found that the cessations were only apparent, leaving intervals of time in the visible progress of the fire, but making no real break at all in the actual connection. In Railroad Co. v. Kerr, page 366, it is said by Thompson, C. J., that the rule “ is not to be controlled by time or distance, but by the succession of events;'’ and in Hoag v. Railroad Co., Trunkey, P. J., in charging the jury, had quoted the foregoing, and added: “ Whether the fire communicated to the plaintiff’s property within a few minutes, ox-after the lapse of hours fronx the negligent act, may be immaterial-” It is said in this case that the agents of plaintiff oxx the ground did not anticipate a further spread of the fire after the interval of time, and therefore it cannot be assumed that the defendant should have anticipated it. But the agents of plaintiff did xxot expect it, because they thought the fire had been put out, not because they did not see the danger of its spreading while it was burning; and this was the danger that appellant was bound to contemplate, to wit, the natural and probable consequence of the original act, not the effect of the supposed extinguishment snbsequexxtly. The pauses in the progress of the fire, therefore, and the lapse of time, while matter for the consideration of the jury in determining the continuity of effect, do not of themselves make such a change as requires the court to say that they break the connection.</p>
    <p id="b79-5" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[188,1755,1166,653]],["BL_80.1",80,[278,371,1176,503]]]'>But it is ai-gued that it was not until the next monxing after the fire started in the stump, and during the time when it was apparently extinguished, that the wind rose, and became a new cause of the spread of the fire to plaintiff’s lumber. This, however, was, like the point already considered, dependent on the cix-cumstances. In Penna. R. Co. v. Hope, one of the facts was a strong wind which carried the fire, and so, also, it was in Penna. etc. R. Co. v. Lacey, <a href="/pa/89/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="89 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="1063246" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0458-01">89 Pa. 458</a>, and in Lehigh <em>V. </em>R. Co. v. McKeen, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20Pa.%20129" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="90 Pa. 129">90 Pa. 129</a>; and in this last case, Tbunkey, J., says the jury “ could also determine whether dry weather and high winds, in the spi-ing time, are extraordinary, and whether, under these conditions, .... the injury was within the probable foresight of him whose negligence ran through <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>from the beginning to the end.” No doubt a hurricane or a gale may be such as to be plainly out of the usual, course of nature, and therefore to be pronounced by the court as the intervention of a new cause. Such a wind would be like the flood in Morrison v. Davis, <a href="/pa/20/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="20 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="972341" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0171-01">20 Pa. 171</a>. But the ordinary danger of wind helping a fire to spread is one of the things to be naturally anticipated. The lapse of time before the wind rose, in this case, was therefore not clearly a new cause to be so pronounced by the court, but a circumstance to be considered, with the others, by the jury.</p>

He was not an insurer. The measure of his duty in this regard was reasonable care and diligence, and whether he used these was fairly and accurately submitted to the jury.
