But if you find as we have stated, that the loss was occasioned by the way in which the coal was taken out by the defendant, or that he has taken out more than he has a right to take, and the plaintiff has been damaged thereby, then it would be your duty to find what the amount of that damage would be, and on that amount he is entitled to interest from the time the injury was occasioned down to the present time.] 4 . . .</p>

The verdict was fully warranted by the evidence, and there appears to be no error in any of the rulings or charge of the court, except in those portions of the latter wherein the learned judge instructed the jury that, if they found the plaintiff’s property was damaged, it would be their duty to ascertain the extent thereof, “ and on that amount she is entitled to interest from the time the injury was occasioned down to the present time.”</p>

Assuming that the jury followed the instructions of the court, the amount of interest included in the verdict is $162.24. That sum should be deducted from the verdict as of the date it was rendered, thus reducing the same to $449.76. With that correction, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>
