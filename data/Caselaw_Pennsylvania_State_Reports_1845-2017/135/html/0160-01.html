Were it prima facie evidence, it has iu this case been overcome. Were it not overcome, the legal qualities of the debt are not stripped from it. As the debt of a married woman, or as barred by the statute of limitations, it could neither be collected by suit, nor set off in a distribution proceeding. Alleged to be a debt in the will, it cannot be regarded as made by it an advancement. But even if it could, it can be shown and has in this case been abundantly shown that the sum, if at all, was advanced to the daughter by advancement to her husband, and that it had been repaid.” .....“ Martin Eichelberger takes an equitable life estate in the legacy to him, the principal of which must be retained by the executor as trustee and invested, and the interest thereof must be annually paid to Martin during his life.

That the testator intended the sums named by him to be charges upon the respective shares of his children, is apparent from the context, which shows clearly that his scheme of equalization was to be wrought out under the terms of items 11 to 17.

The leading thought in that instrument is equality. This is clear from item 10, which declares: “ It is my will that each of my children shall have share and share alike.” To produce this result, he puts a valuation upon the farms and other pieces of real estate which he had devised to his children respectively. Then follows the statement of the amount due his estate by each child. Item 15 of the will declares that “ my daughter Jane, married to John Badabaugh, is indebted to my estate thirty-six hundred dollars;” and item 17, “ Martin Eichelberger is indebted to my estate two hundred and eighty-four dollars and twenty-eight cents.” The indebtedness of the other children need not be stated, as it is not involved in this appeal. The auditor held that neither Jane nor Martin was chargeable in the distribution with the sum mentioned by the testator. This ruling was affirmed by the learned court below upon exceptions.</p>

He does lind. that at one time the testator aided Jane's husband, John Radabaugh, to buy a farm, and in doing so advanced him a considerable amount of money, but that this matter had been settled by a conveyance of the farm from John to the testator. This, however, occurred several years prior to the making of the will, and can have no bearing upon the present controversy.</p>
    <p id="b189-4" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[207,830,1166,1263]]]'>The learned auditor and court below evidently treated the case as if it had been a suit by the estate against the legatees to recover the indebtedness named in the will. The auditor accordingly finds as conclusions of law that (a) the debts mentioned in the will are barred by the statute of limitations; and (5) to establish the debts referred to the declarations of the will are not sufficient; even if prima facie, they could be rebutted by counter evidence. Zimmerman v. Zimmerman, <a href="/pa/47/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="47 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="485503" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0378-01">47 Pa. 378</a>, was cited in support of the latter proposition. It hardly needed authority to show that a mere declaration in a will that A. B. was indebted to the testator would not of itself sustain a suit against A. B., to recover the amount of such alleged debt. The will would not even be competent evidence for such purpose. A debt cannot be created by the mere declarations of a testator. In the case in hand, there was no attempt to enforce payment of these debts against the testator’s children by suit. Hence, there was no room to apply the statute of limitations. For what purpose, then, were they specified in the will ? The appellees contend it was done for the information of the executors, and to enable them to proceed to collect the respective amounts from the children so charged. But the testator does not appear to have left behind him any evidence of such debts upon which his executors could have based a suit at law; and the declaration in the will, as before observed, could not have sustained an action.</p>

Stokes, <a href="/pa/61/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="61 Pa. 136" data-case-ids="428635" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0136-01">61 Pa. 136</a>. I do not understand this principle to be disputed excepting in its application to the facts of the present case. While it was conceded that a testator can convert a debt however deceptive the possible proof of it, however it is barred by time, into a present advancement, and so make it deductible from the portions of his legatees, yet it is argued that this can only be done when his will expresses this purpose cleariy, as in Green v. Howell, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 203" data-case-ids="480234" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0203-01">6 W. &amp; S. 203</a>; Grim’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="105 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="454291" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0375-01">105 Pa. 375</a>. Our attention was also called to the fact that there is no direction in the will that these debts shall be deducted from the shares of the children against whom they are charged. It is true there is no such direction in terms. There is, however, a necessary implication that they shall be deducted; an implication so strong as to leave no reasonable doubt of the testator’s intention, and which, for the purposes of this case, must be regarded as the equivalent of an express direction. When a testator says through his will to his executors, “ You shall divide my estate equally between my children, share and share alike,” and then specifies the amount each has received in his lifetime, what rational conclusion are we to draw but that the amounts so received shall be deducted from their shares? Under such circumstances, the direction to divide equally necessarily involves such deduction.</p>

Even if a mistake had been made, I am unable to see how it could be corrected upon distribution without making a new will for the testator. If the indebtedness of Mrs. Radabaugh was for money received by her husband, the <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>testator had a right to charge it against her in his will. A legatee is bnt a volunteer, at best, and must take the bounty of the testator upon the terms in which it is bestowed. The assignments of error are sustained.</p>

Is this controlled by what immediately follows? We regard the plain intent of the testator to have been that Martin should take the interest only of this fund during his life; that at his death it should go to his children, if he had any, and on default of children, then over to the other children of the testator. He intended to sever the product from the fund producing it, and give only the former to Martin. To carry this object into effect, he directs his executor to invest the fund, and pay over the interest only to Martin during his life. Is there any inflexible rule of law which will defeat the plainly expressed purpose of the testator? Where it is the manifest intent of a testator to sever the product from its source, a bequest of the income of an estate will not carry an absolute estate in the prin<a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>cipal: Bentley v.

The trust is an active one, intended to preserve the contingent remainders: Kay v. Scates, <a href="/pa/37/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="37 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="418902" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0031-01">37 Pa. 31</a>; Sheets’ Est., <a href="/pa/52/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="52 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1002227" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0257-01">52 Pa. 257</a>; Eachus’s App., <a href="/pa/91/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="91 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="488056" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0105-01">91 Pa. 105</a>. Moreover a limitation over on the death of the first taker, or a direction that the interest of money shall be paid annually to him for life, is held to be evidence that he has but a life-interest: Myers’s App., <a href="/pa/49/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="49 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="998443" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0111-01">49 Pa. 111</a>; Sheets’ Estate, supra. There is a line of cases which hold that the rules of construction admit of the use of the words “ heirs of the body ” or “ issue ” in the restricted sense of “ children,” or in the enlarged sense of “ heirs of the body,” in order to carry out the intent of the testator. In such instances, the intent is the key to ascertain the meaning of the words: Guthrie’s App., <a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>; Haldeman v.

Taylor, <a href="/pa/63/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="63 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1019043" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0481-01">63 Pa. 481</a>; Koppenhaffer’s App., <a href="/pa/87/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="87 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1057901" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0196-01">87 Pa. 196</a>. And in Peck’s App., <a href="/pa/78/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="78 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1040350" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0432-01">78 Pa. 432</a>, it was held that “all mere technical rules of construction must give way to the plainly expressed intention of a testator, if that intention is lawful.” In the case in hand the clearly expressed intent of the testator was to give to Martin onty the income of this fund for life, with remainder over, as before stated, and to carry it into effect he created an active trust. We need not speculate as to his object in doing this; he has not stated it, and we have no concern with his motive. It is enough for us to know that such intent was lawful, and, not being in conflict with any law or rule of public policy, must be sustained.</p>
