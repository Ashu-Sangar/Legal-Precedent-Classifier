That the court was in error in treating Carpenter as a mere middle-man or conduit to transmit the title from the husband to the wife, is clear upon the agreed statement of facts. It was not admitted, nor stated as a fact, that Carpenter was such, and on the face of the deed from Whitby to Carpenter an absolute title was conveyed. For aught that appears, Carpenter could have conveyed the property to whomsoever he pleased. In a case stated, as in a special verdict, whatever is not distinctly set forth as admitted, must be taken not to exist: Phila. etc. R. Co. v.

But that deed will not bear the construction placed upon it by the court below, under which Mrs. Whitby would have an estate during widowhood only. The deed is in proper form ; no part of it is missing, nor is any part out of place. The only difficulty it presents is that the habendum is repugnant to the premises. But this habendum is void, because, under it, a freehold estate would be granted to commence in the future, the provision being that she should take as widow of Henry Whitby, which she could not do until after his death. That <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>this was the intention is made plain by the expression used, “in case she survive him.” A freehold cannot be granted in this way, without the creation of a precedent particular estate: 2 Bl. Com., 165,166. The habendum being void, and the grant in the premises being to her and her heirs, she took an estate in fee-simple: Carter v. Madgewiclc, 3 Lev. 339.</p>

The habendum is void for another reason: namely, that it contradicts the premises, by attempting to reduce to a life-estate the fee-simple granted in the premises : 2 Bl.

The court in its struggle to impute an intention to Henry Whitby, whom it erroneously regards as the real grantor of his wife, assumes that at the time the conveyances were executed he had <em>no </em>other property. This assumption is not justified by the case stated, and is contrary to the fact. But what Whitby’s intention was should have been found from his deed to Carpenter.</p>

It is apparent from the record that the two deeds were parts of one and the same transaction, and the manifest intention of the parties was the conveyance of the land from the husband to the wife through Carpenter as a mere conduit of the title.

The construction must be made upon the entire deed, so as if possible to give effect to every part of it: Sheppard’s Touchstone, 83, 84.

It matters not whether her estate was for life or durante viduitate, as the remainder in fee vested in Henry Whitby’s heirs. In contending that the habendum is void because it contradicts the premises, the appellant’s counsel overlook the rule that the intention of the grantor must prevail, and also the rule that the habendum in a deed may enlarge, qualify, expound or vary the estate given by the premises: See Sheppard’s Touchstone, 73, 109; Moss v.

Even if the true construction of the instruments be that a fee-simple estate was granted to Mrs. Whitby, it nevertheless was dependent upon a contingency, and upon the breach of the condition, by her marriage to Huffy, the fee at once reverted to and vested in Harry Whitby as the heir of the grantor, Henry Whitby. By reason of his minority he cannot be prejudiced by a failure to enter for condition broken. We submit that, whether bjr remainder or by reversion, the fee is vested in Harry Whitby.</p>

    <p id="b647-7" data-blocks='[["BL_647.7",647,[220,1586,1167,904]]]'>The learned judge below held that the deed from Henry Whitby to Albert E. Carpenter, and the deed of Carpenter to Kate Whitby, wife of the said Henry Whitby, constituted one transaction, the object and effect of which were to transfer the title of the real estate in question from Mr. Whitby to his wife. In this there was no error. Both deeds were for the consideration of one dollar; they were executed on the same day, and witnessed by the same persons. It is evident that Carpenter was the mere conduit through which the title was to pass. In contemplation of law, the fee never vested for a single moment in him; it passed through him, without stopping. It is almost absurd to suppose that he was to take any interest, however slight, in the property. It was strongly urged, however, that the learned judge below traveled out of the case stated, in order to reach this conclusion. We do not think so. It was the proper, legal construction of the papers, and their construction was for,the court. That, in part, at least, is what courts are for.</p>

      <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>Regarding this, then, as a settlement by Whitby upon his wife, it is almost grotesque to suppose that he intended that after his death his widow should give this estate to a stranger to his blood. This is just what she did. Mr. Whitby married a wife much younger than himself. Shortly after this settlement he died, leaving his widow and one child, the present plaintiff surviving. The widow married again, and, almost before the honey-moon had elapsed, she made her will in which she bequeathed and devised all her estate, real, personal, and mixed, whatsoever and wheresoever, “unto my beloved husband, John J. Duffy, his heirs and assigns, forever,” thus cutting off her only child, the child of her first husband from whom she acquired the estate, without a dollar. In the light of these circumstances, we will consider the terms of the deed from Carpenter to Mrs. Whitby. The habendum is as follows: “ To have and to hold the said tract or piece of land hereby granted unto the said Kate Whitby, her heirs and assigns, to and for the only proper use and behoof of the said Kate Whit-by, her heirs and assigns, for and during her continuing the widow of the said Henry Whitby, in case she survive him, and at her decease, to him,-the said Henry Whitby, his heirs and assigns forever, in fee.”</p>
    <p id="b648-4" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[240,1519,1177,914]],["BL_649.1",649,[234,372,1166,610]]]'>This is clumsily worded, but the intent is clear to give the widow an estate during widowhood, and, after her marriage or death, to his son, Henry Whitby, in fee. The intent is not as clearly expressed as it might be, the fault, possibly, of the conveyancer ; but, regarding this for what it really is, a settlement by a man upon his wife, probably a substitute for a will, and looking at the situation of the grantor, an old man providing for a young wife and leaving one child, an infant, at the time, “ we see a man,” to adopt the language of the learned judge below, “ with a wife and one son, an infant, having no other property or estate, as we can see, than that described in this transaction. He knows that in case of his death'his widow can only receive under the law one third of the rents, issues, and profits of that ;• or the interest of the one third of the valuation money thereof, if sold, which he believes would not be sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and support durante viduitate; and, being desirous of providing amply for her welfare and comfort during widowhood, and securing the <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>premises to his son and heir after her marriage again or her death, he concludes to give her the full control, with the whole income, issues, rents, and profits of said real estate, during her widowhood, reserving to himself, his heirs and assigns, the fee.” It would be a violent presumption, too violent to be entertained for a moment, to suppose that he intended this estate to go to a second husband of his wife, after her death, to the exclusion of his own child. Yet, if the language of the deed requires this construction, the estate must go there, however shocking it may be to our sense of natural justice. Fortunately, we are not driven to this conclusion. There is abundance in the case to justify the ruling of the learned judge below.</p>
