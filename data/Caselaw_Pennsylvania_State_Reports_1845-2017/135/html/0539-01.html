Herbst two certain parcels of land in North Hopewell township. These lands had formerly been in one farm, known as the Adam Secrist farm, but a portion lying between them had been conveyed to another person. At the date given, a deed was delivered by Smeich to Herbst, $20 of the purchase money paid, and two notes given; one for $980, payable April 1,1884, and the other for $2,940, the note in suit. The deed referred to did not embrace in its description the smaller of the two parcels, containing about twenty-three acres of woodland. Objection being made to the deed for this reason, the indorsement of September 14, 1883, was put upon both notes and the deed accepted. On April 4, 1884, the note for $980 was paid, and the indorsement of that date made upon the note in suit. It was also shown that in February, 1884, Herbst had taken possession of both tracts of land, and proceeded to cut and sell timber off the woodland tract, so continuing until May, 1884. He had also sold off a part of the woodland tract.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b560-10" data-blocks='[["BL_560.9",560,[233,2061,1168,339]]]'>. It seems that the plaintiff agreed to sell to the defendant for $3,800, two tracts of land in North Hopewell township, formerly the Adam Secrist farm; one being a tract of farm land, containing about 119 acres, and the other a tract of woodland containing about 23 acres. They formerly formed one tract, as is shown by the evidence of ’Squire Strayer, but a part was sold off which now lies between the farm and the woodland.</p>

      <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>On September 14, 1883, in pursuance of a previous agreement, the parties met at ’Squire Strayer’s office in Winterstown, and Jacob Smeich, the plaintiff, produced a deed which he had had prepared, and it was read. The defendant, Jacob D. Herbst, immediately objected that it did not contain any description of the woodland, while the plaintiff insisted that it did. [In point of fact, as the uncontradicted evidence of ’Squire Thomas G. Cross shows, it did not describe or convey the woodland, and to the tract of woodland the defendant has received no title whatever.] 7</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b561-4" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[218,874,1166,1120]]]'>A large amount of evidence was given to show what took place at ’Squire Strayer’s office, what was said by the parties in regard to the matter of title to the woodland, to the execution of the note, and so on. In the view I have taken of this case, it is immaterial. For, it appears that on April 4, 1884, when the first note became due, the parties to the note, Jacob D. Herbst and Jacob Smeich, met at the house of the latter and put on the back of the note what has been spoken of as the second indorsement, which I will read to you. [The indorsement of April 4, 1884, is this: “April 4, 1884. This note is not to be collected until the title is perfect clear on the farm I sold to Jacob D. Herbst. Jacob Smeich.” This indorsement I regard as decisive of this case. Its construction is exclusively for the court, that is, the construction of the indorsement. The only cases where the construction of a written instrument is for the jury, are those where the meaning or application is made ambiguous by extrinsic evidence, as is said in Watson v. Blaine, 12 S. &amp; R. 136, and Beatty v. Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/52/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="52 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="1002261" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0456-01">52 Pa. 456</a>. In all other cases, even where the writing is ambiguous on its face, the court is bound to construe it and inform the jury of its meaning. There is nothing in the parol evidence in this case to make this indorsement ambiguous.] 8</p>

Herbst, in a lump, for a single consideration of $3,800; and to hold this indorsement to have relation to the tract of farming land alone, would be to make the payment of the note depend on the sufficiency of the conveyance of only a part of the land contracted for.</p>

Its construction was for the court, and we think the learned judge below interpreted it correctly. It was expressly stipulated that “ this note is not to be collected until the title is perfect clear on the farm I sold to Jacob D. Herbst.” There is no ambiguity in this language. So far from the title being clear, there was no title to the twenty-three acres of woodland. The description of the farm as contained in the <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>deed omitted the woodland. The plaintiff contended, however, that the woodland passed as an appurtenant to the farm under the deed as executed. Without discussing the somewhat novel proposition that one tract of land can pass as appurtenant to another tract, there was no room to apply such a principle in this case. The woodland in question was separated from the farm conveyed by an intervening farm. That the one was not appurtenant to the other appears clearly as a matter of fact; hence we need not discuss the legal proposition apparently involved.</p>
    <p id="b564-6" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[261,873,1190,709]]]'>We do not regard it as important that the defendant entered upon the woodland, exercised acts of ownership over it, and sold some of the timber. Nor, that he had sold and conveyed part of the farm away so as to place it beyond his power to rescind. He was not seeking to rescind, nor was he bound to do so. He bought the two tracts for the single consideration of 13,800. He had a right to enter upon both, and treat them as his own. For the one tract, he has no paper title; and it was expressly agreed, and so entered upon the back of the note, that his liability thereon should be suspended until the title was perfected. The thought naturally suggests itself, that it would have been easier and less expensive for the plaintiff to have complied with his agreement, than to have embarked upon this litigation.</p>
