    <p class="summary" id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[284,600,1169,657]]]'>This is a serious charge. The evidence shows that the assignor had for some years been engaged in farming, and that up to about a month prior to the assignment, there was on the farm certain stock and farming implements, of which, to outward appearance, he was the owner. About this time he got into financial difficulties, and, it is claimed, secreted his personal property with intent to defraud Emanuel Kauffman, whom he owed, and J. D. Witters, who on March 31, 1888, issued execution against him. Even if this were true, it would be no evidence of an attempt to defraud the assignee, but as the Witters execution was settled without a sale, the circumstances are evidence to show acts of ownership exercised over these goods by the assignor three weeks before the assignment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b600-6" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[281,1265,1169,503]]]'>It was difficult to obtain answers from the assignor as to some questions, and the one: “ Did you not tell the appraisers <em>. ... . </em>that this property was not yours but your wife’s ? ” he positively refused to answer. Appraisers Pfautz and Badorf, and assignee Murr, all testify that he told them, at the time the appraisement was made, that his'wife owned all the personalty, and that they consequently appraised none of it. David R. Buch testifies that, the day after the assignment, he had a conversation with Mrs. Kreider in her house, and she told him she had nothing. This Mrs. Kreider denies.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b600-7" data-blocks='[["BL_600.6",600,[276,1775,1174,500]]]'>On August 28,1888, David R. Buch issued a fieri facias and the sheriff levied on the personal property on the assigned premises as the property of Joseph Kreider, defendant in the judgment entered to January Term 1885, No. 522. This was the same personal property that was there at the time of the assignment. Mrs. Kreider then made affidavit that she was the owner of certain articles and served the same upon the sheriff. This notice was respected by the plaintiff, and none of the articles named in it were sold. The sheriff sold the balance of his levy on September 5, 1888, and realized $214.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[199,571,1167,863]]]'>As to the second question, it is claimed that the return of the appraisers awarding the assignor $300 from the real estate, is conclusive of his right to receive the same, as no exceptions were filed. This would be true of the confirmation of a widow’s appraisement in the Orphans’ Court: Runyan’s App., <a href="/pa/27/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="27 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="979714" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0121-01">27 Pa. 121</a>. Appraisements of the exemption in assigned estates rest on a different footing. They are simply filed and never confirmed at all. Indeed, it has been decided that the proper place to contest the same, is on distribution before the auditor: Imhoff’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=119%20Pa.%20354" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="119 Pa. 354">119 Pa. 354</a>.

After the assignment, and before the Buch execution, he sold some of this property and received the proceeds. That his wife was the owner is very doubtful.</p>

However, we consulted closely the authorities cited on the argument, and it is proper to say in answer or explanation of the conviction expressed, that the evidence offered and taken by the auditor, and the judicial rulings of our Supreme Court in similar cases, dispelled those convictions, and that the facts so taken and all substantially included in the findings of the learned auditor are not clearly wrong, and therefore this court cannot reverse them or set them aside. “ In the eye of the law, fraud spoils everything it touches,” say Coulter, J., in Mitchell v.

Will not similar protection be accorded against the laches of a creditor, who. seeing the assignor claim the exemption, makes no objection and raises no question in regard to it, until after the assignee, being led to believe that it is acquiesced in, has paid it ? The appraisement filed may not seat the claim on the real estate, and may not be conclusive as between debtor and creditor, but it is at least legal notice to all parties requiring them to make known their objections. In all the cases in which assignees have been surcharged with improper payments on account of exemption, they have had notice, in some way, of the invalidity of the claim.</p>

The object of the exemption laws is to afford some immediate relief to the insolvent debtor; and, as the law exacts diligence in making the claim it will also exact diligence on the part of a creditor who contests it. It was the exceptant’s duty to move to set aside the appraisement: Williamson v.

The ground of this surcharge was the fraud of the assignor. The authorities cited by the court fully sustain the position that if the debtor equivocates and dissembles, denies the ownership of that which he cannot hide, and embarrasses the officers of the law in the execution of their legal duties, he forfeits his right to exemption: See Strouse v. Becker, <a href="/pa/38/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="38 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="994108" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0190-01">38 Pa. 190</a>; Huey’s App., <a href="/pa/29/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="29 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="982923" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0219-01">29 Pa. 219</a>; Gilleland v.

No doubt exists about the law, and we think the facts fully sustain the findings of the learned judge.</p>

It is doubtless true that if the property claimed had consisted of personal estate, and the same had been duly appraised, set apart, and delivered to the assignor without notice of the fraud, the assignee would be protected. But, in this case, the claim for exemption was made out of real estate, a farm which sold for $4,210. It could only be paid out of the proceeds of such sale. The appraisers found it could not be divided. In such case, the action of the appraisers was not in the nature of an absolute and conclusive <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>adjudication that the assignor was or would be entitled to the exemption out of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate when sold, without regard to what he might do in the meantime; in other words, it did not seat his claim either upon the land, or upon the fund realized from the sale thereof: Imhoff's Appeal, supra. The most that can be predicated of tlie action of tbe appraisers, is that it placed tbe assignor in a position to claim the exemption out of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate when it came to be distributed, provided he was otherwise entitled to it. If the assignee has paid the money over, he has done so prematurely, and is in the position of any other assignee or trustee who makes distribution of bis own motion, and without the order or adjudication of the court. In such case, he distributes at his own risk.</p>
