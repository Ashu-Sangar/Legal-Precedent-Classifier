On April 7,1884, Jacob Esbenshade obtained a judgment against Landis for $2,500, which became a lien on each of said properties, being the first lieu on that in Lancaster township. Between April 7 and May 15, 1884, Landis commenced the erection of a dwelling and a stable upon his Millersville property. Afterward, judgments were recovered against him as follows:</p>

Can the fact that the Manor township property was sold by the sheriff some months previous to his sale of the Lancaster township [Millersville] house, and that the auditor is distributing only the fund derived from the latter, render this testimony irrelevant and inadmissible ? The subject of the marshaling of assets properly refers to the adjusting of conflicting claims upon a common fund, but the doctrine of subrogation, nevertheless applies to different funds raised at different times, or even in different counties. The broader lien creditor must either have recourse to the fund charged with his lien alone, or he must allow the restricted lien creditor the use of his lien to obtain satisfaction out of the fund he could not otherwise reach: 2 Trickett on Liens, § 804.

Holders of mechanics’ liens on the house claim that Esbenshade must take this judgment from the Manor township fund and leave the proceeds of the house for them. But Jacob Esbenshade, trustee, is also the holder of another judgment against John S. Landis, for $500 and interest, entered October 1, 1884, the lien of which on the house is subsequent to that of the mechanics’ liens, which is not reached by the proceeds of the farm; and he claims the right to pay his $2,500 judgment, or the'balance due on it, from the house, in order that his $500 <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>judgment may drop down and be paid from tbe other fund.

Taking this view, the auditor decides that Jacob Esbenshade, trustee, must look to the fund derived from the sale of the Manor township property and now in the hands of the sheriff, for the payment of his judgment of $2,500.</p>

The balance of the fund from the Manor township property remaining in the sheriff’s hands, though not before the auditor for distribution, has been considered by him as though it were. It is proper to say that we have received $1,900 out of that fund, but we did so on an understanding with the sheriff that it should be applied in accordance with the final determination of the equities of the parties, and hence the case will be argued as though nothing had been paid. Our judgment entered April 7, 1884, is now the first lien on each fund, but it makes a very material difference out of which one it is paid, for if we do not get at least $594.20 out of the proceeds of the Lancaster township property, our second judgment will be lost.</p>

We claim the right to take payment out of the fund before the auditor, and thus secure the advantage of our first lien in the way least prejudicial to ourselves. This right we clearly have unless other equities, stronger than ours, inter<a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>vene : Ramsey’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20232" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 W. 232">2 W. 232</a>. We were ruled out by tlio auditor and the court, upon the ground that if our first judgment were paid out of this fund the mechanics’ liens could be subrogated upon the Manor fund. We contend that mechanics’ liens are not such liens as are entitled to subrogation. This has been strongly intimated by this court: Knouf’s App., <a href="/pa/91/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="91 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="488862" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0078-01">91 Pa. 78</a>; and no case will be found in which subrogation has been enforced in favor of such liens. On principle, it seems clear that they are not entitled to it. They are purely in rem. They create no personal liability: Anshutz v. Mc-Clelland, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20W.%20487" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="5 W. 487">5 W. 487</a>; Ilolden v.

    <p class="summary" id="b637-5" data-blocks='[["BL_637.4",637,[206,987,1159,707]]]'>3. Judgments or mortgages differ radically from mechanics’ liens. In the former, there is either an adjudication or a confession of personal liability which pledges the debtor’s whole estate and creates an equity against him that prevents the accidental resort of the paramount creditor to the fund doubly charged, from operating to enable the debtor to get back the other fund discharged from both debts. In the case of mechanics’ liens, no personal liability having been fixed on the debtor, the very reason for the doctrine of subrogation is wanting. To enforce it as to them would be to enlarge a purely statutory lien against a particular building and its curtilage, into a general lien of the broadest kind against all the defendant’s lands, wheresoever situated; and this, in the face of the rule that statutory privileges are strictly construed.</p>

In any event, these mechanics’ liens, none of which were on record for months after our second judgment was entered, cannot bo subrogated on the Manor fund as against that judgment. To allow this would be enforcing subrogation in favor of secret liens against liens of record. Mechanics’ claims are an. exception to the settled policy against secret liens, so far as the particular building is concerned; but, to allow them to relate back in a claim for subrogation, which may be enforced against funds in another county, and in some cases even in another state, would produce untold confusion and reverse the whole doctrine of notice. Moreover, the doctrine of subrogation is purely of benevolence, and it will never be enforced when it would work injustice, nor except in favor of the stronger equity: Keety v. Cassidy, <a href="/pa/93/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="93 Pa. 318" data-case-ids="442078" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0318-01">93 Pa. 318</a>; Wagner v. <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>Elliott, <a href="/pa/95/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="95 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="492889" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0487-01">95 Pa. 487</a>. The mechanics’ lien creditors had record notice of our first judgment before work was begun on the Millersville property, but we had no record notice of their liens, and were not bound to know of their contingent claim for subrogation, when we parted with the money on our second judgment on the security of the Manor property.

When the mechanics put their work and materials upon the Millersville property, they could seg of course that it was bound bjr the lien of appellant’s first judgment.
