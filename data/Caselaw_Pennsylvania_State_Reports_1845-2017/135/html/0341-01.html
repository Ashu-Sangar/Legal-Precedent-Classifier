It wa's claimed that the testator meant, not only the children whom he had particularly named, and to whom he immediately thereafter refers as “my said children,” but also the issue of the children of his daughter, Mrs. Holmes, who were then deceased. That he did not so mean is, we think, evident from several considerations.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b363-4" data-blocks='[["BL_363.4",363,[218,725,1160,811]]]'>He particularly names the persons who are to participate in this residue. If he had intended to include all his children and their issue, this would not have been necessary. He could easily have included all by general words; but, having named them, we must infer that he meant only to include those who were so named. He provides for two of the children of Mrs. Holmes by name, giving to each of them a legacy, and does not mention any of the rest of her children or their issue. He must have known whether she had other children, and, if they were deceased, whether they left issue. If he had intended to include all her children or their issue, he would have used the same language as he did with reference to his other deceased daughter, Maria Neff, whose “children and grandchildren ” are particularly designated as participants with his other children in this residue, after the payment of the legacies to Mrs. Holmes’s son George and daughter Mrs. Jamison.</p>

Holmes, by way of remainder under this my will after the death of my sons, James P. and Peter A., .....that the said children shall take and enjoy the same in the same proportions as the sums I have given to and for them respectively after the death of Ann M. Holmes; that is to say, two sevenths to go to and vest in <em>George </em>W. Holmes absolutely, and five sevenths in trust for Mrs. Jamison.” In a previous part of his will he had disposed of this particular fund, in the event of the death of his son, James P., to and among his remaining seven children and the issue of any of his said children who may then be dead, leaving lawful issue; which bequest would have included all of Mrs. Holmes’s children and grandchildren. He now, by this later clause of his <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>will, restricts the- disposition of her share to these two of her children, thus, we think, clearly indicating an intention to exclude the grandchildren. We think, therefore, that the construction placed upon this will by the auditing judge is correct.</p>

N., equally, share and share alike, as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants, and the issue of any of my <em>said, children </em>who may then be dead,” etc. Whom did the words “said children” include? Appellant claims as one of the issue (grandson) of Ann M. Holmes, and his counsel has argued with great ingenuity that, as Ann Holmes was a child of the testator, and is mentioned in the. former part of the sentence, she must be.included among the “said children” whose issue were to inherit. If she had been mentioned generally as a child, or among his other children, or in connection with his enumeration of his intended beneficiaries, the argument would be unanswerable. But the manner and connection in which she is <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>mentioned make such a construction impossible. Her name appears solely as a part of the description of the fund of which he is disposing, and not at all as part of the disposition itself, or among the beneficiaries. The residue of the fund therein-before left in trust for Ann is the subject matter of the devise, and he describes it accordingly as the fund “ given and devised in trust for my said daughter Ann.” But, if it had been described as “ the residue of the fund given and devised to the Safe Deposit Company in trust under the first part of this clause of my will,” it would have expressed the testator’s meaning with equal exactness, without mentioning Ann’s name at all, and, of course, without any possibility of a claim that her issue were included in the subsequent enumeration of the beneficiaries.</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[217,1070,1161,605]]]'>This consideration settles the fact that in naming his daughter Ann the testator was not writing or thinking of her at all as a beneficiary, but of the fund which he identified by reference to her. When he came to the distribution he specifically named the children whom he intended should receive it, and, when he desired to provide for the contingency of the death of any of them, his primary beneficiaries, he added the words, “issue of any of my said children who may then be dead.” In the connection and manner of their use it is entirely clear that the words “said children” referred to those he had named as distributees, and did not include Ann, whose name he used merely as part of the description of the fund to be distributed.</p>
