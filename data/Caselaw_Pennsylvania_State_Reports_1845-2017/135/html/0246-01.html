It is not to be doubted that such indorsement is as effectual to establish payment as a receipt given. If all the payments made upon this contract have been indorsed upon it, the question of the amount unpaid and the space of time in which a default has been suffered in the time of payments, is a simple question of computation and can be <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>readily ascertained from the examination of the contract.

The only evidence required would be the contract, to establish both the default of payment and the space of time for which it had been suffered, and the amount unpaid upon the contract. If a jury would be able to ascertain these facts from an inspection of the contract, I think the prothonotary should be allowed to ascertain the same facts from the same instrument.</p>

Whether judgment should be entered, depended, under the agreement, upon whether the defendant was in default of payment for three months, which could be ascertained only by evidence dehors the record. Again; the amount for which judgment was to be confessed was only so much as remained unpaid, which was uncertain, and required extrinsic evidence to show it. Was this judgment, entered on such an instrument, void? By the common law, a prothonotary could not sign judgment virtute officii; he could only enter judgment rendered by the <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>court. The only ways in which a judgment could be entered without trial were by default; by cognovit actionem, after process ; by a warrant of attorney to confess, which was limited to cases of debt; or, by a confession, propria persona, in the face of the court. After the revolution, prothonotaries were made justices of the Courts of Common Pleas, but all judicial power was taken away from them again by act of April 13, 1791, 8 Sm. L. 31.</p>

By long practice prothonotaries have been permitted to enter amicable actions and confess judgment therein, if by paper filed they are clearly authorized so to do and if they observe all the other rules applicable to such actions, but not to enter judgment in any other way: Cook v. Gilbert, 8 S. &amp; R. 567; McCalmont v. Peters, 13 S. &amp; R. 196; Zorger v. Gonter, 13 S. &amp; R. 58.

Unless he was authorized by statute, the prothonotary could not lawfully enter this judgment in the way he did. The act of February 24, 1806, 4 Sm.

The instrument upon which the prothonotary acts must answer strictly the description contained in the statute. The whole meaning of the act, is that where there is no question as to whether the judgment shall be entered, and no question as to the amount being ascertainable from the face of the instrument, the prothonotary may enter it. In the present case, there were such questions to be determined, and they could be determined only by a court and jury: Connay v. Halstead, <a href="/pa/73/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="73 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1032302" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0354-01">73 Pa. 354</a>. There is a wide difference between conditions im<a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>posed relating to the judgment, and conditions relating to the process: Hope v. Everhart, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20Pa.%20284" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="70 Pa. 284">70 Pa. 284</a>. It is a question whether a prothonotary can enter judgment for a penal sum, conditioned for the performance of a collateral act: see Sewing M. Co. v. Radcliffe, 6 Cent. R. 679; Boas v. Nagle, 3 S. &amp; R. 250. But there is no doubt that he cannot enter judgment when its entry depends upon a condition.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[240,732,1183,916]]]'>4. There is no presumption of a breach of conditions upon which a judgment depends, but such breach, and everything else necessary to support the judgment, must be made to appear : Patterson v. Pyle, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Monag.%20352" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="1 Monag. 352">1 Mona. 352</a>. It cannot be presumed that the prothonotary heard testimony to sustain his judgment: Campbell v. Goddard, 117 111. 251; Scott v. Loughery, 6 W. N. 123 ; Loan Association v. Noris, 1 W. N. 110; Berustine v. Gavaghan, 1 W. N. 506; Koelle v. Engbert, 4 W. N. 202; Rusk v. Clifford, 10 W. N. 238. And if he had power to enter the judgment under the act of 1806, he did not do so in such manner as to make it a legal judgment. He must put on record, as part of the judgment, such facts as will sustain it by showing his right to act. A paper filed, makes no part of the judgment, but upon the entry becomes functus officio. This judgment is void, because the tenor of the conditions under which it was entered were not stated in the record as the statute requires. The court below misinterpreted the decision in Connay v. Halstead, <a href="/pa/73/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="73 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1032302" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0354-01">73 Pa. 354</a>.</p>

It is his duty to record upoh the minutes of the court all judgments rendered by or confessed before the court whose clerk lie is. Tf he is not personally present, the court may direct any competent bystander to make the entries upon the record; for the legal effect of such entries does not depend upon the person by whom they may be copied or recorded, but upon the jurisdiction of the court whose acts they are. It is also the duty of the prothonotary to enter, by himself or his clerks, on the records of the court, any amicable action entered into in writing, and filed in his office, when the court is not in session. He may also note the confession of judgment in such action by the defendant. This he does simply as the clerk and keeper of the records of the court in which the parties agree that their action shall be entered : Cook v. Gilbert, 8 S. &amp; R. 567. He has no authority in the premises, and no duty to discharge except to put faithfully into the records of the court what the parties have agreed shall go there. As an individual, he may be authorized to act for another in the same manner that any other person may be ; and, when so authorized, his powers are derived from the instrument under <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>which he acts, and not from his office. His commission as prothonotary gives him no right to act as attorney in fact or at law for suitors or others, and imposes no duties except such as grow out of his relations to the court as its clerk. To justify him in acting for suitors, an express authority must be shown, coming either from the person to be affected by his acts, or from an act of the general assembly. By the act of February 24, 1806, it was made the duty of the prothonotary of any court of record within the commonwealth, on the application of the holder, to enter judgment on any note, bond, or other instrument of writing in which judgment is confessed by the maker, or which contains a warrant of attorney for an attorney at law or other person to appear and confess judgment thereon. The act directs that the judgment be entered against the person or persons who executed the instrument, and for the amount which, from the face of the instrument, may appear to be due thereon. If the amount due cannot be ascertained from the face of the instrument, the prothonotary cannot enter judgment upon it, for the act of 1806 gives him no power to inquire beyond: Connay v. Halstead, <a href="/pa/73/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="73 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1032302" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0354-01">73 Pa. 354</a>.</p>
    <p id="b274-6" data-blocks='[["BL_274.4",274,[258,1388,1167,806]]]'>The instrument on which the judgment in this case was entered is a contract bearing date the 9th April, 1884, by which the plaintiff sold to the defendant a farm for $4,500. This amount was to be paid in yearly instalments, with interest annually on the whole sum unpaid. The contract contained a confession of judgment in these words: “ The said party of the second part, in case default be made for the space of three months in all or any of the above payments, does hereby confess judgment to the said party of the first part, his heirs or assigns, for the whole amount unpaid on the above agreement.” On the back of the contract were the following indorsements: “April 1, 1885, paid $275; April 1, 1886, paid $520; April 2, 1888, $305.” There was no indorsement for either 1887 or 1889, and neither that for 1886, nor that for 1888, was for the whole amount of the payment then falling due. The judgment was entered on the 1st day of June, 1889.</p>
    <p id="b274-7" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[256,2202,1167,197]],["BL_275.1",275,[183,372,1163,1418]]]'>When this contract was presented to the prothonotary, two questions were suggested for his consideration. The first grew out of the terms of the confession. Had the maker made default in any payment for the space of three months ? The sec<a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>ond arose from the words of the act of 1806. Could the amount due be ascertained from the face of the instrument? If both questions could be answered affirmatively, the judgment could be entered. If either could not be so answered, the prothonotary had no power in the premises. The possession of an instrument in writing for the payment of money affords proof, prima facie, of a right in the holder to recover upon it according to its terms. The holder is not required to prove that it has not been paid. His case is made by the production of the instrument in the first instance, and the burden of showing payment is on him who alleges it. Whether the instrument be a note, a bond, or a contract, like that on which this judgment was entered, the rules of evidence are the same. The instrument makes for the holder a case, prima facie, on which he could recover before a jury, or have a judgment entered by virtue of the power of attorney. Both the default and the amount due wore ascertainable in the first instance from the face of the instrument. If payments liad been made that did not appear on the paper, so that there was in fact no default, the court would on application hear the defendant’s proofs, and strike off the judgment; but, until the prima facies of the instrument is overcome by proof, the judgment must stand. The trouble with the appellant’s case is that the general rule which he invokes is not applicable upon the facts of this case. The instrument was within the act of 1806, and upon its face it was practicable for the prothonotary to determine the existence of a default, and the amount due to the holder. The judgment was rightly entered, and the rule to strike it off was rightly refused.</p>
