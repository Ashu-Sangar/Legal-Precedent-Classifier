    <p class="summary" id="b231-4" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[220,717,1170,701]]]'>From the first and supplemental reports of the auditor it was made to appear that on July 7, 1883, John Dowie covenanted by articles of agreement to convey to Martin McNulty the real estate described in the petition, for the sum of $4,500 payable in instalments, but died on January 24, 1885, intestate, before executing a conveyance. Christina Dowie, the widow of the deceased, and Robert Hawkins, received letters of administration upon his estate. Mrs. Dowie died September 29,1887. Certain payments had been made upon the contract during the lifetime of Mr. Dowie, and other payments were made to the administrators after his death. The contention related solely to the question whether an instalment of $1,500, payable July 15,1884, had been paid to Mr. Dowie in his lifetime.</p>

As evidence tending to establish the payment of the disputed instalment, testimony was offered as to what took place at a meeting between Mrs. Dowie and the petitioner, in the presence of Mr. Harry A. Hall, then representing Mrs. Dowie, as her attorney, and another witness. At that meeting, which was on June 1, 1886, Mrs. Dowie, as found by the auditor, said she was satisfied from the statements of Mr. McNulty that the $1,500 instalment had been paid to Mr. Dowie in his lifetime, but there was no evidence that she had any personal knowledge upon the subject, and the other administrator was not present. Mr. Hall was called, and, under objection on the part of the petitioner that the conversation to be detailed was privileged,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">*</a> testified that on June 1,1886, he had a long talk with Mrs. Dowie about the matter; that she <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>said she did not believe that the petitioner had paid the money, but he was her son-in-law, and rather than have any further trouble about it she would lose the §1,500; that the witness told her she had no power to settle the controversy as the title to the property was in the children,- and the only way for McNulty to get title was to prove the contract and his payments in the Orphans’ Court, and that her settlement would not be binding upon her, upon her co-administrator, or upon the witness as the guardian of the children, but that she said to him she had made up her mind to settle it and have peace in the family.</p>

Hall, attorney, as to conversations and consultations had with Mrs. Dowie, his client, in his lifetime, which were in a professional capacity and of a confidential nature, and to which he was not permitted to testify by statute.”</p>

They were not legitimate evidence and the auditor was right in disregarding them. No error was committed by the auditor in not finding that a settlement had been made between the administratrix and Martin McNulty which was binding upon the estate. This settlement was not based upon any legal evidence, and the administrati’ix was not justified in making such settlement. The auditor cannot be convicted of error in admitting the <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>testimony of Harry A. Hall, Esq., as to conversation had with Mrs. Dowie, his client. McNulty cannot object to the reception of this evidence, even if the testimony was of a confidential character. Hall was not the attorney of McNulty, and it was not in his power to object. It is the privilege of the client to object, and not of a stranger, even if the testimony objected to was a privileged communication.</p>
