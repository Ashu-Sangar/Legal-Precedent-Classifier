But if our position in regard to this is untenable, we submit that even then the bail is not liable in this case. A demurrer to the second indictment was sustained, and judgment was entered for the defendant. When this judgment was entered, no other proceeding was pending against Oblender in the Court of Quarter Sessions, and he was then entitled to his discharge : Commonwealth v.

Blessing entered into as bail for Adam Oblender, in the Quarter Sessions of Lancaster county, was conditioned for the appearance of the said Adam Oblender in the said court on the third Monday of November, and that he “should not depart the said court without leave.” The record shows that at the same term of the court, to wit, on November 20, 1886, the said recognizance was forfeited, and respited to December 6,1886. The record further shows that at each following term, to March Term 1888, the said recognizance was forfeited and respited. On March 19,1888, we find the following entry: “The defendant being called three times in open court, and his bail being called three times in open court, and failing to produce the body of Adam Oblender, the recognizance was absolutely forfeited, and process issued.”</p>

This, however, was not the case. The bail was forfeited on November 20, 1886, and the liability’' of Blessing was then and there fixed. The respite, as it is called, was for the benefit of the bail, and presumably at his request. The legal effect of it was to prevent suit upon the recognizance at the time, and give him until the next term to bring in his principal. Without a respite, or some similar order, suit could have been brought at once upon the recognizance after the forfeiture of November 20th. His liability, as before observed, was then fixed, but with a stay of proceedings. But that liability did not depend upon the subsequent proceedings upon the indictment. Any relief thereafter became a matter of grace, not of right. It follows logically that it was <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>not error to exclude the offer of the record of the subsequent proceedings in the Quarter Sessions against Oblender.
