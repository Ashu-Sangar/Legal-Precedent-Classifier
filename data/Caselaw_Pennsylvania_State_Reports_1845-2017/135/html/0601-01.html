The witness testified, further, that, five or six months before that transaction, he had sold tobacco to Beckman for defendants, and the latter had paid him his commissions on that sale.

[What was there to show Rhoads that he was not employed by the New York man to buy for him ?] 3 Mr. Rhoads had not asked him to sell for him. If he was requested by Rhoads &amp; Co. to sell this tobacco for them, and did what he tells you he did, brought a customer face to face with Mr. Rhoads, to whom Mr; Rhoads sold the tobacco, he would be entitled to commissions.

It certainly is not supported by Smith v.
