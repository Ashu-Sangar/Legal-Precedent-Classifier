We never contended, nor did the auditor hold, that the mere handing of the constable’s execution to the sheriff was per se an abandonment of it. But upon all the testimony in the case as to the declarations and conduct of the constable, we contend that his leaving the goods in the possession of Getz until they were sold by the sheriff, his making no claim to the proceeds and his making no return of the execution to the alderman, all show a practical abandonment. In view of the testimony, there can be no reasonable doubt that he made the levy, not with the bona fide intention of selling, but merely, in his own language, “ to hold the goods.” An execution so levied is fraudulent as to other creditors: Weir v. Hale, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 285" data-case-ids="1854657" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0285-01">3 W. &amp; S. </a><em><a href="/watts-serg/3/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 285" data-case-ids="1854657" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0285-01">285</a>; </em>Freeburger’s App., <a href="/pa/40/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="40 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="478856" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0244-01">40 Pa. 244</a>.

Of all the cases reviewed by Mr. Justice Mitchell, in Hallman v.

In that case the debtor attempted to prefer a junior to a senior lien creditor, and we submit that the principle is applicable in such a case only. The case at bar is quite different from the one referred to ; for, when Getz waived his exemption in our judgment there were no other judgment liens against him, and therefore his waiver could not displace established liens or change the order of distribution. The principle gathered from all the cases, commencing with Bovvyer’s App., <a href="/pa/21/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="21 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="411542" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0210-01">21 Pa. 210</a>, is merely that the defendant cannot, by his own fiat, after the order of liens is fixed, substitute a junior for a senior lien creditor. But the ruling of the court below makes a waiver, on the faith of which the creditor parted with his money, valueless as against other creditors who then had neither lien nor debt: this, in the face of the fact that the waiver is a part of the judgment: Numbers v. Shelly, <a href="/pa/78/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="78 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="1040356" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0426-01">78 Pa. 426</a>.

The first of the rules laid down by Mr. Justice Mitchell may be read without violence to the text, as meaning that a waiver wall enure to the benefit of all prior liens existing at the time of the waiver. So read, it is in harmony with the language of Mr. Justice Thompson in Garrett’s App., <a href="/pa/32/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="32 Pa. 160" data-case-ids="986662" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0160-01">32 Pa. 160</a>, and with the third rule laid down in Hall-man v. Hallman. Again; a debtor’s property to the value of $300 is exempted by § 1, act of April 9, 1849, P. L. 533, not only from sale, but from levy. The constable, therefore, had no right to levy on these goods : Hildebrand v. Bowman, <a href="/pa/100/0580-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="100 Pa. 580" data-case-ids="498424" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0580-01">100 Pa. 580</a>. His levy was void; and hence, the only real levy being that made under the appellant’s writ, the proceeds pass to her: Ehrisman v.

There was nothing in this case to show that the execution of Reuben A. Leinbach was not issued in entire good faith, for the purpose of making the monejn The constable made a levy thereunder, and upon the same day, but a few hours later, a levy was made by the sheriff, upon the same property, upon another execution. Thereupon the constable handed over his levy to the sheriff, at the same time claiming his rights as an officer to the goods, and allowed the sheriff to <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>sell. The sheriff returned his writ subject to the constable’s levy; and the proceeds of the sale, $285.74, were distributed by the court below to the plaintiff in the execution in the hands of the constable. We see no error in this. It is true the auditor found that the constable abandoned his levy. This, however, is a mere deduction from evidence which does not justify it, and the court was clearly right in not regarding it. It was contended, however, that the money should have been awarded to the Miller judgment, because it contained a waiver of exemption, while none is found in the Leinbach judgment. This position cannot be sustained. It is settled that a waiver as to any lien will inure to the benefit of all prior liens, on the principle that a debtor cannot alter the precedence settled by law: Hallman v. Hallman, <a href="/pa/124/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="124 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="563051" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0347-01">124 Pa. 347</a>.</p>
