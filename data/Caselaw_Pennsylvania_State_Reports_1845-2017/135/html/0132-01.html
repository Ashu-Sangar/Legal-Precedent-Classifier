On December 6, 1887, one car load of rollers reached the defendant, and on December 16th the second car load arrived. The rollers were found to be defective in certain parts, and the plaintiff was so notified. The plaintiff company then agreed to replace the defective parts, and, as it was about to go out of business, arranged, with the consent of the defendant, to have the parts made by one J. B. Adams, at Cheboygan, Mich., and shipped by him to the defendant. To carry out this arrangement the plaintiff made a contract in writing with Adams, dated January 11,1888, by which Adams was to make and ship the parts required. This contract was offered in evidence by the plaintiff, and admitted under objection by the defendant; exception.1</p>

On February 3, 1888, the defendant, not having received the parts, and having purchased them elsewhere, wrote and telegraphed to both the plaintiff and to Adams rescinding the order. The defendant, for the purpose of showing tha»t the plaintiff had not used clue diligence in obtaining the parts, offered in evidence a letter from Adams to the defendant dated February 7, 1888. This letter was as follows, the Mr. Frost named therein being the president of the plaintiff company: “ Gentlemen: 1 have just returned from a trip east, during which I had in tended to call upon you, but I found my time limited, as I was needed at home. I found your telegram and letter upon my arrival and have stopped getting out your order until I shal hear from Mr. Frost.
