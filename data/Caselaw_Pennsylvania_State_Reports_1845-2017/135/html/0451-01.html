But the legal maxim, sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, is the principle to be applied to the facts in this case. “ A man must enjoy his own property in such a manner as not to invade the legal rights of his neighbor.” “ Every man is restricted against using his property to the prejudice of others.” “ And this rule <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>of law applies to the public, in at least as full force as to individuals:” Broom’s Leg.

It was held in that case that a municipal corporation owning and using property for public purposes is subject to the rule, sic utere tuo ut alienum non leadas; that the city is liable for damages to a well for the erection of a gas reservoir. Sharswood, J., in that ease said: “ It does not follow that because a municipal corporation has the right to become the owner of an adjoining lot for some public purpose, they have a right to erect a nuisance on it. If they build a lock-up or a station-house, they cannot dig a privy, however skilfully they may do it and however convenient it may be, if the result is that the filth of it is discharged on their neighbors.” It is true that that is but a dictum of the learned justice who delivered the opinion, but the referee accepts that as being sound law. In a number of cases, it has been decided that a municipal corporation is not liable for the misfeasance of its police officers, because the police power of the city is derived from the state; but Mr. Justice Sharswood declared that a police station owned by the city could not have a privy in it whose filth is discharged on the neighbors’ premises, without being answerable in damages for the injury thus done.</p>

One reason in that case for holding that the defendant was not liable, was that the entire resources of the school district can be used only for the erection of buildings, or the conduct of the school itself; and, as these districts can have no fund out of which to pay damages, such as are claimed by the plaintiff in this case, their recovery would be to no purpose. But this suit is brought against a municipal corporation which has other property and funds than that which is contributed for a special charitable purpose.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.6",476,[228,1856,1174,593]]]'>2. This case is not ruled by Ford v. School Dist., <a href="/pa/121/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="121 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="561227" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0543-01">121 Pa. 543</a>. A school district is not a municipal corporation, and there is quite a difference between the two things: Wharton v. School Directors, <a href="/pa/42/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="42 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="481505" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0358-01">42 Pa. 358</a>; §§ 20, 28, act of May 8, 1854, P. L. 623. It is not a school district that is sued here, but a municipal corporation, the owner in fee of the land upon which the privy well was built and negligently maintained. The city makes the requisite appropriations from the general taxation for maintaining its own schools upon its own property, and this suit is not, like Ford v. School District, supra, brought against “ a quasi corporation whose entire resources are appropriated toward the maintenance of a school.”</p>

The city is therefore liable in this action for two reasons: (1) because it receives a consideration for the performance of the duty it owes as owner of the property: Dillon on Mun. Corp., § 985; Eastman v. Meredith, <a href="/nh/36/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="36 N.H. 284" data-case-ids="6099394" data-case-paths="/nh/36/0284-01">36 N.

Roberts, <a href="/pa/108/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="108 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="539255" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0489-01">108 Pa. 489</a>; Knauss v.

It is admitted that property may be taken by eminent domain for school purposes, but this cannot be done without just compensation, and there is no law permitting the city of Philadelphia to build a house on its own premises and then use a neighboring property as a cess pool, without paying just damages for the injuries inflicted. It is for such injuries that damages were recovered in this case.</p>

School Dist., <a href="/pa/121/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="121 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="561227" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0543-01">121 Pa. 543</a>. The distinction, however, is plain. That case was an action for the negligence of the <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>janitor of a school building, and was decided on the ground that, under the Pennsylvania statutes, school districts are agencies of the commonwealth for a special and limited purpose, with no funds under their control but public moneys devoted to a specific charity, and not divertible, even indirectly, to any other use. This purpose might be entirely destroyed by holding the funds liable for the consequences of torts by the officers or servants of the school district, and therefore such liability cannot be sustained. It had been held as early as Wharton v. School Dir., <a href="/pa/42/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="42 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="481505" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0358-01">42 Pa. 358</a>, that school districts are not municipalities, but mere territorial divisions for limited purposes, and belonging to the class of quasi corporations, which exercise some of the functions of a municipality within a prescribed sphere. To the same effect are Commonwealth v. Beamish, <a href="/pa/81/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="81 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1044159" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0389-01">81 Pa. 389</a>; Colvin v.

And this is the well-settled general doctrine. “It is essential.....to bear in mind the distinction .....between municipal corporations proper.....and . . ......quasi corporations, such as townships, school districts.' .... The decisions.....hold the former class of corporations to a much more extended liability than the latter, even where the latter are invested with corporate capacity and with the power of taxation: ” 2 Dillon Mun.

The city, having a general power of taxation, and exercising full municipal functions, comes under the larger measure of liability spoken of by Judge Dillon. Just how far this liar bility extends has not been definitely decided, as is said by our Brother Clark, in Boyd v. Insurance Patrol, <a href="/pa/113/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="113 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="457583" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0269-01">113 Pa. 269</a>, 279, where he reviews the cases with special reference to the liabilities of charitable or other corporations exercising a quasi municipal function. Nor is the distinction between the cases where municipal corporations have been held liable and where they have not, entirely logical or obvious, as was observed by Chief Justice Gordon in Ford v. School Dist., <a href="/pa/121/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="121 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="561227" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0543-01">121 Pa. 543</a>, 549. But, in the class of cases to which the present belongs, injuries arising from the misuse of land, there has never been <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>any substantial hesitation in holding cities liable. The ownership of property entails certain burdens, one of which is the obligation of care that it shall not injure others in their property or persons, by unlawful use or neglect. This obligation rests, without regard to personal disabilities, on all owners alike, infants, femes covert, and others, by virtue of their ownership, and municipal corporations are not exempt. The general rule is thus stated: “ Municipal corporations are liable for the improper management and use of tlieir property, to tbe same extent and in the same manner as private corporations and natural persons. Unless acting under valid special legislative authority, they must, like individuals, use their own so as not to injure that which belongs to another:” 2 Dillon Mun. Corp., 3d ed., § 985. The particular question here involved does not seem to have been before this court, but it was expressly decided in Shuter v. Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Phila.%20228" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="3 Phila. 228">3 Phila. 228</a>, by Judge Sharswood, when president of the District Court: “ The municipal corporation owning and occupying property for public purposes is as much subject as a private citizen to the usual rule, sic utere tuo nt alienum non lsedas. The city is as much bound as an individual owner of a lot, to find an outlet for the water on it, without encroaching on his neighbor.” We adopt this as a correct exposition of the law.</p>
    <p id="b479-5" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[957,1556,357,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
