The copy of his book entries does not charge the defendant nor any one else, and therefore it does not call for an affidavit of defence. The omission is fatal and cannot be supplied by averments in the statement of claim, the test being whether or not the book entries would be competent to go to the jury as evidence of the plaintiff’s claim : Wall v. Dovey, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20Pa.%20213" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="60 Pa. 213">60 Pa. 213</a>. This rule is not altered by the Procedure Act of May 25,1887, P. L. 271.

Without the copy of the instrument, which is the foundation of the action, the case is not brought within the affidavit of defence law; and, therefore, the copy filed must be such as to entitle the plaintiff to judgment. Again; the action was clearly barred by the statute of limitations. There is no averment of any special contract or time credit which would change the maturity of the claim from the date of the last item, May 24, 1883, nor are the terms of any such contract set out, and the suit was not brought until June 11,1889. In view of these facts, and in view of the defendant’s denials that he had any dealings with the plaintiff after May, 1883, that he agreed to pay the claim on June 15, 1883, or that he is indebted to the plaintiff in any amount, the judgment was erroneous.</p>

      <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>1. The statement of claim contains distinct averments of the amount due and of the dates, as required by the statute, and also a copy of the book entries. The essential feature of the statement, that the original indebtedness did not mature until June 15,1889, is nowhere met by the defendant’s affidavits. A denial that the defendant agreed to pay $205 with interest, does not meet an allegation that he agreed to pay $205 without interest. Had the defendant questioned the sufficiency of the statement of claim in the lower court, his objection, if deemed of importance, could have been met by an amended statement, requiring a new affidavit: Jones v. Gordon, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20Pa.%20268" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="124 Pa. 268">124 Pa. 268</a>.

    <p class="summary" id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[262,1047,1175,749]]]'>2. The general denial of indebtedness in the supplemental affidavit is too indefinite to prevent judgment: Peck v. Jones, <a href="/pa/70/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="70 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1028228" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0083-01">70 Pa. 83</a>. Cases decided under the old affidavit of defence law are not applicable here, because that law has been superseded by the act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 271: Marlin v. Waters, <a href="/pa/127/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="127 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="565712" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0177-01">127 Pa. 177</a>. Under the act of 1887, if the averments of the statement of claim are sufficient, and are not denied by the affidavit of defence, the latter is insufficient: Gould v. Gage, <a href="/pa/118/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="118 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="556759" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0559-01">118 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/118/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="118 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="556759" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0559-01">559</a>; </em>Byrne v.

In the light of these decisions, it matters not whether the book entries would have been within the old law. The statement avers the amount justly due from the defendant, his promise to pay it, and the date at which it became payable. Denying neither of these averments, the defendant’s affidavits are insufficient.</p>

This distinctly set up the bar of the statute of limitations, and was a good defence against summary judgment.</p>
    <p id="b298-7" data-blocks='[["BL_298.8",298,[261,2223,1173,196]],["BL_299.1",299,[213,358,1166,1220]]]'>But the statement itself is too defective to sustain the judgment. In the first place, it sets out that the “ action is founded on a book account or entry, a copy of which.....accompanies this statement,” etc. But the copy does not charge the <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>defendant, nor does the statement say that the original does so. It “avers that the charges there made were <em>intended, as a personal charge </em>against said defendant,” etc. It is quite consistent with such intention that the entries were in fact charged in the book against some other person, for whom defendant was claimed to be responsible, or, as in cases of mechanics’ claims, against a specific lot or building, without naming the defendant at all. That something of this kind is meant in the present ease appears probable from the statement that the entries were intended as a personal charge, “ by virtue of a special agreement.” If the entries are in fact against defendant by name, they are a personal charge, without resort to a special agreement. On the other hand, if the entries in the book do really name the defendant, then the copy filed is incomplete, and does not come up to the requirement of the statute. It is true, that the affidavit of defence must now be made to the statement, to which the copy of book entries is only an appendix or exhibit which may be helped out by averments ; so that the failure to name the defendant therein is no longer a fatal defect, as it was under the former affidavit of defence law, as held in Wall v. Dovey, <a href="/pa/60/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="60 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="1014493" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0212-01">60 Pa. 212</a>. But the copy is a necessary appendix to the statement by the express terms of the act of May 25,188T; and this means a correct and complete copy, as should be made to appear either on its face or by categorical averment.</p>
    <p id="b299-5" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[213,1586,1166,808]],["BL_300.1",300,[262,357,1173,1002]]]'>But there is another equally serious defect in the statement. The action is averred to be founded on the book entries, and they were more than six years old when the writ issued. The plaintiff endeavors to avoid this apparent bar of the statute of limitations by the brief averment that the amount so charged “ became due and payable ” at a subsequent date. But how or why it did not become due till then is not explained. If the book entries are the only foundation of the action, then they are manifestly insufficient to keep the claim alive more than six years from the date of the last item. If, however, a special agreement is relied upon, it should be set out. Suppose the position of parties to be reversed. Suppose plaintiff had brought this action on May 25, 1888, and defendant had filed an affidavit of defence that the money was not due until June 15th; it is clear on all the authorities that the affidavit would have been held bad for not setting out the reason, and, if it <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>depended on special contract, the terms of such contract. The completeness as to essential facts which has always been required in an affidavit of defence is now equally required in the statement of claim. The act of 1887 provides that the plaintiff shall make a concise statement of his demand, accompanied, in actions of assumpsit, by copies of all notes, contracts, etc., upon which the claim is founded. The spirit of this act plainly requires that every contract or agreement upon which the claim in any manner depends, even if in parol, shall be averred in the statement. The act is unwise, and is founded on the erroneous and superficial view that, by abolishing technical forms, it can get rid of distinctions inherent in the nature of the subject, but it would be doing injustice to the purpose of its framers to hold that it was meant to sanction mere looseness of pleading. Accuracy and technical precision have no terrors except for the careless and the incompetent, and the act of 1887 was not intended to do away with them. As to all matters of substance, completeness, accuracy and precision are as necessary now to a statement as they were before to a declaration in the settled and time-honored forms.</p>

But, even if in fact they were not, it would make no difference, because a judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence is, in effect, a judgment on demurrer, and,- like all such judgments, must be self-sustaining on the face of the record.</p>
