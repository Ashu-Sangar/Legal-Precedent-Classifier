For it is well settled that the writ of injunction is a remedy wholly preventive and prohibitory when issued, and when issued that only could have been its purpose and effect. But upon the argument [we are confronted with the fact that the acts are already done, and we are asked by our order to compel in this preliminary hearing a restoration of the situation existing prior to the service of the writ; ] 3 in short, by means of this preliminary injunction, which was intended to be preventive, to accomplish and compel what can only be done by a mandatory order.</p>

In the case of Farmers’ Railroad Co. v. Reno etc. Ry.

In this case the whole doctrine is fully discussed, and the learned judge, Sharswood, says: “ All injunctions are generally processes of mere restraint; yet a final injunction may certainly go beyond this and command acts to be done or undone. They are then termed mandatory. They are often necessary to do complete justice; but the authorities, both in England and in this country, are very clear that an interlocutory or preliminary injunction cannot be mandatory.” Justice SHARSWOOD condemns in forcible and terse language a tribunal that seeks to accomplish, by an indirect order, what it has no right or lawful power to do by a direct decree.</p>

That can only be done upon hearing had, and the testimony and evidence fully produced in the methods recognized by equity practice.] 3 But it is equally clear that an injunction will not issue where the party seeking it has a statutory remedy. [He cannot be said to have no adequate remedy at law when by express statute he is given a remedy by which he may pass over the lands of the defendants to remove his coal.] 4 If this be true, then the only question left would be, is the damage irreparable ? It is not irreparable when it can be compensated in money damages.

The plaintiff replaced it, and it was again torn up. This occurred for the third time ; the last being on February 8th, while the plaintiff was obtaining a preliminary injunction to restrain the defendants. The writ was. served just as they had finished the work of demolition, and <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>this coincidence is strongly suggestive of a race against the law. When the cause came on to be heard upon the motion to continue the injunction, the learned court dissolved it, in part for the reason that the act sought to be restrained had already been done, and that it had no power at this stage of the cause to issue a mandatory injunction, and restore the property to its former condition.</p>
    <p id="b129-5" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[199,730,1165,236]]]'>In the recent case of Easton etc. Pass. Ry. Co. v. Easton, <a href="/pa/133/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="133 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="812935" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0505-01">133 Pa. 505</a>, we had occasion to express our views in regard to the propriety of settling legal disputes by the strong hand. I quote a few words from the opinion in that case as applicable here:</p>
    <p id="b129-6" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[198,986,1168,644]]]'>“ There is a growing disposition in this commonwealth, especially on the part of corporations, private as well as municipal, to take the law into their own hands, and settle controversies by force, instead of appealing to the courts to redress their wrongs and enforce their rights, in an orderly and peaceable manner. Instances are not rare, and are of recent occurrence, where bands of men have stood confronting each other, some of them with arms in their hands, in the assertion of supposed rights. The public peace has been threatened in this manner, sometimes resulting in loss of life. It is well that it should be known that such persons, whether representing individuals, private corporations, or municipalities, are simply rioters, and answerable to the criminal law for their conduct.”</p>
    <p id="b129-7" data-blocks='[["BL_129.6",129,[198,1649,1168,797]]]'>In that case the authorities of the city of Easton tore up the tracks of a street-car company because the latter had put down a kind of rail of which the city councils did not approve. They did not invoke the aid of the courts in enforcing their supposed rights, but asserted them with the strong hand. What the city did in that case, the defendants did in this; they decided in their own favor all the questions of law and fact arising under the lease, and enforced their decision by tearing up the tramway, not only once but thrice, the last destruction being so well timed as to escape by a few minutes the injunction issued bj^ the court. If such matters are to be settled in this way; if we sanction the doctrine that might makes right, there will be little use for the civil courts, while the criminal side of the courts will have a large accession of business, in the matter of riots, assaults, and homicides growing out of such transac tions.</p>
    <p id="b130-4" data-blocks='[["BL_130.3",130,[281,367,1173,403]]]'>
      <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>What we did in the Easton case we will do here. We will restore the injunction, without passing upon the merits of the case. ■ They will be considered when it comes here upon final hearing. As far as it is possible upon a preliminary injunction, we will restore the status quo as it existed prior to the acts of the defendants. While the injunction will not require the defendants to relay the tramway, it will enable the plaintiff to do so, and will protect him in its use pending this litigation.</p>
    <p id="b130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[543,775,912,138]]]'>The decree is reversed at the costs of the appellees, and the preliminary injunction is reinstated.</p>
