Billings, the defendant, and one brother and one sister of the whole blood, to wit, Charles F. Billings and Abby B. McNeil, the plaintiffs, and one brother and three sisters of the half blood; that on October 27,1879, Sarah M. Billings, the defendant, became the administratrix of said deceased, and was still acting as such; that in the partition of the real estate of the deceased, finally confirmed in the Orphans’ Court in March, 1881, about 19,000 acres of the decedent’s lands were allotted to said Sarah M. Billings during her natural life as of her dower interest; that all these dower lands were unseated and unproductive to the widow, except about 460 acres, which were improved and upon which were the houses, barns and other out-buildings, and one lot upon which was a large and ex<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>tensive saw-mill; that taxes for the years 1880 and 1881, for county, road, school, poor, and other purposes, aggregating $1,100.03 were assessed against the several tracts of unseated and unproductive land thus set apart to Sarah M. Billings; that these taxes being unpaid, the lands against which they were assessed were advertised for sale by the county treasurer in June, 1883; that to prevent such sale, the plaintiffs, who were the remainder-men, paid the taxes and costs and charged the same against the defendant, the tenant for life; that in 1882 and 1883, taxes of the same character were assessed against the same lands, aggregating $1,292.29; that, these taxes remaining unpaid, in the spring of 1884 the lands were again advertised for sale by the county treasurer; that in June, 1884, the plaintiffs caused notice in writing to be served on the defendant,-giving a specific statement of the taxes and of the lands against which they were assessed, the date and place fixed for the advertised sale, and requesting her to pay said taxes, or the plaintiffs would consider themselves compelled to pay them, in which event they would charge the amount thereof to her; that said notice was disregarded, and, when the day of sale came on, the plaintiffs paid the said taxes and costs, and charged the same to the defendant. It further appeared, in evidence admitted under objection and exception, that the defendant was in receipt of over one thousand dollars income from a portion of the lands assigned to her; that she had also received certain large sums upon timber or bark contracts, called the Lee, Colton and Wolf contracts, which had been made by her deceased husband in his lifetime and related to certain of the lands allotted to her; that on December 6, 1884, in a settlement in writing of matters then in dispute between the plaintiffs and defendant, relating chiefly to the Colton and Lee contracts, the following provision was inserted:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b221-7" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[220,927,1164,1216]]]'>There is no dispute here, under the evidence, that the lands upon which the taxes were assessed were in fact set apart to this defendant as part of her dower as widow of Silas X. Billings, or that they were separate, distinct and several tracts of land set apart to her and described as declared upon in the case, by the number of the warrants, quantity and location in the townships, etc., as is usual in cases of assessments on unseated lands. [In addition to these particular lands described in this declaration, it appears from the evidence that other lands which were not altogether unseated or unproductive lands were assigned to her, also, as a part of her dower. Evidence has been given in the case, the effect of which, however, in law, was reserved by the court, upon the fact or question as to whether the defendant Mrs. Billings received an income from the other lands mentioned in this connection; that is, those that were to some extent productive. The view we take of the case, gentlemen, if we had declared it at the time this evidence was offered, would have resulted in the rejection of that testimony, because that view forced us necessarily to the conclusion that the receipt of such income from other lands than those in question upon which these taxes were assessed, does not charge the defendant with the duty of paying, from such sources of her income, taxes charged upon the identical lands in question in this controversy.] 11</p>

But that is not the question as we view it in this case. The plaintiffs in this case charge this defendant with the payment of taxes upon lands, as we have stated, wholly unseated and unproductive, from which, under the evidence in the case, it appears that the defendant has not been in receipt of any income whatever, in her right as widow entitled to dower in the estate of S. X. Billings, deceased. We qualify that remark, because there has been evidence introduced here that she has been in receipt of a very large amount of money from other sources than such as we regard properly appurtenant to the interest that the widow has in real estate, by right of dower, in the lands of her deceased husband. It has been shown here—and this evidence was submitted in the same way, pro forma, and the effect of it to be determined later in the proceedings in the case,—it has been shown that a large amount was received by the defendant on account of what is known as the Colton contract that has been in dispute in this court heretofore. She received also a large amount of money from another contract which has been spoken of as the Wolf contract, and a considerable sum from another, which is spoken of as the' Lee contract, all of these contracts having been made by her deceased husband, S. X. Billings, in his lifetime. But as to the moneys received in those respective ways by this defendant, we think ’ there is no question involved in this case. Her rights with respect to those contracts are entirely different from those that appertain to her estate in dower. They arose from contracts made by her husband, and the effect of a recovery in respect to them has been to bring the proceeds of those contracts into the settlement of the estate of her deceased husband upon which she was administratrix, so that really, as we view the case, we have nothing to do with that income to this defendant. ’ i</p>
    <p class="summary" id="Aue" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[268,2308,1164,94]],["BL_223.1",223,[213,377,1169,1369]]]'>We do not think it charges her with any responsibility for the payment of taxes upon the lands referred to in the declara<a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>tion in this case. If we could take the view which has been maintained in the argument, to some extent, by counsel for the plaintiffs, that the widow of a decedent in Pennsylvania is bound to keep clear from such encumbrances all the lands that may be assigned to her, without regard to the character of the lands, then we should take a different view of that question. But the lands in question here were distinct, several tracts of land, not apportioned to her productive estate in dower, as we have already stated, so far as the evidence appears. Prom them she has had no inconje whatever; in reference to them she has exercised no privileges whatever, not even such a privilege as a tenant in dower may exercise in reference to such lands; as cutting wood or timber, for purposes of the estate itself. It would not be claimed that this defendant has ever had the right to enter upon these lands, to cut any of the timber for any other purpose. If she had done that, she would be guilty of waste, and responsible under the law for committing waste ; responsible to those entitled to the remainder of the estate after her dower, the heirs of Silas X. Billings, who are shown to be the plaintiffs in this case. [We think in this case the question to be determined is, whether from the mere circumstance of the assignment of unproductive lands as dower to a widow, she is to be charged with the payment of all taxes upon those lands without regard to the quality of them, or whether they are productive to her in her right of dower or not. Wo say she is not, under the circumstances as we find them in this case.] 18</p>

But we are to view the case as we find it here under the evidence. And we think the law in Pennsylvania, in respect to lands of this character, is that the taxes charged upon them, are not a personal charge against the person assessed with them, in the same sense as taxes assessed against a person occupying seated lands; that is, lands that are productive, occupied and used for the purpose, for instance, of farming or any other productive or profitable business. So the ease is different from what it would be if this defendant were charged with these taxes accumulated upon an estate from which she had received rents, issues and profits, as <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>tenant in dower, or upon the lands in question, appurtenant to such an estate. In such a case as that, taxes upon lands appurtenant to her homestead would properly be chargeable to a doweress. [We find no authority in Pennsylvania saying that a person assessed with taxes upon unseated lands is personally charged with the same, and under obligations to pay them. If the person assessed with the taxes says, “ I will allow these lands to go to sale,” all that can be done is to sell the land for taxes. And, we say to you, the defendant in this case had the right to decline to pay the taxes upon these unseated lands; and it does not follow, at all, that the plaintiffs in this case, having, as it is alleged in the declaration, paid them under duress or compulsion, which in some cases would give a right of action to recover, have a right to recover taxes against this defendant.] 13.....</p>

The interest of the widow, which, we generally speak of as dower, undoubtedly begins at the time of the death of her husband, but it is not a sole interest, in a case like this, where the rights of the heirs of the husband are in question.
