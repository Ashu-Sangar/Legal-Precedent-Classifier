L. 274, entitled “An Act constituting each city of the third class a single school district,” etc.; that said resolutions were duly recorded on the minutes of the said several boards, and that a certified copy thereof was tendered in due time, with the proper fees and charges, to William P. James, clerk of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Luzerne county, to be filed and recorded in the office of the said court, in compliance with the provisions of § 9 of said act, and that the said William P. James had refused and still refused to file and record said resolutions; praying that a writ of mandamus might issue commanding the respondent to file and record the said resolutions according to law. The respondent filed an answer, on the same day, averring, in substance, that he was not in duty bound to file or record the said resolutions because the said act of May 23, 1889, was unconstitutional, and, if constitutional, was inoperative to affect the school districts of the city of Wilkes-Barre, until June, 1890.</p>
