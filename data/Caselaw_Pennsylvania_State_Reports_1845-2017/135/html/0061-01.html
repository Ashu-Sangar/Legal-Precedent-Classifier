When the second note, dated March 9, 1887, at three months, was coming due, the plaintiff testified, “ I wrote him a note that I couldn’t meet it. He wrote me a note in return, to bring the horse up, that if he had a horse to. match it he would take it back. I took the horse to his stable, but he just took the harness off him, and said that the horse should never go out of that stable again. I never had the horse since. I demanded him. I had no horse to carry on my business, and had to hire one at $1.50 a day. At the end of that time, a couple of weeks, I had to go out of business.”</p>

I wrote him a note in reply, and he came up to the stable with the horse. He wanted to exchange it for another horse worth $250, which I wouldn’t do. I offered to give him another horse that was in the stable, but he wouldn’t take it, and I told him that when he paid the amount of the balance of the purchase money of this horse he had brought back, he could have it, and not before.”</p>

    <p id="b83-9" data-blocks='[["BL_83.9",83,[196,1102,1174,967]]]'>Both parties agree in their testimony that the title to tbe horse was not to pass to plaintiff below until he had paid for it. He paid $40, and then, being unable to make the next payment, he gave a note for the rest of the purchase money. He says this note was for the convenience of both parties; the defendant below says it was for the accommodation of the plaintiff, but neither of them make any suggestion that it was to change the terms of the original bargain, except as to the time and mode of payment. The title to the horse was still in the vendor, and the giving of the note did not make any change in that respect. A note given for an existing debt is not payment, unless it be expressly accepted as such. The presumption is that it is not to be payment unless it is itself paid, and the testimony in this case contains nothing to overcome this presumption of the law. If there had been any conflict as to this point, the case should have been left to the jury to find what was the intention of the parties ; but, as there was no conflict, the jury should have been told that the title to the horse was still in the vendor under the original contract.</p>

The time for payment in full, not only by the original agreement, but by the second extension, had more than passed; the title was still in the vendor, and the jury might well have found that the peaceable resumption of possession, under the circumstances, was a reasonable <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>exercise of tbe right of rescission of tbe conditional sale. But, even if they did not on this ground find for the defendant, the plaintiff’s whole interest in the horse was the amount he had <em>paid; </em>and the jury should not, in any view of the ease, have been allowed to go beyond that amount in the assessment of damages.</p>
