The return avers that the objects of the league have passed away, and that it has become a club for social purposes. However this may be, its corporate character and the rights of the members remain the same, and can only be changed by an amendment to the charter. If the social elements enter into its business transactions, it is only an incident which confers no additional powers upon the corporation, and can in no degree interfere with the rights of the members. The business proper of the league seldom convokes a majority of the members, <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>and those who meet there for pleasure may not change its character and purposes. It is important to keep this in view, in considering the charge and the evidence upon which the relator was disfranchised. Language which might disturb the harmony of a meeting, or interfere with its business, and therefore be an offence against the corporation itself, may have a different aspect when it occurs in the drinking place between two members. It is then an offence against an individual, in which the corporation cannot be involved, and can have no interest.</p>

If this be so, generally, the evidence having been made a part of the return, wo must regard it as complete and for certain purposes to be considered. It shows that the relator’s offence was in quietly saying to a member with whom he was conversing in the drinking-room: “I have behaved like a gentleman, and you like a blackguard.” He was tried for saying this and not for calumniating a member, and was disfranchised.</p>

The power conferred implies that the subject of their action shall bo in spirit and substance disorderly, shall be directed against the corporation, and injurious to it.

The order of a legislative body, or of a court, could not be said to be interfered with by a remark heard only by the person to whom it was addressed, however insulting it may have been to him. No one else was disturbed by the remark made by the relator. It could not therefore be considered disorderly. Certainly it could not be <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>so, as against the league, nor injurious to it or its objects. This conduct in no way interfered with its rights, or authority, or with the transaction of business, nor could it affect its reputation. In considering the meaning to be given to “disorderly” in the section, it should not be overlooked that it is placed in juxtaposition with acts and conduct injurious to the interests or hostile to the objects of the league, which were the preservation of republican government and the Union. We conclude, therefore, that the language complained of was not disorderly, within the meaning of the by-law, and was not against the corporation or injurious to it or its purposes.</p>

Chief Justice Woodward said: “ I look upon the occurrence as disorderly and injurious to the club, within the meaning of the sixty-fifth by-law, but as one of those minor offences for which a majority have no power under the by-laws to disfranchise a member. The relator’s offence was not directed against the society, but against a fellow member, as in Earl’s Case and B inn’s Case. The law affords no precedent for punishing an offence between fellow members by disfranchisement. I am unwilling to make so bad a precedent in this case.”</p>

But has it been exercised? There is nothing in the by-laws defining the acts for which á member may be expelled. Offences for which he may be suspended are set out fully, but not one for which he may be expelled. The league have not acted upon the power given by the charter, and have not defined the offences punishable by expulsion, and the manner of trial.

It is true, <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>tlie relator does not appear to have been found guilty of “ acts or conduct ” which by the board were “ deemed disorderly,” or “injurious to the interests or hostile to the objects of the league,” in totidem verbis; he was found guilty of rude and ungentlemanly conduct, in the league-house, in this: that, without cause or provocation, he charged upon a fellow member that he was acting like a blackguard. This was certainly conduct of a disorderly character, especially as it occurred within the club-house, a place devoted to the cultivation of friendly political and social relations between gentlemen, and might well be deemed disorderly by the board of directors; that the board did deem the act disorderly, and injurious to the interests and hostile to the objects of the league, is shown by their formal resolution to that effect. It is not expected that the proceedings of a trial of this character, which are conducted in most cases by persons unlearned in the law, will be expressed with absolute technical accuracy, or will be subjected to the severe scrutiny which is applied, by persons of critical professional skill, in courts of law. If the proceedings are regular, and conducted in good faith; if the accused has been accorded a full and fair hearing, and a proper finding and judgment has been entered upon the facts, and the whole proceeding is stated with substantial accuracy, it is sufficient. The trial seems to have been conducted in an orderly manner, according to the strict letter of the by-laws of the league. The proceedings are in due form, and the relator, for anything that appears, was allowed the benefit of a full and impartial hearing, before a committee of the board, at his own election: it does not appear that he was denied any right or privilege to which he was entitled. There is no allegation, much less evidence, of fraud or unfairness, and we assume that the action of the league was in good faith.</p>

The common-law power of expulsion, as declared in the opinion of' Chief Justice Woodward, who tried the case at nisi prius, may be stated thus :</p>
    <p id="b342-6" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[303,582,1169,302]]]'>1. The power of disfranchisement must, in general, be conferred by the charter.

Evans had been convicted of breaking the sixty-fifth article of the by-laws of the club, by having an altercation within the walls of the club-house with Samuel B. Thomas, and by striking him a blow. “ I look upon the occurrence,” says the Chief Justice, “as disorderly and injurious to the interests of the club, within the meaning of the sixty-fifth by-law, but as one of those ‘ minor offences,’..... for which a majority have no power, even under the by-laws, to disfranchise a member; and, upon the doctrine of the cases I have referred to, I hold the by-law void, so far as it inflicts this extreme penalty for such an offence. I would be very sorry to say that anything short of a statute could confer on a majority of the members of any corporation power to expel a fellow member for merely disorderly conduct..... It is not a joint-stock company at present, for under its by-laws no pecuniary profits are divisible among the members, but it may become <em>so; </em>and, whether i-t does or not, the relator has a vested interest in its estate, and cannot be deprived of it by the proceedings that were had against him. On this point the authorities are clear, and without conflict. Nothing but an express power in the charter can authorize a money corporation to throw overboard one of its members. I have shown that the <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>act of incorporation contained no such power. On the contrary, it excluded it; for the proviso reads, ‘ that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to authorize said Philadelphia Association &amp; Reading-room to do any other act or acts, in their corporate capacity, than are herein expressed.’ ” These excerpts, drawn from the opinion of the Chief Justice, show that, while he denied the common-law power of a corporation to disfranchise its members, with the exceptions stated, he conceded that where the power is conferred by the charter, it may be exercised even for minor offences, and in money corporations.</p>
    <p id="b343-3" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[209,917,1164,1473]]]'>The Union League, although not a proprietary corporation, cannot in any strict sense be considered a joint-stock or moneyed corporation: its objects and purposes, as well as its management, are of a purely patriotic and social, and not of a financial or monetary character. Although authorized to hold property, real and personal, to a certain limited extent, for the promotion of the objects of the league, it is plainly distinguishable from such corporations as are organized for business and for purposes of gain, and this is fully illustrated in the present conduct of its affairs. In the by-laws it is provided “ that no member shall receive any profit, salary, or emolument from the funds of the league.” Members are admitted, not upon payment of the estimated value of a share or interest in the property of the league, but of a merely nominal sum as an admittance fee, and are charged with the payment of an annual tax of $25 for the support of the league, whilst their franchise and property rights are not inheritable, but continue for life, or during membership only. But, however this may be, the power of expulsion is expressly conferred by the charter, and the causes which shall justify it, and the manner of effecting the same, are expressly committed to the corporation, to be regulated by the by-laws, which by-laws “ the corporation and its officers are empowered to make and alter in the manner therein mentioned.” It is plain, also, that, according to the by-laws made under this provision of the charter, a majority of the board of directors has the power to suspend a member for acts or conduct which they may deem disorderly, or injurious to the interests or hostile to the objects of the league, “ and this suspension, unless the member is subsequently restored, is equivalent to an expulsion.”</p>

The relator, at the time of his admission to the league, was bound to know the provisions of the charter, and Avill be held to have assented to its provisions and to the frame of government which was laAvfully set up in accordance therewith. By the terms of his admission, the relator voluntarily submitted himself in all matters pertaining to the government of the league to the action of the board, and of the majority; and he could not thereby have been deprived of any constitutional or legal right, for the tribunal was practically one of his own selection.

Speaking of the force and effect of the charter, Mr. Justice Agnew says: “ Having the force and effect of law, by the provisions of the act allowing the incorporation, it..... is no longer a subject of judicial inquiry as to the fitness of its objects, conditions, and articles.” In Franklin Benef.

And as the legislature, by a direct statute constituting the charter of the Union League, has expressly given to the members themselves the right, through their by-laws, to regulate the causes of expulsion and the manner of effecting the same, we cannot see why the right thus conferred may not be exercised.

Any vilification of a member, or exhibition of personal rancor towards him, or the use of abusive or offensive epithets respecting him, especially in his presence and hearing, within the club-house, is, without doubt, disorderly and injurious to the interests of the club. Nor is the by-law in question illegal, or in conflict with the charter, in this, that it does not designate and define the various and specific acts which will be deemed disorderly. To have anticipated in a by-law the various disorderly acts which might or could occur, would have required the exercise of a very fertile imagination; neither the statute nor the common law contains any such ridiculous detail. What is orderly, and what is disorderly conduct, injurious to the interests and hostile to the objects of the league, must necessarily be determined by some proper tribunal; and the board of directors, to whom the practical management of its affairs is given, constitutes, in the first instance, the tribunal which the members have themselves set up, to have and exercise jurisdiction over such offences. When Mr. Burt became a member of the league, he voluntarily submitted himself to this jurisdiction ; he was admitted upon the terms of the charter, with knowledge that he must submit to all such regulations as the by-laws might reasonably provide, and that, for any wilful violation or infraction thereof, he was liable to be disfranchised.</p>

Nor is it wholly without significance that the counter-charge against Mr. Littleton was wholly groundless, unwarranted, and untrue. It does not appear that the board of directors, nor the league, in the exercise of their powers, either in the framing of these by-laws or in the trial and conviction of the defendant, acted arbitrarily or oppressively or in any sense unjustly, or that Arthur Burt was disfranchised without cause.</p>

If be have been expelled irregularly, tbe Chief Justice adds, “be has liis remedy by mandamus to restore him, but neither by mandamus nor action can tbe merits of liis expulsion be re-examined.” We quote from tbe opinion of Mr. Justice Agnew, in Society v.

One case has been brought to our attention, Pitcher v. Board of Trade, <a href="/ill-app/20/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="20 Ill. App. 319" data-case-ids="4905857" data-case-paths="/ill-app/20/0319-01">20 Ill. App. 319</a>, which appears to bear a very close analogy to the present. The hoard of trade was a hody corporate, created by a special act of the legislature: it owned a large amount of property; its object was the promotion of trade, and the admission fee was $10,000. The corporation was authorized to establish such rules, regulations and by-laws for the management of their business and the mode in which it should be transacted, as they might think proper, and liad “ the right to admit or expel such persons as they may see fit, in a manner to be prescribed by the rules, regulations, and bylaws thereof.” Pitcher was admitted as a member, and paid the price of admission, but was afterwards charged with “fraudulent conduct in a business transaction,” an offence declared by the by-laws; he was tried before the board of directors under the by-laws, and the charge being sustained he was expelled. On a mandamus, it was held that, as the charter conferred a general power of expulsion to be exercised as prescribed by the rules, regulations, and by-laws, that power was such as could be delegated to the board of directors. “ It seems to us,” says Judge McAllister, who delivered the opinion, “ from a consideration of all the provisions of the act, that its framers intended to leave the whole subject-matter of the expulsion of members to be regulated, both as to method and tribunal, by rules and by-laws of the body, not inconsistent with the principles of natural justice or the laws of the land. In pursuance of that power, the by-laws, set out in our statement of the case, were adopted, by which appellant on admission formally agreed to be bound. We are of opinion that such by-laws were authorized by the act, are not inconsistent with any principle of natural justice or the laws of the land, and are valid; that the trial, conviction, and expulsion of appellant were by a tribunal, not only authorized by appellee’s charter but by reason of appellant agreeing to be bound by said by-laws.” The case cited presents many points of similarity to the present case. The corporations, in both cases, owned property of large value; members were admitted on payment of a money consideration; the power of expulsion <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>was in both instances conferred by charter, and was delegated under the by-laws to the board of direction, not only as to the causes, but as to the manner of its exercise; and in neither case was the particular act or thing charged specifically set forth as an offence in the by-laws, but was, on the trial, so adjudged by the board of directors.</p>
