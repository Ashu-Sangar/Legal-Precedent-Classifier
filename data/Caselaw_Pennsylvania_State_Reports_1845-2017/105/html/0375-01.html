Runk, Esq.), which was filed March 12, 1880, the following facts appeared: Henry Schnurman died in March, 1875, seised and possessed of considerable real and personal property. Joseph Schnurman, his son-in-law, one of the executors named by Schnurman in his will, alone accepted the appointment, and letters testamentary were granted to him. The testator left to survive him a widow, Clementina Schnurman, four daughters — namely, Araminda B.

A. Feldman, Bella D. Grim, wife of A. S. Grim, — a son, Henry Schnurman, Jr., and a grandson, Robert Seider, son of testator’s daughter Rachel by a former marriage. Before bis death testator had. been a member of the firm of H. &amp; J. Schnurman, millers, consisting of himself and Joshua Schnurman, a brother of the accountant. This firm was dissolved long before testator's death, and was succeeded by that of H. Schnurman &amp; Co., composed of the members of the old firm and Joseph Schnurman, the accountant. This firm also was dissolved before testator’s death. Both firms were indebted to testator’s estate. Joshua Schnurman was the liquidating partner of both. From the claims against these two firms, which aggregated $17,046.61, the accountant realized, in 1878, the sum of $16,030.70. Of this he computed that $1,700 Avas interest accrued since the testator’s death, and therefore paid it to the Avidoav, Mrs. Clementina Schnurman, the beneficiary of the income of his estate (otherAvise undisposed of) during her life. Objections were made to this credit, on the ground that the entire payment was on account of principal, but it was alloAved by the auditor.</p>

Newhard each had a three-eighths interest, and Henry R. Roth tlie remaining two-eighths. Shortly after testator’s death the stock of this firm was appraised and valued at $16,394.30, and the three-eighths owned by the estate was finally appraised at $6,147.86]-. This interest the accountant himself took at the valuation, paying for it by a mortgage on real estate belonging to him for $6,147.86], Avliich he gave to C. W. Cooper in trust for testator’s estate. Testator’s son-in-law, A. S. Grim, offered to give $2,000 more for this interest, Avliich offer was refused by accountant. Some time after this, application Avas made to the court for the revocation of accountant’s official bonds, by bis sureties, Avho alleged misapprehension on their part of the effect of the obligation, and fraud in procuring their signatures. In his ansAver to this petition accountant admitted that he had purchased decedent’s interest in the firm as above, but claimed that it was for the best .interests of the estate, and Avas done with the full knowledge and approval of the heirs of decedent; and this ansAver was accompanied by a petition of the heirs affirming the truth of the answer, and signed by the widow, the son, and the four daughters of the decedent.

No fraud is alleged, nor is it asserted that the sum named does not fairly represent its full value. Neither the executor nor the heirs had any right to take the decedent's place in the partnership, nor to compel the continuance of the business. The stock on hand was rightfully in the possession of the surviving partners, the legal ownership of that stock, for the purposes of liquidation, was in them, and they had the right, acting honestly and with reasonable discretion and diligence, to dispose of it as they pleased. <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>It was their duty to turn it into available and distributable form, pay the debts, and divide the surplus. The executor possessed no power of sale or other authority over it; he had the right merely to compel an account, and payment accordingly. The decedent’s estate was entitled to receive from the surviving partners, upon a general statement of the partnership accounts, after payment of the firm debts and settlement of its affairs, three-eighths of the surplus remaining. The settlement involved a conversion of the common stock into money, and it was in the proceeds of the conversion the executor had a right to participate.</p>

The administrator or executor of a deceased partner, having in view the best interests of the estate; ma3r settle with the surviving partners on such terms as in the exercise of good faith and a reasonable discretion he may choose to accept; but as the surviving partners are in some sense trustees of the deceased partner’s interest, both they and the executor must be held to the exercise of the utmost good faith. The surviving partner may, however, in the interests of trade, purchase from the executor, at a fair valuation, the unascertained share of the deceased partner, and avoid the ruinous results of a general sale. This form of settlement is not infrequent, and, if the parties act bona fide, and with proper discretion, it sometimes affords an eas3r solution to the difficulties which ma}r arise in such cases. In such a case the affairs of the estate are guarded by the executor, whose interest it is to realize as largely as he can, and who has no interest otherwise.</p>

There is no allegation, and there is certainly no proof, that the sum specified does not fairly represent the value of the stock.

There is absolutely no evidence in contradiction of tliése facts, excepting the alleged fact of Grim’s offer in May preceding, a fact which, if it existed at all, was doubtless well known at the time. It will be observed, however, that the real estate, in which the business of the firm was conducted, was the property of Henry Schnurman, and it was to the interest of the estate that the business should be continued, that the realty might remain profitable to rent.; the surviving partners, if they contemplated a continuance of the business, had a right to select their own partner; no one could intrude himself upon them. Joseph Schnurman was acceptable to them, and here doubtless is the <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>key to tlieir conduct.

Glidden <em>v. </em>Strupler, 2 P. F. Smith, 400; Bispham Eq., 293. But the transaction here shown, so far as the heirs are concerned, was in no sense a sale of their interests in anything; the active parties to the sale were the surviving partners on the one side, and Joseph Schnurman on the other ; the heirs were but passively affected by it. There was no conveyance, no transfer, no release of their interests in the partnership or the estate; their act was merely the approval of a course of procedure, to be pursued by the executor, to ascertain their shares and advance the settlement. In this-they were affected with no disability; under the Act of 1855 they were entitled, without being joined with their husbands, to ascertain, receive and receipt for their shares. This was a matter therefore about which they might be consulted, and concerning which they might advise, and, in so doing, they were held to the exercise of the same degree of good faith as-others in a like case. It was through the inducement of the-heirs that the executor assumed the hazard of the purchase,, and became responsible for the price; the law presumes that the act was done on the faith that it should not afterwards be-disputed, or the resulting obligations denied. A married, woman should be held to the observance of that good faith, in her dealings with the world, to which others are bound; hex-protection is for the prevention of fx-aud; she should not thereby be enabled with impunity to defraud others. The-subject of the sale has, in the nine years that have elapsed,, passed out of the executor’s power, his condition is materially changed, aixd the heirs are by their conduct precluded from asserting a right which otherwise they might have enforced.. It is said that the daughters are not the owners of the corpus of the estate; this may be so, but they are the only exceptants-,. <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>atad aré the parties to this appeal. The 8th assignment is, we think, without merit. The testator directed that the notes of ■his sons-in-law should be taken and considered as advancements ; the usual incidents to an advancement thereby attached to the notes. The wife of the accountant receipted to the executor upon the footing of the <em>will; </em>if she <em>made </em>no complaint, no one else could'. The 9th assignment is equally without merit. The $1,700 paid to the widow was an adjustment of interest accruing to her from the testator’s death, upon the moneys remaining in the hands of Joshua Schnurman, during the protracted examination of the books, made at the ■instance of the heirs. The settlement was for a round sum including interest; but the widow was entitled to the interest, and this $1,700 is the sum which was paid to her as interest out of the round sum received. No complaint is made that it was not. actually paid, or that the amount is too large; indeed it appears to have been paid with the appellant’s consent to the widow, who at once divided the amount among her children ; each of the appellants received a share, and they now seek to surcharge the executor with the money which they now have in their own pockets.</p>
