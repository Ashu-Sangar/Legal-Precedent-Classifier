In estimating the profits of the business of a partnership, it is error to include among the expenditures such amounts as have been expended in permanent improvements to the real estate of the firm. Such improvements must be regarded as capital.</p>

A member of a partnership, who was also its general manager, was to . receive, under the articles of partnership, “a liberal salary, say $500, out of the gross income” for his services. In the statement of an account of said partnership’s business, a sum of money expended in permanent improvements to the firm’s real estate was included among the expenditures. With this item included, the account showed that <em>the </em>firm had made no profits from its business. The court below, holding that “gross income” in said articles meant net profits and not gross receipts, held accordingly that A. was not entitled to any salary under the agreement.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b432-10" data-blocks='[["BL_432.12",432,[252,1725,1187,736]]]'>Thomas M. Rathmell and Ezra Rathmell, the plaintiffs, entered into partnership with Gottlieb F. Braun, the defendant, on August 7, 1875, for the purpose of manufacturing and selling flour, feed, etc. Under the written terms of the co-partnership G. F. Braun was to manage the business of said firm, and receive as compensation therefor “ a liberal salary, say five hundred dollars, out of the gross income.” The working capital was to be $1,000, the plaintiffs and defendant each to furnish one half. .Subsequently, each of the two parties contributed $300 more to the worldng capital. The firm’s mill, formerly owned by Braun, and in which the plaintiffs had purchased a one half interest, was not in a condition to successfully carry on the business, and considerable money was expended in improving it. On April 1,1877, the plaintiffs, having become dissatisfied with their investment, dissolved the partnership and demanded from Braun an account of its business. On May 19, 1882, this bill was filed.</p>

      <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>As to whether Braun was entitled under the'above agreement to any compensation for his services during the period of the partnership, the master reported as follows :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-6" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[161,557,1180,1775]]]'>The words of the agreement are “ the second party agrees to allow said first party a liberal salary, say five hundred dollars out of the gross income.” What is the meaning of <em>“gross income ? </em>” “ Gross ” means whole, entire, <em>total. “ </em>Income ” is defined as “that gain which proceeds from labor, business or property of any kind — the profits of commerce or business.” Hence, <em>“gross income" </em>hei’e means the whole or entire profit arising from this partnership. In other words, the defendant here agreed to conduct this business for a salary, conditioned upon- its being profitable. This being the master’s view of the agreement, the next question for decision is, “Was there a profit in this business?” The partnership began with a working capital of $1,000, which, by reason of repairs and improvements to the mill, was soon increased to $1,600. The business continued about a year and seven months, at the end of which time there remained less than $800; that is to say, the capital of $1,600, as well as any amount which may have been made in the business was reduced to about $800. Counsel for defendant urged in this behalf, that in ascertaining whether there was a profit or not the money expended for building and for personal property must not be considered. But the master thinks equity requires a different view of it. When the partnership was formed, the mill was not in a condition for making the business successful. The defendant was a practical miller, and he used this money in the repairing, improving and increasing the capacity and power of the mill. All this was done under his care and supervision. The success of the business evidently depended on what the mill was able to do. It was just as necessary that the mill should be repaired, improved and placed in good running order, as it was to buy grain for it to manufacture. This improvement and conser quent expense were contemplated when the partnership was formed. The plaintiffs by reason of this put in more money than they agreed to furnish, and left the whole management of it to the defendant. The master regards the item called “ building expenses” as in fact nothing more than the current expenses of the business. The master believes that these items should be taken into account in determining the question of profit. Under this view of the case, there certainly is no profit, and there being no profit, the defendant, under the agreement, is entitled to no salary.</p>

    <p id="b434-9" data-blocks='[["BL_434.11",434,[262,1543,1184,388]]]'>The master found that the firm made no profits, and hence that there was no fund out of which the appellant’s salary of $500 per year could be paid.- To reach this result he has stated a debit and credit account with the “Susquehanna Mills,” from which: it appears the appellant is a debtor to the concern in the sum of $500.78. Ho fault is found with the items of this account.' They are not shown to be incorrect, nor is error assigned thereto except in the matter of interest. It is the result that is complained of.</p>

But when we examine it to ascertain what, if any, profits were made by the firm, we cannot adopt the master’s conclusions. The item of $1,385.15, “amount paid for building expenses” must be thrown out in estimating profits, for the plain reason that it was expended for betterments. It was evidently for the permanent improvement of the real estate. . The master does not give the items of this expenditure, but enough appears to show its general character. In one place he refers to it as “ the amount, expended for building.” In another place he says : “ The mill was.not in a condition for successfully parrying .on the busi<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>ness, and considerable money was expended in improving it.” Again the improvements were for “repairing, improving and increasing the capacity and power of the mill.” This is something outside of the ordinary repairs to a property of this description. The improvements were evidently of a permanent character, for the purpose of increasing the capacity of the mill. They added to the permanent value of the real estate, and must therefore be regarded as capital. The outlay was not a part of the annual current expense of carrying on the business. It was perhaps a necessary expenditure, but it was no more a part of. the expenses of the business than the purchase of the mill property itself.</p>

' It will be the duty of the court below to enter a decree in accordance with this opinion, or if necessary, to send the case back to the master for that purpose.</p>
