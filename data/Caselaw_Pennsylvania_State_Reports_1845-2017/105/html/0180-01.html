Baum’s Rights and Duties of Rectors, etc., 76; Cripp’s Law of the Church and Clergy, 804; Blunt’s Book of Church Law, 296; Hoffman’s Ecclesiastical Law in New York, 79. But the contention that the rector had no right to vote at all cannot be sustained. The right of the rector to vote at a vestry meeting is the law of the Episcopal church, without <em>any </em>exception, in the states or countries which recognize the law of the church as binding in such matters. Baum on the Rights of Rectors and Vestrymen, 75; Richey’s Churchman’s Handbook, section 61 and note; Hoffman’s Law of Church in New York, 79, 80, 81. Nor can the charter and by-laws of this church he so construed as to change this law, on the ground that under them the rector is not a vestryman. Art. HI., of the charter, provides that the temporal affairs of the congregation shall be under the management of the rector, church wardens and vestrymen. Art. V., after referring to the qualifications for electors, provides that the vestrymen shall continue in office until others are chosen, aud shall have authority to fill vacancies in their own body. But this latter provision that the “vestrymen” shall have authority to fill vacancies in their own body does not take - away the rector's right to vote as a member of the body, for should this be the case the ehurch wardens, who are members of the vestry, would also be deprived of a vote, and this has never been alleged. The court below held that the rector, though an “ essential part of the vestry, is in no sense a vestryman; ” and “ the rector, though a member of the body termed the vestry, is in no sense a vestryman, nor is he entitled to perform the functions of a member of the vestry, which the charter restricts to the vestrymen alone.” It may be that the rector does not become a member of the vestry from the fact of his being a member of the corporation; but it is incomprehensible that he should be a “ member of the vestry ” and yet not have the rights of a “ vestryman.” The manner in which the corporation has interpreted this provision is shown in Article II., section 4, of the by-laws: “ The <em>vestry </em>shall have power to fill all vacancies that may occur in their own body.”</p>

There could, therefore, have been no quorum of the vestry at any meeting held after June 13, 1882, because the withdrawal of the rector and four members of the vestry left only six legally elected vestrymen, and seven were required by the by-laws to make a quorum. All proceedings at the so-called vestry meetings after that date were therefore void. The question here is not one within the juris<a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>diction of a court of chancery.

Three judges of election were “appointed” by the vestry, and upon the withdrawal of one another was appointed in his place. Until the vestry failed to appoint, the warden had no right to do so. The poll held by the three judges having been legal, there was no necessity for a new election. The plaintiffs were, therefore, de facto vestrymen, were in possession, and as the defendants sought to interfere with the exercise of their rights as vestrymen, they were clearly entitled to the equitable jtirisdietion of the court.

This right, although claimed in good faith, and not without some color of authority in the Episcopal church, cannot be sustained. This was conceded upon the argument, and need not be discussed. It is manifest Mr. Neilson was not elected to fill the vacancy referred to.</p>

The third article of said charter provides that “The temporal affairs of this corporation shall be under the management of a vestry, to he composed of the rector, church wardens and vestrymen chosen in the manner hereinafter provided, who shall have power,” &amp;c.

      <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>It will thus be seen that the' vestry is composed of the rector, church wardens and vestrymen. The vestrymen consist of twelve persons who are elected on Easter Monday; the two church wardens are selected from the vestrymen.

    <p id="Abn" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[252,758,1178,647]]]'>It was contended that because the fifth article declares that “ the vestry of said church shall consist of twelve persons who shall be elected on Easter Monday,” and that said vestrymen shall have “ authority to fill vacancies in their own body,” the rector had no right to vote infilling any such vacancy. The fifth article was not intended to conflict with the third article, which declares who shall compose the vestry. The word “vestry” in the fifth article was plainly intended to designate the number of vestrymen and provide for their election on Easter Monday. The article prescribes the manner of their election, and the qualifications of voters. This view is strengthened by the fact that neither the rector nor church wardens are referred to in the fifth article as belonging to the vestry, while they are expressly designated as members of the vestry by the third article.</p>
    <p id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[252,1403,1178,603]]]'>But it is said the vestrymen, and not the vestry, are to fill all vacancies in their own body, and as this was the case of such vacancy the rector could not vote. The fifth article standing alone might seem to favor such a construction, but when we turn to the eighth article we find that “The vestry, or a majority of them, shall and may convene from time to time, and make such and so many rules, by-laws, ordinances and regulations as they may deem expedient for the good government and support of the church, and shall have power to fill all vacancies in their own body.” When we examine the bylaws which the vestry have made in pursuance of this power, we find in article second, section 21, the following: “ The vestry shall have power to fill all vacancies that may occur in their own body.”</p>

We therefore regard it as entirely clear that it is the vestry as a whole, and not the twelve vestrymen as a portion of the vestry, that'have the power under the charter and by-laws- of this church, to fill vacancies in that body, and as the right of the rector as a member thereof to vote is not denied by the charter or the law of the church, he was entitled at the election for vestryman occasioned by the death of Mr. Smith, to vote for Mr. Eeilson. This made a tie, and neither Mr. Neilson nor Mr. Chew was elected. As the election for twelve vestrymen on Easter Monday, 1883, depends for its validity to a <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>considerable extent upon whether Mr. Neilson or Mr. Chew was elected to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Smith's death, it is evident the plaintiffs have no such apparent right to act as vestrymen as entitles them to the interference of a court of equity.
