The brakeman was at the time on the forward bumper of the rear car, and there was no evidence that he saw A.

Their house was on a corner, fronting on a street which ran parallel to the railroad, and running back along a street at right angles thereto. At the intersection of the railroad and the latter street there was an embankment about eight feet high, on which a flight of steps was constructed for the purpose of more convenient access from the street to the railroad. The back door of the plaintiffs’ house was about ninety feet from these steps. The injury was inflicted by a coal train upon the last car of which two boys, William Perry and Aaron Coolbaugh, each about nine years of age, and schoolmates of Theodore, who was six years old, were riding by permission of the brakeman. As the train approached the steps these boys motioned to Theodore, who was standing at the back door of plaintiffs’ house, to join them on the car. He ran out and reached the top of the steps just as the last car was passing. He climbed up on this ear and shortly afterwards lost his hat. In his attempt to recover it he fell under the car and received injuries from which he died in a few hours. The brakeman at this time was sitting between the last car and the next one, warming himself at a fire made of waste.</p>

When the mother came in with the .milk the sister asked her if the coffee was ready, and she answered yes. Theodore then asked if there was sugar in it, upon which the sister went to the buttery to get it,- at the same time the mother stepped into another buttery to strain her milk. When she came out, Mrs. Lochard rapped on the window and asked her, where is Theodore? The mother answered here, and looked around the room for her child, when Mrs. Lochard said, “ he is over on the railroad, killed.” The father was at his work, some two miles distant.</p>

There .is nothing in the testimony to warrant the court in holding, as matter of law, that there could be no recovery either on the ground that the child’s parents were chargeable with contributory negligence, or that he, himself, was a trespasser in the sense that one of maturer years would have been under like circumstances.

Their house was on a corner lot, extending back along a street running at right angles to the railroad. At the intersection of the railroad and the street there was an embankment about eight feet high, on which a flight of steps was constructed for the purpose of more convenient access from the street to the railroad. The back door of plaintiffs’ house was about ninety feet from the foot of the steps. The injury was done by a coal train, on the hind car of which two boys, about nine years of age, schoolmates of •plaintiffs’ son, were riding by permission of the brakeman. As the train approached the steps these boys beckoned to the deceased, who was then standing in the back door of his home. He immediately responded, ran out, reached the top of the steps as the hind car was passing that point, climbed on the car, and, almost immediately thereafter, in attempting to recover his hat, fell under the car and was so badly injured that he died same afternoon. There was no material conflict of testimony. The witnesses disagreed as to whether the boy <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>actually left the car for the purpose of recovering his hat, or fell in attempting to reach down for it. The boy Perry says deceased ran from his home to the railroad. “ When he got on the railroad I kept motioning my hand to him; then he went to the hind car, got on, and his hat fell off, and when he went to get on again his legs went under the car.” The only other witness who describes the occurrence, which evidently was the work of a few seconds, says he reached down after his hat and fell off the car.</p>

It must have been running very slowly, or a boy under six years of age could not have climbed on the car while it was in motion. It is said the brakeman, who was sitting on the bumper at the front end of the hind ear, should have prevented the boy from getting on the car, or have taken care of him when he was there. To this it may be replied that the brakeman had his duties to attend to, and was in a position where he could promptly apply the brake when necessary; and, moreover, there is not a particle of testimony tending to show that he saw the boy, or had any reason to suppose he was on or near the train. If he gave the other boys permission to ride on the ear he transcended his authority, and did'a very imprudent and improper act; but it so happened that no harm befell either of them.</p>
