He did not use the return coupons of the ticket until more than two years afterwards, viz., on November 3, 1881, when he started to travel from Philadelphia to Williamsport. The ticket was accepted for passage on the Pennsylvania Railroad from Philadelphia to Harrisburg. After leaving Harrisburg, the conductor of the train declined to accept the ticket, and' demanded fare. Plaintiff did not pay it, but was permitted to travel until after the train had stopped at Dauphin, and had started from that station. The conductor then again declined to honor the ticket and demanded fare, which the plaintiff refused to pay. The conductor then stopped the train, some distance from the Dauphin station, and the plaintiff was ordered to leave the train, which he did, no violence being used. The train was not stopped at a station, and the testimony was conflicting as to the distance from the Dauphin station at which it was stopped; the conductor testified it was about a quarter of a mile; the plaintiff said it was a mile and a quarter.</p>

There is nothing whatever on this ticket that I can see that limits in any way the time within which it is to be used. There is nothing to show the purchaser of this ticket that it is not at liis discretion to use it when he was disposed to do so, and. the company cannot limit their responsibility after making a contract of that sort by any directions or instructions to their agents. [Therefore, when the conductor refused to receive this ticket, and turned him off the car, in my opinion he committed a gross outrage.] I do not think that it is fair to comment upon the conduct of Mr. Smith as being at all brutal or violent, or more disrespectful than was necessary. He put this man off against his will, but it was not accompanied by any actual violence. That, however, does not make the putting him off less or more justifiable. That is a simple <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>incident which depended upon the characteristics of the man who happened to be the conductor at the time. [Putting the plaintiff off the train was without any right whatever.-] This, then, raises the second question, which is really the main question in this case.' That is, whose agent it was that put him off this car.</p>

Where an outrage is committed upon the traveller by'some of these connecting routes over "which the original seiler of the ticket has no control, it would be very hard justice, indeed, if you were to attempt to make the railroad that sold this ticket responsible for the conduct of the employees of the'other railroads. Very often these tickets of this character take not only over railroads, but over steamboat routes, and, of course, it would bé a great hardship, because a company sold you a ticket which gave you a privilege of a trip to Europe, that the company who sold you that ticket, if the captain of the vessel at sea was to violate your rights in any way, should be responsible; and the defence in this case is, that these defendants were not the agents of the Pennsylvania Railroad at the time, and that they are not responsible, therefore, for their acts. Now, the plaintiff says that that was not true; that there was no doubt that it was a Pennsylvania Railroad car; that they were in the full uniform of the Pennsylvania Railroad; that the insignia attached to their coats designated that they were in the Pennsylvania Railroad service, and bad all the outward indications of being in the employ of that company; and, therefore, the plaintiff contends that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, through their servants, are therefore responsible. The defendant on the other side has shown to you the different charters of these railways, and has argued to you that although there does appear to he a very intimate connection between the employees of the two roads, that in point of fact they were not the employees of their railroad, but of the Northern Central Railroad. You have heard the comments of counsel on each side, and this is a question for you. If you belie.ve the offence was committed by the officers of the Pennsylvania Railroad, defendant would be responsible. If, on the other hand, you believe it was done by those over whom the company then liad no control, that the conductor was the employee of another and distinct organization, then they would not be responsible.</p>

It is well understood, and was amply proved in this case, that the conductor while on the line of the Northern Central road was governed exclusively by the directions of that company, and in refusing the plaintiff’s ticket was acting under their instructions, and not under those of the Pa.

Having the ticket with return checks still attached thereto in his possession, he left Philadelphia in November, 1881, intending to use the same iii going thence to Williamsport. He experienced no difficulty until lie reached a point on the Northern Central Railroad east of Dauphin, where he offered the ticket for passage to Sunbury and thence to Williamsport, but the conductor refused, to receive it, on the ground that the time within which it might have been used had expired, and insisted on payment of the usual fare.

The learned judge was therefore right in charging the jury that there is nothing whatever on the ticket limiting the time within which it might be used; nor is there anything to show the purchaser “ that it was not at his discretion to use it when he was disposed to do so, and the company cannot limit their responsibility, after making a contract of that sort, by any directions or instructions to their agents.” He was also right in refusing to charge as requested in defendant’s second point, viz.: “ If the jury believe that the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary diligence and care in making iiiquiries, could have ascertained ’ at or before the time he got the ticket, that under the rules and regulations of the company it was not good after November 1st, 1879, and did not exercise such care and diligence, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and the verdict should be for defendant.” There was no evidence to justify the submission of this proposition. On the contrary the uncontradicted testimony negatived the idea of any want of care and diligence on the part of plaintiff below. He testified in substance that when he was about purchasing a single ticket to Philadelphia, the ticket agent informed him he could buy a round trip ticket that would be good until used, and upon that assurance he bought and paid for the ticket in question.</p>
