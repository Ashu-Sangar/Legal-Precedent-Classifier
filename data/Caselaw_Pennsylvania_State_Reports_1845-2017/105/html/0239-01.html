The Philadelphia, Newtown and New York R. R. Company became insolvent in 1876, and all its property and franchises were sold by the sheriff to Benjamin Smith et al., by whom they were subsequently conveyed to a new corporation, under the same name. This company leased their road to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, and, with the last named corporation, is the defendant in this action. The defendants requested the court to charge the jury substantially that the plaintiff's right was limited to recovery under the agreement of July 8, 1873; that as the original company’s occupation was under that agreement, they were guilty of no trespass, and ejectment would not lie. The court instructed the jury as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b258-11" data-blocks='[["BL_258.8",258,[265,1503,1201,257]]]'>“ If you find that the company entered and took possession under the agreement, or that it was fulfilled, the plaintiff cannot maintain this suit.

It wholly omitted to secure the payment prescribed by the statute to give it a right to take possession. Its entry was therefore a trespass. McClinton <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., 16 P. F. Smith, 404; Gilmore <em>v. </em>Railroad Company, decided at the present term, 8 Out., 275.</p>

It has taken private property without paying or securing payment therefor to the owner, and seeks to hold possession thereof against his will. This it cannot legally do.

It claimed to hold the whole title adversely to the plaintiff below, and attempted to defeat the action. If its .position is now worse than it otherwise might have been, it is caused by its own act in setting up a claim which the jury found to be untrue. It wilfully refrained from asserting its equities on the trial. It asked for no conditional verdict to protect them. The corporation cannot defeat a right to recover, under a contract which it did not fulfil.</p>
