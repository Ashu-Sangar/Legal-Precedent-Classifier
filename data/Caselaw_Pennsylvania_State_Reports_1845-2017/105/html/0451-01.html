The bill further alleged a readiness on B.’s part to satisfy the judgments, and prayed for specific performance of the contract to convey. A., in liis answer, denied any such agreement, and claimed that B.’s possession was in pursuance of a contract of loase. The judgments were not satisfied of record, but their lien was allowed to expire. The fact of the parol agreement for the sale of the land was sustained by the weight of the evidence; but among the salient points of the case were the conflicting evidence respecting the contract; that the possession was as consistent with the lease averred by A. as with the purchase averred by B.; that the possession was recent, and the improvements such that the extent and value thereof could be proved and compensated for in damages; that the parties treated the judgments as remaining in force until the lien expired, and that the insolvency of A. was as well known to B. at the date of the contract as afterwards.

In September, 1871, he bought of David Chapman the land described in par. 2 of plaintiff’s bill, with personal property estimated at $800, for $8,400. H. &amp; B. lent him $1,000 to make the first payment, for which he gave them his note. To secure the balance of purchase money, McKinney gave Chapman his two notes for $1,200 each, which were subsequently purchased by II. &amp; B. The three judgments mentioned in par. 8 of plaintiff’s bill were entered on these notes. The whole of McKinney’s debt to Chapman was thus paid with money furnished by H. &amp; B., and they bold all the judgments to secure it.</p>

A parol contract was then made between these parlies, in pursuance of which McKinney transferred to 11. &amp; B. possession of the land, and of the greater part of his personal property except his household furniture. As to the terms of this contract and its date, the testimony is somewhat conflicting. ..... The master finds that all the material averments contained in plaintiffs’ bill of complaint relating to the terms of the contract, its execution on the part of II. &amp; B., and the several matters which entitle <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>them to demand specific performance, are sustained by the evidence.”</p>

At the same time Holbert gave McKinney the following certificate: “This is to certify that Mahlon McKinney has this day given us his judgment notes of $500 each, due 1, 2, '8, 4, 5, 6, and 7 years making in all $3,500, which we agree to return to said McKinney within twenty days from this date, or cancel the judgment notes we now hold against him for $3,400, principal, and we may do either at our option.</p>

In their reliance upon it, they allowed the lien of their judgments to expire, without revival; while McKinney has since conveyed the legal title to his co-defendant, and is insolvent. It would therefore be impossible to place the parties in statu quo. A peculiar feature of the case is that McKinney never had anything invested in the land, nor any real interest in it apart from a naked legal title. The consideration was wholly paid by H. &amp; B.; McKinney held possession for about two years and a half, and during that period received $1,000 to $1,200 from H. &amp; B. for bark and timber taken from the land, without paying a dollar of interest or principal; and then, unable to pay anything, — with the value of the land diminished by the removal of bark and timber, and the debt for purchase money increased by arrears of interest,-^he abandoned it to H. &amp; B. as a payment of the debt.”</p>

The opinion of the court was, inter alia, as follows: “ The plaintiffs complain that the master should have found that Lord knew that plaintiffs were in possession of the land at the time of his alleged purchase; that Lord gave no consideration, and was a party to the fraud......Practically, however, so far as the merits of this case are concerned, in order to entitle the plaintiff to relief against Lord, the master, we think, has found sufficient. Holberts &amp; Branning were in actual possession of the land, and had been from April, 1874, down to 1st September, 1877, the time of the deed to Lord. This possession was open, notorious, exclusive and continued. Lord himself testifies that he knew of their possession, but claims that that knowledge was of a possession as tenants of McKinney, but admits that he received that knowledge from McKinney and not from any person actually in possession. We can discover no rule of law nor principle of equity which would excuse Lord from inquiring of the parties in possession as to how they held. It was negligence on his part, if not constructive fraud, for him to quietly ignore this evidence of title. Possession is notice to all the world of the title a person claims under. Neither the advice of counsel nor any amount of inquiry scattered over other territory could excuse Lord from inquiring on the land itself, or of those who had the land in their possession. <em>Possessio pedis </em>would have given some force to their declarations, and at the same time it took away all force from the declarations of McKinney or any one else......We have reviewed all the evidence in the case, and find that the defendant Lord is affected with constructive fraud, and that a decree should be entered against him avoiding the deed of Mahlon McKinney and wife to Alva <em>J. </em>Lord for the land in dispute.”</p>

Specifically, he did not find what improvements were made, nor their value. There is real conflict in the testimony whether the value of what the plaintiffs took off the land did not exceed that of the improvements. Be this as it may, it is certain that no buildings were erected, none repaired, no orchards planted, that the farm was occupied by tenants, and that the improvements can be compensated in damages. He did find, notwithstanding the parties aver and admit that McKinney owned and held possession of the land on May 25, 1874, that McKinney left in April preceding when the tenant of plaintiffs moved upon the land. This fact was corroborative of McKinney’s testimony that in April lie leased and gave possession to the plaintiffs. One of the plaintiffs, William Holbert, and his son were witnesses in support of the allegations in the bill. At first they were positive the contract was made on May 25, but after the closing of the defendant’s testimony, in rebuttal, corrected their first date placing it in April; they fixed the date at first by reference to the credit on their book for the personal property, and at last by reference to an execution issued for the seizure of that property. It may be noted that contrary to his averment in the bill and to the testimony of his son, the plaintiff testifies that the personal property was worth more than the book account, and the overplus was to be credited on the judgments.</p>

So the bill avers and so the plaintiff testifies: Though the lien has expired, the judgments are now record evidence of McKinney’s indebtedness to the plaintiffs. Until the lien expired the parties treated the judgments as in force. On May 1, 1876, the plaintiffs signed and delivered to McKinney a paper as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[242,650,1195,822]]]'>“ This is to certify that Mahlon McKinney has this day given us his judgment notes of $500 each, due one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven years, making in all $3,500, which we agree to return to said Mahlon McKinney within twenty days from this date, or cancel the judgments we now hold against'him for $3,400 principal. We may do either at our option.” The-meaning of that is the same since the lien of the judgments expired as before. It is neither obscured nor twisted by lapse of time nor pecuniary interest. It accords with the record, while the oral testimony for the purpose of reconciling the paper with the allegation that the judgments were actually satisfied, is inconsistent with both the record and the writing. The three notes on.which the judgments were founded were entered in the plaintiffs’ book of bills receivable; after the expiration of the lien and after the plaintiffs had consulted an attorney, but before the beginning of this proceeding, the plaintiffs wrote on the page where the notes were entered, under the head of, “When and how disposed” these words: “ Paid by all real a,nd personal estate bought of Chapman.”</blockquote>

It is not averred that the plaintiffs were induced to let the lien drop by any artifice of McKinney. They neglected to procure revival of the judgments. Then they demanded the deed, and then McKinney refused. He denies that he made the contract, but being overweighed by the opposing testimony, says the thing proved is void. His fraud is of the kind which exists wherever a man refuses to perform a parol contract for sale of land, and relies on the Statute of Frauds to prevent its enforcement. Had not the plaintiffs neglected to keep .the lien alive there would be no vague charge of fraud; were it not for the loss, or danger of loss, of their judgments, there would be no- devices to avoid the statute.</p>

He did not find that the plaintiffs had-satisfied, the judgments, or treated them as paid, or that they had promptly requested a conveyance and tendered satisfaction, for such finding would hav.e been against the plaintiffs’. <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>own testimony; yet lie infers that the several matters which entitle them to specific performance are sustained by the evidence. In his reasoning, leading to that conclusion, he remarks that a peculiar feature of the case is, that McKinney never had anything invested in the land, nor any interest except the uaked legal title; that the consideration was wholly paid by Holbert and Branning when McKinney purchased, and after holding possession for two years and a half McKinney abandoned the land to Holbert and Branning as a payment of the debt. Of course, that is figurative, for if true, McKinney was a naked trustee, and the plaintiffs the real owners. The bill makes no such averments. There it appears that McKinney owned the land and was debtor to the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b477-6" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[224,966,1174,983]]]'>Although the fact of a parol agreement for the sale of the land is sustained by the weight of the evidence, among the salient points of the case are, the conflicting testimony respecting the contract, and that the possession is as consistent with the lease averred by the defendants as with the purchase averred by the plaintiffs; the possession was recent, less than four years prior to commencement of the action, and the improvements such that the extent and value thereof can be easily proved and admit of compensation in damages; that the parties treated the judgments, the consideration, as remaining in force until their lion expired; and the insolvency of McKinney was as well known to the plaintiffs at the date of the contract, and while the lien of the judgments was unexpired as it has been since. Should such a contract, under the circumstances, prevail against the statute ? This question cannot be affirmed without grave doubt, for the case comes with its discrepancies arising from fallible memory, if not from evil motive. If a chancellor will act when there is doubt, such cases will be frequent, and the uncertainty of titles to real estate be increased. To take a case out of the operation of the statute, its proof in all essentials and its equities should be so plain as to preclude doubt or hesitancy in reaching a conclusion.</p>

It has been said that there must be proof of expenditure for improvements not reimbursed by profits derived from the occupation of the land, and not capable of compensation in damages recoverable in an action for the breach of the contract, to take the case out of the operation of the statute: Hart <em>v. </em>Carroll, <a href="/pa/85/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="85 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="440531" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0508-01">85 Pa.

St., 52</a>. Every day’s experience more fully demonstrates that the statute for prevention of frauds and perjuries was founded in wisdom, 'and is necessary to preserve the title to real property from the uncertainty attending the admission of parol testimony. Where one purchases a tract of land by parol, pays all his money, receives, full possession and holds and uses it as his own, equity interferes so as to prevent the vendor from converting the statute made to prevent frauds into an instrument of fraud. The party who claims the interference of the chancellor has the burden of proof. He is presumed to know that the law required the contract to be in writing. When he asks the court to save him from the consequences of his own disregard of the law, he should be held to proof of the requisite facts beyond a doubt. If a chancellor were to act on doubtful parol proof, on strained and fanciful inferences, or vague surmises, he would annul the wholesome provisions of the statute in search of a visionary equity, and introduce into the community the very evils which the legislature intended to remedy: Per Grier, J. Woods <em>v. </em>Farmare, <a href="/watts/10/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="10 Watts 195" data-case-ids="1850930" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0195-01">10 Watts, 195</a>.</p>
