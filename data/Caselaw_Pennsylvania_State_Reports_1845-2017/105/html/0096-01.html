Houtz to December Term, 1877, No. Í154. On March 22d, 1878, J. B. Coryall obtained a judgment against the same defendant. Subsequently, on April 20th, 1878, Duffey obtained another judgment against said. Houtz, to March Term, 1878, No. 816. In January, 1883, Duffey issued a praecipe for a scire facias to revive the judgment to March Term, 1878, No. 816. A writ of scire facias issued accordingly and was returned nihil babet, and on February 15th, 1883, an alias scire facias issued, and was returned as before. On February 21st, 1883, after the lien of the first judgment had expired, Duffey took a rule to show cause why the said praecipe and writ of scire facias should not be amended, so that its caption should read December Term, 1877, No. 1154, instead of March Term, 1878, No. 816. An affidavit ivas presented therewith by Duffey’s counsel, that by a clerical error the praecipe misrecited the term and number of the judgment intended to be revived, making it No. 816 of March Term, 1878, instead of No. 1154 of December Term, 1877.

Thereupon, Duffey took this writ of error, assigning for error the said modification of the order of the court making absolute said rule allowing the amendment.</p>

We do not contend .that such a mistake, however unfortunate, could' be corrected as against persons who had acted upon the faith of the record as it then stood, either by purchasing the property or by loaning money upon it, or in any other way altering their position for the worse in reliance upon it, but it is confidently submitted that it is the very purpose and object of our statutes of amendments that such a mistake should be corrected as against all persons whatever, except those who have acted npon the faith of the record which has been made. It is difficult to distinguish this .from the ordinary case of the entry of satisfaction upon the record of the wrong mortgage or judgment, a mistake which might not be corrected as against any person who had acted on the faith of the mistaken entry, but it certainly would be corrected as against all other persons, including the judgment creditors or mortgagees who had done nothing in consequence of the mistake and would suffer nothing whatever by its correction. We are supported in this contention by a number of cases. In Close <em>v. </em>Gillespey, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Johns.%20525" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Johns. 525">3 Johns., 525</a>, a mistake which occurred by the neglect of an attorney was corrected by amending the record nunc pro tunc, although a subsequent judgment had been entered against the defendant, on which a preference was claimed. The court said:</p>
    <p id="b116-5" data-blocks='[["BL_116.4",116,[251,1590,1182,865]],["BL_117.1",117,[186,413,1178,781]]]'>“It does not appear that the debt of the contesting party had been contracted since the entry of Close’s judgment, and that therefore it could not perceive that he had any right to avail himself of the irregularity which has intervened.” In Chichester <em>v. </em>Cande, <a href="/cow/3/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Cow. 39" data-case-ids="2157969" data-case-paths="/cow/3/0039-01">3 Cow., 39</a>, no record of any judgment had been filed, but the court allowed it to be done, nunc pro tunc, and awarded the money to the plaintiff in it as against the holder of a judgment which had been regularly filed and otherwise would have been entitled to the money. In Mara <em>v. </em>Quin, 6 T. R., 8, a judgment was put two years back to prevent injustice, because it would not injure third persons. Our own courts have given a most liberal construction to our Statute of Amendments, and fully warrant the amendment in this case. In Maus <em>v. </em>Maus, <a href="/watts/5/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Watts 315" data-case-ids="1844043" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0315-01">5 Watts, 315</a>, it was held that a writ of scire facias to revive a judgment may be amended at any time so as to make it conform to the original judgment upon which it was intended to be sued out. In Rainey <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/watts/10/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="10 Watts 343" data-case-ids="1850997" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0343-01">10 Watts, 343</a>, this court decided that a clerical error or slip in the scire facias, which it says was obviously a clerical mistake in referring to a judgment not existing instead <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>of the real one meant, might be amended; and it adds that “ courts have of late years been indulgent in admitting amendments to cure the slips of officers, and more especially is it permitted among us where legal proceedings are so slowly and often negligently conducted.” In Sweeny <em>v. </em>Delany, 1 Barr, 320. this court decided that a record maybe amended by transferring the proceedings to the proper suit, when by mistake they have been filed in a suit to which they do not belong, and says that if the mistake led no one into a surprise that induced him to slip Ms time for the exorcise of a right, it gives no one a right to complain of the correction of it. The general doctrine seems therefore to be abundantly settled that amendments will be generously and liberally allowed in furtherance of the justice of the case, upon condition only that they shall do no injustice to third parties. We submit therefore that the court erred in so modifying our rule as to give Coryall a preference in lien, to which he was not entitled either in law or equity.</p>

No clerical error was made by any person having charge of the record. The prothonotary correctly followed the instructions of the praecipe. The alleged amendment did not correct any irregularity or defect in the record. There, was no inconsistency therein. Each part of the record was in entire harmony with every other part thereof. In fact there was not any mistake in the record. The mistake, if any, was wholly outside of the record. It consisted in the entire omission to take any step towards the revival of the judgment in No. 1154, December Term, 1877. The whole action to revive was taken in another judgment in another term.

This right extends to those who obtain a lien or make a purchase during the life of the prior lien, and whose rights will be impaired by the proposed restoration. Such a creditor holds a subsequent judgment within the meaning and spirit of the decisions protecting his rights against lost liens.
