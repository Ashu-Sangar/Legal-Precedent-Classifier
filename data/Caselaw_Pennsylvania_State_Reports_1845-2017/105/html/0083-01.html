It further appeared that the plaintiff’s claim in said ejectment was to this effect: John F. Perry, father of-Emma M. Perry, was in his lifetime the owner of certain valuable real estate in the city of Pittsburgh. Becoming embarrassed, he, in 1863, executed a deed, absolute on its face, conveying said real estate to his brother, Hugh Perry. Said deed was prepared by Mr. Dicken, who was also present at its execution; the only other witness, one Abraham Patterson, died shortly before the ejectment was tried. The plaintiff in said ejectment, by Dicken as her principal witness, set up that although said deed from John F. Perry to Hugh Perry was absolute on its face, it was executed, delivered and accepted upon the parol agreement and trust that Hugh Perry was to raise $15,000 bjr a mortgage on the property conveyed, with which sum John F. Perry’s debts were to be. paid, and Hugh Perry should retain the property until he should repay himself out of the rents, etc., the amount of John F. Perry’s debts which he might pay, with interest, and thereupon he, the said Hugh Perry, would re-conv?y said property to John F. Perry; that Hugh Perry, in part execution of said parol trust, raised the money by mortgage, paid said debts, and subsequently was himself fully repaid, with interest, all the sums so paid by-him to John F. Perry’s creditors; but that Hugh Perry, after the .death of John F. Peny, in 1868, repudiated said parol trust, and refused to re-convey the said real estate.</p>

In a word, if it be true that Mr. Dicken agreed for a contingent fee to conduct a case in which he was the chief witness, undoubtedly, the fact that the fee was contingent, and that unless the cause was won he received nothing for his services, makes such a contract null and void. In order to place myself squarely upon the record for whatever it maj1- be worth hereafter, and that there may be no mistake in my views, I answer this proposition as follows: I decline so to charge the jury. And I may briefly state, as well now as at-any other time, my reasons for so doing. Whatever majr have been decided elsewhere, the Supreme Court of our State, to whom I owe allegiance, and whose final decrees I always endeavor to carry out, be they what the}r may, has decided substantially that a contingent fee payable to a lawyer is not in itself illegal. That is the <em>first </em>reason why I decline so to charge.</p>

Here the lawyer, who was to obtain the contingent fee, was the chief witness in that cause, and perhaps the all-important witness in that cause. There was a time, when I should have taken a different view of this question. There was a time, and that not very long ago, when, under the rule of the old English common law, the slightest interest which a man had in a cause excluded him from being a witness in a case. So jealous was the law in that respect that even a slight liability for a mere fraction of the costs in a case would exclude the most important witness living. How, except in excepted cases when the old rule of law yet shuts a man’s mouth, any man may be a witness in his own case. If, then, the policy of the law of Pennsylvania has been so changed that a man may swear his own claim, no matter how much it may be, through the court, provided the other side is living and able to answer him, I see no moral reason why a lawyer may not sustain a case by his testimony, although he is a professional gentleman engaged in the cause. I can well imagine a case where the exigencies, of <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>the situation would imperatively demand his being a witness in order to defeat a failure of justice. But, while I say all this, I desire to guard my remarks, as far as I am able, by adding a word or two to what has already been said. Wherever a gentleman appears in a ease, and is obliged to take the stand from necessity, or whether there exists a necessity or not, the jury should scan the testimony with the most piercing penetration. They should look at all the surroundings of the case, and they should test the value of that witness’s testimony by the highest standard known to an intelligent man. There is no law in Pennsylvania which compels an attorney, the moment he testifies, to disappear from the case as an attorney; hut that is our practice, and the most proper one. While I decline to say that these contracts, if you believe they exist at all, — a question to which I shall presently refer, — are null and void, I request, nay, I demand, so far as it is proper for me so to do, that you shall scan them with the greatest possible care.”</p>

In England this suit for a contingent fee'could not be maintained. But in this state the practice has, with questionable propriety, been recognized. One of its baneful effects is that the attorney becomes a speculative partner with the plaintiff, as well as an advocate, and the temptation to overreach his own client tends to create a personal and adverse interest incompatible with the relation which should exist between attorney and client. The best writers upon professional ethics have condemned the practice and warned against its baleful influence. Sharswood’s Legal Ethics, 102; Ormerod <em>v. </em>Dearman, 4 Out., 561; Dawkins <em>v. </em>Gill, <a href="/ala/10/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Ala. 206" data-case-ids="11255936" data-case-paths="/ala/10/0206-01">10 Ala., 206</a>; Grove <em>v. </em>McCalla, 9 Harris, 44; Clippinger <em>v. </em>Hepbaugh, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 315" data-case-ids="478672" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0315-01">5 W. &amp; S., 315</a>; Filson <em>v. </em>Himes, 5 Barr., 452. But this ease is far worse than oue of a mere contingent fee. Under color of a contingent fee, it was a contingent reward for testifying as the sole essential witness in the cause. Such contracts tend to conspiracy and perjury. No liberality of decision can so override the policy of the law as to validate <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>such a bargain, made by an attorney with a young woman lately a minor, on the eve of a trial. It would make no difference that there was no corrupt motive, the principle being that any contract whose tendency, directly or indirectly, is to affect the proper administration of justice, is void and against public policy. Smith on Contracts, 141; Wharton on Contracts, § 415; Grove <em>v. </em>McCalla, 9 Harris, 44. It was not disclosed on the trial of the ejectment that he was to receive a fee as attorney, which was contingent upon his swearing the case through as a witness. The temptation to falsify was intense, and this fact should have been disclosed so that it might affect his credibility. The courts will not lend their aid to enforce such a bargain. The Act of 1869 does not remove the disqualification of immorality inherent in such a contract as this, which was in effect a bribe to bias his testimony in his own favor as well as in favor of his client. It is in vain to attempt to separate the man as witness and as attorney; this appears from his own statement of the defendant’s offer: “If you are successful we will even do better by you; <em>the ease is in your hands and we depend upon you </em>” — evidently referring to his testimony as witness, and not his services as attorney</p>

The question involved in the ejectment was, whether or not a certain deed, made in the year 1863, by John F. Perry (father of Emma M. Perry) now deceased, to Hugh Perry, for valuable real property on DuQuesne Way, in the city of Pittsburgh, was intended by the parties thereto simply as a security for money, and therefore a mortgage, or whether it was what it purported to be, an absolute deed for the premises therein, <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>described.'

Yet it is certainly true, as stated by Judge Lewis in his Abridgement of the Criminal Law, that “ Many of the most eminent and upright gentlemen of the bar have felt no repugnance to this method of compensation; it has been practiced without the slightest censure by gentlemen who have risen to the highest legislative and judicial stations in the Commonwealth, and who have been distinguished ornaments of the profession.” As those, who have rights but no means to pursue them, are obliged to resort to this means of procuring legal redress, it becomes the duty of the courts, as we have already held, to see that no improper advantage is taken either of the ignorance or necessities of those who enter into such contracts. If, then, the agreement between Emma M. Perry and J. Charles Dicken was for his professional services as an attorney, the mere fact that his only hope of reward depended upion his success would not defeat its provisions or prevent his recovery of the sum stipulated. That the plaintiff’s services were rendered in the line of his profession as an attorney, and not otherwise, is established by the verdict; the learned judge of the court below in his general charge, instructed the jury that if the plaintiff “ failed to satisfy them by sufficient evidence, either of his employment as attorney, or of the existence of a contract made with him as such,” they should find for the defendant.</p>

There is nothing in the evidence to indicate that there was any corrupt intention to influence the testimony of the witness; it was known from the commencement of the proceedings in ejectment that Dicken’s testimony would be required; he was the only person present at the execution of' the deed, and who knew the true nature and character of the transaction with the intent of the parties thereto. His testimony, however, became more important and essential by reason of the death of a witness a few days before the trial. It is immaterial here whether the amount of his compensation was only determined a short time before the trial, or at an earlier' date, if the fee was for professional services, and that was a question solely for the jury; Dicken testifies however, that the amount had been fixed before the ejectment was brought, and that he thought he had been secured to the amount of $5,000 in the contract with Weir &amp; Gibson, who were associated with him in the case.</p>

If no interest or policy of law will exclude even the parties from testifying, upon what principle can we hold that it is immoral and tends to perjury to admit the attorney to testify? We are ignorant of the fact that there is anything in the nature of the profession, or in its tendencies, which will justify any such imputation.
