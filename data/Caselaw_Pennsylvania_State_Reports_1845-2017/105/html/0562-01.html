John Kline was not without some sIioav of right to this land, that he made a boná fide claim to it; and in order to establish that allegation, a warrant is given in evidence, dated in 1824, to one Sharpless, and a survey thereon, all of Avhich (with a very small exception at one end) is Avithin the boundaries of the Branham tract, and embraces, according to Mr. West’s testimony, the coal-openings called Kline’s mines. Within a short time after (I haven’t the date of the deed), in 1832, the warrantee of the Sharpless warrant conveyed an undivided one fourth of that tract to Kline, who thus became tenant in common with the other OAvners, having whatever lights there ívefe under that Avarrant.</p>

From 1832, Kline’s occupancy and. possession, whatever they might be, did not and could not extend beyond the fixed and known boundaries of the Sharpless tract; he bound himself to them by claiming <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>under tlie Sharpless warrant.

The term was originally synonymous with “ settled ” — a settled or seated country; hence “ country seat,” “ site ” of a building, &amp;c. What is “ unseated ” land? We can say that it is the reverse of seated; but it is most unfortunate that the meaning of the word unseated, on which the titles to the most valuable lands in the Commonwealth depends, should still be uncertain. It' is a singular fact that in determining the meaning of “ unseated,” none of the cases refer to the Act of Assembly where the term was <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>first used. The Act of 3rd April, 1804, Pur. 1441, says : “All unseated lands within this Commonwealth, held by individuals, companies, or bodies corporate, either by improvement, warrant, patent or otherwise, shall for the purpose of raising county rates and levies be valued and assessed in the same manner as other property.” In the Act, lands held by improvement are denominated <em>unseated. </em>Now the legislature well knew the meaning of title by improvement. In Bixler <em>v. </em>Baker, 4 Binriey, 217, C. J. Tilghman said: “ In our Acts of Assembly and in common parlance, there is a difference between an improvement and a settlement. An improvement may be made by. clearing land, and cultivating it without residing on it. A settlement requires an actual residence.” It seems to us much, of the confusion in the decisions would have been obviated by adhering to the definition which the Act itself placed on the word, <em>unseated: </em>Bixler <em>v. </em>Baker, 4 Binney, 217; Campbell <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/watts/1/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts 503" data-case-ids="1838096" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0503-01">1 Watts, 503</a> ; Harbeson <em>v. </em>Jack, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20125" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Watts 125">2 Watts, 125</a>; Bechdle <em>v. </em>Lingle, 16 P.

The point did not arise in the case, and the language of Judge Thompson cannot-be construed as deciding that mining a few tons of coal in ithe winter, at the outcrop -of a vein, without any improvements or indication of permanent occupancy, will have the effect of seating the land. What he meant was, that such improvements and permanent occupancy as are usual and customary'in the business of mining coal and mining ore would have that effect.

It follows that the question of whether a tract of land is seated or unseated depends altogether upon what has been, or is being done upon it; upon the appearance which it may present to the eye of the assessor. As was said in one of the cases above cited, Rosenberger <em>v. </em>Schull, the assessor has nothing to do with the misapprehensions or mistakes of the occupant; it is his business to return the land as seated if he finds upon it such permanent improvements as indicate a personal responsibility for its taxes. On the other hand, if there be no such improvements he must return it as unseated. Neither is it the business of the assessor to inquire how the improver holds the property, whether by title perfect or imperfect, or by no title at all. This concerns neither him nor the public; for the question is but how the taxes shall be collected: if seated, then from some person; but if unseated, from the land itself. But if there has not been enough done upon the premises to seat them, we cannot see how the matter can be helped out by the introduction of somebody’s title, whether colorable or substantial.</p>
    <p id="b585-8" data-blocks='[["BL_585.8",585,[200,1704,1166,331]]]'>We can understand, as was said in this very case, when in this court before, 6 Norris, 302, on the authority of the Lackawanna Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Fales, 5 P.

There was, therefore, from the beginning of this case, no want of color of title in Kline; his claim as an improver was just as good as that under the worthless Sharp less warrant. Color of title in itself is nothing; it merely marks the integrity of a man’s claim, and the improvement in this case was just as good as an indication of the honesty of <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>Kline’s intention as was the warrant. Wé are therefore at a loss to know why it was thought that this question of colorable title was not in the ease when here before. But however Kline claimed, be his title good or bad, actual or fictitious, it helps not «the subject in hand; it does not seat, nor help to seat, the tract in controversy. The question we have to deal with is, after all, one of fact and not of intention. From and after the time this man first built his cabin and commenced the taking out of coal, had he continued his improvement, or had he even maintained a permanent and continuous occupancy, he might have succeeded in seating the premises which lie claimed, but it is a sure thing that if his first operation did not fix that character upon the property, and we have decided that it did not, nothing he subsequently did had that effect. His first cabin, never used for anything but a temporary shelter for those who occasionally took out coal, was abandoned and finally disappeared altogether, and the building at the second opening was a mere shanty, as an improvement, of no value whatever. True, he took coal from the land, but how did this seat it ? There were no fixtures of a valuable character in or about the mine; nothing that would indicate that the mining, rude as it was, was carried on as a regular and continuous business. In fine, adopting the rule of Watson <em>v. </em>Davidson, 6 Norris, 2T0, the occupancy of Kline was not of such a character as to be visible and known to every one whose business it was to see and know it. In fact, no one could, from the mere appearance of things, tell whether coal had been taken from the property by one claiming to own it, or only by an occasional trespasser.</p>
