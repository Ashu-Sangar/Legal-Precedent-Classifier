Intention is required for the purpose of limiting the sense of that word and restraining it to “ children.” The defendants, however, insist that in its popular sense it is used to mean “ children,” citing in support of this view Wells <em>v. </em>Ritter, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%20208" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Whart. 208">3 Wharton, 208</a>; Ralph <em>v. </em>Carrick, L.

R. 9 Q. B. Div., 643, where the w ,rd issue was construed to mean children. But in each of these cases, as in every instance in which a will is to be interpreted, the entire contents of the instrument wore considered together, and the particular portions of the will upon which controversy hinged were construed in the light of and in connection with every other portion of the testamentary paper. At the same time the established principles of interpretation of last wills were kept steadily in view, and to which fpll effect was given. In no other way can the intentions of a testator be ascertained and carried out, and the law in its application to last wills and testaments be maintained.</p>

The endeavor was, as it always should be, to ascertain the intention of the testator ; and in the most recent of them, Morgans. Thomas, 9 Q. B. Div., 643, Jessel, Master of the Eolls, decided that the word “ issue,” as used by the testator, meant children. The testator devised land to his eldest son, L., “for life, and after his decease to his lawful issue, and their heirs forever, if any,” and “ if he should die without <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>leaving <em>any children </em>born in wedlock,” then to testator’s son, E., and his heirs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b224-5" data-blocks='[["BL_224.4",224,[235,509,1187,1027]]]'>In his search after the meaning of the testator the Master of the Eolls says: “ We must see what he means by 4 lawful issue,’ and what he means by 4 children.’.....The word children has, both in law and in common parlance, only one meaning, though you may by a-context show it is improperly used; that it is written by mistake for descendants or something else. But the word 4 issue ’ Kas two meanings — it may mean 4 descendants,’ and it may mean 4 children; ’ the common use of the word in ordinary parlance being ‘children,’ though in legal parlance its proper meaning is 4 descendants.’ You require a context of a different character to show that the testator has made a mistake in writing one word for another, from what you do when you wish to ascertain which of two meanings that the word properly bears is to be affixed to it. Looking at it in this way, it appears to me that in this case we must read 4 issue ’ as meaning 4 children.’ ” The last clause of the paragraph “if he should die without leaving <em>any children,''' </em>shows most plainly what the testator intended by the preceding words “lawful issue.” Having given the estate after the termination of the life estate to the son L., and to L.’s lawful issue, he then provides that if he should die without leaving children born in wedlock, then to another son and his heirs, shows that lawful issue could have no other meaning than <em>children </em>of L. born in wedlock.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b224-7" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[236,1545,1181,689]]]'>•So also in Bryan <em>v. </em>Mansion 5 De Gex &amp; Smale 737, the bequest was for life to a niece, witb remainder to her “issue ” and a subsequent direction to pay the same amongst her children, with a provision for maintenance for children during minority; it was held that issue meant children. It was abundantly clear that the words issue and children were used interchangeably to indicate who were to take the property on the happening of the contingencies upon which it was to vest. The intention was not doubtful, and the will was interpreted accordingly. So, also, it may be said of the remaining cases cited by the defendants under this head of their argument. The intention of the testator, as gathered from a consideration of the entire will, controlled in the interpretation of each one of them, recognizing also the full force of the principles which in England have been held to apply to the words issue and children, when used in a testamentary instrument.</p>

The decision of both Lord Eldon and the House of Lords was based mainly on the effect of the word “lineal,” but other considerations were allowed to weigh in reaching the conclusion as to the true interpretation of the will. It was considered important that there was a provision in the instrument for the use of the name Thelluson by the heirs, and that there was a supposed general intent to exclude the female line. Ahjxander, O. B., in assigning reasons for the affirmance of the opinion of Lord Eldon, says : “ The word lineal was introduced, as it appears to us, in order to intimate the testator’s desire, that the person to nominate should be the male descendant of a son in the male line.</p>

In the case of Beckam <em>v. </em>De Saussure, 9 South Carolina Rep., 546, it is thus stated: “ The word issue when used as a word of limitation is equivalent to heirs of the body, and issue male, like heirs male of the body, define an estate which, according to the rules of inheritance, can descend only to males, whose descent from the proposed ancestor has been wholly through males.

But this, it seems to us, begs the question, and satisfies the contention of the defendants only on their showing, by that which appears in the will, by what the testator has himself said, that he intended the words male issue as words of limitation to the sons of Richard. Failing to show this, the conclusion follows that he intended male descendants generally, and not that he intended to limit the inheritance to Richard’s sons, as he has not in any way indicated an intention to restrict #tlie usual and ordinary signification of the words “ male issue,” the meaning which the law in such cases attaches to them is decisive of the question.

The. testator adopted his son Richard as the male source., though he was then unmarried; he contemplated that the precedent life estates might extend to the period of Richard's having children, but not to a period of indefinite multiplication, and attenuation in subsequent generations.</p>

If, however, the technical meaning of “issue ” be applied to this will,'we must also adopt the technical meaning of “ male issue,” viz.,-male descendants tracing through males, a continuous stream of males, bearing the ancestor’s name, unbroken by intermediate females.

He would doubtless-.have been surprised had he been told that his son Richard, if he had no sons, but daughters only, might nevertheless have “ male issue.” The words “ male issue ” are most frequently used as words of limitation, but there is no reason why a different meaning should be given to them when used as words of purchase : Oddie <em>v. </em>Woodford, 3 My. &amp; Cr., 584; Bernal <em>v. </em>Bernal, 3 <a href="/pa/74/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="74 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="1034700" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0414-01">Id., 559</a>; Thelluson <em>v. </em>Rendelsham, 7 House of Lords cases, 428; Lywood <em>v. </em>Kimber, 29 Beav., 38; Hawkins on Wills, 171, 172; Theobald on Wills (ed. 1876), 271. <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>Jarman, indeed, wlio wrote in 1843, attempted, without authority, to draw a distinction between the words, “ issue male” as words of limitation and as words of purchase, and his statement afterwards led the majority of the court into error in the South Carolina ease, Beckam <em>v. </em>Do Saussure, cited by defendants in error. But Hawkins, who wrote in 1863, after the meaning of the words had become well established, expressly states that when used as words of purchase they mean exactly the same as when used as words of limitation, and Theobald, who wrote in 1876, also finds it concluded by authority that “ the heir male taking <em>ly purchase </em>must claim through males.”</p>

If the word “ issue ” in such devise be preceded or followed by the word “ male ” the only effect is to exclude lineal descendants who are females : Beckam <em>v. </em>De Saussure, 9 S. C. Rep., 546. Under the devise hero, if Richard or William Lewis Wistar had had a son or sons living at the vesting of the remainder, their sons would answer equally with them the description of the class, and would participate with them in the gift. The fact that the defendants in error are sons of a daughter of testator’s son Richard does not exclude them from the class of male issue of Richard, under a direct devise to such class as purchasers. The arguments and authorities based upon the construction of the terms “issue” or “.male issue ” when used as words of limitation have no application to this case; nor are those cases applicable in which those terms, used as words of purchase to designate a class of devisees, have been qualified by a particular intent discerned in the context of the will.

On the other hand, the plaintiffs in error contend that the words mean children, male children, and not <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>male descendants generally of Richard, or that they mean male issue of Richard, tracing their descent through males only.</p>
    <p id="b233-6" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[213,541,1164,1549]]]'>As has been clearly shown, in the opinion referred to, the word issue, in legal parlance, means lineal descendants, irrespective of their being of the same generation. In our several Acts of Assembly regulating the descent and distribution of real and personal estate of intestates, the words “ issue ” and “lawful issue” have always been employed as synonymous with lineal descendants, including not only the first, but more remote generations as well. So also in a class of eases to which Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Barnitz, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20449" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="9 Watts 449">9 Watts, 449</a>, belongs, where devises, in terms broad enough to pass a fee simple, are reduced to a fee tail by a subsequent provision limiting the estate to another in the event of the first taker dying “ without issue,” or “ without leaving issue,” etc., the word issue, as a general rule, is never hold to mean children, but lineal descendants generally ; and being tiras a limitation over upon an indefinite failure of issue or lineal descendants, such devises have always been construed to create an estate tail. When, as in the present ease, the word is manifestly used as descriptive of the devisees, and is also restricted to such issue as shall be living at a specified time, it is always construed as a word of. purchase, embracing all lineal descendants of the person named, in being at the time so specified, unless it clearly appears from the context that the testator intended otherwise. This principle of construction appears to be fully sustained by the authorities, among which are the following: Haydon <em>v. </em>Wilshere, 3 T. R., 372; Hockley <em>v. </em>Mawbey, 1 Ves. Jr., 150; Freeman <em>v. </em>Parsley, 3 Ves., 421; Leigh <em>v. </em>Norbury, 13 Ves., 340; Wythe <em>v. </em>Thurlston, Ambler, 555; Davenport <em>v. </em>Hanbury, 3 Ves., 257; Hawkins on Wills, 187, 188; Cook <em>v. </em>Cook, 2 Vern., 545; Bradshaw <em>v. </em>Melling, 19 Beav., 417; Ross <em>v. </em>Ross, 20 Id., 645; Miller’s Appeal, 2 P. F. Smith, 113; Coyle’s Appeal, 2 Norris, 242. In Leigh <em>v. </em>Norbury, <em>supra, </em>the Court said: “ It is clearly settled that the word £ issue,’ uneonfined by any indication of contrary intention, includes all descendants. Intention is required for the purpose of limiting the sense of that word and restraining it to children.”</p>
    <p id="b233-7" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[213,2089,1162,346]],["BL_234.1",234,[248,421,1182,1158]]]'>Several classes of cases, in which it has been decided that such intention was sufficiently indicated, are exceptions to the general rule, depending on the peculiar features of each case. One of them is where a precedent estate or interest was given to the parent of the children who were held to be intended by the word issue. In such cases the devise to his issue lias been likened to a legal succession in right of the parent. Bradshaw <em>v. </em>Melling, <em>supra, </em>and Robinson <em>v. </em>Sykes, 23 Beav., 40, are <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>illustrations of this class. In the latter ease the Master of the Rolls said: “ I am of opinion that though the word 6 issue ’ is <em>nomen </em>generalissimum, and includes all the remotest descendants, that nevertheless, where issue are pointed out as persons to take with reference to the share of the parent, a gift, which so far as regards the parent fails, they take on the principle which may be called a quasi representative principle ; that is, the children of each parent, whose share fails, take that parent’s share, but not admitting the grandchildren to take in competition with children.” Whenever it is apparent, from a consideration of the whole will, that the testator intended to restrict the gift to children it will be so construed. In the case before us there is not the slightest indication of such intention. Testator’s son Richard, whose name is used merely as descriptive of those to whom the estate in remainder was given, had no interest under his father’s will, or otherwise, in the land in controversy. The devisees did not take through or under him; but, as a defined class, they took as purchasers by direct gift from the testator. There is nothing in the phraseology of the will to indicate an intention to restrict the words “ male issue ” to the sons of Richard, or to his male issue, tracing their descent through males only. If the word “male” had been,omitted, it would scarcely be claimed that all the lineal descendants of Richard, both male and female, in being at the time designated, would not have been included in the description. The only effect of that word is to exclude fémale lineal descendants.</p>
