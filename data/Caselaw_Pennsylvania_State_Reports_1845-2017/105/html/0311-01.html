Under the Act of 31st March, 1856, the mode of assessment and classification remained the same, as under the Act of 1849, but the rates of licenses were increased, and it was provided that such license should not authorize sales of less than five gallons, except malt ’ and brewed liquors, which might be bottled and delivered in quantities not less than one dozen bottles. The Act of 20th April, 1858, after making some modifications in the rates, provides that brewers' and distillers may thereafter sell any <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>liquors, which they have been licensed to manufacture and sell, in any quantity not less than one gallon.</p>

He concedes that he must manufacture and sell within the county, and that he cannot sell at more than one point in the county, but he contends that the place of sale may be in the same or a different municipal division of the county, as he may choose; that there is nothing in the law which necessarily restricts the place of sale to the place of manufacture, if both be conducted within the county in which he has the license to operate.</p>

He is appraised, taxed, and licensed in the same manner as a vender of merchandise, upon the return of the mercantile appraiser, and the license thus obtained secures the privilege, not only to manufacture, but to sell the product; there is no requirement expressed in the statute that this sale shall be conducted at the precise place of manufacture. The applicant for a distiller’s license is not required, as a licensed retailer is, in an application to set forth the particular place in which his business is proposed to be conducted, or to designate the building with its adaptations to the particular purposes of the license. The business, like 'that of a vender of merchandise, is open to all who may choose to engage in it, upon compliance with the law. There is nothing expressed in the statute, or in the <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>form of license prescribed by law, or in the form of procedure to obtain it, which restricts the business to any particular place, or to any sub-division of the county.</p>

Rev. Stat. U. S., § 3288. The place of manufacture cannot, therefore, in the nature of the case, be the place of sale. If the liquor which the defendant was licensed to manufacture and sell, must necessarily be manufactured in one place, and under existing laws sold in a different place, how can it be seriously contended that the place of sale is to be determined by, or limited to, the place of manufacture ? It may be anywhere else in the countjq but it cannot be there.</p>
