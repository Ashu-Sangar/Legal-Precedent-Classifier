The bill further charges that the respondents claim, and threaten to enter upon and possess, a small part of the Calvin Washburn lot, a narrow strip along the western side, including a portion of the complainants’ buildings erected thereon; that the complainants are, and have been, in full possession of the alley, and also of the disputed strip of ground, and that the respondents have neither right nor title to either. Wherefore, to prevent a multiplicity of actions at law, for the redress of these repeated and threatened wrongs and trespasses, the prayer of the bill is for a perpetual injunction to restrain the respondents from using the alley, and from taking possession of the said strip of ground.</p>
    <p id="b500-5" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[268,969,1177,301]]]'>A demurrer to the bill was overruled and an answer was filed, in which the respondents claim the right to use the alley, deny any wrongful act, and allege that their claim is based on a just and legal title; that they are justly and legally entitled to the strip of land, referred to in the bill, and deny that the complainants are, or have been, in the possession of the disputed premises.</p>

Where rights which are legal are asserted on one side, and denied on the other, the remedies are at law. They cannot be settled under equity forms; this is .undoubtedly the general rule. In actions respecting real property, therefore, if there be no equitable ground of relief involved, the rights of the parties must be determined at law; when thus determined, or when they are admitted in the pleadings, or otherwise clearly appear, an equity rbased upon that right, superinduced by the acts of the parties, may be asserted, and a decree for equitable relief made; thus equity is made the means, not of establishing the legal right, but of giving adequate protection in the enjoyment of it when thus established. No irreparable injury has been shown, and it does not yet appear that a multiplicity of suits must result under proceedings-at law; all parties in interest may be put upon the record in a single suit, and non constat that the trial and determination of that suit may not end the controversy; the right to equitable relief may follow, if any equity is superinduced by the acts of the parties, but the interference of equity in such a case rests, as stated by Chan.

It is not enough that he is able to produce some evidence of his right, where there is conflicting evidence that goes to the denial of all right. When the emergency is pressing, and the injunction affidavits disclose a prima facie right in the plaintiff, the proper practice I apprehend is for the court to interfere by special injunction, and stay the defendant’s hand until the right has been tried at law.” Even in cases confessedly within the jurisdiction, as partition, equity will not interfere if the complainant’s title be denied, until he has'vindicated it at law; the court may retain the bill, however, until that has been done: 2 Atk., 280; Coxe <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 Johns.

In none of them did the dispute involve the ascertainment and determination between the contesting parties of their rights at law; the right of the complainant, in each of the cases, was either admitted or otherwise clearly and incontestably established, and in all of them proper grounds were assigned for equitable relief.
