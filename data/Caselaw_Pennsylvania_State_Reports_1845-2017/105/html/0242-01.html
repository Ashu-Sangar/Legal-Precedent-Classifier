John A. Selser, a member of the plaintiff firm, showed him a lot of one hundred or more boxes of such peaches, and offered to open them for his in<a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>speetion. Mr. Roberts testified that he asked Selser to give him a sample of these goods; that an opportunity was offered him to ihspect the contents of all the boxes, but as such examination would have taken several hours, he declined to do so: that he examined the contents of three or four boxes, and found them to be sound and undamaged peaches of the kind desired. He expressed his satisfaction with their quality and purchased a hundred boxes for $750, which his firm subsequently paid. After their delivery, some forty-seven boxes proved mouldy and unsound. To determine the condition of the fruit, the parties chose arbitrators, who duly found that the contents of these forty-seven boxes were “unmerchantable.” It was further agreed by the parties that the defendants should sell the goods and charge the loss, if any, to loss account, the issue to await the result of a somewhat similar dispute between the defendants and M. Semple &amp; Co. If this latter case was decided in favor of Semple &amp; Co., then it was agreed that Roberts &amp; Co. should have no claim on Selser &amp; Bro., bnt if it was decided in favor of Roberts <em>&amp; </em>Co., then Selser &amp; Bro. agreed to pay Roberts <em>&amp; </em>Co. the amount of the loss, if any, sustained on the re-sale of the ¡oeaches. It was in evidence that the case between Roberts &amp; Co. and Semple &amp; Co. was undecided. The defendants sold the goods at a loss of $212, which sum, with interest, is the set-off claimed.</p>

[The law in regard to sale by sample, I mean the law in Pennsylvania, is this: If you buy by sample, the seller is not responsible for the goods; they need not correspond with the sample except in kind, but the goods must be merchantable as that kind. By merchantable as that kind is meant that the goods may be of a quality very inferior to the sample, but they must be sound goods; they must not be damaged or spoiled, and must be fit for the use for which they are generally intended. To illustrate: if you sold one hundred barrels of apples by one as a sample, you would be responsible as to kind, but not as to quality; the other ninety-nine might be of a kind very inferior to the sample, but if they were sound apples you would not be responsible. But if they were rotten or spoiled they would still be salable; <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>they might he fit for hog feed, but that is not what is meant by merchantable, and you would be responsible.

They must be merchantable under the denomination affixed to them by the seller. If you believe that, you will allow defendants their claim of set-off.] If, on the other hand, you believe that these goods were sold by inspection, and that the defendants got the identical goods sold, you will reject their claim of set-off.”</p>

The (defendants admit this claim to be correct, but interpose a set-off amounting to $212, with interest. This set-off arises out of a distinct transaction. The plaintiffs, and also the defendants, are dealers in fruits in the city of Philadelphia. On the 22d October, 1880, the defendants purchased of the plaintiffs, at thirty days’ credit, 100 boxes of unpared evaporated peaches, 5000 lbs., at 15 cents per lb., amounting to $750, and, at the expiration of the thirty days’ credit, paid the price stipulated. From sixty to ninety days after the purchase forty-seven boxes proved to be mouldy and damaged. The condition of this portion of the fruit having been submitted to arbitration, it was determined to be then <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>unmarketable.

    <p id="b263-5" data-blocks='[["BL_263.5",263,[205,692,1168,1113]]]'>The court, however, submitted to the jury, as a question of fact, whether the sale was by inspection or by sample. In this, wo think, there was error. There was no evidence to justify such a submission. If the testimony of the contracting parties is believed, the sale was certainly by inspection. It cannot he doubted that the intent of the parties, in such case, is in general a question for the jury; hut there is no evidence here of a sale by sample, nothing which could justify a jury in so finding. The goods, in bulk, were on band, and were exhibited to the buyer; their condition and quality were, it is admitted, readily ascertainable by inspection, and a full opportunity to that end was afforded. Mr. Selser offered to open, and did open and show, as many boxes as the vendee wished to see, and Mr. Roberts examined all that were opened. The buyer bought upon his own judgment; no representation as to quality or condition was made, no fraud is alleged, no warranty is shown. The parties were dealers only, not manufacturers or producers, no confidential relation existed between them, and the vendor’s means of knowledge were no greater than those of the vendee. It is true that three or four boxes only were opened, and these were examined as a specimen of the whole ; but they were all thrown open to inspection, and the buyer, after an examination of a-part, declared himself satisfied, and made the purchase. If it was inconvenient to examine all, the buyer, if still unsatisfied, should have protected himself by a warranty.</p>

If the bulk is thrown open to inspection, the buyer is considered to have inspected the bulk, and. not to have relied upon that only which is exposed to view as a sample. The intention of the parties in such case is to sell by inspection, not by sample.</p>

It is certainly settled, in a long line of cases in Pennsylvania, that a sale of chattels by the production of a sample, without fraud or other circumstance fixing the character of the sample as a standard of quality, does not imply any warranty of quality. Differ as we may as to the policy or propriety of such a principle, we cannot deny that it is now recognized as the settled law of this State.

    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[256,1126,1182,1328]],["BL_265.1",265,[207,425,1162,218]]]'>The court very properly instructed the jury thus: “ The law in regard to sale by sample — I mean the law in Pennsylvania — is this: If you buy by sample the seller is not responsible for the goods; they need not correspond with the sample, except in kind; but the goods must be merchantable as that kind.” Thus far' the charge is clearly right, but in what follows it was as clearly wrong. The court, apparently by way of explanation, proceeds: “By merchantable, as that kind is meant that the goods may be of a quality very inferior to the sample, but they must be sound goods; they must not be damaged or spoiled, and must be fit for the use for which they are generally intended.” We agree that in a sale of goods by sample, in Pennsylvania, they must correspond with the sample in kind, and must be merchantable as that kind; but there is no implied warranty that they are “sound goods,” “not damaged or spoiled.” When goods have become unsaleable or unmerchantable they have ceased to be of the kind they originally were. A barrel of sound apples and a barrel of rotten apples are articles entirely different in kind, and the same may be said of a box of sound unpared evaporated peaches, and one so mouldy and decayed as to be unmerchantable as such. There is no warranty implied as to the different grades of quality so long as the identity of the goods in kind remains. To hold that a sale by sample, without more, imports a sale of sound goods not damaged or spoiled, would in some cases give the bulk a higher standard of excellence, in. quality or condition, than the sample itself. The degree of unsoundness which will support an assumpsit upon an implied warranty, must be such as destroys the merchantable character of the commodity sold, and converts it into an article substantially different in kind from that which <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>was sold. We apprehend that this was the instruction which the court intended to give, as the methods of illustration employed sustain this view; but the charge, as expressed, is susceptible of a very different construction, and is misleading in its tendency.</p>
