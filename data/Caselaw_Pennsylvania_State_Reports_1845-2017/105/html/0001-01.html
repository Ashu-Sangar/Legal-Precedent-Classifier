The first floor, similarly divided, was used generally as sitting-room, eating-room, store-room, kitchen, smoking-room, &amp;c. On the evening of February 2d, 1883, the Italians, including the prisoner and the deceased, were gathered in the sitting-room or front room. Between eight and nine o’clock they at different times went up stairs and went to bed, the deceased being among the first to do so.

At about half-past ten o’clock, when all the lights were out, the occupants of both rooms were aroused by the cry from the deceased: “ Stoppa, Jimmie! Stoppa, Jimmie! What’s the matter with you?” Then followed groaning and lamentation from the deceased. No outcry was made by the prisoner, nor had he been heard to enter the upper room. Immediately upon the outcry one of the Italians went out to a neighbor’s for a lamp, after which he went for their boss and sent for a doctor. After the outcry the deceased started from his bed, and after staggering a few steps, fell at the foot of the bed of anotherlof the Italians, and lay there for some minutes, groaning, praying, and bleeding from eleven incised wounds. When the light came the deceased was found lying on the bed to which he had staggered. He had on his undershirt and his drawers, in which garments he had gone to bed — they were full of blood and cuts. The prisoner’s hatchet, covered both as to metal and handle with blood, was found in the room of the deceased near the door. Ho other weapon of any kind whatever was found in the room after the assault. The bed of the deceased was broken down, the trestle at the foot of the bed was also broken, and lay under the wreck. The blanket was very bloody, and was cut in six, seven or more places. The sheet was cut in the same way as the blanket, and both the sheet and the blanket were bloody in the location of the cuts. When the light was brought the prisoner was not there, and his ordinary clothing had disappeared also. The outer door was wide open.</p>

While the prisoner was not directly in jeopardy, yet if the verdict were in his favor he could not be tried upon the indictment. It was of vital importance that he should be tried by his right name, or his life may be twice put in jeopardy for the same offence, and the policy of the law that the jury shall be kept secluded applies with equal force to this case as to the trial upon the indictment itself. But, however this may be, it was clear error to permit the jury to separate after the conclusion of the testimony on the main issue, and before verdict. The danger to the prisoner was aggravated by their listening to an inflammatory sermon exhorting juries to greater severity in the conviction of criminals accused of murder, and depicting in vivid language the terrible results of failure of justice in such cases. It is impossible to say that the jurors were not thereby improperly influenced to convict. That they might have been so influenced is sufficient reason for reversal of the judgment. If such language hacl been used to the five jurors in a street conversation, at that time, is there any doubt that the court would have discharged the jury, or have set aside the verdict ? The solemnity of the actual circumstances but adds to the force of our argument. It was, moreover, matter of common notoriety that but recently in the same county, a man accused of murder had been lynched by hanging by mob violence. The rule that juries in criminal cases shall be kept together in seclusion is well established in this state. Peiffer <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 3 Harris, 468. The refusal of the court below to grant a new trial for ordinary causes (as <em>e. g., </em>that the verdict is against the weight of'the evidence) is not subject to review, but we contend that when the reason assigned is misconduct of the jury, the case is, from necessity, an exception. Otherwise, no matter how flagrant be such misconduct, if the court below misconstrues the law, the defendant has no redress. In such case the action of the court is an abuse of discretion, which is always reviewable. Whelchell <em>v. </em>State, <a href="/ind/23/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="23 Ind. 89" data-case-ids="1472506" data-case-paths="/ind/23/0089-01">23 Ind., 89</a>; Jack <em>v. </em>State, 26 Texas, 1.

Up to that point the Court may postpone the trial as lawfully at one stage of the proceedings as another. A man is not in peril from the verdict of a jury till the full number are qualified to hearken unto the evidence and make deliverance. Eleven jurors, or eight, can give no verdict. McFadden <em>v. </em>Com., <a href="/pa/23/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="23 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="974071" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0012-01">23 Pa. St., 12</a>. The practice as to the time of administering the oath to the jurors is not uniform; in some districts each juror is separately sworn as called and unchallenged, and in others none are sworn until all are selected. In either case the tribunal is unorganized while there are less than twelve, and until it is organized, for good cause the Court may direct the drawing of the jurors to begin anew.</p>

An offer was made to follow this with evidence that the deceased had committed divers crimes, involving a ferocious and cruel disposition on his part, and that before he was killed the defendant had knowledge of said offences. No precedent has been cited for the proof of such <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>acts by the deceased in bis lifetime, nor does there seem to be reason for their investigation where they are not in issue. Conceding that the defendant had proved that he was attacked by -the deceased, then it was competent to prove his bloodthirsty character, his bodily strength, how he was armed, the manner of the assault and all other circumstances tending to show that the attack was felonious, or that it was believed to be felonious by the defendant. But it is settled that specific criminal acts at other times, affecting other people than the slayer, which may have given the deceased his bad character, are incompetent. Were evidence of such acts competent, so would be repelling evidence, and the side issues would become as numerous as the offences charged against the deceased. The offer to prove “ a series of five specific acts of violence known to the defendant,” meant an investigation of each act as plainly as did the separate offers to prove each.</p>
    <p id="b28-4" data-blocks='[["BL_28.4",28,[228,1111,1184,345]]]'>The Commonwealth gave evidence of the defendant’s declarations made in the office of Justice Hower. For the purpose of explaining these the defendant proposed to prove his declarations, made more than an hour afterwards, and a mile and a half distant from Hower’s office. Instead of showing that his offer was part of a continuous conversation began at the office of Justice Hower, the evidence shows the contrary. Its rejection was clearly right.</p>
    <p id="b28-5" data-blocks='[["BL_28.5",28,[227,1456,1186,303]]]'>The nineteenth assignment of error is to the following portion of the charge: “ Where the defendant sets up the plea of self-defence to an indictment of murder, he must satisfy you of the truth of the plea by the preponderance of testimony. If he failed to do so in this case, then he is guilty of murder in the first or of the second degree, or of voluntary manslaughter, as you find the facts may warrant.”</p>
    <p id="b28-6" data-blocks='[["BL_28.6",28,[225,1761,1186,648]],["BL_29.1",29,[165,425,1176,85]]]'>This, if exceptionable by itself, with the context is free of error. In the instructions every point put by the defendant’s counsel was affirmed, and the facts submitted with fairness to him. The jury were told, “ If the facts, as proven will support any reasonable theory consistent with the defendant’s innocence, then the defendant must be acquitted.” Also, “ If the Commonwealth has satisfied you that the defendant inflicted the wounds on the body of the deceased, and that he died from said wounds, then your next inquiry will be whether the Commonweath has satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of murder, and if so, of what degree, or of voluntary manslaughter.” Then the jury understood from the remark objected to, that if the defendant killed the deceased, and the killing was not in self-defence, he was guilty either of murder 'or voluntary man<a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>slaughter. The evidence admits of no other conclusion; or, really, there was no evidence that the killing was involuntary.</p>
    <p id="b29-6" data-blocks='[["BL_29.4",29,[164,512,1181,866]]]'>Tinder the last assignment it was argued that there was not evidence of the existence of the ingredients necessary to constitute murder in the first degree. The evidence is too strong for doubt, that the deceased at tlie moment of the assault was in liis own bed, and all the other occupants of the room were in theirs, except the defendant; that none heard the defendant come into the room, and it was dark; that with his own hatchet he inflicted the numerous wounds upon the head and upper part of the body of the deceased ; that the defendant ivas not heard to make outcry, and received no injury unless a slight cut on the hand, which healed within a few days; and that the deceased cried, “ Stoppa, Jimmie ! Stoppa, Jimmie ! What is the matter with you ? ” and he was unarmed. The legitimate inference, we think, is not weakened, but strengthened, by other facts in evidence. When a man quietly approaches another’s bed in tlie night, and makes a furious assault with a deadly weapon, it is presumed that he intends the natural consequences of his act. If the jury believed the testimony they rightly found that the killing was wilful, deliberate and premeditated.</p>
    <p id="b29-7" data-blocks='[["BL_29.5",29,[166,1379,1180,293]]]'>The assignment that tlie Court erred in refusing to arrest judgment was not pressed, for the obvious reason that no ground for the arrest appears of record. But it was urged that tlie Court erred in denying the motion for a new trial because tlie jury- were allowed to separate and part of them, attending church, heard a sermon on the text, “ Thou shalt not kill.”</p>
    <p id="b29-8" data-blocks='[["BL_29.6",29,[170,1683,1180,777]],["BL_30.1",30,[269,431,1187,637]]]'>At common law the refusal to grant a motion for new trial being a matter of discretion, is no ground, for a writ of error. The Act of May 19,1874, provides that on tlie trial of all cases exclusively triable in the Courts of Oyer and Terminer, 41 exceptions to any decision of the Court may be made by tlie defendant, and a bill thereof shall be sealed in the same manner as is provided and practiced in civil cases; and the accused after conviction and sentence, may remove the indictment, record and all proceedings to the Supreme Court.” It is contended that as any decision of the Court may be excepted to, and all proceedings may be removed, the refusal to grant a new trial may be reviewed. Previously it had been enacted that in all cases of imirder in the first degree removed to the Supreme Court, the judges shall review both the law and the evidence, and determine whether the ingredients necessary to constitute murder in the first degree were proved to exist; the Act of 1874 enables this to be done by providing for the removal of all proceedings. But it was not the intendment <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>that decisions which have always rested in the sole discretion of the Court where the cause was tried, should be made subject to exception and review. If this were so the accused could except to the refusal of his motion to postpone the trial, or to the granting of a motion by the Commonwealth for continuance, or to the refusal of his apjclication for attachment for an absent witness, and the like, as well as to the refusal of his motion for new trial. The decisions subject to exception within the purview of the statute are similar to such as were so subject on the trial of a civil cause, as the admission or rejection of testimony and instructions to the jury. This is plainly expressed in the statute, and like plainness is requisite to overcome the rule at common law that decisions of matters within the discretion of the Court are not subject to writ of error.</p>
    <p id="b30-5" data-blocks='[["BL_30.4",30,[267,1079,1187,604]]]'>In this case we think there is little reason for regret that the refusal of a new trial is final. On its trial every doubtful question was solved in favor of the defendant. His claim that he struck in self-defence was submitted with fair instructions, although the evidence thereof was slight, if any at all. The learned judge recognized that, u It is undoubtedly the law of this State that on trials for homicide, jurors ought not to be permitted to separate while thé prisoner is in their charge ; ” and he believed this rule had been complied with, at least in its spirit. Upon careful consideration he concluded that the sermon (not a fragment of it) neither had nor tended to have the effect of biasing the minds of the jurors or of disqualifying them for the proper exercise of their functions; and in this view he was likely correct.</p>
    <p id="b30-6" data-blocks='[["BL_30.5",30,[266,1684,1184,595]]]'>There is a growing laxity in the observance of the rule which, if unchecked by the Courts of Oyer and Terminer, may induce legislation either abrogating the rule itself, or providing a remedy when it shall not have been enforced. It seems to us that compliance with the rule ought to be so strict that no plausible charge could be made that the jury were not kept free from every improper communication or intrusion. Increasing the number of subjects for review in homicide cases is detrimental to the public, and departure from old and familiar rules strongly tends to promote such increase. There was much appearance of departure in this case from an undoubted rule, and it is not strange- that the' learned and able counsel for the defendant have sougljf, for that cause, to obtain another trial.</p>
