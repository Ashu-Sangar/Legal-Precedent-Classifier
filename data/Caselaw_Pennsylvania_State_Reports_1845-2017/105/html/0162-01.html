    <p id="b186-6" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[243,1154,1176,171]]]'>It was ruled in Diamond <em>v. </em>Lawrence County, <a href="/wright/1/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Wright 353" data-case-ids="625811" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0360-01">1 Wright, 353</a>, that a coupon bond of the county, under seal, should hot be treated as negotiable paper, although it was there conceded that all the courts, American and English, held otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b186-7" data-blocks='[["BL_186.6",186,[235,1326,1186,688]]]'>County of Beaver <em>v. </em>Armstrong, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%2063" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="8 Wright 63">8 Wright, 63</a>, contains a very full reference to the authorities showing that corporation bonds under seal, payable to bearer in money, were negotiable. In the opinion of the court by Mr. Justice Read, it is said: “It is clear then, upon reason'and authority, that the coupons which form the subject matter of this suit, and the bonds to which they were attached, having been regularly issued by the county of Beaver, are on the footing of negotiable paper, and pass from hand to hand by delivery as the representatives of money. They may circulate-together or separatelj'-, and suits on -the coupons are sustained entirely independently of the bonds, to which they were originally annexed. It is therefore of very little consequence whether they áre promissory notes,' bills, drafts or checks, for they have the same qualit}*- of negotiability as either of those instruments, and the-holder sues upon them and recovers in his own-name.”</p>
    <p id="b186-8" data-blocks='[["BL_186.7",186,[235,2013,1176,173]]]'>In Bunting’s Adm’rs <em>v. </em>Camden &amp; Atlantic R. R. Co., 81 P. F. Smith, 254, the case of Carr <em>v. </em>LeFevre, supra, is cited approvingly, and it is held that corporation bonds payable to bearer may be sued in the name of the holder.</p>

In the opinion of the court by Mr. Justice Sterrett, he says: “Being negotiable securities, every transfer- of the bonds to a new holder, for <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>value and without notice, would give the latter a good title to them as against the former holder. That such is the status of coupon bonds similar to those in question, is too well settled by recent decisions to admit of doubt,” citing County of Beaver <em>v. </em>Armstrong, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%2063" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="8 Wright 63">supra,</a> and other cases. He then proceeds “ Like a bank note, or promissory note indorsed in blank, they pass by delivery, and • a good faith purchaser is unaffected by want of title in his vendor. The last taker is presumed to be a <em>lona -fide </em>holder for value, and may maintain bis possession against everybody until the contrary is successfully established by those who undertake to assail his possession.”</p>

The defendant having taken this bond in good faith, and having paid a valuable consideration therefor, acquired a good title: Phelan <em>v. </em>Moss, 17 P. F. Smith, 59; McSparran <em>v. </em>Neeley, 10 Norris, 17.</p>
