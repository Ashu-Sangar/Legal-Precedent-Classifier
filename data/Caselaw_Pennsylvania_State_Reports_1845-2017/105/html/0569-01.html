It would, in our estimation, be a wrong to make the one or the few pay the debts of the many. And especially so where the fact of the association of a number of men of acknowledged capital were ostensibly in the similitude of sureties, personally pledged to pay debts of a corporation of which they were <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>all members, and which by reason of their being associated to it would be entrusted with special confidence and credit, until under the common management it sunk into insolvency, if one alone were selected from whom to have payment by the creditors, although his own interests in the corporation would be very small. With our present views we hold that there is a right to recover here......The next trouble in this case is after we allow the action of assumpsit to lie for the recovery sought, whether it may be maintained for contribution against only one at a time or more than one. We allow the issue to be maintained in this action on the theory that it arises between these stockholders in the same concern by a sort of implied assumpsit. As soon as these stockholders subscribed to the corporation they assumed certain obligations to the corporation, and by jointly and severally pledging themselves under the Act of Assembly to the credit of the compan]'', they also necessarily got into an obligatory relation to each other that would imply an obligation higher than merely moral to assist each other in the discharge of the obligations incident to the relation which they assumed the moment they gave their names to the stock of the company. We cannot see that the situation of the one would be in any way different from the other. If any of them were sued, it was their duty in good faith to make a proper defence. There is no denial here that the plaintiffs did not use good faith. If they wore unsuccessful then, paid the claim, took an assignment of the judgment, and if they could not recover from the company, or those joined with them, they had the undoubted right to sue for contribution one or more than one to avoid multiplicity of actions, for contribution so far as they could be reached in the proper county and within the jurisdiction of a proper court, and they would be entitled to judgment against those against whom they had proven their case by competent evidence......If the plaintiffs have used good faith in the bringing and conduct of their suit against the present defendants, we. see no reason why they should not recover from them in the gross, and that amount to be specially set out . in such ratable proportions as would insure equality among the number of shares held by any of them in the capital stock of this company at its dissolution May 19, 1860, or at the rendition of this verdict, if the evidence satisfies you that they were of the now solvent stockholders of the company, and having been stockholders at the time the liability attached.”</p>
