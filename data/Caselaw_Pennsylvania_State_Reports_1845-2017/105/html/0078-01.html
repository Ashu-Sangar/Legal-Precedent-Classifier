    <p id="b98-9" data-blocks='[["BL_98.10",98,[220,1575,1194,825]]]'>This action was originally a foreign attachment, brought by Mary King against Thomas Bolton, Henry Bolton and ’John Bolton, trading órlate trading as “The Bronx Company;” the attachment being dissolved, however, the action proceeded in assumpsit. The plaintiff’s claim was upon a note of The Bronx Company, dated July 3d, 1872, for four hundred dollars, payable to the order of the plaintiff below, on demand,for value received. Upon the note was endorsed a payment, dated September 9th, 1879, of $28, interest to 3d July, 1877. This’suit was.brought 13th December, 1881. The defendants interposed the plea of the statute of limitations, and also a special plea of their discharge in bankruptcy from all debts contracted prior to 28th May, 1878. The plaintiffs joined issue on the plea of the statute, and replied to the special plea that the defendants, after they became bankrupts, ratified and confirmed their promises, etc., and upon this the defendants joined issue. On the trial, the record was so amended that Henry Bolton was the only defendant, and the verdict was against him alone.</p>

A promise, whether express or thus implied, has been regarded as a waiver of the statutory defence and the remedy is restored; the action must of course proceed upon the original contract,, not upon the new promise.</p>
    <p id="b99-6" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[171,954,1189,1089]]]'>But the mere acknowledgment of a debt, however clear, distinct and unambiguous it may be, in terms, is not now sufficient to restore a debt which has been discharged under the operation of the bankrupt law. Yoxtheimer <em>v. </em>Keyser, 11 Penna. St., 364; Canfield’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.N.C.%2067" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 W.N.C. 67">1 W. N. C., 67</a>; Allen <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 9 Bk’cy, L. R., 481. The effect of a discharge in bankruptcy is an absolute extinguishment of the debt, and not a mere bar of the remedy for its recovery. Nothing remains, after the discharge but the moral obligation to pay, which,, taken with the fact of the prior legal obligation, has been held to form a sufficient consideration for a new express promise ; in the nature of the ease -«however, there can not arise a promise by implication, as the mere acknowledgment of a debt would not create any liability, if, in fact, no debt existed.. The promise to restore a debt from which the debtor has been, discharged, whether by proceedings in bankruptcy or otherwise, must be a clear, distinct and unequivocal promise to pay the specific debt, not the expression of a mere intention to-pay; it must be without qualification or condition, and must contain all the essentials of a valid express agreement, excepting only the element of a valid consideration; the moral obligation, taken with the fact of a pre-existing liability, will furnish the consideration. In an action upon such a claim the-declaration must, therefore, be upon the new promise, and not the original, as the latter is extinguished by the discharge.</p>

Whether Mii Rowland or Mr. Shallcross stated correctly the contents of Mr. Bolton’s letter, was a question for the jury; the testimony justified a submission; as an acknowledgment of indebtedness, and a promise to pay, ■combined in a single phrase, no form of words could be more ■distinct, clear and unequivocal than this: “We owe her the money; will pay it some day; can’t say when.” It is true no itime was fixed, for the payment, but no condition was annexed, ■no qualification superadded; the word “ will ” is auxiliary to “pay; ” the letter was not the expression of mere sentiment, ■or of a willingness or intention to pay only, it contained a present positive promise, deliberately made by a business man in reply to a business letter, and an action was maintainable upon it as soon as made. If Bolton had written, “We owe her the money, will pay it,” no one could, for a moment, doubt the sufficiency of such an explicit promise, and yet the time of payment is just as indefinite as if the words, “some day, can’t say when” were added. If the promise is otherwise in proper form, it is unimportant that no particular time is designated for payment.</p>
