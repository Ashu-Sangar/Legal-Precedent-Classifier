Sanner &amp; Co., now for use of W. W. Patrick <em>v. </em>John D. Roddy and Hiram Findlay. To this Korns objected by filing his answer July 17, 1880, in which he alleged that the assignment was fraudulent. On November 9, 1880, the court ordered that said Patrick “be joined as plaintiff without prejudice to the right of the parties.” An affidavit of defence had been filed by Roddy to the claim of Korns on the balance of said mortgage. The case was subsequently tried, and on January 27, 1881, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff Patrick, for $1,529.33, and in favor of the plaintiff Korns, for $921.14, and on March 16, 1881, the prothonotary, at the instance of J. H. Uhl, Esq., attorney for Korns, entered judgment on the verdict for the amount due the plaintiffs, respectively.

The only question before the court when that order was made was, whether there had been fraud or collusion between Roddy and Patrick, when the assignment was obtained. If there had been, that could have been established before the auditor, and that would have been sufficient to have postponed the judgment of Patrick, even though there had been no reservation by the court, when the amendment was allowed. But there is no evidence whatever that there was. any fraud, collusion or covin in connection with the assignment. Having thus determined that Mr. Patrick’s judgment is' entitled to participate in the distribution, as though no question had been raised as to the validity of the assignment, it only remains to notice the argument of Patrick’s counsel, that his judgment is entitled to priority over that of Korns by virtue of the assignment. It would be a complete answer to this, to say, that Mr. Patrick is not allowed to share in the proceeds by virtue of the assignment, but by force of his judgment. Again it has been well decided by numerous authorities in Pennsylvania, that if any portion or payment of a mortgage or judgment has been assigned, and on sale of the premises bound it proves insufficient for the payment of the whole amount, then equality of distribution prevails.
