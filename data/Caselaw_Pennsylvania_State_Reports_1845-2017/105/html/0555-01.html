He was there the day I -met him at Catawissa— no, the day before. He just asked to put up a large culvert where that run is; make it convenient for our cattle to pass backwards and forwards. So he went on to the cider house, and says he, ‘We just want the width of this cider house; set this over, and we will put our track right down here where this cider house stands.’ We went on down two or three rods. Says he, ‘ Even if the ties extends out two or three rods here, we will cinder over there.’ I just asked if he would keep inside of the wagon ruts. He says, ‘Yes; further than that we don’t want to come in.’ When we got to the watch-house says he, ‘ These engineers oftentimes are very apt to strike a straight course through such a place as this is; they take too much land;” and I didn’t say anything agin it; thought it was away from the plants and fruit. And he said they wouldn’t disturb anything. He asked me what 1 was willing to give him the right of way for on the bank. He says, ‘ Well, we will give at the rate of $200 an acre right here on the 'bank.’ I didn’t say anything agin that, if he would put it where he showed me. ‘ Down here below that pale fence I paid a little over $800 an acre,’ says I. Says he, ‘We will make it $850 that part,’ on account it left the river bank. Says I, ‘ I wouldn’t like to have this road taken up I have round my barnyard and the premises.’ ‘ No,’ says he, ‘ that shan’t be touched; you shall have that road as you have it now, and even the fruit shall not be touched; they must keep away from the fruit.’ He spoke about the opening below the garden — ‘ that shall not be touched; you shall have your opening there.’ I said I would come down and see about signing this paper, and see my son what he says about it. They called me in before I got to my son’s. I can’t read writing except my own name; couldn’t say whether agreement was read to me or not; if it was, didn’t understand it anyhow; did not know what it meant.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b576-7" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[248,857,1173,686]]]'>Answer. — As stated in this point, the construction of the contract of August 14, 1880, is for the court. The general rule is, as I have already said, that an agreement with the company for the location of its road on the land of an owner, is presumed to include a license to do what is lawful in the construction and management of its road, to the same extent and to the same effect as if the land had been compulsorily taken, and it is therefore considered to release a claim for injury to other lands of the grantor (or for other damage) to which he would have been entitled if the land had been taken by legal proceedings under the statute. But in this case the parties contemplated compensation for other damages than the mere taking of the land for the right of way, and therefore the general rule, above stated, is not applicable here, and damages above the value of the land taken may be assessed if any such have been sustained.

    <p class="summary" id="b576-9" data-blocks='[["BL_576.8",576,[240,1842,1172,557]]]'>Answer. — If the contract was a binding contract upon Swank, not induced by any misrepresentation as to what the company would or would not do, then the value of the land actually taken for the road must be ascertained by the terms of the contract, and the plaintiff is entitled to at least that value. If damages have been sustained by the plaintiff beyond that value, they should be ascertained all together as stated in our answer to the eighth point of the defendants, and the eighth point is this : That, in the absence of an agreement, the measure of damages to an owner for the location of a railroad through his land, is the difference of the value of the property as a whole before the opening of the road and the value as affected by the road.

    <p class="summary" id="b577-6" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[192,636,1176,650]]]'>Answer. — This is correct, provided the jury find that the conversation and negotiations in respect to the right of way, and leading to the agreement, were to the effect that an archway would he made by the company, giving the plaintiff access to tho river, and that his fruit trees would not be disturbed by the location of the road; and that these representations, and the arrangement in respect thereto, continued up to the time of executing the writing. While parol evidence is inadmissible to alter a contract, it is competent for the purpose of showing that it would be a fraud upon the maker to take his land without the performance of the conditions on which he agreed to part with it.

This principle, recognized in the charge of the learned Judge of the Common Pleas, is so well settled and so reasonable that it has not been controverted. But the court held that the parties to the agreement in question contemplated compensation for other damages than the mere taking of land for the right of way, and that the general rule is not applicable; to this we are impelled to dissent. The parties contracted for “ the right of way ” for compensation to be ascertained at a certain rate per acre for the quantity of land occupied. No word or clause indicates a reservation by the landowner of the right to recover damages ,t° other land, or to recover for the vines, trees and shrubs on the land taken for the way. Nothing is excepted out of the grant. The way defined in the contract is entire and within the general rule. So far as advised, the popular understanding of a grant of right of way for a railroad is, that it includes all the company may lawfully and adversely take from the grantor for use as a way.

Previous negotiations of the parties are presumed to be merged in the written instrument. The court well remarked that tit is competent for the maker of a contract to show by parol testimony that it would be a fraud upon him to take his land without the performance of the conditions on which he agreed to part with it. But the conditions ought to appear in the writing. If by mistake, or by design of the agent of the company, this contract does not fully express the agreement, it can be reformed in equity, and the reformation, according to the rules of evidence in equity proceedings, can be made at the trial of this action. Swank was the only witness who testified in support of the alleged “representations or misrepresentations” which, if established, change the terms <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>of the written contract, or as submitted, actually set it aside.

Were the defendant in error in a court of equity, asking that the contract be reformed, or set aside, by reason of the alleged fraud, and the allegation denied, upon such testimony as adduced here, his bill would be at once dismissed. His testimony could not be. considered by the chancellor, unless corroborated by another witness, or the equivalent of another. Unless there be such testimony as a chancellor could consider upon a question of this nature, it ought not to be submitted to a jury in a proceeding at law.
