Brinton, Esquire), the following facts appeared: William Lewis, who was owner of a certain house and lot in West Chester, borrowed §1000 from one Joshua N. Peirce, giving as security therefor his judgment bond, with a waiver of exemption. Judgment was entered on this bond April 1, 1878. On November 2t, 1878, William Lewis- died, leaving a widow, Margaret Lewis, and one son, William Lewis. His will contained, <em>inter </em>alia, the following clause:</p>

Letters of administration were granted on her estate, and the minor son, William Lewis, by his guardian, Abraham Wanger, then claimed to have §300 set apart to him out of his mother’s estate — which consisted chiefly of the said house and lot. The appraisers of her estate reported that division thereof could not be made without injury to the whole, and the real estate was afterwards sold by the administrator by order of court.</p>

The auditor, in coming to a contrary conclusion, was governed by the ease of King’s Appeal, 3 Norris, 345, and his attention was not called to the later decision in 13th Norris, in which King’s Appeal is distinguished and, limited to its peculiar facts.

Act of 1851, Purd. Dig. 416; Himes’ Appeal, 13 Norris, 381. The application to the administrator of Margaret Lewis, by the minor for $300 exemption, was the only channel open to him for his rights under the law. This application and return of the appraisers had the same effect as if the death of Margaret had preceded her husband, William Lewis, and the minor had applied to the executor or administrator of his father. It is clear that the child, where there is no widow, has the right to the exemption. The Orphans’ Court has sufficient equity power to control that question. Steffy and Shimp’s Appeal, 26 P. E. S., 94.

In the former case the contention was between the surviving husband on the one side, and the children of his deceased wife on the other side. The attempt was to take from him property of his wife which the statute expressly gave him. We declared the Act did not intend to apply to the property of a wife. In the latter case the question did not relate to the distribution of the property of a wife, but to the property of a widow. The rights of a husband did not arise. It follows so far as that part of the case is presented this decree is right, and the court was also right in holding that the land passed to the mother encumbered by the liens with which it was charged when she acquired it. There was error in allowing any interest on the judgment in favor of the appellee, Peirce. The auditor allowed none. No exception was taken to this decision. The court gives no reason for the allowance. It was evidently inadvertently made. To the extent of the sum allowed for interest the decree must be modified.</p>
