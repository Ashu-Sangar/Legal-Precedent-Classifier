    <p class="summary" id="b335-11" data-blocks='[["BL_335.9",335,[199,1856,1171,559]]]'>First. That the refusal of defendant’s testatrix to execute the power of sale of real estate confided to her discretion by the terms of the will, gives no cause of action to the plaintiff, even though the delay was a mistaken exercise of discretion, occasioned partly by the fact that the rents and profits during the time of such delay belonged to her, as devisee, and further that the fact of her having at one time agreed, at the solicitation of creditors, to make a sale under the will at a certain price upon their advancing a sum of money to pay other creditors, and her afterwards insisting on another sum of money, even though she meant such further sum as a bonus to herself, has no material bearing on the question before the court.

In the case of Mayer <em>v. </em>Walter, 14 P. F. Smith, 283, it was ruled that a suit, however malicious and unfounded, cannot be made the ground of an action for damages. The cases of Eberly <em>v. </em>Rupp, 9 Norris, 259, and Muldoon <em>v. </em>Rickey, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20W.N.C.%20421" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 W.N.C. 421">13 W. N.

    <p class="summary" id="b336-5" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[247,952,1178,904]]]'>Third. That the neglect of Mrs. Parsons to make application to the Orphans’ Court for an order to sell the real estate as soon as she reasonably could after it clearly appeared to her that the personal estate was insufficient, did not give plaintiff any cause of action against her when living, or against her executor since her death. If the plaintiff deemed the delay prejudicial it might have proceeded to compel a sale under the Act of 29th March, 1832. Doubtless an executor is responsible for a neglect of a duty imposed by the law, which neglect is prejudicial to persons interested in the estate, and which results solely from his own supineness. But it is as much the. business of a creditor as of an executor to judge of the danger to be apprehended from delay, and in case of such apprehension to quicken action in the mode prescribed by the statute. Where he does not do this, and a loss results from the delay, it is, I think, to be attributed as much to the supineness of the creditor as'of the executor. Concurrence and acquiescence in delay, upon the part of the party injured, especially when the law puts it in his power to quicken action, will, in my judgment, relieve the executor, and this upon the principle of contributory negligence, or at least on analogous reasoning.</p>

Parsons, deceased. The main ground of complaint is, that she did not within a reasonable time after his death, as surviving executrix of his estate, sell his real estate and apply the proceeds on judgment liens on the property, of which the plaintiff held one. The will of Mr. Parsons declared, “I also authorize and empower my executor and executrix to sell my Malt house property, and any and all other real estate of which I may or shall die seised or_ possessed, and make all needed deeds to grant and convey the same, and. to fix at their discretion and judgment terms of sale, prices <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>and purchasers.” After a specific bequest of personal estate, he gave all the residue of his property to his wife, and named her as executrix.. By reason of her alleged unreasonable delay in making sale of the real estate, the plaintiff in error and others, creditors of her deceased husband, applied to the Orphans’ Court to remove her as executrix. The decree of that court came before us for review in Parsons’s Appeal, 1 Norris, 465. The 'questions there ruled bear directly on those presented in the present case.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[282,814,1170,293]]]'>It was held that, in case of undue delay in the sale of the real estate of a decedent, the proper remedy for a lien creditor to enforce a sale, was under the Act of 29th March, 1832, by petition to the Orphans’ Court; and that delay in making sale for the payment of debts by an executrix, who had discretionary power of sale under the will, furnished no just cause for her removal.</p>
    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[279,1115,1174,859]]]'>• In the present ease the plaintiff seeks to recover on substantially the same facts that were shown in the case cited. If the plaintiff has any remedy for alleged misfeasance or negligence of Mrs. Parsons, as executrix of her husband’s will, in the care and management of his estate, the proper place to seek that remedy is in the Orphans’ Court. The power given and the trust committed to her are both <em>virtute officii. </em>The trust is not given to her by name but as executrix. Then not only has the Orphans’ Court full power to charge and surcharge her for dereliction of duty as such executrix, but it has sole jurisdiction of the testamentary trust imposed upon her.

F. Smith, 100. There, and there only is her liability under the trust to be settled and determined. The ground on which the plaintiff seeks to maintain this action arises from the facts that it was a creditor of the 'testator, and that she as his executrix, did not properly discharge her duty and trust, but was derelict therein, and mismanaged the estate to the injury of his creditors, of which the plaintiff was one.</p>

Dig., 1104, pl. 8, declares “the jurisdiction of the several Orphans’ Courts shall extend to and embrace, <em>inter alia, </em>all cases within their respective counties wherein executors, administrators, guardians or trustees may be possessed of or in any way accountable for, any real or personal estate of a decedent.”</p>

    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[173,684,1163,385]]]'>Although Mrs. Parsons was the residuary devisee, yet that fact does not aid the plaintiff. The claim to recover does not rest on any breach of her personal agreement to sell the property. No sale which she could have made as devisee, would have divested the liens or passed a title of any value to the purchaser. It was by virtue of the trust and her power as executrix, that a sale by her would have aided the plaintiff. It is only by her delaying so to sell that any creditor of her husband’s estate was injured.</p>
