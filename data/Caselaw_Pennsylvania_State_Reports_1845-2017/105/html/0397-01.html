The claimant failed to give bond, and the court directed the sheriff to sell under the writ and pay the money into court. Other parties then claimed one-half the property levied upon. The court then made another order directing the sheriff to sell subject to the rights of the last mentioned claimants. The sheriff made sale, giving notice that he was only selling the right, title and interest of A. in the property, and that he could not deliver possession to the purchaser.

    <p class="summary" id="b416-7" data-blocks='[["BL_416.6",416,[246,931,1181,1033]]]'>“ First. — March 10, 1881, the sheriff of Lycoming county, by virtue of a proper writ for that purpose, levied on a certain lot of. logs and lumber as the property of L. G. Huling, the defendant named in the writ. The property levied on was claimed by Ida M. Huling, wife of the defendant in the writ. The sheriff then applied for the benefit of the interpleader act. Rule to show cause, &amp;e., was granted. Subsequently, to wit: April 2, 1883, the claimant, Ida M. Huling, having failed to give bond, &amp;c., the court ordered the sheriff to proceed with his writ and pay the money into court. When the sheriff attempted to proceed with his writ, Peter Reeder and S. P. Wallis gave notice that they claimed the one-half of the property levied on. The sheriff then applied to the court for leave to require indemnifying bond from the plaintiff, or to return his writ, &amp;c., when upon April 22, 1881, the court ordered the sheriff to sell the property levied on, subject to the claims and rights of S. P. Wallis and Peter Reeder. The sheriff then, April 29, 1881, sold the property levied on, giving notice to bidders that he was only selling the right, title and interest of L. G. Huling, the defendant, in the property, and that he could not deliver possession to the purchaser. A. D. Hower became the purchaser, and brings this action of replevin to recover possession of the property bought by him at said sheriff’s sale.</p>

Huling. The logs were stocked and manufactured, or intended to be manufactured, for Ida M. Huling. L. G. Huling acted for his wife, Ida M. Huling, in this lumber transaction, but he had no personal ownership in the logs or lumber, nor had he any title to or possession of the land from whence the logs and lumber came, except for his wife and under her title. There is some evidence that L. G-. Haling said he owned the logs, &amp;c., but it is not sufficient to overcome the positive testimony of L. G. Huling himself and S. P. Wallis that this lumber <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>and those logs were the property of Ida M. Iiuling, at the time they were seized and sold, it follows therefore that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover on the facts of the ease.</p>

Huiing, having had an opportunity to come into court in the interpleader proceedings, and having failed then to act, is now to be permitted to make claim and set up her defence in this action? When the sheriff was ordered to proceed with his writ, no conditions were made nor was the claimant thereby barred of any of her rights. All parties interested stood just as if no proceedings had been had for the interpleader. Ida M. Huiing is, therefore, not prevented from setting up her defence in this action. Bain <em>v. </em>Funk, 11 P. F. S., 185; T. &amp; H. Prac. (5 ed.) §§ 1142, 1143, &amp;c.
