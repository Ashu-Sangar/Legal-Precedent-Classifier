In answer to various questions asked for the purpose of getting him to state whether he had served such notice, C. testified substantially that he had no personal recollection whatever in regard to it, but that if the judge’s notes were correct, and he (C.,-) had testified at the former trial that he had served the notice, Ms testimony then given was true, and he had so served it.</p>

Bennett, on the other hand, claimed that notice had been given to Reed, but that the latter, paying no attention to the same, had allowed judgment to be taken on the claim. In order to prove that Reed was duly notified to defend, the plaintiff called one S. S. Spencer, and handing him a notice entitled in the cause, the witness identified the same as having been signed by himself as counsel for Bennett. The witness was also handed certain notes of his own testimony taken by the judge in 1871, at a former trial of the same cause showing that he Trad then testified that he had served the notice. After looking at these papers, in answer to various <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>questions, Spencer testified as follows: “I can only state that this is my signature to a notice.

I have no recollection of serving it other than is contained in those notes of testimony. If I swore to it then it was so.

He has no recollection of it whatever, but the notes of the former trial, taken by his Honor, Judge Vrsr-CE5ÍT, are shown to Mr. Spencer, and from which it appears that he at that time testified that it was served either the first Monday of September or October, 1868. That he testified to that at that time, would appear to be sufficiently clear, and he says, if he did, it must have been true, because he would then have had a recollection of it. Mr. Spencer, it is claimed, is corroborated by pencil memorandum, made on the face of this notice October 5, 1868, which I think it was said was in the handwriting of Mr. Wetmoro. And the book or record of the Marine Hospital was produced to show that on that.date, October 5, 1868, there was a meeting in the evening at Mr. Spencer’s office, at which, according to the record, Mr. Spencer and Reed were present; this for the purpose of showing that those two parties were together some time on that day, and that he might therefore serve the notice.” (Second assignment of error.)</p>

In Yelott <em>v. </em>Lewis, supra, relied on by the plaintiff in error, the plaintiff offered to read to a witness, notes of his testimony, as given before certain arbitrators, that he might refresh his memory as to a date. The defendant objected, because the witness was the plaintiff’s, and could not be led by showing him his former testimony. The objection was to a leading question, and the objection was sustained. This is all that is decided in Velott <em>v. </em>Lewis, although the language of the court would seem, by its general terms, to make the scope of the decision broader. There is nothing in the case to prevent the application of the doctrine of Rothrock <em>v. </em>Gallaher, 10 Nor., 108, to any other case varying in circumstances.</p>

For this purpose théy called Mr. Spencer, and handing him a notice entitled in that case, he identified it as having been signed by himself in the name of “Spencer &amp; Marvin, attorneys for Bennett.” They also handed him the judge’s notes of a former trial, taken in January, 1871, showing that he had then testified in re<a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>gard to the service of the notice.

I see by them I testified some eleven years ago.” In answer to the question whether he was a witness at the former trial in 1871, he said, “ I think so; am not positive about it.” By numerous questions it was sought to elicit from the witness some testimony as to the service of the notice, but he steadfastly adhered to the position that he had no personal recollection in regard to it. The plaintiffs were then permitted, against the objection of defendant, to ask this question: “Now, refreshing your recollection from those notes, state what yon testified, in January, 1871, as to having served this notice on W.

Eeed?” His answer was: “If the notes of Judge Vincent are correct, I did testify that I served that notice on the-first Monday of September or October in 1868, and, if I so testified at trial, I did serve the notice.” On cross-examination he reiterated, in substance, what he had repeatedly said before, that he had then no personal recollection in regard to the matter.</p>
