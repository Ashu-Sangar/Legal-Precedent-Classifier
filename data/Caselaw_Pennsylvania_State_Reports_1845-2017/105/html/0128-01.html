Quain’s Appeal, which has since been affirmed and adhered to by the Supreme Court,-was the case of a ground rent, in which it was held that the executors of-a deceased covenantor in a ground-rent deed are no.t bound.to pay, out of assets in their hands, ground-rent accrued after his death, the reason given being that the cove: nant to pay rent is a perpetual one, which would forever prevent .the settlement of the estate, and make the office of executor as perpetual as itself. Subsequently the District Court of Philadélphia, in a learned opinion by Judge Stroud, decided that suit might be maintained against an administrator <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>upon the covenant of his decedent for. ground-rent accrued' since his death, but that the judgment should be restricted to the land out of which the ground-rent issued. Gardiner <em>v. </em>Painter, 3 Philadelphia Reports, 365, which was afterwards approved by the Supreme Court in Williams’ Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20283" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 Wright 283">11 Wright, 283</a>, in which case, after a vigorous assault by eminent counsel upon the doctrine of Quain’s Appeal, it was reasserted in the most positive terms. .....</p>

There is a well-established principle that the representatives of a deceased contractor or covenantor are not liable for breaches of a promise which was so entirely personal to himself that it could not have been contemplated that any one else could or should perform it, as a contract to paint a picture or write a book, or to do some act where the skill of the contractor was an element in the making of the contract. Performance of such contracts becomes impossible when the party to fulfil them dies, and in such cases the personal representatives are not bound. Dickinson <em>v. </em>Calahan, 7 Harris, 227; Bland’s Adm. <em>v. </em>Umstead, 11 Harris, 316. But where the contract or covenant is for the payment of money, a different case is presented. As was said by Thompson, J., in White’s Ex’r. <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20176" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Wright 176">3 Wright, 176</a>, ‘ A contract to pay money, although it falls due after the decease of the obligor, does survive. And what is the difference between an agreement to pay at a future period or on a future contingency ? The contract is to be completed, not by any personal performance, but by the payment of money. This act an executor can do as effectually as the testator, and it cannot therefore come within the rule of the cases cited.’</p>

It is to pay the interest until the mortgaged lots are so built on as to secure -the mortgages. And as the lots are not yet built on, and may never be, it follows that the covenant may endure forever, and the liability to pay may in this respect resemble a yearly ground-rent payable semi-annually. But there is this difference between a covenant to pay ground-rent and the covenant in question here, that the personal covenant to pay the rent is only a collateral security, the ground-rent being a real incumbrance, and the land being the main reliance of the landlord out of which to get his rent, so that, as C. J. Gibson observed in Torr’s Estate, 2 Rawie, 252: ‘ It is impossible to put a ease in which the land is more obviously or more con<a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>clusively the principal debtor.’ The covenant now under consideration was evidently made for precisely the opposite reason —namely, that the mortgagees were unwilling to look to the land exclusively for the interest upon their money until it had been built upon, and thus not only increased in value but in a situation to produce income out of which the interest might be paid.</p>

It is a well-settled and familiar principle of equity that a creditor who has a lien on two funds, shall not take satisfaction in a way to disappoint another who has a lien on but one. The mortgages of the claimants are security for interest as well as principal, and under the ruling in Gould’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.N.C.%20562" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 W.N.C. 562">6 W.

If the law were as contended by counsel for the accountant, every contract for the payment of money not falling due within a year from-the-death of the contractor, would, as a logical consequence, be of nbvalidity.

Busby, executors and trustees of the will of William Crean, deceased, for $5,460; and one by Emily Lehman for $3,820. Both claims rest upon the same principle and need not be separately discussed. The claim first named arose under tire following circumstances: On the 22d of January, 1874, the decedent, John H. Jones, entered into a written agreement with the claimants whereby he covenanted and agreed to be responsible for and guarantee the payment of the interest upon each of ten several indentures of mortgage, given and executed by William S. Kite to <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>the claimants, “ as the same shall accrue unto the said. Edwin W. Lehman and John L. Busby, executors and trustees as aforesaid, until such time as the lots described in said mortgages shall be improved- to fully secure the mortgage debts thereon secured.” This -agreement was signed and sealed by the decedent. The lots of ground described in the agreement have not been improved up to the present time. It was found by the auditor that the interest on these mortgages remaining unpaid up to the first 'of January, 1883, amounted to $5,460. The two principal questions which are involved in this claim may be stated as follows: 1st. Does the decedent’s covenant to pay the interest on the mortgages bind his executors and administrators, and 2d, -If the covenant does extend to the executors and administrators, was the lien thereof continued as to the real estate of the decedent ?</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[233,1058,1188,1380]]]'>As to the first point it was strongly urged by the learned counsel representing some of the appellants that the covenant did not extend to the executors and administrators of the covenantor, and Quain’s Appeal, 10 Harris, 510, was cited in support of this view. Quain’s Appeal was the first Pennsylvania case which squarely decided that a ground rent covenant does not survive against executors or administrators except as to the rents which accrued in the lifetime of the decedent; and that rents which accrue subsequent to the death of the covenantor are not payable out of his personal estate, and it is not too much to say that that decision was somewhat of a surprise to the profession. For it must be conceded that such covenants are personal and may be enforced against the covenantor during his life, even after he has parted with the ground out of which the rent issues. The court was doubtless driven to that decision by the practical impossibility of enforcing such a covenant, in many instances perpetual, against a dead man’s estate, and no one at the present day who will take the trouble to read the opinion of the court as delivered by Justice Lowkxe, can doubt its soundness". Quain’s Appeal was followed by a decision of the District Court of Philadelphia, in which, in an opinion delivered by the late Judge Stboud, it was held that while the administrator” of a grantee in a ground rent deed is a proper party to an action of covenant for the rent accrued after his death, the judgment will however be restricted to the land out of which the rent issues. See Gardiner <em>v. </em>Painter, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Phila.%20365" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="3 Phila. 365">3 Phila. Rep., 365</a>. This case was not brought up to this court for review, but in Williams’ Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20283" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="11 Wright 283">11 Wright, 283</a>, it is referred to by the late Chief Justice Thompson with approval, and the doctrine thereof, as well as of Quain’s Appeal, affirmed by this court. We.may therefore regard the question at rest.</p>
    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.3",157,[183,409,1171,943]]]'>
      <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>But we are not prepared to apply the same doctrine to the case in hand for obvious reasons. While there are some points of analogy between a ground rent and the covenant in question, there are also essential points of difference. In the former instance the rent issues out of the land, and the covenantee must be presumed, especially in the case of perpetual rents, to rely upon the security of the land for payment. In the creation of such ground rents, as was said by this court in Quain’s Appeal, supra: “ The grantor of the land cannot be presumed to have then placed any value on such a covenant; for the personal covenant of the original grantee is as nothing in a series of tenants lasting forever. The real security is the covenant running with the land and encumbering it; and this is the essential reliance of the owner of the rent.” It is not so with the covenant we are considering. The land in its unimproved condition was not deemed a sufficient security, and the mortgagee declined to take the mortgages without security that the interest should be paid until such time as by improvements placed upon the property his mortgages should be made safe. So that we must assume that the mortgagee looked to the personal security of the covenant, and to that alone, for the interest.</p>
    <p id="b157-6" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[187,1358,1170,645]]]'>Nor is it a perpetual covenant. It may be regarded as a security for the improvement of the property. This is really its scope, and the decedent could have relieved himself and his estate by doing this or procuring it to be done by others. The decision in Quain’s Appeal was a necessity growing out of the peculiar facts of that case, and we are not disposed to apply it to cases in which no such necessity exists. Were we to do so in the present instance, we would be at a loss where to draw the line. The general rule is that all personal covenants survive to the executor or administrator of the covenantor, and to take a case out of the rule there must be something more than the mere fact that the covenant is to be performed <em>in future. </em>We are clearly of opinion that the executors of this testator are bound by his covenant to pay the interest on the mortgages in question.</p>

Under this statute it is plain that where the debt is due and payable the suit therefor must be commenced’ within five years from the death of the decedent, or the lien is lost; and where the debt is not due and payable within five years the creditor is bound to file a copy or particular written statement of the instrument of writing by which the debt is secured, within five years. These directions being statutory cannot be omitted.</p>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[227,933,1190,947]]]'>Two suits were commenced in the Courts of Common Pleas against the executors of John H. Jones, deceased, to recover arrears of interest due under this covenant. The first writ was issued on Dec. 1, 1876; the second on Jan. 4, 1888, and in both cases a narr. and bill of particulars were filed, but in neither was a copy of the covenant or instrument of writing filed, as required by the Act of 1834 when it is sought to hold, the lien for a debt not maturing within five years. The auditor and the court below held that to the extent that the arrears of interest were embraced in the first suit, which was brought .within five years of the testator’s death, the said suit continued the lien’thereof as to said arrears, and awarded the claimant a dividend out of the fund in court. But as to the second suit, inasmuch as said fund is the proceeds of real estate sold over eight years after the testator’s death, and no copy of the instrument had been filed in the proper office, it was held that the lien was gone and no further arrears could be recovered. It is difficult to see how any other conclusion could have been reached. The mere bringing of the second suit without a compliance with the Act of 1834 in filing a copy of the instrument could not prolong the lien beyond five years. This is too plain for argument.</p>

After giving a number of legacies to different persons and institutions, he devises and bequeaths all the residue of his estate to trustees in trust, “to let and demise the real estate, and invest and keep invested the personal estate ” for the purposes of the trust, and then follows a power of sale in these words: “To <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>sell all or any part of the real estate, without liability on the part of the purchaser to see to the application of the purchase money, and the proceeds of sale to re-invest from time to time, if practicable, in irredeemable ground rents upon the same trusts.”</p>
