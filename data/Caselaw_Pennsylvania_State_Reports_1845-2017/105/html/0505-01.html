In this country the rule, in many of the states, is held to be different from the English doctrine, though there is conflict of authority on the subject, and in this state the decisions show a decided tendency toward restricting the application of the equitable doctrine of the conversion of realty held by a partnership into personalty, and to admit it only for the accomplishment of equitable results. It is, however, the well settled rule in Pennsylvania, that when real estate is brought into the partnership business, and forms part of its stock, it is considered personalty, and as converted <em>out and out for </em>all purposes <em>of </em>the partnership, except sale and conveyance under the Statute of Frauds : Meily <em>v. </em>Wood, 21 P.

Hunter, formed part of the assets of the partnership, as the recorded' agreement so stated; the conveyances are all made <em>in terms </em>for the use and benefit of the partnership, and the evidence is that all except the first purchase was paid for out of the profits of the partnership. Certainly then, under the authority of Foster’s Appeal, 24 P. F. Smith, 391, and the facts above stated, it must be held that in this case there was an out and out conversion from realty to personalty, to the extent that the real estate held by the partnership was not subject to lien by the creditors of Frederick S. Hunter, or any other individual member of the firm, nor to sale, mortgage, or encumbrance either by him, or any one else who succeeded to his interest in the partnership, but remained liable, first, for the payment of all partnership debts, and secondly, for the payment of any balances which might be due to the other members of the firm. Under the same authority it is equally clear, that had the partnership been wound up and dissolved, upon the death of Frederick S. Hunter, all its affairs settled, and a balance ascertained to be due to his estate, such balance, arising from the real estate, would have been re-converted, as no longer forming a part of the partnership stock, nor required for its purposes, and would have descended to his widow and children, as real estate. But in the case before us the partnership could not be dissolved nor its affairs wound up, by the death of Frederick S. Hunter, and as a matter of fact, it was not wound up nor affected in any way thereby; but on the contrary continued its business just as before his death, and his interest remained in the partnership subject to all its purposes, and was represented by his widow and the guardians of his three minor children, who stood in his stead as partners.</p>

Hunter be considered during this continuing partnership with his widow and children, either by their guardian or themselves as members thereof, and with their entire interests • subject to the equities of partnership creditors and the other partners— whether realty or personalty for the purposes of descent? ..... Indeed it does not appear, though the firm paid large dividends, how much would have remained for distribution, either of personalty or realty, if the affairs of the firm had been wound up, and certainly all the partnership stock, whether realty or personalty in fact, must remain liable, primarily, for all partnership obligations, and be considered per? sonalty until all partnership affairs have been fully wound up and settled. In Abbott’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20234" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 Wright 234">14 Wright, 234</a>, the balance <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>of a fund in court arising from a sale of partnership real estate was awarded to the surviving partners as against the claim of an individual partner in his own right, and as the executor of another deceased partner, on the ground that the affairs of the firm had never been finally settled.

But the partnership in question never has been wound up, and under the terms of the agreement its affairs may not be finally settled for an indefinite period; nor does it appear but that the entire interest of which Frederick S. Hunter died seised, may in the future be, or might at any time heretofore have been, required for the purposes of a final settlement and winding up of the partnership affairs. How then can re-eon-version take place until the equities which work the conversion are accomplished and settled ? How could this undefined and still undefinable interest in the partnership descend as real estate, and as such, be chargeable with a dower interest and subject to all the possibilities of sale, mortgage, or incumbrance by those entitled to the remainder, without interfering with the equitable rights of partnership creditors and partners, and defeating the very object of conversion ? All the partnership property in this case being clearly impressed with the character of personalty, any attempt to withdraw that character from it, during the existence of the partnership or before accomplishing the equitable objects for which the conversion into personalty was effected, would not only defeat those objects, but lead to a state of uncertainty and confusion respecting the rights of partners, creditors and heirs, and would, in the opinion of the master, be contrary to sound legal principles. It may be noticed further that as both the widow and children of Frederick S. Hunter allowed their several interests to remain in the partnership, and thereby became partners under the 6th clause of the agreement above quoted, it seems impossible to escape the conclusion that if their interest, by any mode of reasoning, could be held to be real estate, at any period since the formation of the partnership, re-conversion into personalty must have again taken place, for it will not be pretended that those interests, or any <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>of the others in the partnership now, may be considered other than as personalty for all equitable purposes.</p>

The only equitable result to be effected by such fictitious conversion is to protect the creditors of the partnership, and it is not to be extended beyond, their exigencies. Thus it at no time gives one partner an implied power to dispose of the whole partnership interest in it. . It does not make the land subject to the rule which makes one partner the agent of the firm. It does not allow any partner to sell more than his undivided interest, unless he have from the others a sufficient special authority for. the purpose. It does not authorize an administrator, even during the continuance of the partnership, to sell his decedent’s share without an order of the Orphans’ Court to that effect: Foster’s Appeal, 24 P. F.

F. S., 50; Moderwell <em>v. </em>Mullison, 9 Harris, 259; Erwin’s Appeal, 3 Wr., 535; Abbott’s Appeal, 14 Wr., 234; Meily <em>v. </em>Wood, 21 P. F. S., 494; Foster <em>v. </em>Barnes, 31 P. F. S., 384; Foster’s Appeal, 24 P. F. S., 399; Du Bree <em>v. </em>Albert, 4 Out., 487. Especially is this the case where the partners, as in this case, impress by their written agreements the character of personalty upon their realty. In such case it will be deemed in equity to <em>all </em>intents and purposes to be personalty, and will consequently descend as such: Story on Part., § 93; Adams’ Equity, *245; Brightly’s Eq.

There was no decree of dissolution of the partnership asked for in the bill or made by the court; there was no final account nor any winding up of the affairs of the partnership. Of course there was no adjudication either of the. status of the parties or of their respective rights to the property of the partnership, as upon a final settlement and distribution of the property and assets of the partnership. The money ordered to be paid was a share of a dividend of the current profits of the firm. The profits realized from the business were of course personal property in any aspect of the case. They represent, not the mere product of <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>real estate distinctively as such, but of a business, to wit, the manufacture and sale of pig iron. Such a business is perhaps quite as largely the result of a dealing with money and personal chattels as with real estate. In this case the furnace and lands occupied in conducting the business were owned by the members of the firm, and to the extent of their use they contributed to the general result of profits earned.</p>
    <p id="b531-6" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[145,753,1172,602]]]'>The partnership in which the parties plaintiff and defendants were interested, was a continuing one which commenced in 1852, and which has never yet been dissolved. No question as to the ultimate ownership of the real estate of the firm, after a dissolution has taken place, arises upon the present record. The articles of copartnership contained an express provision that the firm should not be dissolved by the death, withdrawal, failure or pleasure of any of its members, nor in any way but by the consent of all the members thereof. A method of continuing the partnership after the death of a member is also provided. That such stipulations are perfectly valid and binding cannot be doubted: Story on Part., §§ 196 to 201; Gratz <em>v. </em>Bayard, 11 S. &amp; R., 46; Laughlin <em>v. </em>Lorenz, 12 Wr., 282, and authorities cited by Agnew, J., on p. 283.</p>
    <p id="b531-7" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[139,1356,1176,1125]],["BL_532.1",532,[312,509,1181,293]]]'>In the present case, in addition to the provision for a continuance of the partnership after the death of a member, there is also a stipulation that the furnace and lands of the firm shall be held as personal property. In point of fact the real estate of the firm was acquired with partnership funds and used for partnership purposes.' In every view of the case so lar as any question which now arises is concerned, during the continuance of the partnership agreement, all the property of the firm must be regarded as personal estate. Certainly this must be so as to mere dividends of profits earned in carrying-on the business. We cannot declare the partnership contract at an end, nor can we dissolve the firm, or deal with its assets as though it were dissolved, by any order which it would b« possible for us to make in this proceeding. We have considered the very able argument of the learned counsel for the appellants with great care, but we are not convinced that it is applicable to the present situation in its leading points. The decision in Foster’s Appeal, 24 P. F. Smith, 391, much relied upon for the appellants, is predicated of a dissolved firm, with all its debts paid, and a residuum of unconverted land remaining <em>in specie </em>for mere purposes of distribution. But there are no such facts here. It cannot now be known that the real estate will not be required for the payment of debts. The firm still continues its business under a lawful agreement to that effect. Whenever a dissolution shall be established, and a final settlement of accounts shall take place, the positions <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>contended for, and the reasoning by which they are enforced, will become entirely applicable, and will exercise a very potent, and possibly a controlling influence, upon the questions which will then arise between-the present .litigants or those who may succeed them. But upon the present state .of the record ,■ we think the appellee is clearly entitled to the dividend in question as the successor to his deceased wife’s titlé.</p>
