Maxwell was intended by the grantor to hinder and defraud his creditors, and if Mrs. Maxwell or her son, John S. Maxwell, acting for her, were concerned in the fraud by knowledge or acquiescence, then no title passed to John S. Maxwell, and the Hutchins judgment became a lien on the premises, and the sheriff’s sale under the Benson and West mortgage discharged the lien of the plaintiff’s mortgage, and she took no title by purchasing at the sheriff’s sale thereunder. But if, on the other hand, the jury found that said deed of December 5, 1873, was made in good faith to secure the payment to Mrs. Maxwell of her debt, and was not intended to hinder or defraud creditors, then the conveyance was valid, and vested the title' in John' S. Maxwell until it was re-conveyed by the deed of October Í3, 1875; and the Hutchins judgment, being entered- at a time when the title was not in Sheldon Maxwell, did not attach as a lien on the premises, and Mrs. Maxwell’s title under her sheriff’s deed would be superior to that of the defendant.

Hence the learned judge said to the jury when a wife claims to hold property against the creditors of her husband, the burden of proof is on her to <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>show affirmatively, by clear and satisfactory evidence, that she did not acquire it from him, or by her own labor or earnings.</p>

For an honest purpose, and to secure or pay a just debt due by him to his wife, he may make a valid sale or transfer of his real estate to her with like effect as to any other of his creditors.
