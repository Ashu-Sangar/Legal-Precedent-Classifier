The priucij&gt;al enterprise intended to be thus aided was the machine shop of Gibbs, Sterrett &amp; Co., who agreed in consideration of $80,000 of city bonds to remove their works from Nunda, N. Y., to Corry, and to give employment to 175 hands. The charter of Corry, however (P. L., 1866, p. 784), provided that the indebtedness of the city could only be increased two per cent, upon the last assessment, and the supplement to the charter passed in 1868 (P. L. 328), required that the amount borrowed in any one year should not exceed $8,000. It was therefore resolved by tlie city councils that certificates of indebtedness be issued running not more than thirty days from date of issue in favor of Gibbs, Sterrett &amp; Co., to the amount of $80,000, and placed to order of the council in trust for said parties, and certificates of indebtedness to be replaced at maturity by city bonds of the city of Corry running not less than ten years nor more than twenty years. Tlie contract for tlie removal of their shops was executed and delivered by Gibbs, Sterrett &amp; Co., simultaneously with this certificate of indebtedness, and was dated March 24, 1873. There was no money or other consideration paid to the city for said certificate, and it was not indebted to Gibbs, Sterrett &amp; Co., except according to the terms of its contract with them. In order to enable the city to issue bonds and thus take up this certificate of indebtedness, tlie Act of March 27, 1873 (P. L., 484), was passed at the solicitation of the city councils.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[259,508,1177,1116]]]'>“ There was no indebtedness of the city of Corry to Gibbs, Sterrett &amp; Co., and the issuing of the certificate of indebtedness in their favor was a mere gift, for the purpose, evidently, of creating an apparent indebtedness to support the issuing to them of a like amount of bonds under the authority of the Act of Assembly then pending, and which became a law three days afterward. By the express terms of this Act the bonds authorized by it, or the proceeds of their sale, were to be used for the purpose of paying the debt of the city of Corry, and for no other purpose whatever. The certificate issued to Gibbs, Sterrett &amp; Co. did not represent a debt, but was a mere pretence or semblance of' a debt invented for the purpose of supporting the like amount in bonds intended to be issued afterward in aid of a private enterprise in which the city had no share of ownership. The transaction-was therefore on its face a perversion and violation of the Act of Assembly under which it purported to be done. It was'in violation also of the seventh section of article eleven of the Constitution of Pennsylvania then in force, and reiterated in section seven of article ninth of the Constitution of 1874, which provides that “ the legislature shall not authorize any county, city, borough, township, or incorporated district, by virtue of a vote of its citizens, or otherwise, to become a stockholder in any company, association or corporation, or to.obtain money for or loan its credit to any corporation, association, institution or party.</p>

And this brings us to what is really the only question .in this case, namely, have these bonds such character .and quality of negotiability as to make them valid in the hands of an innocent purchaser without’ notice ? This question has been settled by the Supreme Court of our own state in the case of Diamond <em>v. </em>Lawrence County, 37 Pa. St. Rep., 353. That was a suit to recover the amount of a coupon accompanying a bond issued by the county to the Northwestern Railroad Company in part payment of the county subscription to the stock of the company, which bond and coupons the company transferred to a contractor for work done on their road, and by several successive transfers they came into the hands of the plaintiff for a valuable consideration. The pleadings and proof showed <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>irregularities in the making of the subscription, and improper conduct on the part of the directors of the company in the use made of the bonds, but it was contended there, as here, that the bonds and coupons were negotiable instruments, and that the defence set up must be excluded as against a <em>Iona fide </em>holder for a valuable consideration, without notice of the defects and irregularities alleged. .....</p>

To hold this doctrine would be practically to nullify the wholesome provision of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, which in express terms prohibits the very thing <em>that </em>was <em>done </em>by the authorities of the city of Corry in this case. The object of the constitutional amendment by which such loans of credit were peremptorily prohibited, was to prevent irresponsible majorities from voting onerous incumbrances and burdensome taxation upon the helpless minorities, the property owners of cities, towns, counties and other municipalities. But if the doctrine be held that the action of councils or other municipal authorities cannot be questioned, and that having issued bonds such as are here in controversy, their action is conclusive, and the municipality estopped from interposing a defence, such as that set up here, it is easy to see that the constitutional provision would be rendered practically worthless as against a majority who could easily elect councils or other governing officers, who would have as little regard for the prohibitory section in the Constitution as was shown by the councils and niayor of tiie city of Corry in this transaction.</p>

It holds, on the one hand, that the purchaser of such securities is not to take them blindly and without inquiry, but that he should ascertain for himself their validity before paying his money; and, on the other hand, it avoids the wrong of permitting a municipal corporation to set up a mere technical defence to defeat a just claim for money of which such municipality lias had the benefit. In the case of Diamond <em>v. </em>Lawrence County, referred to, the county was required to pay only what was actually received by the railroad for the bonds sold and for which bonds the county received certificates of stock in the Northwestern Railroad Co., the corporation to which the bonds were issued. Iu this case there was no actual debt, and nothing whatever given for the bonds of the city. It was a gift merely to aid individuals in a purely private <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>business enterprise "in which the city had no ownership or property interest whatever. The whole transaction was in violation of law, and of this the plaintiff could readily have informed himself had he taken the trouble to have inquired.

In our case the legislature authorize the issue of bonds for a strictly legitimate purpose, that is, for the payment of debts. In Parkersburg <em>‘v. </em>Brown, the authority was to issue bonus for the purpose of lending the same to individuals engaged in manufacturing — a purpose directly in violation of the Constitution. A purchaser of such bonds,, referring on their face to such legislation, would of course be-charged with notice of their unconstitutionality, and could not reasonably hope to recover on them. It will not avail to-say that in the case under consideration the bonds were appropriated to a similar purpose, not contemplated by the legislature. With the appropriation the purchaser has nothing whatever to do. He looks only for proper authority to issue-for a lawful purpose, and, finding it, he must be protected.</p>

Kerr, the owner of the bonds upon the coupons of 'which, or some of them, this suit has been brought, is a bona fide <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>holder for value, and that he was, at the time of Ms purchase, without notice of the defence now set up by the city. These bonds, with their coupons, were in the ordinary negotiable form, payable to bearer, signed by the mayor, treasurer, and clerk of the city, and sealed with its seal. In the body of these obligations we find the statement that they were issued in pursuance of the Act of the 27th of March, 1878, and of the action of the common council and authorities of the city of Corry. About the facts here stated there is no serious dispute, nor do I understand that the power of the municipality to issue this paper is called in question. Indeed, it would be useless so to do, for the Act above recited leaves no room for hesitation; by it the power is clearly conferred, and had these bonds, when issued, been applied to the lawful indebtedness of the city, as in said Act directed, there could be no room for controversy. It is, therefore, manifest that the labored argument on which the legal arbitrator bases his conclusion comes to nothing. If, indeed, his premise were correct, the rectitude of his conclusion could not be questioned. If the council of the city of Corry had no power to issue the bonds in controversy, then, without regard to their form, they would be as worthless as so much blank paper, and the operative legal principle here involved applies as well to a natural person, and private corporation, as to a municipality. If one receives the negotiable paper of another purporting to have been executed by an agent, it is not enough to show that it came to hand in the regular course of business, and that the holder gave a valuable consideration for it, for these are of no avail unless it be first shown that the alleged agent had authority to execute it. If, however, it be made to appear that he possessed such power, then may the innocent holder recover, though the paper was, in fact, issued in fraud of the principal’s right, and for a purpose not intended.</p>

The mayor and council had no power to bind tlie city by the certificate of indebtedness issued to Gibbs, Sterrett &amp; Co., on the 24th of March, 1873; the city owed this firm nothing, and its credit could not be thus loaned, lienee, the exchange of bonds for this certificate was a void act; it was a mere gift of these valuable securities to Gibbs, Sterrett &amp; Co., and in their hands they were no better, as evidences of indebtedness against the municipality, than was the original certificate for which they had been exchanged. The contest here, however, is not with the original holders of these bonds, but with an innocent pur<a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>chaser, who in good faith.took them, depending upon the representation, appearing on the face of each and every one of them, that they and their coupons, when due, would be paid to the bearer.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[288,608,1175,560]]]'>It follows, that the material inquiry involved in this case is, was the plaintiff bound not only to inform himself, through the Act of Assembly, of the power of the city authorities to issue the bonds, but did he take them charged with all the equities to which they were subject when in the hands of the first holders? In other words, do they oecupjr no other relation to the commercial community than do ordinary specialties, and have thejr in them no element of negotiability ? In the court below these questions, on the authority of Diamond <em>v. </em>Lawrence County, 1 Wr., 353, were answered adversely to the plaintiff, and the bonds were held to be nothing more than ordinary specialties, against which any defence might be set up which the city had against Gibbs, Sterrett &amp; Co.</p>

The coupon there sued upon was from a bond which, with others, had been issued by the County of Lawrence and passed to the Northwest Railroad Company, in payment of the county’s subscription to the stock of that company. On the 5th of June, 1857, and before the railroad company had transferred the bond, afterwards held by Diamond, a bill was filed by the county against the company to prevent a transfer of the bonds, and compel a surrender of them for cancellation. On that bill a decree was made as prayed for, on the ground that there had been a direct violation, by the corporation, of the Act of Assembly in selling the bonds for sixty-four cents on the dollar. Under these circumstances, Diamond having received a transfer of his bond pending the bill, it was held that he was bound to take notice of the suit then in progress; in other words, the case was disposed of on the doctrine of <em>lis pendens, </em>and the assertion found in the opinion that bonds of this character are not to be regarded as negotiable securities, must be taken to mean only that they are not to be treated as paper of that strictly commercial character which relieves its holder from the effects of the doctrine of <em>lis pendens. </em>If we were compelled to interpret this opinion as did the court below, we would reject it altogether, for thus interpreted it is not law in this commonwealth nor anywhere else. This decision, even when applied as it was intended, is not satisfactory, since it puts us, as a court, into this anomalous condition, that by it we are made to antagonize the sentiment of the commercial world, and the doctrine of every other court, whether in this country or England. It has been repudiated by the Supreme <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>Court of the United States, and held not to be the law of Pennsylvania. Mercer Comity <em>v. </em>Racket, 1 Wallace, 83. Under these circumstances we will not agree to carry the doctrine of this case a single step beyond the facts upon which it is based; nor are we willing to positively commit ourselves even to this extent, for in so doing we must necessarily overrule the case of Beaver County <em>v. </em>Armstrong, 8 Wr., 63, in which we held that municipal bonds and coupons are negotiable securities. But returning to the case in hand, we cannot see wherein it differs materially from that of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>The Commissioners of Allegheny County, 1 Wr., 237, wherein those commissioners were peremptorily ordered to provide for the payment of the coupons of bonds issued to a railroad company, and, like those in the case of Diamond <em>v. </em>Lawrence County, were, by that company, in defiance of the Act of Assembly, sold below par. Here the very same learned Justice, who delivered the opinion in the Lawrence county case, says that the making of the bonds on their face payable to the company or bearer, was, of itself, sufficient to authorize their transfer; that this was a direction, in precise language, that the bonds should be transferable on delivery, like bank notes or bills of exchange. And all this seemed to him so clear, that lie alleges he never before heard it doubted, and probably never should again. So, also, the very same idea was expressed in the previous case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>The same Commissioners, 8 Casey, 218, as it was in the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh, 10 <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20371" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="11 Wright 371">Id., 496</a>, and Carr <em>v. </em>Le Fevre, 8 <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20371" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="11 Wright 371">Id., 413</a>. Taking the cases here cited as exponents of the doctrine entertained -by this court, concerning municipal bonds, and we may summarize it as follows: They have, at</p>
    <p id="b311-6" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[183,1717,1166,343]]]'>least, a quasi negotiability in these particulars; they pass by delivery, and the holder may sue in his own name; the transferee for value holds title as an original obligee; he cannot bo affected by equities existing between the previous holders and the municipality, of which he had no notice, neither can he be affected by the default of the officers issuing them, unless such default directly affects their power to make and put them upon the market.</p>
