Among other debts were two notes held by Amos Rothermel, his cousin, for the aggregate sum of $765. By an arrangement between Templin and Rothermel, certain personal property belonging to Templin, and used by him in conducting his business, was appraised at the sum of $700, and Rothermel agreed to take the same in payment of the notes, and to transfer the property back to Mrs. Templin upon her agreeing to pay the sum of $779.50, in instalments of $50 a month. This agreement was consummated in the following manner: At about two o’clock A. m., on December 18, 1877, the property was removed from Templin’s to a shed on the property of his adjoining neighbor, and there delivered to Rothermel, who gave up his notes. In the forenoon of the same day it was moved back to Templin’s place and delivered to Mrs. Templin, who thereupon executed and delivered to Rothermel an instrument of writing purporting to be a bill of sale of the same goods to him, reciting a consideration of $779.50 paid by Rothermel to her, and providing that upon payment by her to Rothermel of the sum of $50 on the first days of each month thereafter, until the said sum of $779.50, with interest, was fully paid, then the said instrument to be null and void, otherwise to remain in full force. Levi Templin then made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. Mrs. Templin retained possession of the said goods, and the butchering business was continued by Levi Templin, for his wife, in the same place and manner as theretofore, except, that receipts and checks, &amp;c., were signed “L. Templin, agent,” instead of “L. Templin.” Mrs. Templin paid regularly the instalments due Rothermel, the last payment being made February 14, 1879. Levi Templin claimed and received $300 in cash and furniture from his assignee for creditors, which he gave to his wife. There was no evidence that Mrs. Templin had any separate estate not derived from her husband.</p>

You have heard what the witnesses said about the bill of sale, and it is for the jury to say whether this was an honest, fair, and bona fide transaction; and if it was, under the view the court has of the law, the title passed over to the wife, upon her paying for it. It is claimed on the part of the defendant that all the earnings that were had, or everything that was done by the husband in carrying on the business of his wife, belonged to the husband. We say to you, as a matter of law, that the wife had a right to carry on business in her own name. She had a right to employ her husband as her'agent, and if the business was honestly carried along for the benefit of the wife, all the earnings that were had in the business belonged to the wife, and if the payment of the property was made by the earnings of the business which was carried on by the wife, the wife was legally the owner of it. If the husband’s money paid for the property, it would be the husband’s property. But if the. property was paid for by the business as it was carried on by the wife, the property was hers. <em>. ... . </em>The jury will ascertain from the evidence whether the property was paid for out of the business which was carried on by the wife ; and if so, she became owner of it when she made the last payment in February, 1879, and it being her property, the sheriff could <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>not sell it, and for that property the verdict would have to be in favor of the plaintiff.</p>

But even had it been bona fide, it would not avail the plaintiff in the issue, because she -utterly' failed to show that she had any separate estate, and the evidence was that the alleged purchase of the goods by her from Rothermel was made upon her credit, the instalments to be paid out of her subsequent earnings from the business, and that they were in fact so paid. It is well settled that this cannot be done as against the husband’s creditors. When the wife has no separate estate she cannot acquire property on her pei’sonal credit; her earnings during coverture belong to her husband, and are liable for his debts: Bucher <em>v. </em>Ream, 18 P.

A married woman must have a separate estate, to protect her purchase upon credit, an estate available, and proportionate to the credit it supports.

But a married woman cannot acquire title to land upon the credit of its after production, nor to any property or business upon its prospective profits. . The production and profits are, in general, the result of the labor of the husband and wife, or their children, and, whilst creditors have no claim on the husband’s labor or that of his family, as such, yet 'when that labor acquires title to property, they may have a-' claim upon the .property thus acquired. When the estate is hers, the production is hers, the labor expended in realizing income cannot affect the title to either. . • .</p>

Templin the rights of a feme sole trader could, without more, have any effect upon the determination of this case. It is true that a portion of the property embraced in the sheriff's levy, was purchased after the date of this decree, but with whose funds was the purchase made ? It has not been shown that the purchase was made with the moneys of the wife; where a wife claims property, as against her husband’s creditors, she must show affirmatively by clear and full proof, that she paid for it with her own separate funds: Keeney <em>v. </em>Good, 9 Harris, 355; Gamber v.

It was not the intention of the legislature to dispense witli the presumptions which ordinarily and of necessity arise in favor of creditors, in transactions between husband and wife, affecting the ownership of property in the wife’s name. The Act of 8d April, 1872, P. L., 85, provides merely that the separate earnings of any married woman, howsoever realized, shall accrue to and inure to her separate benefit and use, and be under her exclusive control, as if she were feme sole, and not be liable to any claim of the husband or his creditors.
