L., 583,] regulating the sherifT’s fees in the county of Luzerne, being special in its provisions, extends to all the territory which was then included within the limits of the county. Said Act was _ not repealed by the general fee bill of June 12, 1878, (P. L., 188,) fixing the fees of officers in counties having less inhabitants than Luzerne; hence, the fees of the sheriff of Lackawanna county, when it was subsequently erected out of Luzerne county, continued to be governed by the local act of 1873, although the number of the inhabitants of the new county brought it within the limits fixed by the general law.</p>

Many difficulties arise in questions raised after the division of a county, or the <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>erection of a new county. We Lave invariably held that the local laws of Luzerne county, passed for the territory, and the benefit of their inhabitants and their control, are still in force in the new county. This Act relating to the fees of a public officer, we consider one of those laws which concern the inhabitants of the territory, and not alone a mere personal privilege. Various reasons might be urged for the passage of such an Act, many of which would show that it was not as a mere gratuity to the sheriff. He is a public officer in a sense that many officers are not. His duties are not confined to the territory of the county in which he holds his office. Many of the reasons which warrant the Act relating to Luzerne county are of force in Lackawanna. The Act of 1878 excludes Luzerne county from its provisions, and of course, at the time of its passage, excluded the territory and inhabitants of the portion of Luzerne now comprised in Lackawanna.</p>

The officer referred to in the Act, to wit: the sheriff of Luzerne county, still exists, and is not affected by this suit. Suppose Lackawanna county had been formed from Luzerne, Susquehanna, and Wayne, and each of these counties had a special law fixing the fees of the sheriff, which one would the sheriff of Lackawanna county come under? At the time Lackawanna county was organized, there was a general law governing counties of the class to which it belonged by reason of population, and to this general law of June 12, 1878, it was subject: Luzerne County <em>v. </em>Griffith, 10 Luz. Leg. Peg., 37. Moreover, we submit that the Act of 1873 was repealed by the Act of March 31, 1876, (P. L., 13,) and the Act of June 12, 1878, revising the whole subject matter: Bartlet <em>v. </em>King, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Am.%20Dec.%20105" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Am. Dec. 105">7 Am. Dec., 105</a>; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Cromley, 1 Ashmead, 179. The principle that a subsequent statute is a repeal of <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>all repugnant provisions in a prior one, applies with special' force where the prior enactment is local and the new one general in its operation: Nusser <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Casey, 127; Keller <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 21 P. F. S., 413. This is not a case stated, and therefore a stipulation for a writ of error was not necessary.</p>

It follows that this writ should be quashed: Hughes <em>v. </em>Peaslee, 14 Wr., 257. All the laws applicable to Luzerne county at the time of the division are in full force in the new county, because it was erected in whole from the old county: Parsons <em>v. </em>Winslow, <a href="/grant/1/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Grant 160" data-case-ids="225849" data-case-paths="/grant/1/0160-01">1 Grant, 160</a>.

    <p id="b486-10" data-blocks='[["BL_486.12",486,[269,1595,1180,821]]]'>The Act of 9th April, 1873, applied to the county of Luzerne only. It was, therefore, special in its provisions, and extended to the whole territory within the limits of its boundaries. When the Act of 12th June, 1878, was passed, the county contained more than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants. It was, therefore, by the express terms of the Act, excepted from the operation thereof. The latter Act did not repeal this special law in force in the county of Luzerne. Did the subsequent formation of the county of Lackawanna, out of a portion of the territory, operate as a repeal thereof in the new county? We think not. The Act providing for the formation of the cotmty did not repeal any of the special laws then in force. Although the name of the municipality which covered this portion of the territory was changed, yet the effect thereof was not, by implication, to repeal any local law then in force within its boundaries. It follows that the Act of 9th April, 1873, is still in force within the county of Lackawanna, and the learned judge committed no error in entering judgment in favor of the defendant in error.</p>
