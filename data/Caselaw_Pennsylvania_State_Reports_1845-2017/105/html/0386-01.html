The sheriff made ineffectual efforts to get at it or see it; he then advertised the hearse and sold it with other property actually levied upon.

For a much stronger reason, a sale without actual seizure would be held valid against a defendant who prevented an officer from seizing the goods where the latter made- an effort to levy, and was prevented from doing so by the defendant. Stuckert was only the bailee of the defendant with no right, whatever, to detain the property. At the time of the purchase by the plaintiffs, the defendant in this case was in no position to challenge the validity of the sheriff’s sale. It must be held that the plaintiffs’ title is good unless it is admitted that Stuckert, by virtue of his purchase under his own execution, issued afterwards, acquired a title superior to that of the plaintiffs.</p>

He had obstructed the officer in the execution of the writ of <em>fi. fa., </em>issued by the plaintiffs. After establishing title in the defendant in the execution, and a sale by the sheriff, the plaintiffs’ title is made out <em>prima fade. </em>The law presumes that the officer acted regularly and had made a levy. The defendant’s attack upon that title, in the way of throwing an informality on the levy, discloses his own illegal act; he demonstrates that the sheriff did not take or see the hearse, because he, the defendant, obstructed the sheriff by locking up the carriage, with a view of preventing its being taken by the officer of the law. The defendant is not entitled to the consideration or protection of the law, either as a subsequent execution creditor, or as the purchaser at the subsequent sale. The old axiom is: “No man shall take advantage of his own wrong.” Therefore the Court arrives at the following conclusions of law:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b407-4" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[156,1161,1170,172]]]'>First — That on October 23, 1879, the plaintiffs had a valid title to the hearse, for damages for the conversion of which this suit is brought, and that the defendant wrongfully withheld the possession of said property from the plaintiffs.</p>
