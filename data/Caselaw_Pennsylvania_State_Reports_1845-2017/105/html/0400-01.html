J., of the 28d Judicial District, the following facts appeared: Mrs. Brobst and Reuben Sieger, deceased, were owners of contiguous lots in the city of Allentown. Both had obtained their titles thereto by deed from Jacob Ritter, the father of Mrs. Brobst. In <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>186T or thereabouts,'Reuben Sieger erected a brick shop, on his lot, the'western wall of which, according to the plaintiff’s testimony, was built up to the line, dividing his lot-from that of Mrs. Brobst, but did not go beyond it. The defendants claimed, however, and gave evidence to prove that this wall overran the said division line from three to five inches, and to that extent was built upon Mrs. Brobst’s land. There was some .evidence offered on behalf of the defendants that at the time of the erection of this wall, Reuben Sieger saw Ritter and acknowledged, that in building his shop he had erected the western wall partly upon Mrs. Brobst’s lot, and that there? upon Mrs. Brobst agreed to allow said wall to stand, in consideration of being allowed to use it, if she ever built upon her own lot. In 1878, Jacob Ritter commenced to build under his own direction, with his own money, but for Mrs. Brobst’s benefit, a brick shop upon her lot. In the erection of this shop he built against the said western wall of Sieger’s shop by cutting holes into the bricks and inserting therein the girders, beams, joists, etc., of his own building. There was some evidence tending to show that these, girders, etc., were not inserted beyond the line of Mrs. Brobst’s lot. • At the time of the erection ,of this building Mrs. Brobst-was covert. The defendants put in evidence the record of a former suit.between Reuben Sieger and Mrs. Brobst, to show that in said suit Sieger-recognized . the wall to be a party wall.

Our defence in the-court below did-not,-as erroneously stated in the charge to the jury, proceed upon the ground that the Avail was in the nature of a party wall. We'contended, on the contrary, that if the girders of Mrs. Brobst’s building were not inserted beyond the line of her lot the plaintiff could not recover. The court entirely disregarded our testimony upon this point, and failed' to submit the question involved therein to the jury.

Actions for trespass may be brought either against the master who commands the unlawful act, or against the servant, who actually commits the trespass: Addison on Torts, § 1312; Drake Kiely, <a href="/pa/93/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="93 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="442097" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0492-01">93 Pa.

    <p id="b421-11" data-blocks='[["BL_421.13",421,[166,1892,1179,300]]]'>The defendants below now allege that they did not proceed-upon the theory that the wall in dispute Avas in the nature of a party wall, but that, on the contrary, they contended the wall Avas built over on defendants’ ground, from two to three inches at the alley, and from four .to five inches in the rear,, and in using the wall neither the lintels nor the girders Avere inserted so as to go beyond the line.</p>

The court treated the case as. the parties treated it, and if the jury Avere misled by the charge, as is asserted in the third assignment, the court in turn was misled by the parties. If the wall in question Avas a party Avail, either by statute, or the agreement of the <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>parties, the defendants would have the right, to úse it upon making.compensation. But to cut into it without having first made compensation would constitute the person doing so a trespasser: Ingles <em>v. </em>Bringhurst, 1 Dallas, 341; Masson’s Appeal, 20 P. F. S., 26. In point of fact the plaintiff contended that,the wall stood on his own ground. This, if true, would give defendants no right to use the wall with or without compensation.: . The defendants alleged, as before stated, that the wall was built over on them two or three inches. This, if true, would have made the plaintiff a trespasser, and he could have been required to take the wall down, or the defendants might perhaps have waived the trespass, and used the wall without compensation. But for some purpose, which to my mind is not clear, the question of the wall being a party wall was brought into the case and produced little save confusion. The defendants, instead of asking an instruction upon the facts, as they now contend them to be, asked the court to charge that if the wall in question was a party wall the plaintiff could not recover. See defendants’ fourth and fifth points. This instruction was very properly refused. Had it been a party wall there would have been no defence. How then can we say that the court erred in submitting to the jury the question, “was this a party wall? ”</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[251,1414,1181,690]]]'>■ Not only did the defendants raise this question by their points, but the same thing runs through the testimony. There was a plain attempt on the part of the defendants to establish the party wall theory, and an evident desire , upon the cross-examination of the plaintiff to obtain such an admission. Not, only so, but .on page 48 of the Appendix I find the following: “ Defendant offers in evidence the record of the suit of Reuben Sieger <em>v. </em>Mary E. Brobst, brought to September Term, 1878, No. 23, in the Common Pleas of Lehigh county. Suit was brought September 25, 1878. We offer this, together with plaintiff’s affidavit of claim, and the declaration in the cause, •for the purpose of showing that Mr. Sieger recognized the wall as a party wall, and sought to charge Mary E. Brobst with one half value of the wall as a party wall. , Objected to as incompetent and irrelevant; it is admitted for the purpose of an admission as a party wall.”</p>
    <p id="b422-6" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[257,2104,1170,85]]]'>■ The defendants have no just ground to complain that the court submitted the case to the jury as they presented it.</p>

He says in his testimony that he put up the building and paid for it. That it was for his daughter’s benefit can make no difference. , The only question is as to the measure of damages. The court.instructed the. jury that they “could go to the extent of the wall used, and compensate the plaintiff.” ,- This <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>was as favorable to the defendant as he could expect. Had there been circumstances of aggravation, vindictive damages would have been permitted: Amerw.Longstreth, 10B., 145: There were no such circumstances, and the court very properly confined the jury to compensation.</p>
    <p id="b423-6" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[169,664,1176,766]]]'>It was urged, however, that as Mr. Ritter was the builder, and his daughter the owner of the property, nominal damages only could be recovered. This assumes that the only trespass Mr. Ritter could be held for was the cutting of the holes in the wall, and that this did no serious injury. This is a mistake. Making the holes was only a part, and a small part of the trespass. The act complained of was the using of the wall, appropriating it to the use of the new building by building against it. This was a trespass of a permanent character, and if the plaintiff is entitled to recover at all in this form of action lie can recover for the entire injury, against the person committing the trespass. It is familiar law that actions for trespass to real property may be brought either against the hand actually committing the injury, or against the person by whose order and authority the act was done: Frantz <em>v. </em>Lenhart, 6 P. F. S., 365; Drake <em>v. </em>Kiely, 12 Norris, 492. In such case there can be no measure of damages short of compensation.</p>
