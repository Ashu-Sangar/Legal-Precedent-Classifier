It was about ninety feet long, occupied eleven feet space iu width, and had from four hundred to six hundred spindles. It was fastened to the floor by means of screws, and was part of the machinery of the mill. M. A. Furbush &amp; Son, who had originally built the mule for a price which was never paid them, had received from Chappell and Taylor a bill of sale of it, and liad sent their workmen to the mill to remove it. Before the workmen had <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>detached it from the building, Ellicott Fisher, the landlord, came to the mill and threatened to arrest the workmen, giving as a reason that Chappell &amp; Taylor owed him some rent. According to plaintiffs’ witness, Fisher did not state the amount of rent. According to Fisher’s testimony, he said there was five months’ rent due, but it does not appear from- either testimony that he stated the amount of money due. In consequence of Fisher’s threats, Furbush’s men desisted from the attempt to take the machine, and the parties left the mill. According to Fisher’s testimonjq Taylor, one of the tenants, then locked up the mill and gave the key to Fisher, who said that he had possession, and that the machine could not go until the rent was paid. Furbush &amp; Son thereupon sued out this writ of replevin. Fisher afterwards went to the mill with a constable, but found that the sheriff had seized the machine under the writ of replevin.</p>

B., 357, the question of fact, whether there was a distress, was submitted to a jury. But, in any event, the machine was not distrainable, because it was a fixture, and fixtures of every kind are exempt from distress, even those which are removable b3r a tenant, or can be seized under a fi. fa.

As to the position taken by the Court below, that replevin cannot bo maintained for a fixture. As a general proposition this is true, for the reason that the title to real estate cannot be tried in a personal action, but <em>cessante raiione cessat </em>lex, and where the fixture is one which the plaintiff has a right to remove and he claims it as a chattel, by virtue of that right of removal, and not by reason of any claim of ownership to the realty, replevin will lie. Thus replevin will lie for a trade fixture before the expiration of the tenant’s term.

In order to render the distress complete, there must be a seizure of the property distrained upon; but a very slight act amounts, in contemplation of law, to such seizure. Smith’s Landlord and Tenant, *166, 224; Taylor’s L. and T., § 578; Wood’s L. and T., 942; Woodfall’s L. and T., 420; Buller on Distress, 131; Hutchins <em>v. </em>Scott, 2 M. &amp; W., 809; Swann <em>v</em>. Falmouth, 8 B. &amp; C., 456; Thomas <em>v. </em>Harries, 1 M. &amp; G., 695. Only two reasons have ever been assigned for the privilege of fixtures from distress: First, that things annexed to the freehold become part of it; and, second, that nothing can be taken as a pledge for rent which cannot be severed and restored without detriment to the pledge, which fixtures cannot. Gilbert on Distresses, 39. All the text writers referred to by the plaintiffs in error refer to fixtures which are “part of the freehold or thing demised”; and the same is true of the cases cited. The case of Hellawell <em>v. </em>Eastwood, supra, is exactly like the one at bar, and is still law in England, having been approved and followed in later cases. Mather <em>v. </em>Frazer, 2 Kay &amp; Johns., 536; Queen <em>v. </em>Lee L. R., 1 Q. B., 244; Waterfall <em>v. </em>Peniston, 6 Ell. &amp; Black., 876; Turner <em>v. </em>Cameron, L. R., 5 Q.

Holland <em>v. </em>Hodgson, supra, relied on by plaintiffs in error, as overruling Hellawell <em>v. </em>Eastwood, simply criticised the dicta of Baron Parke, and not his decision. In Pennsylvania, as between landlord and tenant, a chattel annexed for trade purposes is not a part of the freehold, but mere personal property.
