On May 20, 1881, Charles M. Hilgert, son of said John Hilgert, by false and fraudulent representations that Powers &amp; Weightman wanted the money for said $6,000 mortgage, and that a certain paper then presented for his signature was a new mortgage to be made to raise money for paying off the same, procured John Hilgert to execute said paper, his wife joining therein, which was dated May 20, 1881. and recorded May 23, 1881. This paper was in fact an absolute deed for said premises to the said Charles M. Hilgert, reciting a nominal consideration of $10,000, no part of which was paid. On January 16,1882, Charles M. Hilgert executed a mortgage of said premises for $25,000 to John. Lowber Welsh, a bona fide mortgagee, which mortgage, and an assignment thereof dated August 5, 1882, to Wm. H. Newbold’s Sons &amp; Co., were duly recorded. Upon a scire facias issued upon said mortgage against Charles M. Hilgert, judgment was obtained September 4, 1882, and a levari facias issued, under which the mortgaged premises were sold at sheriff’s sale for $21,500. The sheriff paid the execution creditor’s debt, interest and costs, and the surplus resulting from said sale, amounting to $1327.35, he paid into Court which is the fund for distribution.</p>

Hilgert procured the said conveyance to himself by actual fraud and hence became a trustee ex maleficio.</p>

When Charles M; Hilgert executed the mortgage the record showed a good title in him, free from- incumbrances, and the mortgagee, having no <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>notice of John Hilgert’s secret equity, obtained the security of the fee simple title. The sheriff’s sale under the mortgage passed the whole title to the mortgaged premises — both the legal and equitable estate — and the surplus proceeds, after paying the mortgage debt, represented the price of John Hilgert’s equitable estate in the premises sold. If the appellants under their judgment had levied on and sold whatever estate Charles M. Hilgert had in the premises, there would be force in their argument that John Hilgert would not be entitled to claim the proceeds of such sale, and the authorities they cite would be applicable. But they have no application where by a sheriff s sale under a bona fide mortgage the entire estate in the land passed to the purchaser. It would be a travesty of justice, if the creditors of Charles M. Hilgert, who paid nothing for his legal estate, should now be let in on the price of his father’s equity.</p>

The remedy of the appellee was to look to the proceeds remaining after the satisfaction of the mortgage taken in good faith, and for a valuable consideration without any knowledge of the fraud.
