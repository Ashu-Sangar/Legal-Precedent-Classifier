    "head_matter": "Stuckert versus Keller.\n1. In order to make a valid levy upon personal property it is not essential that the sheriff should take it into his possession. There may be circumstances under which a levy may be valid even though the sheriff did not have the property within his power or view.\n2. Plaintiffs in an execution directed the sheriff to levy upon a hearse belonging to the defendant in the execution, which was in the possession of a mira party. The sheriff went to the latter\u2019s premises, and demanded the hearse, saying that he came to levy upon it. He was informed that it was locked up, and he could not have it. The sheriff made ineffectual efforts to get at it or see it; he then advertised the hearse and sold it with other property actually levied upon. Subsequently. the party .in possession of the hearse levied upon it under a judgment obtained by him against the defendant in the execution, and bought it at the sheriff\u2019s sale under his execution. In trover by Hie purchaser at the first sale against the purchaser at the second sale. Held, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover.\nFebruary 19, 1884.\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunket, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh county: Of January Term, 1883, No. 308.\nTrover and conversion by Edwin Keller and Samuel S. Keller, against George W. Stuckert, for a hearse. Plea not guilty. The case was, by agreement, tried without a jury, before Albrtotit, P. J., whose findings of fact and conclusions were as follows:\nFirst \u2014 That on October 11, 1879, the plaintiffs entered in this Court a judgment in their favor and against Joseph Keller, on a promissory note with warrant for confession of judgment, for the sum of 85,094.\nSecond \u2014 That on October 11, 1879, a writ of fieri facias was issued on said judgment, returnable to November Term, 1879, it came to the sheriff\u2019s hands on the day aforesaid.\nThird \u2014 Under said writ certain personal property of Joseph Keller was levied on and sold. The hearse here in controversy, however, was not actually levied on ; the officer\u2019s action as to it is set forth in the sixth and seventh finding. All the property sold except the hearse here in controversy was in the store of said Joseph Keller, and there the sale was held. The hearse was advertised along with the other property as required by law. At said sale the hearse was offered, and it was sold to the plaintiffs for the sum of 8500.\nFourth \u2014 In 1875 Joseph Keller became the owner of said hearse, and it was still his property at the time of the said sheriff\u2019s sale, which took place on October 22, 1879.\nFifth \u2014 From 1875 down to the time of said sale said hearse was kept for storage and shelter, when not in use, at the livery stable of the defendant, Stuckert, about two blocks from said store, under an arrangement that Joseph Keller would hire the horses from Stuckert whenever he had occasion to use the hearse at funerals; that in consideration of that patronage, Stuckert agreed to charge nothing for the storage of the hearse. During all said time the hearse was kept in the carriage house of Stuckert, Joseph Keller obtaining and using it whenever ho chose; the latter had the right to use or remove it whenever he desired to do so. Stuckert had no lien or claim upon the hearse.\nSixth \u2014 That the plaintiffs in the execution directed the sheriff to levy on the hearse. In consequence the sheriff, on October 11th or 12th, proceeded to the stable of Stuckert, where the hearse was, for the purpose of levying on the hearse. It was then in Stuckert\u2019s carriage house, and the door of said house was locked; it had been locked up by the defendant, Stuckert, or by his direction for the purpose of preventing a seizure thereof by the sheriff under plaintiffs\u2019 writ.\nSeventh \u2014 The sheriff, when at the stable to make the levy, demanded the hearse from the defendant\u2019s employees in charge, who informed him that he. could not have it. The sheriff looked for it but he failed to find it; he never saw it until after the sheriff\u2019s sale.\nEighth \u2014 Stuckert was present at the sheriff\u2019s sale while the hearse was being offered by the crier; it has not been shown that he was there when it was struck off to the plaintiff. Before it was put up for sale, and at the place of sale, the sheriff demanded the hearse from Stuckert but the latter refused to give it up.\nNinth \u2014 On October 23, 1879, the plaintiff demanded, of Stuckert, the hearse, and the latter refused to deliver it.\nTenth \u2014 On November 12, 1879, Stuckert obtained, in this Court, a judgment against Keller, and on December 4, 1879, issued execution to January Term, 1880. Under that execution the sheriff actually seized the hearse at Stuekert\u2019s stable, where it had remained in Stuckert\u2019s possession, and on December 4, 1879, sold it to said Stuckert.\nEleventh \u2014 That at the time of demand (October 23,1879), Ihe value of said hearse was $650, and interest on that sum to this date (November 6, 1882) is $118.30; the amount of the value with interest added is the sum of $768.30.\nDid the plaintiff acquire title to the hearse by virtue of the purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale?\nThere was no such levy as would be good against other execution creditors under ordinary circumstances; the sheriff did not have the hearse in his power or control, nor was it in his view: Duncan\u2019s Ap., 1 Wr., 500; Carey v. Bright, 8 P. F. S., 70. In Trovillo v. Tilford, 6 Watts, 468, it was held that a levy was to be considered good as against a defendant in an execution, without an actual seizure, where it had been agreed between the defendant and the sheriff, that a levy by the officer should be dispensed with, a list of the goods having been furnished by the defendant, who was to remain in possession of the property. For a much stronger reason, a sale without actual seizure would be held valid against a defendant who prevented an officer from seizing the goods where the latter made- an effort to levy, and was prevented from doing so by the defendant. Stuckert was only the bailee of the defendant with no right, whatever, to detain the property. At the time of the purchase by the plaintiffs, the defendant in this case was in no position to challenge the validity of the sheriff\u2019s sale. It must be held that the plaintiffs\u2019 title is good unless it is admitted that Stuckert, by virtue of his purchase under his own execution, issued afterwards, acquired a title superior to that of the plaintiffs.\nBut to sustain defendant\u2019s claim to the hearse under his purchase, would bo to permit him to reap the benefit of a palpable wrong, committed by himself. He had obstructed the officer in the execution of the writ of fi. fa., issued by the plaintiffs. After establishing title in the defendant in the execution, and a sale by the sheriff, the plaintiffs\u2019 title is made out prima fade. The law presumes that the officer acted regularly and had made a levy. The defendant\u2019s attack upon that title, in the way of throwing an informality on the levy, discloses his own illegal act; he demonstrates that the sheriff did not take or see the hearse, because he, the defendant, obstructed the sheriff by locking up the carriage, with a view of preventing its being taken by the officer of the law. The defendant is not entitled to the consideration or protection of the law, either as a subsequent execution creditor, or as the purchaser at the subsequent sale. The old axiom is: \u201cNo man shall take advantage of his own wrong.\u201d Therefore the Court arrives at the following conclusions of law:\nFirst \u2014 That on October 23, 1879, the plaintiffs had a valid title to the hearse, for damages for the conversion of which this suit is brought, and that the defendant wrongfully withheld the possession of said property from the plaintiffs.\nSecond \u2014 That the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against the defendant for the sum of $768.30.\nExceptions filed to the findings and decision of the court were overruled, and judgment was entered on the decision in favor of the plaintiffs for $768.80. The defendant took this writ of error, assigning for error the overruling of his exceptions, and the said judgment.\nR. E. Wright & Son, for the plaintiffs in error. \u2014\nAlthough the strictness of the English rule requiring actual manual possession to be taken of personal property by the sheriff to constitute a good levy is not adhered to in Pennsylvania, yet it has always been required (with a single exception) that \u201c a valid levy upon personal property cannot be made unless the sheriff has it within his power and control, or at least within his view: \u201d Wood v. Vanarsdale, 3 Rawle, 405; Linton v. Commonwealth, 10 Wr., 294; Duncan\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wr., 502; Weidensaul v. Reynolds, 13 Wr., 76 ; Commonwealth v. Berger, 6 Wr., 285; Carey v. Bright, 8 P. F. S., 81; McClelland v. Slingluff, 7 W. & S., 134; Schuylkill Co. Appeal, 6 Cas., 358; Welsh v. Bell, 8 Cas., 17. The exception referred to is where the defendant himself expressly waived the levy: Trovillo v. Tilford, 6 Watts, 468. If this exception is to be extended to permit the action of a third party to have such effect, then a paper levy may be resorted to in all cases where the person in possession of the goods under a claim of right objects to the levy. The fact that a levy was prevented by Stuekert, whether rightfully or wrongfully, cannot have the effect of giving the purchaser title under a sheriff\u2019s sale made without a levy.\nJames S. Biery, for the defendants in error.\n\u2014 The cases cited by plaintiffs in error apply to successive execution creditors, raising a question of the validity of the levy, and do not apply to this case. There are many exceptions to the rule requiring that the sheriff shall have the property levied on within his power or view: Allentown Bank v. Beck, 13 Wr., 394; Trovillo v. Tilford, 6 Watts, 468; Welsh v. Bell, 8 Cas., 12; Wilson\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris, 428; Shafner v. Gilmore, 3 W. & S., 438; Lewis v. Smith, 2 S. & R., 142."
