        "text": "Chief Justice Mercur\ndelivered the opinion of the court, October 6, 1884.\nThis suit was against Catharine Burke as a feme sole trader oply. It was in that capacity only that a recovery against her was sought.1 Her husband was not joined with her in the action. Her affidavit of defence avers, inter alia, that she was then, and at the time of the issuing of the summons a married woman, \u2019the wife of Joseph E. Burke, to whom she was married oh the 4th of October, 1860, and that she had lived and cohabited with him as his wife ever since. She further averred \u201cthat this deponent is not now and never has been declared a feme sole trader, and is not now and never was such.\u201d This certainly is a positive and distinct denial of the existence of the alleged fact, on which the right to recover against her was based. If there be any other it is not averred in the pleadings. Whether some other grounds may be shown on the trial to maintain the action, is a question not now before us. When an affidavit of defence distinctly and unequivocally denies the fact, without which a recovery cannot be had, the court should not hold it insufficient. This affidavit does so deny such a fact.\nIt follows the learned Judge erred in ordering a judgment to be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.\nJudgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.",

B., a feme sole trader,\u201d an affidavit of defence that the defendant \u201cis not now and never has been declared a feme sole trader, and is not now and never was such,\u201d is sufficient to orevent judgm ent for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.\nJanuary 23d, 1884.\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Steebett, Green and Clark, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas No. 3, of Philadelphia county: Of January Term, 1884, No. 71.\nThis was, in the court below, an appeal from the judgment of a magistrate, in a suit by Andrew Adams and Itichard Sheldon, late trading as Sheldon & Adams, against \u201c Catharine Burke (a feme sole trader.) \u201d Plaintiff filed in the Common Pleas a copy of book entries charged against \u201c C. Burke.\u201d Defendant filed the following affidavit of defence:\n\u201c That she is now and was at the time of the issuing of the summons in this case, a married woman, tiie wife of Joseph E. Burke, to whom she was married on the 4th October, 1860, and that she has lived and cohabited with him as his wife ever since. That this deponent is not now and never has been declared a feme sole trader, and is not now and never was such.\u201d\nPlaintiff took a rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, which the court made absolute, whereupon the defendant took this writ of error, assigning for error the said judgment.\nW. A. Manderson, for the plaintiff in error.\nJV. Dubois Miller ( O. H. Krumbhaar with him), for the defendant in error.\n\u2014 The affidavit is insufficient in that it fails to deny that the defendant had traded as a feme solo; it is not enough to deny that she is or has been declared ruch, as she\nmay engage in business and render herself liable as a feme sole without being actually and technically a feme sole trader; that she did so trade is in effect imputed by the record, and as she did not deny it, the affidavit was insufficient.
