Unfortunately, the appellant failed to have judgment entered on the verdict before this appeal was taken. We have repeatedly held that, in the absence of such judgment, no appeal lies: Lynch v. Metropolitan L. Ins. Co., 422 Pa. 488, 222 A. 2d 925. In Lynch, the Court said (page 489): \u201cNo judgment on .the verdict has ever been entered. In the absence of such judgment no appeal lies. In Menyo v. Sphar, 409 Pa. 223, 224 (footnote), 186 A. 2d 9, we recently said: \u2018Too many members of the Bar mistakenly believe that the appeal is from an Order which dismissed their motion for a new trial, instead of from a judgment which was entered on the verdict: [citing authorities].\u2019 See also: Denmon v. Rhodes, 416 Pa. 568, 569, 207 A. 2d 860; Gelzhiser v. Fisher, 418 Pa. 88, 208 A. 2d 836. [Emphasis in original]\n\u201cThe instant appeal, being premature, must be quashed.\u201d\nAppeal quashed.\nMr. Justice Mtjsmanno and Mr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.",
