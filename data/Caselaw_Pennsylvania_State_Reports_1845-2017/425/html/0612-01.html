Wood, while represented by counsel entered a plea of guilty in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Delaware County to an indictment charging him with burglary and larceny. Following a guilty plea hearing, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three to six years.</p>
    <p id="b650-7" data-blocks='[["BL_650.10",650,[197,1295,1152,482]]]'>In March 1966, Wood filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. §1180-1 (Supp. 1966), wherein he alleged that Ms guilty plea had been unlawfully induced. In April the court dismissed the petition without a hearing; an appeal was taken to the Superior Court where the order was affirmed per curiam. <a href="/pa-super/208/0765-02" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="208 Pa.

A few months before his arrest, petitioner had been released from prison on parole and he further asserts that this same agent threatened that his failure to co-operate would result in the im<a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>position of the maximum sentence under the burglary charge as well as the revocation of his parole.</p>
    <p id="b651-3" data-blocks='[["BL_651.4",651,[136,523,1156,1261]]]'>At the time the plea was entered, the court did not question petitioner about whether he was aware of the consequences of his actions. Although our cases have not made such an inquiry an absolute prerequisite, preferring to treat each case upon its own circumstances, we have repeatedly warned that without a record demonstration that the decision to so plead is the defendant’s own voluntary and intelligent choice, the plea’s validity may be undermined in a subsequent collateral proceeding.

Moreover, in the instant case, during the plea hearing, petitioner’s counsel informed the court about the alleged assurance made to petitioner concerning his hospitalization. The court responded that it knew nothing about such recommendation, but that it was going to send petitioner back to the penitentiary anyway. Counsel’s request for a continuance in order to produce the state official was opposed by the district attorney and denied by the court.</p>

Accordingly the Commonwealth claims that this particular issue must be deemed to have been finally litigated or waived under §4 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In the first place it is not clear whether the Commonwealth’s position is that the induced guilty plea was actually litigated in the prior habeas proceeding or the failure to litigate it amounts to a waiver. The 1965 habeas petition alleged that the state had obtained a confession in an unconstitutional manner. While it is true that some of the same allegations contained in the present petition were involved in the 1965 hearing, the factors which would vitiate a guilty plea and those which would lead to the exclusion of a confession are not identical. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Kerekes v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/423/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="423 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1903177" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0337-01">423 Pa. 337</a>, 346, n.8, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%20699" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="223 A.2d 699">223 A. 2d 699</a>, 704, n.8 (1966). Petitioner insists that the waiver provision of §4 is not applicable because at the time the first collateral petition was filed he was not aware that the entry of his plea itself could be challenged. While this in itself <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>might be further explored at a hearing, we may not infer an intelligent waiver from a silent record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
