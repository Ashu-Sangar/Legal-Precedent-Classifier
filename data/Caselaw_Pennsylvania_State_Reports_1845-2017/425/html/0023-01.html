The land was used by the public especially the youth of the Township for approximately five months during each year; located thereon were two softball fields with bleachers, backstops, and permanent bases, provided, with township funds, by the recreation board. In October, 1963, the Township sold approximately one-third acre of this land to an adjoining church, and at that time, the Township, acting through its commissioners, placed in the township records a so-called “statement of principles” to the effect that this land was not for sale and would not be for sale unless and until substitute land was available, that it would not be for sale until highway plans of the Commonwealth which would take part of the property were finalized and that no agreement for the sale of any substantial part of this land would be entered into “without first holding a public hearing.”</p>

While there is a conflict of testimony as to what transpired at <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>that meeting, there was testimony that George Goodman was willing to offer $125,000 for the land as then zoned, although the Township witnesses stated such offer was contingent upon the zoning being changed. Late in March 1966, the township commissioners met with one John P. Acchione, and, on April 4, 1966, at a regular meeting, the commissioners authorized the sale of the land to Acchione for $100,000 at a private, not a public, sale. On April 6, 1966, the township commissioners entered into a written agreement with Acchione “or his nominee” for the sale of the land for $100,000, this agreement stating, inter alia, “This agreement is subject to the approval of any Court which may be required and if Court approval cannot be obtained then this agreement shall become null and void.” By a letter mailed to the township commissioners and read at their regular meeting on May 2, 1966, Messrs. Goodman protested the proposed private sale to Acchione for $100,000 and stated that they would bid at a public sale at least $125,000 upon the same conditions as contained in the Township-Acchione agreement of April 6, 1966.</p>

It is true that the mere possession of discretionary power by an administrative body does not make it wholly immune from judicial review, but the scope of that review is limited to the determination of whether there has been a manifest and flagrant abuse of discretion or a purely arbitrary execution of the agency’s duties or functions.

However, without any notice whatsoever to the public of an intent to sell the land, without holding the “public hearing” pledged in 1963, without making any attempt whatsoever to ascertain whether Goodmans or anyone else were <em>then </em>interested in purchasing this property, without considering whether a public rather than a private sale would call forth a better price, the township officials, in late March, 1966, met with Acchione and agreed to accept from him $100,000 for this land. Thereafter, on April 4, 1966, the township commissioners authorized the sale of the land to Acchione for $100,000. Before any petition had been presented to the court for approval of the contemplated private sale of this land, the township commissioners knew that the land could be sold to Goodmans for a price $25,000 in excess of the price offered by Acchione, yet they persisted in attempting to effect a sale to Acchione. The only notice to the public of the proposed disposition, by way of sale, of this land was <em>after </em>execution of the AcchioneTownship agreement and <em>at </em>the time of presentation to the court of Acchione’s petition for the sale under the Revised Price Act, supra.</p>

An examination of the agreement of sale between Acchione and the Township indicates that, in their haste to complete the deal, the township commissioners sold not only the land but the sewage pumping station. While the court below dismissed this fact with the suggestion that it could see no public interest to be served by the retention of such pumping station, yet the failure of the Township to note in some manner the disposal <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>of this township asset eloquently points to the slipshod manner in which this transaction was handled.</p>

Under the distinction drawn in <em>Baton, </em>the instant sale was clearly a judicial sale. In <em>Baton, </em>we also held that where a higher offer is made following a judicial sale, the acceptance or the refusal of such higher offer is in the sound discretion of the court.

The private sale of this land under the circumstances should not have been approved. Our review of this record reveals no reason to justify a private rather than a public sale of this land upon which a trust had been imposed nor do we find any “other sufficient cause” to justify the sale under the circumstances. While the law entrusts considerable discretion to the court to which a petition is presented under the Bevised Price Act, supra, we believe that in approving this sale the court below abused its discretion. The Township was acting in a fiduciary capacity and its actions in effecting this sale fell far short of the statutory duty placed upon fiduciaries. The failure by the Township to make any effort to <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>obtain a more advantageous price for this land constituted a breach of its trust.</p>
