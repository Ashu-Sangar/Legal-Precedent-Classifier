Initially, the taxpayer contends that mailing of the tax assessment by the tax collector to the taxpayer did not constitute a “decision of the collector” within the statutory provision and, therefore, the billing was advisory only, the taxpayer was not required to appeal and the present proceeding should terminate. This contention is without merit. No other rational construction can be given to the assessment of this delinquent tax and the mailed notice thereof other than as a “decision of the collector” within the legislative intendment. The assessment by the tax collector of the tax constituted a ruling that taxes for the pertinent years were then due and owing to the School District from the taxpayer.</p>

The instant action is against a political subdivision, to wit, the School District. It could not be otherwise under the factual posture presented. The tax collector for the School District made an assessment of a tax against the taxpayer; to dispute the validity of such assessment the taxpayer instituted an action against the School District, a political subdivision.

The statute contemplates such activities upon the part of the corporation within the taxing district as may be <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>equated with an engagement in business or commercial activities within the statutory definition. Our case law, interpretative of this statute and other statutes dealing with “doing business”, has delineated the type of conduct which will constitute “doing business”. The instant taxpayer’s activities do not rise to the standard required to make it subject to this form of taxation. Viewing the factual situation from the point of view most favorable to the School District, what were the taxpayer’s activities within the taxing district? The taxpayer had some customers in Philadelphia who, on occasion, were visited by the taxpayer’s “promotion men” or metallurgists, either for the promotion of good will or the investigation of complaints, and to such customers taxpayer’s products were shipped to Philadelphia by common carriers, the freight being paid by the customers; taxpayer listed in the Philadelphia telephone directory its two offices outside Philadelphia, and advertised in trade journals which had some circulation within the taxing district. On the other hand, the taxpayer maintained no office, plant or warehouse in the taxing district, its personnel have no authority whatsoever to accept orders from customers in the taxing district and all sales were made and effected outside the taxing district. Under such factual picture, the evidence falls far short of establishing the statutory base justifying the imposition of this tax. Cf. <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. v.

The plant and the Bala Cynwyd office are listed in the Philadelphia telephone directories and both have Philadelphia exchange telephone numbers. All of the contracts for the goods sold to purchasers located in Philadelphia are purely intrastate transactions. Three representatives of the Alan Wood Company’s Bala Cynwyd office regularly call upon customers located in Philadelphia, namely, contractors and architects who use or have need for the products manufactured by the company. In addition to the sales representatives, the company employs metallurgists who consult with and advise prospective customers in Philadelphia regarding their needs and investigate customer complaints.
