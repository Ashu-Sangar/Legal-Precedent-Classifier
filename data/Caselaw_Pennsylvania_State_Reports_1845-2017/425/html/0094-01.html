The appellees, Clement DaPra and Antoinette DaPra, his wife, are the holders of a restaurant liquor license. The tavern which they operate under the trade name of Clem’s Cafe, is in the Borough of Canonsburg, Washington County. A police officer of the Borough, while patrolling, on or about February 8, 1965, noticed a young man come out of the tavern carrying a bag. The officer stopped to question him, and the young man dropped the bag and ran, but was apprehended immediately. Mr. DaPra admitted that he had made the sale of 4 quarts of Iron City beer after having inquired of the age of the young man, and after he had produced a draft card issued in West Virginia. The draft card indicated that the person to whom it was issued was born February 1, 1938. Interrogation revealed that the young man’s name was Charles Smith, of McDonald, Pennsylvania, and he was using a draft card issued to another person from whom he bought it. Charles Smith was turned over to the juvenile authorities, and the attendant newspaper publicity drew attention to the incident, and the Liquor Control Board issued a citation to the licensees, the appellees herein. The Board suspended the license of the appellees for 10 days, finding that: “The licensees, their servants, agents or employes sold, furnished and/or gave or permitted such sale, furnishing and/or giving of alcoholic <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>beverages to minors, on February 8, 1964.” This order was appealed to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Washington County, which court sustained the appeal and reversed the board’s order suspending the license.</p>

The proprietor, who was tending bar at the time, had a question as to the customer’s age because he Tooted border-line’. So challenged, Smith produced a draft card showing that he was Lewis William Nestor, of Rowlesburg, West Virginia.” The court also found that the description on the draft card “fits him almost perfectly”, Smith. The court further noted that “Our County has a border on the State of West Virginia, and it is not at all uncommon for West Virginia license plates to be seen on the streets of Washington County towns, or for West Virginians to do business, look for work, or seek refreshment in Washington, Claysville, Canonsburg or Fredericktown. The Hearing Judge finds it a fact that Smith’s artful deception did deceive Clement DaPra, licensee, on the stated date. Since Smith had a West Virginia draft card, it would have been idle to have asked him for Pennsylvania type identification, either that furnished by the Liquor Control Board or voter’s registration.” The court found that Mr. DaPra was a man of good reputation and that there had been no previous record of any infraction of the Liquor Control Laws. The court further held that “Under the circumstances, therefore, it seems proper to sustain the appeal. To do otherwise would be to exalt form over substance. The furnishing and perusal of the West Virginia draft <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>card would seem to be substantial, although not meticulous, compliance with the relevant legislation.”</p>

The latter act permitted a licensed vendor upon the charge of furnishing liquor to a minor to offer evidence to show that it was not furnished knowingly or negligently.” The Superior Court went on to say that: “The sale of intoxicating liquor was at that time regulated and controlled by the Brooks Law of May 13, 1887, P. L. 108. The Brooks Law prohibited the sale to minors, and in a proceeding to revoke a license on the ground that the licensee sold liquors to minors, the Supreme Court held that the good faith of the licensee was no excuse or justification for such sale: In re Carlson’s License, <a href="/pa/127/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="127 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="565755" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0330-01">127 Pa. 330</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.%208" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="18 A. 8">18 A. 8</a>.” The court held that under the Liquor Control Act of 1923, P. L. 34, the mere fact of selling intoxicating liquor or beverage to a minor constituted an offense, irrespective of intention or good faith. The Superior Court said in Borehsupra: “In Commonwealth v. Liberty Products Company, <a href="/pa-super/84/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="84 Pa. Super. 473" data-case-ids="662686" data-case-paths="/pa-super/84/0473-01">84 Pa.

The subject is treated in Greenleaf on Evidence (Yol. 3, Sec. 21) as follows: “Ignorance or mistake of fact may in some cases be admitted as an excuse; as where a man intending to do a lawful act, does that which is unlawful. . . . This <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>rule would seem to hold good in all cases when the act, if done knowingly, would be malum in se.

This Court, in its interpretation of decisions coming down from the Supreme Court of the United States, has released, or in some way mitigated the punishment due confessed burglars, robbers and established killers. It seems to me that it might be a little considerate of a man who honestly sells a few thimblefuls of beer to put some bread on his table for himself and family. The lower court said that DaPra was “not particularly successful.” DaPra would not be the first honest man who failed to become rich.</p>
    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.6",139,[136,1559,1153,756]]]'>In reversing the two other courts, this Court goes into a learned discussion between laws malum in se and laws malum prohibitum, taking me back nostalgically to my law school days, but I think that this erudite dissertation could be saved for something a little more substantial than what is involved here. Suppose someone, without the knowledge of the proprietor, turned back the clock in a tavern, and the proprietor sold beer after the official closing hour, according to Eastern Standard Time. Would this Court say that, regardless of clock, calendar, chronometer, or compass, regardless of deception, imposture, and trickery, regardless of common sense and arithmetic, the proprietor was guilty of violating the criminal code?</p>
    <p id="b139-6" data-blocks='[["BL_139.7",139,[139,2327,1150,97]],["BL_140.1",140,[212,399,1150,591]]]'>This is a little case. I should not be writing a Dissenting Opinion about it. Why should I care? The <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>Majority of the Court has spoken. It has spoken bad law, it has jettisoned logic, equity and sapience, but it has spoken, and it should not be my concern to complain about it. I have other cases of far more importance than this one awaiting my attention, study, and midnight lamp, but I am compelled to express my dissent against the decision of the Majority of this Court because I am disturbed about Clement DaPra, an honest citizen and a good church member, who is being stigmatized because someone blindfolded him and pushed him into a pit of undeserved prosecution.</p>
    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[213,1002,1152,421]]]'>When DaPra learned that Charles Smith was not 21 years of age, he hurried to the police station to notify the authorities of what had occurred. He was concerned with the dignity of the law and he was disturbed about young Smith who, he felt, was starting on the wrong path of life. DaPra gave of his time, attention and concern to the law. And for this he is now branded a law-breaker.</p>
    <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.6",140,[213,1445,1154,756]]]'>I cannot help stating with all candor that this case should never have come to the Supreme Court. We had no business to touch it. The court of common pleas, after listening to numerous witnesses, after considering all the evidence, and after taking judicial notice of the West Yirginia-Pennsylvania boundary line and the traffic which passes back and forth over that line, found no violation in the law on the part of DaPra and released him. The Liquor Control Board appealed to the Superior Court, and the Superior Court, after studying the record, after hearing arguments,' and after due deliberation, affirmed the decision of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Washington County and released DaPra as being without fault.</p>
    <p id="b140-6" data-blocks='[["BL_140.7",140,[216,2211,1152,202]],["BL_141.1",141,[136,394,1153,654]]]'>Then the Liquor Control Board, with a Javert persistence, all the while spending the money of the Pennsylvania taxpayers, petitioned this Court for an allocatur. This Court could well have turned down this <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>request for allocatur, as it turns down hundreds. But it allowed the petition. The Liquor Board then again spent large sums of the taxpayers’ money to print the record and brief; its lawyers, again using taxpayers’ money, gave of their expensive time to this monumental litigation, one or more of them traveled to the seat of judgment and delivered themselves of their extensive learning about a little case involving a little tradesman, who had been twice told by the Courts of the Commonwealth to go home and forget about the hard luck which had visited him when someone tripped him and sent him reeling into a brier patch of legal entanglement.</p>
    <p id="b141-4" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[136,1058,1154,530]]]'>This Court then, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the Court of last resort in the Keystone State of the Union, sat in exalted session, listened to the attorneys, went into deliberation, and finally, after months of study, analysis and profound cerebration, produced the decision which overruled the court of quarter sessions, overruled the Superior Court, and overruled the law of common sense, which is as much a part of the jurisprudence of American justice as formalistic codes.</p>
    <p id="b141-5" data-blocks='[["BL_141.6",141,[135,1608,1155,529]]]'>But it is possible I am unfair in complaining. The Majority Opinion has been good to me by providing me with a magic carpet transporting me back in fancy to my halcyon days at Georgetown Law School where I learned with bated breath the distinction between laws malum in se and those malum prohibitum. The Majority Opinion has revived for me those ivy-clad days of my youth when I was joyously drinking in the lesson being taught me that law was the “distillment of reason.”</p>
    <p id="b141-6" data-blocks='[["BL_141.7",141,[137,2158,1152,99]]]'>Alas, I have since found out that that distillation is occasionally diluted by stale beer.</p>
