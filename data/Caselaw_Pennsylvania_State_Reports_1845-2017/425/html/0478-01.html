XIV and Pa. Const. Art. I, §5. In the districts created by city council’s ordinance the average deviation from the ideal is only 4.08% varying from +7.8% for the most populous district to -6.9% for the least populous district, thus creating a ratio between the most and least populated districts of 1.15 to 1. By contrast, in the districts created by the plan proposed by plaintiff Newbold the average deviation from the ideal is 3.53% varying from a +7.8% for the most populous district to a -4.7% for the least populous district and thus creating a ratio between the most and least populated districts of approximately 1.13 to 1. In considering these deviations against state and federal equality guarantees, it must be borne in mind that any dilution of voting power which they appear to represent is substantially reduced by the fact that any potential majority of city council may be composed of those seven of the seventeen councilmen whose <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>election at large preserves precise equality of voting power as to them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Our conviction in this regard is supported by the fact that there appear to be no reported cases in which ratios as small as those here have been successfully challenged. Indeed the ratios of the districts created by this Court’s reapportionment of the General Assembly, <em>Butcher v.

However that may be, there are two short answers to plaintiffs’ contentions. The first is that when this Court redistricted the Pennsylvania Senate it did so in accordance with Pa. Const. Art. II, §16 which provides that senatorial districts <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>shall be “as nearly equal in population as may be.” That language is no different in effect from the “as nearly as possible” language in §2-102 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter. Yet the deviations in population in the Court’s senatorial districts were greater than those in the redistricting ordinance involved here. Hence it must be apparent that this Court views such a deviation as not violative of the equality standard so phrased. The second answer to the plaintiffs’ argument on the basis of the §2-102 of the charter is that neither they nor the court below have suggested a plan which is significantly closer in equality of population than the redistricting ordinance. Thus in light of the importance of permitting reapportionment by the Legislature wherever possible, we certainly do not think that the “as nearly as possible” language of the charter is to be read to permit judicial interference merely because an alternative plan is proposed whose average variation from the ideal is one half of one percent less than the Legislature’s plan and whose maximum ratio is only 2% closer to mathematical perfection than the Legislature’s plan. So to hold would invite a multiplicity of attacks on redistricting legislation by disgruntled factions based on what amounts to de minimis approaches to mathematical equality.</p>

This is indeed a puzzling conclusion in light of the fact that the only reference to gerrymandering on page 463 of our opinion in the first <em>Butcher </em>case appears in a lengthy quotation from the Supreme Court of the United States’ opinion in <em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em><a href="/us/377/0665-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="377 U.S. 533" data-case-ids="6171208" data-case-paths="/us/377/0665-01">377 U.S. 533</a>, 578-79, <a href="/us/377/0665-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="377 U.S. 533" data-case-ids="6171208" data-case-paths="/us/377/0665-01">84 S.

Moreover, an examination of that quotation makes it clear that the Supreme Court of the United States was speaking only of gerrymandering in the context of a situation where substantial equality of population among districts was not present. Thus, there is no basis on page 463 of our first <em>Butcher </em>opinion, nor is there any other basis in Pennsylvania’s present Constitution or laws for the proposition that gerrymandering per se, as distinct from departure from explicit constitutional or statutory requirements of compactness or contiguity, may constitute the sole basis upon which a legislative plan of apportionment may be judicially invalidated.</p>

      <p id="b517-6" data-blocks='[["BL_517.5",517,[154,1793,1154,634]]]'>Mr. Newbold said: “[W]e find some features of Bill 2086 [tbe redistricting ordinance introduced into' City Council] wbicb are highly desirable. For example, according to recent Pennsylvania and United States Supreme Court decisions, the overriding consideration in any redistrieting or reapportionment is population. That is, legislative districts must be as nearly as equal in population as may be in order to meet the test of constitutional validity. The present bill appears to pass that test with flying colors.” Mr. Bussell said: “We certainly won’t quarrel with the population of your proposed districts because as has been said previously, and as Mr. Newbold and I agree, in terms of the population requirements established by the Pennsylvania and United States Supreme Courts, you are in line, and I don’t think there is any question about that.”</p>
