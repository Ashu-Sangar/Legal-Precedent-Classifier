Upon her death, title to a property,—consisting of 192 acres of land and situated in Roaring Brook Township, Lackawanna County,—became vested by operation of law in her husband and five children, the former receiving a one-third interest and the latter each a two-fifteenths interest. In 1940, the husband’s one-third interest in the property was conveyed to Esther W. Kennedy, one of the two Wilson daughters, who thus became the owner of a seven-fifteenths interest in the property.</p>

By deed recorded on April 18, 1941, the three Wilson sons and one Wilson daughter, Betty W. Truver, conveyed their respective interests in the property to Esther Kennedy. Thereafter, Mrs. Kennedy exercised the right of redemption and, by the payment of $900 in settlement of delinquent taxes owing on the property for the years 1930-1944, inclusive, she <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>secured a conveyance of the property from the County in her own name.

While the equity complaint does not specifically so state, Mrs. Truver seeks to have a trust imposed upon the property to the extent of her claimed two-fifteenths interest therein. Upon issue joined between the parties, the matter was tried before Judge Con abo y; after hearing, the court found that the evidence did not establish any trust, either express or by operation of law, and dismissed the complaint.

All of the others have signed the deed.” Mrs. Kennedy then continued: “Your interest in the property . . . will be preserved upon your giving a deed for same. In other words, you are entitled to two-fifteenths of whatever the property sells for over all ordinary expenses of the sale” and then she reiterated that the taxes had to be paid and the property redeemed if anybody was to receive anything. In his letter to Mrs. Truver, Mrs. Kennedy’s counsel advised her to go along with Mrs. Kennedy’s proposition for her own best interest, adding: “They [the Kennedys] are willing that on paying the taxes each one will retain his share of the property” and <em>“They </em>[the Kennedys] <em>are willing to give you a guarantee that you will own two-fifteenths (2/15) in the </em>property.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

    <p id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[151,1226,1152,955]]]'>The majority opinion while not suggesting that Mrs. Truver had knowledge of Mrs. Kennedy’s conveyances, imposes a duty upon her to have made frequent inquiries about the status of the realty, to have displayed “curiosity”. In my view appellant was under no such duty. Mrs. Truver, a resident of Texas, had every right to assume that her sister-trustee would continue to preserve, hold and account for her interest in the property. It was not until she noticed the construction in 1961 that she first had cause to be suspicious and thereafter she immediately demonstrated her concern. Nor do I see how Charlotte Kennedy was unduly prejudiced by the death of her mother, some two months prior to the institution of this suit, and the death of her mother’s lawyer. The majority is willing to conclude that the record evidence clearly establishes the existence of a constructive trust, and Charlotte Kennedy as donee stands in the shoes of her mother.</p>
