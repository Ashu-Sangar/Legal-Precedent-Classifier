The clothes were in disarray and private portions of the body exposed. A medical examination indicated she had been dead at least two days and death was caused by strangulation.

They told Bishop they wanted him to go to police headquarters for questioning. He readily assented. Mrs. Santos was invited to accompany Charles but declined.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[202,1056,1151,368]]]'>Bishop was taken by the officers, via automobile, to headquarters for the Special Investigation Police Squad, where he was questioned intermittently for about two and one-half hours. During this period he was told, “You can tell us what you want, it is up to you.” No further advice as to his right to remain silent was given.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[202,1436,1150,413]]]'>During this questioning, Bishop made several conflicting statements concerning his whereabouts on the night of Thursday, March 28th, the date of Miss Burrell’s disappearance. At first he also denied knowing the victim, but later admitted this was untrue. However, he steadfastly denied any involvement in her death, or having phoned her on any occasion prior thereto.</p>

There he was met and questioned by four officers. He was immediately informed that they had information he was with Miss Burrell on the night she was murdered and asked him if he wanted to tell them about her death. About ten minutes later, he “admitted participation” in the crime.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The questioning then pro<a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>ceeded, with intermissions, until about five-twenty o’clock in the afternoon. During this period, he was not warned of his right to remain silent or that anything he said would be used against him in court. However, he was treated kindly and without abuse or intimidation.</p>
    <p id="b215-3" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[152,738,1153,960]]]'>Finally about five-forty o’clock, the recording of the challenged statement began. Immediately before he was warned, for the first time, that anything he said would be used against him in court. No further warnings or advice were given. The statement, in answer and question form, was typewritten and when finished, about seven-thirty o’clock, read to and signed by Bishop.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Shortly thereafter he was escorted back to the home of Mrs. Santos, and she was informed he was <em>“to </em>be arrested” for the crime. Bishop then identified for the officers the clothes he wore on the night of the killing. A subsequent examination thereof by a laboratory technician disclosed scrapings thereon which matched material of the same nature found in the abandoned automobile. Stains of blood on the clothing were found to be the Same type as that of the victim. One of Bishop’s fingerprints was also found in the automobile.</p>

The fact that Bishop was not given the in-custody warnings these decisions require during the police questioning did not, in itself, render the confession inadmissible. They were, however, important factors to be considered in determining if Bishop’s statements were made of his own free will. See <em>Davis v. North Carolina, </em><a href="/us/384/0737-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="384 U.S. 737" data-case-ids="12047392" data-case-paths="/us/384/0737-01">384 U.S. 737</a> (1966), and <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

The voluntariness question has to be determined in the light of all the existing circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth v.

While Bishop was only sixteen years of age (he was evidently still no “babe in the woods”) and without friend or counsel at the time of the questioning, and, admittedly, not warned of his right to remain silent, the voluntariness question, under all of the facts established by the record, was in our opinion for the jury to resolve.

    <p id="b217-4" data-blocks='[["BL_217.5",217,[153,579,1157,1458]]]'>Bishop was taken into custody without a warrant and none was issued prior to the time the confession was obtained. It is established beyond argument that a warrantless arrest is not lawful, unless there is probable cause therefor. See <em>Ker v. California,, </em><a href="/us/374/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="374 U.S. 23" data-case-ids="8495" data-case-paths="/us/374/0023-01">374 U.S. 23</a> (1963). Probable cause means that “the facts and circumstances within their [arresting officers] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief” that the suspect had committed a crime: <em>Carroll v. United States, </em><a href="/us/267/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="267 U.S. 132" data-case-ids="6137701" data-case-paths="/us/267/0132-01">267 U.S. 132</a>, 162 (1925).

It has been argued that no “arrest” occurred in this case since Bishop went along willingly with the police to headquarters. Assuming arguendo, that no coercive restraint existed in the beginning, Bishop was certainly under arrest when he was transferred to the Homicide Detective Headquarters. Any other contention is ludicrous. This is especially so in view of the uncontradicted testimony in the record that he was handcuffed during the transfer. Whether or not sufficient cause existed to justify an arrest at that time (in view of Bishop’s contradictory statements) need not be reached. For, assuming an illegal arrest occurred, it is still our view that, under all the circumstances, the evidentiary use of the confession was not constitutionally proscribed.</p>
