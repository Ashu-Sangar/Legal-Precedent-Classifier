From that date plaintiffs took no further action until August 5, <em>1965, </em>when complaints were filed alleging that the Hospital was responsible for injuries sustained by the minor plaintiff when the latter was placed in the hospital nursery on November 12, <em>1944- </em>On August 26, 1965, the defendant hospital filed a motion for the entry of judgments of non pros because of the failure of the plaintiffs to take any action in the prosecution of their claims for a period in excess of 18 years.

      <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>Plaintiffs’ sole contention on <em>these </em>appeals is that Rule 1037(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure prescribes the exclusive procedure by which a defendant may obtain a judgment of non pros, where the original action is begun by the issuance of a writ of summons. Rule 1037(a) provides: “(a) If an action is not commenced by a complaint, the prothonotary, upon praecipe of the defendant, shall enter a rule upon the plaintiff to file a complaint. If a complaint is not filed within twenty (20) days after service of the rule, the prothonotary, upon praecipe of the defendant, shall enter a judgment of non pros.”</p>

Beginning with the earliest history of the common law, it has always been the law that undue delay by a plaintiff after a suit has been commenced, is grounds for the Court to deny recovery by ordering a non pros of the action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> In <em>Waring Bros. &amp; Co. v. Pa. R.R.

The statement of claim was not filed until 1894, approximately 15 years after the writ of summons was filed. In upholding the grant of a judgment of non pros by the lower Court, this Court stated that the trial Court possesses an inherent power to grant a non pros for an unreasonable delay. This Court pertinently said (page 175): “. . . When it is considered that a delay of only six years in the bringing of such a suit gives rise to an absolute bar to its maintenance, at the mere will of a defendant, it seems useless to consider wheth<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>er the court in the exercise of its discretionary power, may not grant a nonsuit for a mere wanton delay of more than fourteen years in the prosecution of the suit.”</p>

The Court pertinently said (page 521) : “The statute of limitations fixes the time as two years from the happening of an accident to the bringing of suit. It imposes no hardship on those who institute suit to understand that they must bring this action within two years. It certainly does not impose a hardship on those bringing the suit to require them to bring it to trial within a reasonable time thereafter. If it is against public policy to permit trespass suits to be begun more than two years after the action arose, it is equally against public policy to permit trespass suits to be tried more than nine years after they were started, unless delay is satisfactorily explained. ... As a matter of fairness one who brings another into court should prosecute the claim against him with reasonable diligence.”</p>

Frank, </em>298 Pa., supra, this Court affirmed a judgment of non pros because plaintiff had failed to file its statement of claim for nearly 17 years. The Court in its Opinion said (pages 140-141) : “ Tt is no reply to say that the defendant may compel the plaintiff to declare his cause of action. It is not his duty to do so, but it is the plaintiff’s duty to proceed with his cause within a reasonable time. He is the actor and must act, or fail of his action.’ This has been followed in many subsequent cases, including Stewart v.

    <p id="b152-4" data-blocks='[["BL_152.5",152,[203,498,1152,1344]]]'>Plaintiffs contend that Rule 1037(a) mandates that in all cases where the action is not commenced by complaint, the only way for defendant to obtain a judgment of non pros is by a praecipe and a rule upon plaintiffs to file a complaint, and upon plaintiffs’ failure to file a complaint within 20 days thereafter, then by praecipe to have a judgment of non pros entered. Plaintiffs’ construction of the rule would exclude and destroy the power of a trial Court to enter a judgment of non pros, no matter how long plaintiffs delay the filing of a complaint or the prosecution of the action, and no matter how prejudicial such delay would be. Such a construction would be not only erroneous but unreasonable and ridiculous. In <em>Glass v. Farmers Nat.

Rule 1037(a) R. C. P. was not intended to, nor does it, impair or in any way impinge on the power of a court over its judgments. Such power is the same since the rule was promulgated as it was before it was adopted. What the rule was designed to do, and all that it did, was to prescribe definitively the procedure to be followed <em>in order to compel a </em>plaintiff<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> to file a complaint or suffer judgment of non pros, for failure to do so.”</p>
