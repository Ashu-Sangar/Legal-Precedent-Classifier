Four days later— September 2, 1963—Mount was apprehended by the police and, on that same day, he made a written statement wherein, inter alia, he admitted stabbing the victim. The next day—September 3, 1963—Mount was given a preliminary hearing at which he was held without bail for grand jury action. Three days subsequent to the preliminary hearing—September 6, 1963—the police, having by that time been furnished with certain information, obtained from findings in the criminal laboratory, which led them to believe that Mount had sexually assaulted the victim, took a second written statement from Mount in which he said that, after stabbing the victim, he went into the living room, removed his clothes preparatory to having sexual intercourse with the victim, returned to where she was lying, picked up her legs and dropped them again because he could not go through with it. This second <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>statement further related that, thereafter, Mount went back into the living room, got dressed, took some money, took the knife out of the victim and left the premises.</p>

The teaching of <em>Davis </em>is: (a) in the <em>preEscobedo </em>and <em>pre-Mircmda </em>periods, the failure to warn an accused of his right to remain silent or his right to counsel, standing alone, did not render inadmissible a confession; (b) however, <em>if </em>the <em>voluntariness </em>of the confession is questioned, the failure to give such appropriate warnings is a factor to be considered in evaluating the <em>voluntariness </em>of the confession. As we read <em>Davis, </em>since Mount concedes the voluntariness of his second confession, under the state of the law at the time when Mount was tried, the failure of the interrogating police officials to warn Mount of his right to remain silent and to have counsel did not preclude the reception into evidence of the confession.</p>

To the introduction of both confessions there was no objection made upon the ground that the police had failed to warn Mount of his right to remain silent, or of his right to have the assistance of counsel at the time he made the statements or upon the ground that such confessions were involuntarily made as the result of coercion, physical or psychological.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

This position, belatedly assumed, does not excuse the failure at trial stage to object to the second confession.

Prior to that statute, the power of the court to appoint arose only <em>after </em>the accused had been indicted; under the statute the court is not so restricted and it may appoint counsel either before or after the accused has been indicted. <em>When </em>the court shall appoint is left to the sound discretion of the court. By implication, the only restriction as to the <em>time </em>of appointment is that the appointment must be made at such time as will enable the ap<a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>pointed counsel to fully and adequately prepare for the trial of the case. The construction placed upon the statute by Mount to the effect that the court <em>must </em>appoint counsel either after arrest or certainly not later than before the preliminary hearing lacks support in the statutory language. Moreover, in view of the fact the instant preliminary hearing was not a “critical stage” in the proceedings at which counsel was required, and, in view of Mount’s eventual plea of guilty, we find no prejudice suffered by him by reason of the fact counsel were not appointed until after indictment.</p>

There was more than adequate evidence extraneous to the second confession to justify the three-judge court in deciding on first degree murder and the death sentence.” On direct appeal, Mount argued that the court, in determining the proper penalty, considered that Mount had raped the victim, that such consideration was without evidentiary support and that the court had abused its discretion and committed an error of law in this respect. We rejected that argument in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Mount, supra, at pp. 346, 347.
