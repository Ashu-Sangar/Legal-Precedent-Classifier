The zoning powers of second class townships in question here were granted by the Legislature in 1947, see notes 1 &amp; 3 supra, and hence are to be liberally construed. There is, of course, no conflict between the doctrine of strict construction of zoning ordinances and liberal construction of the zoning enabling acts because the Statutory Construction Act defines a law as “an act of Assembly of this Commonwealth” and hence is not controlling with regard to the construction of ordinances.

This means, appellees argue, that since quarrying is an industrial use of land, the township’s power “to regulate and restrict” does not encompass the ability to absolutely prohibit any particular industrial uses. In support of this conclusion the learned court below pointed out that West Whiteland’s power to prohibit particularly offensive uses of land may not be found in its zoning powers since the Legislature has provided in other sections of The Second Class Township Code special police powers to deal with certain specified types of offensive uses as well as the right to deal with nuisances generally.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The only case cited by Exton as directly supporting its contention that The Second Class Town<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>ship Code did not empower West Whiteland to enact §701 (3) is <em>Norate Corp. v.

We believe that the pertinent phrase— “to regulate and restrict . . . the location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes”—considered by itself does not compel the conclusion that Exton seeks to establish. Indeed, the most striking aspect of this language —especially in view of the inclusion of the words “other purposes”—is the generality and flexibility of the powers granted. It must be borne in mind that the power granted extends to both <em>location </em>and <em>use. </em>Exton’s argument might have far greater force if the statutory language included only the word “location” and not the word “use.” Then we might be persuaded that once a township has been divided into districts for trade, industry and residence, the zoning power could not be further utilized to regulate and restrict the uses within a municipality. But with the employment of the phrase “location and use”, we would find it difficult to attach to the statutory term “use” the independent significance which we must assume the Legislature intended. More especially is this so since in light of §2002 (53 P.S. §67002(a)) of the Code which contains a separate grant of power to “divide the township into districts of such number, shape and area as may be deemed best suited to carry out the purpose of this article.”</p>

Because of the necessity of including provisions for nonconforming uses in zoning legislation, municipalities may not by virtue of the zoning power curtail the offensive uses of land existing at the date of the enactment of the zoning legislation. However, in order to permit municipalities to curtail the increase of such uses which it deemed most offensive, without the expense, time and uncertainty involved in prosecuting a suit in equity or taking measures for the abatement of a nuisance, the Legislature may well have decided to grant second class townships the broader power to prospectively prohibit such uses. Thus the inclusion of specific powers to prohibit a special class of offensive uses does not preclude us from finding, in the zoning power granted, the right to prohibit, subject to the doctrine of nonconforming use, offensive uses.</p>

Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>supra, is not well placed. In <em>Norate </em>this Court held that a zoning ordinance prohibiting off-site billboards throughout a township was not a reasonable exercise of the township’s police power. Nowhere in <em>Norate </em>is the legislation granting the township power to zone even cited, much less discussed. As we read it, <em>Norate </em>nowhere even intimates a view as to the power of a municipality to selectively prohibit uses throughout the township; it merely decides that township-wide prohibition of the billboards in that township failed to bear a reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. Indeed, although our research reveals no reported Pennsylvania case which squarely deals with the question whether zoning enabling acts authorize township-wide bans on selected uses, the preponderance of court’s expressions on this matter assume such bans to be valid.

Nothing will be gained by adding such terms as ‘exclude,’ ‘segregate,’ ‘limit,’ ‘determine.’ ” After the words “other purposes” footnote 14 to the Act contains the following language: “This is a catch-all phrase.

We believe this is true despite the possible existence outside the municipality of sites on which the prohibited activity may be conducted,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> since it is more probable than not that, as the operator of the prohibited business is forced to move further from the property he owns, his economic disadvantage will increase to the point of deprivation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a> Moreover, if one municipality may, with only moderate justification, totally prohibit an undesired use of land, it is not <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>unlikely that surrounding municipalities will do the same—thus increasing the distance to an alternative site and the concomitant economic disadvantage.

For these reasons, we believe that a zoning ordinance which totally excludes a particular business from an entire municipality must bear a more substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare than an ordinance which merely confines that business to a certain area in the municipality.</p>

Thus from the map it appears that throughout the township there are at least half a dozen areas encompassing upwards of two hundred acres which are sparsely or <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>completely devoid of commercial or residential development.

The township’s reliance on the increase in truck traffic, for instance, is hardly reasonable absent a showing, which does not appear on the record, that quarrying operations will involve any greater increase in truck traffic than other <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>industrial uses which are permitted. The township’s assertion that quarrying will disturb the underground water supply in West Whiteland, though found as a fact by the board, is not supported by competent evidence. The only testimony which the township produced to support this statement was given by witnesses unqualified in geology and the thrust of this testimony was contradicted by Exton’s witness, head of the geology department of Bryn Mawr College. The contention that creation of the quarrying pit would be a danger to children is not a consideration which merits much weight. The danger to children could be so easily reduced by erection of proper fencing<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a>— a regulation which we see no reason why a township could not impose under its zoning powers, not to speak of its other powers—that it hardly supports prohibition of quarrying.

An air pollution expert testifying for the township suggested that an operation of the size proposed to be constructed by Exton would if <em>uncontrolled </em>put into the air at least a ton of dust per hour and if <em>controlled </em>about a ton of dust per day. Properly controlled dust would tend not to settle, and on a normal day such controlled dust could be seen for about “a mile or <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>more.” No evidence appears of record as to what effect the dust produced might have on health, nor did the air pollution expert indicate the extent to which quarrying and the other uses specifically prohibited in the ordinance would create greater amounts of harmful dust than an increase of permitted industry or those other pollution producing uses permitted in the township, although it is admitted by the expert that such other uses would add pollutants to the air. Given these facts, in addition to the fact that according to the official zoning map of the township attached to the 1957 ordinance, a substantial fraction of the township land is located more than a mile from any cluster of residential development, we fail to see how creation of dust by quarrying bears a sufficiently substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare to justify its prohibition.</p>

These witnesses stated that blasting and vibration from operations in these quarries shook their houses and was an unpleasant experience. The record does not faintly suggest, however, any reason to suppose that such blasting occurs during sleeping hours; indeed the record suggests that blasting would occur during the day and at most on one or two occasions a week. Nor does this record suggest by any competent evidence that the level of noise or vibration from the blasting as well as other aspects of the quarrying operation would have a defined effect on health. While we can appreciate the great desirability of quiet and tranquility, this does not raise it to a consideration of constitutional significance. Moreover, even assuming the substantial relationship to public health of quiet in an <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>area closely located to a hospital or to general welfare where noise would interfere with the efficient operation of a school, we fail to see how a township, which according to its zoning map contains one area of over three square miles in which no schools or hospitals are located and in which there are less than 100 residences, and other buildings, could constitutionally prohibit quarrying throughout its borders on the grounds of the noise and vibration.</p>

The planning consultant testified that in a study prepared for the township <em>subsequent </em>to the enactment of the prohibition of quarrying, he had advised its exclusion because West Whiteland was primarily a residential community, that people were moving in rapidly “looking for the amenities of country life”, that quarrying was a “nuisance”, that he had never seen one that was not “somewhat of a problem in terms of either vibration or pollution or noise, . . . [or] danger”, that anywhere a quarry was placed in West Whiteland Township industrial zone there would be a problem of excessive truck traffic, that a quarry would be harmful aesthetically, that a quarry would “do a great deal of damage to the township”, that he “equated” vibration with the mental health of the community—although he denied being an expert on vibration and never professed to be an expert in mental health and admitted he himself had not suffered an apparent health problem during the time he lived close enough to a quarry to feel vibrations,—and finally that because of the unaesthetic aspects of quarrying it was an activity which would inhibit the development nearby of residences and certain kinds of industry. In light of our previous discussion of traffic, dust and vibration, we believe <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>that the consultant’s testimony consisted in reality of no more than a series of epithets based solidly on only one objection relevant to West Whiteland Township as a whole—that this quarry was unaesthetic and conflicted with his projected plans.

The natural or zealous desire of many zoning boards or councils to protect, improve and develop their township or community, to plan a city or a township or a community that is both practical and beautiful and to conserve the property values as well as the “tone” of that community is undoubtedly commendable. However, public authorities (including the Legislature) which deal with zoning must constantly remember that “zoning power” is based upon and derived from the police power of the State and may be exercised only in those cases in which the public health, safety, morals and general welfare are in need of protection. To hold otherwise would be to countenance an Unconstitutional invasion and deprivation of the Constitutionally guaranteed property rights of every American.</p>

There are several reasons for this confusion. First and most important, too many Judges seem to have almost completely forgotten the rights of property granted and ordained to property owners in and by the Constitution of the United States <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>and in and by tbe Constitution of Pennsylvania. Tbe second important reason is that the decision reached by a zoning board or by a Court is too often based <em>solely </em>upon “general welfare”—an expression which is incapable of accurate definition and in reality is often nothing but the guess or wishes of a few nonelected officials, or sometimes a Judge.</p>
    <p id="b103-4" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[138,783,1153,819]]]'>The third important reason is the difficulty in reconciling the conflict between (on the one hand) the Constitutionally ordained and guaranteed right to acquire, possess and protect—which means lawfully use—your own home or your own property as every American in the Land of the Free may wish, and (on the other hand) the right of a Judge or zoning board (members of which are usually appointed and not elected officials) to lawfully impose upon a property owner duties and restraints concerning what he may or may not do with his own property.

The legislative objectives of the zoning ordinance prohibiting quarrying were to: (1) Control traffic on an already congested highway; (2) Prevent the expulsion of dust in great quantities into the atmosphere; (3) Protect the surrounding property owners or users (including elementary school children) from the dangers of blasting; (4) Protect the water supply of the surrounding property owners and users; (5) Protect the township roads from deterioration from over use by heavily laden trucks and from sink holes resulting; (6) Eliminate the noise emanating from blasting and rock crushing; and (7) Prevent the creation of a large hole in the middle of the township.</p>

The majority are content to supply their own solution to each of the problems presented by diminishing the record (by finding incompetent the township’s testimony with regard to the underground water supply), by suggesting legislation which the township chose not to enact (in particular, the fencing of the quarry to protect children), or by superficial treatment (such as concluding that because the record does not indicate that blasting will occur during sleeping hours it will not disturb the community).</p>

While affirming the judgment of the court below, the majority opinion in effect, reverses the decision of the board and grants relief equivalent to judgment non obstante veredicto. In granting such relief upon a diminished record, the majority have ignored a rule of long standing that a judgment may not be entered by a court which has eliminated evidence appearing in the record; in such a case, the proper remedy is the grant of a new trial. <em>Brandon v.

In effect, this decision has made our Court a zoning board—and a poor one at that.</p>
    <p id="b111-6" data-blocks='[["BL_111.7",111,[105,1349,1153,975]]]'>Furthermore, this Court has held on several occasions that on an appeal from an order of a trial court reversing the decision of a zoning board of adjustment, without taking additional testimony, the scope of review is limited to determining whether the board abused its discretion or committed an error of law. <em>Polizzi v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/420/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="136" data-cite="420 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1898547" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0405-01">420 Pa. 405</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20226" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="218 A.2d 226">218 A. 2d 226</a> (1966); <em>National Land and Investment Company v.

In a situation like the instant case, where the constitutionality of the statute as a whole is not attacked but only its constitutionality as applied to a particular property, the findings of fact of the board assume even more importance than in a <em>broad </em>constitutional attack. The majority have completely ignored this standard by substituting their own findings of fact for those of the board.</p>

That is illogical. A conclusion of law was reached by the board which was against the interests of Exton. Since Exton chose not to question that determination, it must be concluded that Exton abandoned its contention that the prohibition of rock crushing was unconstitutional. That is the only assumption that may be drawn from the failure of either party or the lower court to discuss rock crushing as a separate prohibited activity. Rock crushing and quarrying are two different activities each of which is prohibited by the ordinance. The reversal of the board’s decision by the lower, court on the matter of quarrying does not change the board’s conclusion with regard to rock crushing since the latter determination has not been attacked by an appeal by the party injured.</p>

One of the legislative objectives behind the ordinance was to prevent the expulsion of great quantities of dust into the air. Since this problem was one of the factors that led to the enactment of the ordinance which is cloaked with a presumption of constitutionality, the burden is upon Exton to prove that the amount of dust expelled into the air by its quarrying activities would not be excessive. The majority, however, reverse the burden and conclude that because the township presented no evidence as to the effect of the dust on health or as to the relative increase in air pollution caused by permissible uses of the land, there is no justification for the ordinance on that ground.</p>
