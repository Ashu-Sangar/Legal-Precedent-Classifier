Hough v. Maroney, </em><a href="/f-supp/247/0767-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="247 F. Supp. 767" data-case-ids="409108" data-case-paths="/f-supp/247/0767-01">247 F. Supp. 767</a> (W.D. Pa.). Judge Rosenberg <em>mistahenly </em>believed that this Court (a) had merely passed upon “the degree and justification of the <em>sentence </em>which [Hough had] received . . . rather than an attack on the substance of the conviction” and had (b) never passed upon and decided the <em>merits </em>of Hough’s contention that under the facts and the pertinent principles of law, <em>he could not </em>lawfully or Constitutionally have been convicted of murder. “In sum total the records relating to all the Pennsylvania State courts indicate that the question of the validity of the judgment of conviction as affected by false or suppressed evidence never had been placed before them for !a determination. . . . This may present a thin thread of difference—but a difference nevertheless.” For this reason, Judge Rosenberg naturally held that Hough had not exhausted his State remedies.</p>

The killing grew out of an armed robbery by Hough and his two confederates, David Almeida and James Smith, in 1947. The three robbers, while attempting to escape from the scene, engaged in a gun battle with the police, during which an off-duty policeman, Ingling, was shot and killed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">*</a>

On January 30, 1947, the present relator Hough, with Smith and Almeida, entered a public park<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>ing garage in the City of Philadelphia, covered the attendant with loaded revolvers, threatened him, Hough (and Almeida each) robbed a cash register, and then stole an automobile. During the robbery, <em>Hough hit </em>the attendant on the side of the head with a revolver. Whey then drove the stolen ear to an Acme public superservice market. After parking the car against the curb, Hough and Almeida entered the market, leaving Smith at the wheel. Both drew loaded revolvers, threatened the attendant, and held everyone at bay, terrorized, while they rifled the cash registers. When the manager of the store became excited, yelled “holdup,” and started to run toward the rear of the store, Almeida fired at him. This shot missed. Hough and Almeida then ran from the store and jumped into the stolen car which Smith was driving. There was a crowd of people in the street, and Almeida fired a shot into the air as he and Hough ran from the store entrance. Hough fired a shot directly at one of the policemen<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">*</a> who was only a few yards away but luckily missed him.</p>
    <p id="b449-3" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[147,1554,1154,478]]]'>At or about the time the robbers arrived at the supermarket, Cecil Ingling, a City patrolman, arrived at the supermarket in his automobile with his family. He was off duty and was in civilian clothes. He also parked his car against the curb in front of the supermarket before alighting to attend to some personal business in the neighborhood. By coincidence, the robbers’ car was parked immediately to the left of Ingling’s car.</p>

    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[186,618,1154,1569]]]'>Hough was apprehended almost immediately, and later, while represented by able and experienced counsel, entered a plea of guilty generally to an indictment charging murder. Defendant’s (relator’s) guilty plea in open Court while represented by counsel is a confession of guilt of the crime with which he is charged in the indictment: <em>Com. ex rel. Finnie v. Russell, </em><a href="/pa/422/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="422 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="1901744" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0313-01">422 Pa. 313</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20796" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="220 A.2d 796">220 A. 2d 796</a>.

After a hearing before the trial Court which consisted of three Judges, he was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death. Upon appeal to this Court, the judgment of conviction and sentence was affirmed by a unanimous Court: <em>Commonwealth v. Hough, </em><a href="/pa/358/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="358 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="8845411" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0247-01">358 Pa. 247</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%2084" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="56 A.2d 84">56 A. 2d 84</a> (1948). Justice (later Chief Justice) Jones, speaking for the Court, said (page 252) : “Notwithstanding that the defendant, under the advice of able counsel, pleaded guilty to the murder for which he was indicted and throughout has conceded that it was murder in the first degree, <em>we have reviewed both the law and the evidence in the case</em>

    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[158,953,1154,581]]]'>Almeida and Smith were apprehended about a year later in another State and returned to Pennsylvania. Thereafter a jury found Almeida guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced him to death. Hough testified as a witness for the Commonwealth (a) at the coroner’s inquest and (b) at Almeida’s trial, that Almeida shot and killed Ingling. Hough testified that he was standing alongside of Almeida who was within two feet of Ingling, and that Almeida fired the fatal bullet which killed Ingling, and said “I got the son-of-a-bitch.”</p>
    <p id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.6",451,[161,1555,1154,533]]]'>We further note that Smith was tried two weeks later. For the first time it appeared that an Assistant District Attorney had deliberately suppressed evidence which indicated that Ingling was killed by a bullet from the gun of one of the arresting police officers. The jury found Smith guilty of murder in the first degree, but probably because of the hitherto suppressed evidence, sentenced him only to life imprisonment. Smith has never taken an appeal or filed any post-conviction petitions.</p>

If one or more persons set in motion a chain of circumstances out of which death ensues, those persons must be held responsible for any death which by direct, by almost inevitable sequence, results from such unusual criminal act. . . . So, if the death of Officer Ingling was the inevitable consequence of the unlawful act, or acts, of the defendant, or the continuation of the unlawful act, or acts, of the defendant, acting in concert—for every one who does an unlawful act is considered by the law as the doer of all that follows— if that unlawful act be robbery, and if the result of that act is a killing, members of the jury, that killing is murder.’ ”</p>

Almeida then entered a guilty plea, was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Indeed I fully share the view that such action is repugnant to our civilized notions of justice and deserves the strongest condemnation. Were I to have found that Hough was,at all prejudiced, I would not hesitate to grant him a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b461-5" data-blocks='[["BL_461.6",461,[155,1836,1150,205]]]'>Because I do not believe that the suppressed evidence was a relevant factor in his decision to plead guilty and because, in view of his life sentence, he has not been prejudiced, I concur in the result.</p>
