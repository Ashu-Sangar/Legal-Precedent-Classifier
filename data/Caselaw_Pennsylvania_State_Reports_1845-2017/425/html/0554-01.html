There the Court said (page 405) : “The granting or withholding of permission to establish a branch office of a bank is not a judicial function, but is purely an administrative function.” And, also (page 407) : “In our opinion, it makes no difference whether the Superintendent of Banks acquired facts upon which he based his decision by an investigation or by a hearing, so long as the evidence shows his decision was based upon some material fact or facts, and was not arbitrary or illegal. The manner in which the facts are obtained, whether by letters, affidavits, depositions or oral testimony, is a matter which is left to the discretion of the Superintendent, so long, of course, as he observes the basic requirements of private as well as public interest.”</p>

Moreover, it is noteworthy that the Banking Code’s restrictions on divulging of information have never before been urged to apply to the disclosure of branch bank applications to protesting banks. To my mind the simplest explanation of this fact is that the Banking Code’s prohibition of disclosure contains the proviso that information obtained by the Department may be divulged “when the publication or divulgement of such information is made by the department pursuant to the provisions of this act. . . .” Act of May 15, 1933, P.
