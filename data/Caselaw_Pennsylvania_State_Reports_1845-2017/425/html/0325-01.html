Remmel, a resident of Pittsburgh, died on March 20, 1963, leaving an estate, which consisted entirely of personalty valued at $1,684,122.35. Deductible debts and expenses amounted to $102,573.45. By her will and the codicils thereto, decedent gave specific and pecuniary legacies to certain named persons totalling $48,945 and created a trust of the residue. This trust was divided into seventeen equal parts, the income from each of which was given to an individual life beneficiary and, in certain instances, to a <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>successive life beneficiary. Upon the death of the beneficiary or beneficiaries entitled to receive the income from any 1/17 share of the principal of the residue that 1/17 share of principal was to be distributed to the W. H. Remmel and Althea F. Remmel Foundation, to be devoted exclusively to charitable purposes. (One of the life beneficiaries had predeceased the settlor which thereby accelerated the charitable remainder as to that 1/17 of the residue.) Mrs. Remmel expressly provided in her will that all inheritance taxes on property passing under her will be paid out of the residuary estate “or the principal of any trust succeeding thereto” and that all other legacies were given free of such taxes.</p>

Thus the combined present value of the charitable share was the reciprocal thereof, or 45.65947% of the residue. The present appeal is by the Pittsburgh National Bank, Executor under the Will of Althea F. Remmel, deceased, from the decree of the court en banc of the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County sustaining the Commonwealth’s appraisement of the inheritance tax in the decedent’s estate.</p>

Before the Secretary of Revenue can determine the value of the decedent’s estate he must first determine which assets are includible therein. Thus the threshold question posed by this appeal is whether the inclusion of the residuary estate in the appraisement value of the decedent’s estate amounts to a tax on charities and for the purpose of determining this threshold question, the amount of the tax is insignificant. The majority opinion answers this question in the negative whereas the dissent assumes an affirmative answer and then seeks to demonstrate, on the strength of that assumption, that the imposition of a tax on charities runs counter to the Act. Under the terms of the will the inheritance tax, which is imposed only upon the specific gifts to individuals, is to be paid out of the residuary estate, with the remainder, if any, going to the charitable foundation. Indeed, conceptually the Commonwealth’s computation no more amounts to a tax on charities than does the appellant’s, for under either ap<a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>proach the ultimate gift to charity is reduced by the amount of the inheritance tax which the estate must pay. Appellant’s calculation, moreover, would result in a specific gift to an individual followed by a charitable remainder being subject to less tax than the same gift not foUowed by a charitable remainder. The Act of 1961 did not intend to have the effect of reducing the specific legatee’s liability (whether this liability is to be satisfied out of his gift or the residuary estate) but simply to exempt charities from paying a tax on their inheritance.</p>

Prior to the Act of 1957, the inheritance tax was <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>collected from both the charitable and noncharitable transfers. After the Act of 1957, no tax was collected on the charitable transfer but only on the noncharitable transfers. The Act of 1961 effected no change in this procedure, and the practice continued of including in the gross estate property of the decedent which was to be distributed to charitable transferees and to noneharitable transferees.</p>

Hence, appellants contend with some force that the value of the property to be transferred to a charity should not be included in the gross estate. However, I see no clear legislative intent that a change of this nature was contemplated when the legislature enacted the Act of 1961. I do see in the legislative history of this section a clear expression of intent by the legislature, evidenced by its almost verbatim adoption of the Act of 1957, to continue the inclusion of charitable as well as noncharitable transfers in the value of the gross estate, from which value the deductions provided for in Article VI would be taken.</p>

Hence, the admonishment in <em>Pratt Estate </em>that “No decision of this Court and no statute of Pennsylvania defines or even uses the term 'gross estate,’ ” is patently in error and should not in the future be relied upon. “Cross estate” is often used by practitioners in referring to an estate being settled under the laws of the Commonwealth, and a definition is gradually developing which accurately defines and limits the term as applied to the administration of Pennsylvania estates.</p>

    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[197,614,1153,639]]]'>At the risk of repetition, the statute not only specifically excludes from inheritance taxation transfers of property made by a decedent to charity but §706 expressly limits and restricts the appraisal of the value of the estate upon which the tax is to be calculated to “property, the transfer of which is subject to tax.” That the amount eventually to be received by the charity will be diminished by the payment of an inheritance tax properly arrived at under §706 is conceded. That the amount to be received by the charity will be further diminished by an assessment of a tax in violation of §706 constitutes the complaint of the estate.</p>

Under the pre-1961 law, the inheritance tax was to be measured by “the clear value” of what the beneficiaries received and it was imposed upon the beneficiaries rather than upon the residue and, therefore, the debts and expenses and the tax lacked a common incidence. Under the statutory law in effect at the time <em>Foster </em>was decided, <em>Foster </em>was correct; by reason of the drastic changes effected by the 1961 statute, <em>Foster </em>is no longer apposite.</p>

In <em>Frick, </em>decided under the Inheritance Tax Act of June 20, 1919, P. <em>L. </em>521, the estate argued that, in ascertaining the “clear value” of the estate as the statute required, the Commonwealth erred in not deducting from the “gross value” of the estate the amount of inheritance taxes paid the Federal Government, other states, Quebec Province and Pennsylvania: the Court, noting that §2 of the 1919 statute specifically designated decedent’s debts and administration expenses as deductible but expressly forbid the deduction of such taxes, refused to permit to be done indirectly that which was directly forbidden by the statute. <em>Frick </em>is entirely inapposite. It should be noted, however, that in <em>Frick, </em>our Court quoted with ajtproval the language of <em>New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, </em><a href="/us/256/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="256 U.S. 345" data-case-ids="3678530" data-case-paths="/us/256/0345-01">256 U.S. 345</a>, 349, 350: “where ‘the tax attaches to the estate before distribution—obviously it attaches to the whole estate, <em>except so far as the statute sets a Umit’” </em>(277 Pa. at p. 252). In the case at bar, the 1961 statute has set a limit. As to <em>Gamp, </em>we agree with amicus curiae’s analysis: “Camp enounces the rule that the deductions may not be apportioned to specific assets—or to specific interests in assets—reflected in the appraisement but must be subtracted from the conglomerate value established by the appraisement. A corollary of this rule is that residuary principal has first call on any tax-saving made possible by the deductions. [The estate’s] calculation procedure is completely consistent with the rule and its corollary: the deductions would be subtracted from the conglomerate value established by the appraisement, and the full benefit of the deductions would enure to residuary principal.” In <em>Tack, </em>the sole question was whether certain bonds of the Delaware River Bridge Joint Commission were exempt from inheritance taxation and the Court simply held such bonds were not exempt. <em>Frick, Camp </em>and <em>Tack </em>all were decided when the statute prescribed a method of appraisal vastly different from that pro<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>vided in the 1961 statute and at a time when property transferred to charities was taxable and are clearly inapposite.</p>
