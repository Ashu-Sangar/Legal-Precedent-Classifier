Allison, widow of the decedent and administratrix of his estate. After a trial lasting 5 days, the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $65,000. This verdict, rendered in a lump sum, was eventually molded into separate sums; $62,000 in the wrongful death action, and $3,-000 in the survival action.

At approximately 8:50 a.m., a vice president of defendant arrived at the building, and, after waiting a short period during which decedent did not arrive to operate the elevator, took the elevator himself and went to his office. (Decedent was due at work at 8:00 a.m.) The decedent arrived a few minutes after 9:00 and, according to an eyewitness, rang the bell of the elevator several times, then removed the key to the elevator door from a box, partially opened the elevator door, took a step forward, and fell into an empty shaft some 15 to 18 feet to the basement of the building.

She went on to relate the procedure for opening the elevator doors in the mornings in the following manner: It was necessary to get the key from a box near the door to open the heavy outer door.

Undoubtedly to him it would be as astonishing that the elevator should not be there as that the building should have disappeared overnight.</p>

Was he?

Is it compulsorily conclusive contributory negligence for one to assume that no one will be so brutally careless as to take away the floor of a scaffold without notifying others, who have every reason to assume the floor will be there? What the Majority is imposing here is not contributory negligence to be decided by a jury, but contributory negligence which is so absolute that no reasonable persons could disagree as to its existence. That is the stand the Majority takes. Allison, so far as the Majority is concerned, practically walked with open eyes into a suicidal death. The record does not support so arbitrary a determination.</p>

There was testimony, on the side of the plaintiff’s case, that the elevator shaft was not well illuminated. An electrical engineer testified that the area surrounding the elevator door was dimly lit. The jury, by its verdict, found that the shaft was not adequately illuminated. But the Majority apparently brought so much light to the evidence, in considering it in favor of the verdict winner, that it had enough left over to illuminate the elevator shaft. This illumination, however, was not seen by the jury which, in addition to hearing the evidence in court, went to the scene of the accident and physically evaluated what the Majority has imaginatively surmised. Not only did the jury see the elevator shaft and the surrounding area, but it heard evidence at the very point of the accident as to the conditions existing at the time of the accident. The trial judge, passing on this feature <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>of the case, said: “The jury observed the actual location of the accident and heard testimony that the lighting condition which they saw was the same at the time that decedent was injured. The jury could well have drawn the inference that decedent walked into a dimly lighted area believing the elevator to be at ground-floor level and in the exercise of his best judgment proceeded into the empty shaft.”</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[150,835,1154,966]]]'>But the Majority of this Court, without seeing the elevator, without knowing the physical circumstances, declares that it will decide this case in the light most favorable to the verdict winner and then proceeds to extinguish the lantern of the evidence. Sitting on the Fourth Floor of City Hall, the Majority maintains that it can see through all the bricks, stone, marble, steel and mortar which intervene between City Hall and 1501 Walnut Street, and perceive what the jury on the scene did not see. The Majority maintains it can penetrate through the wall of six years, which has risen since the accident happened, and reconstruct, from the printed page, the circumstances of the accident, more accurately than those who were there when it happened and who testified to it in court before a judge and twelve jurors who confirmed what the witnesses said by visiting the scene of the accident. This is judicial clairvoyance to which I cannot subscribe.</p>

There is absolutely nothing in the case which offers a modicum of rationalization to the Majority’s far-fetched theory. Indeed the evidence and all inferences logically derivable therefrom reject conclusively the Majority’s hypothesis. The Majority speaks of George King who was standing beside Allison when the tragedy occurred, stating that King could read his newspaper by the light in the lobby of the <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>building. Whether he could read his paper has nothing to do with conditions inside or immediately outside the elevator shaft. King’s testimony is self-defeating. If Allison was deceived about the presence or non-presence of the elevator, so was King, because it is impossible to believe that King could have been so inhuman as to allow Allison to step into an empty elevator shaft if King knew the elevator was not there. If King could not see the elevator was not there, that makes two persons on the scene who were honestly deceived by the circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[199,1007,1154,1232]]]'>There is no question that Allison made a mistake but it was an understandable mistake; it was, so to speak, a logical mistake, an almost compelling mistake. For nine years, he had been inserting the key in the elevator door, for nine years he had started operations from the ground floor. Never in those nine years did he begin his work from the fourth floor, to which Snelling had, with unexcusable recklessness, taken the elevator that tragic morning. As stated, Allison was the only one who had the right to run the elevator. If he was not there, the tenants waited or walked. No one had the right to take away the elevator any more than a heedless air passenger would have the right to seize the controls in the cockpit of an airplane. Louis Snelling, brother of the self-propelling vice president of the defendant concern, did not take the elevator when he arrived (prior to Robert Snelling) and discovered that the operator was not there. Louis Snelling took to the stairs, as Robert could easily have done. The witness King arrived before Allison appeared on the scene. He made no effort to do what Robert Snelling had done. He waited for Allison’s arrival.</p>

Only an arbitrary exercise of intellect can conclude that a nine-year custom does not become an established fact.

Six days a week, 52 weeks a year for nine successive years, he took the key from a box, inserted into the elevator door, and stepped into the elevator. He did this continuously and without interruption for 2808 days. Can it be said that, because on the 2809th day, he did not test what he had never had occasion to test or doubt before, he was so devoid of concern for his life that he must be branded by the law as negligent beyond reason?</p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.6",567,[158,1334,1152,586]]]'>The Majority Opinion speaks of situations where recovery was not permitted because the aggrieved person walked into an obvious elevator danger, but in those cases the sortie into the elevator shaft was a single occurrence. Those cases have to do with one who, in a strange environment, advanced for the first time into a hazardous situation. Here it was not a question of the first time; it was a matter of the 2000th time. If for 2000 consecutive days there is no rain, one cannot be blamed, if on the 2001st day, he steps out on a sunshiny day without an umbrella.</p>

That was not the case here. Here it was a matter of dim lighting, the kind of lighting, incidentally, which one observes in the Majority Opinion throughout, that is, a shadowy obfuscating, nebulous, opaque, umbrageous kind of lighting which misleads, without intending to. It is like a banana peel under a lettuce leaf.</p>

      <em>For </em>example, the Majority quotes from <em>Murphy v. Bernheim &amp; </em>Sons, <em>Inc., </em><a href="/pa/327/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="327 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="1176685" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0285-01">327 Pa. 285</a>, as follows: “When one is moving in the dark he must proceed with the greatest caution and literally ‘feel his way around.’ ” This is the lettuce leaf which gives the reader the idea that the plaintiff in that case did not recover because he moved in the dark. The Majority cites this case as an ally to its cause; in point of jurisprudential realism, it is not an ally but an armored foe, which, with the spear of logic, punctures the bubbles of illogic floating throughout the Majority Opinion. In the <em>Murphy </em>case, we <em>affirmed </em>the verdict returned in that case in favor of the elevator walker on the intelligent basis that he had been honestly misled, as was the decedent in this case. In a powerful opinion which brings crashing to the ground the whole wobbly structure of theorization in the Majority Opinion here, Justice (later Chief Justice) Maxey said: “When one walks in dim light where he has no reason to apprehend danger and uses his best judgment as he proceeds, and then meets with an accident, the question whether or not he is guilty of contributory negligence is usually for the jury.”</p>
    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[202,1647,1152,795]]]'>An elevator shaft, like anything else, can stand in three different types of luminosity. It may be enveloped in total darkness, it may shine forth in bright light, or it can remain half-concealed and half-disclosed like the Star Spangled Banner at Fort McHenry during the night of that historical bombardment. The elevator shaft at 1501 Walnut Street was in the third classification on the morning that Allison stepped into it. On a situation of that character,. Chief Justice Maxey said: “Where the elevator approach is but dimly lighted, a person may be justified in thinking that an elevator is at the floor when in fact it is absent. Under such circumstances, his contributory negligence is plainly a jury question,” citing 9 R.C.L. sec. 23, page 1257.</p>

In narrating the circumstances of the accident, Chief Justice Maxey said: “he [the plaintiff] found the entrance thereto open and no guard or gate down, and believing the elevator lift to be level with the floor on which he was at that time, he walked through the opening and fell to the bottom of the elevator shaft.”</p>

In explaining the probable state of mind of the plaintiff Murphy when he approached the elevator, the revered jurist of Lackawanna County said: “When one becomes accustomed after long experience to finding elevator shafts safeguarded, he naturally takes it for granted that <em>all </em>elevator shafts are safeguarded.”</p>
