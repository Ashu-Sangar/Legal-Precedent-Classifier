Our immediate inquiry is whether, in the factual matrix of the case at bar, the conduct of these pickets constituted an invasion of the private property of Weis and/or Logan.

    <p id="b422-6" data-blocks='[["BL_422.7",422,[202,2052,1148,98]],["BL_423.1",423,[152,405,1159,1642]]]'>Our research does not disclose that we have ever determined whether the property in a shopping center, <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>accessory to its main purposes, constituted private or quasi-public property. Resolution of that question involves the consideration of many factors. There is no doubt that this shopping center was not conveyed, donated or otherwise dedicated to the public use generally; neither the record nor common sense would justify such a finding. Both Weis and Logan, the former in opening its store and the latter in creating its shopping center as an area upon which commercial enterprises would be conducted, fully anticipated that that portion of the public interested in patronage of Weis’ store and the other commercial enterprises, opened and expected to be opened, would not only enter the stores but would utilize fully the parking and the parcel pick-up facilities of the center. The provision of such facilities furnishes attractive features in the complex of the shopping center to attract potential shoppers. The success of both Weis’ store and the Logan shopping center depends upon the extent to which both are able to induce and persuade the public to visit and shop in the area. Both Weis and Logan, by their provision of the parking and pick-up facilities impliedly invited the public to utilize such facilities.. However, that invitation to the public was not without restriction and limitation; it was not an invitation to the general public to utilize the area for whatever purpose it deemed advisable but only to those members of the public who would be potential customers and possibly would contribute to the financial success of the venture.</p>

That the invitation to the public was general, <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>as the Union implicitly urges, offends the common sense of the matter.</p>
    <p id="b424-4" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[208,506,1153,813]]]'>Moreover, in the case at bar, that Weis had taken special precautions against an indiscriminate use of its property is evident from this record. It had posted a sign on its property which stated “No trespassing or soliciting is allowed on Weis Market porch or parking lot by anyone except Weis employees without the consent of the management”. A general invitation to certain classes of persons to use the premises and the exclusion of certain other classes of persons from such use is fully consistent with the right of a property owner to the use and enjoyment of his property. See: <em>Adderley v. Florida, </em><a href="/us/385/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="385 U.S. 39" data-case-ids="11334139" data-case-paths="/us/385/0039-01">385 U.S. 39</a>, 48, <a href="/us/385/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="385 U.S. 39" data-case-ids="11334139" data-case-paths="/us/385/0039-01">87 S.

In <em>Great Leopard, </em>seven employees of Great Leopard went on strike and the picketing was conducted by blocking the sole driveway entrance to the supermarket and a foot-bridge which connected a municipal parking lot and the supermarket property. We were of the opinion that the terms of the injunction were too broad and modified the injunction to permit picketing in the front and the rear of the supermarket. In <em>Great Leopard, </em>we did not determine either the status of the supermarket property nor whether the employees were trespassers. Moreover, it is to be noted that the pickets were employees of the supermarket whereas in the case at bar the pickets were not and never had been employees of Weis. In our view, <em>Great Leopard </em>is not controlling of the instant appeal.</p>

To hold that these property owners solicited the use of their property by persons who were attempting to discourage the public from patronizing the store facilities lacks any basis in law or common sense. These pickets, even though engaged in picketing of a peaceful nature, had no right or authority whatsoever to utilize the private property of Weis and/or Logan for such picketing purposes; such use constituted a trespass which very properly was restrained.</p>

The majority have chosen to regard the rights attendant to private ownership of property but not the burdens which attach thereto. Throughout the law, there is recognized the principle that even owners of private property must observe and conform to certain community standards in the use and maintenance of their land, as witness the law of nuisance, zoning and negligence of property owners. And, most especially, as witness the law of labor relations. In <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em><a href="/us/310/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="310 U.S. 88" data-case-ids="6137179" data-case-paths="/us/310/0088-01">310 U.S. 88</a> (1940), the United <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>States Supreme Court held that peaceful picketing is entitled to the same constitutional protection as other forms of free speech. In <em>Thornhill, </em>the pickets were employees of the picketed employer, with whom they had a labor dispute. Only a year later, the Supreme Court extended the constitutional protection under <em>Thornhill </em>to a situation wherein the pickets were not employees of the picketed establishment but were members of a union which had unsuccessfully attempted to organize the establishment’s employees. <em>A.F.L. v. Swing, <a href="/us/312/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="312 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="359055" data-case-paths="/us/312/0321-01">312 U.S. 321</a> (1941). </em>Such “stranger picketing” is, therefore, constitutionally protected. The instant matter cannot be resolved by an analysis limited to the rights associated with private property. Concomitant to these rights are certain restrictions, one of which is that freedom of speech and freedom of the press often require that the rights of private ownership yield. In <em>Marsh v. Alabama, </em><a href="/us/326/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="326 U.S. 501" data-case-ids="6157703" data-case-paths="/us/326/0501-01">326 U.S. 501</a> (1946), the Supreme Court stated, “Ownership does not always mean absolute dominion. The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.” <a href="/us/326/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="326 U.S. 501" data-case-ids="6157703" data-case-paths="/us/326/0501-01">326 U.S. at 566</a>. In <em>Marsh, </em>the Court held that the constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press and of religion precluded the enforcement of a state criminal statute against a Jehovah’s Witness who distributed religious literature on a street of a company owned town. The Court reasoned that because the street was opened to the public in general and, though privately owned, served a public function, private management could not curtail precious constitutional liberties.</p>

Accordingly, I deem unincisive the majority’s failure to recognize any conflict between the rights of private ownership and the constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of speech and of the press. Just as there exists a conflict between the right to distribute printed religious matter in a company town and a statute restricting such activity, so too there exists a conflict between a union’s right to picket peacefully and a shopping center’s policy not to permit such activity within the boundaries of the center.

As one observer commented, shopping center grounds are possessed of more attributes of a public way than the Marshall Field owned street because the public would use the shopping center public ways to a far greater extent than it could use the company owned street.
