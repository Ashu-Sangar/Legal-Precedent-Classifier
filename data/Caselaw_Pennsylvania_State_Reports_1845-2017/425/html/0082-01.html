As to the other six items, the court below expressed the view that five were not improper and noted that appellees had withdrawn their objections to the remaining one. In this appeal not only do the appellants ask us to reverse the court below with regard to the propriety of the expenditure of state money for the Special Death Benefit Fund, but appellees also urge us to overturn the ruling that one of the five other expenditures considered, i.e., payment by the Relief Association of $100 per annum to the Firemen’s Legislative Federation of Pennsylvania,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> was not improper.</p>

The statute contains no language or thought such as “all” or “equally” which the Auditor General seems to find in it. Nor does the. statute support the appellees’ suggestion that only men actually present at the scene of fires are eligible for benefits from the funds distributed under the Act. The phrase “as is or are engaged in the service” does not warrant that conclusion, first because “service” is not tantamount to presence at the scene of a fire, and second because, as an examination of the surrounding adjectival expressions readily discloses, “as is or are engaged in the service” clearly modifies the term “fire company, or fire companies” and not the term “employes.”</p>

In <em>Souder </em>we affirmed a Superior Court decision in which it was held that the Act of 1895 did not authorize the officers of a relief association to appropriate money received from the state under the Act of 1895 to their own use; in <em>Hanover </em>we held that money received from the state under legislation closely similar to the Act of 1895, could not, upon dissolution of the Pension &amp; Benefit Association, merely be distributed to the former members thereof, but that such money must be placed in the successor pension and relief fund. As we read <em>Souder </em>and <em>Hanover, </em>they only stand for the proposition that money received from the state by pension and relief associations do not thereby vest in the memberships thereof, but must be distributed for “pension” and “relief” purposes. It is hardly disputable, and it has not been disputed in the instant litigation, that money distributed by the appellant’s Special Death Benefit Fund is expended for relief.</p>

      <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>As stated above, appellees, seek in this appeal to have ns correct the ruling of the court below that the $100 annual contribution by the Relief Association to the Firemen’s Legislative Federation of Pennsylvania is not an improper expenditure of money received under the Act of 1895. In its opinion the court below observed that: “[the federation] follows legislation in Pennsylvania which affects firemen in the Commonwealth. By attempting to secure favorable legislation, the Association attempts to maintain and improve the protections and benefits of firemen throughout the state and so to attract able men to fire duty. Specifically, it attempts to insure that the Commonwealth continue to pay proceeds of the foreign fire insurance tax to relief associations so that funds are available for relief purposes” and determined that appellant’s contribution was not improper because “spent to provide directly for the benefit and protection of the Association’s membership.” In its brief in this Court, appellees contend that the court below erred because the contribution to a “lobbying group” is not a “direct benefit” to a relief association. Appellees do not suggest why such a contribution is not a “direct benefit,” and more, pertinently, what in the Act of 1895 requires, that the money disbursed thereunder be used for the “direct,” rather than the “indirect,” benefit of a relief association. Suffice it to say, that we find the opinion of the court below entirely satisfactory in this regard. Indeed, for this Court to hold that state money specifically appropriated to an association of those involved in performing public duties may not properly be used to enable that group to follow state legislation affecting itself and its members in the discharge of their public duties would cast doubt on the propriety of the legislative activities of numerous as<a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>sedations the existence and expenditure of public funds which is presently authorized by statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

I consider this argument misdirected. The auditor general’s only concern is to determine if the funds received by appellant from the Commonwealth are being spent in accordance with the purpose for which they were paid. In doing so, the auditor general’s duty and power to examine the books and records of the association are clear, as is his duty to refuse to approve requisitions for further payment if he determines that funds are being used for an improper purpose. This does not involve interference with the internal affairs of appellant for, as the Auditor General has stated, nothing prevents the association from establishing a special death bene<a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>fit limited in its coverage as long as Commonwealth funds are not used for this purpose.</p>

It states that the amount involved shall be paid “. . . to the relief fund association of . . . the fire department, or of such fire company, or fire companies, paid or volunteer ... as is or are engaged in the service of [the municipality] and duly recognized as such by the council . . . of such city . . . .” In <em>Commonwealth v.

The necessary, though unstated, implication of that holding was that the funds had to be used for the general relief and protection of all the members of the receiving association. We so indicated in our prior opinion in this case, <a href="/pa/415/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="415 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1891832" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0305-01">415 Pa. 305</a>, 308, <a href="/citations/?q=203%20A.2d%20476" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="203 A.2d 476">203 A. 2d 476</a>, 478, and in our opinion in <em>Hanover Township Police Pension &amp; Benefit Fund Association </em>Case, <a href="/pa/396/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="396 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="1284905" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0313-01">396 Pa. 313</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20705" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="152 A.2d 705">152 A. 2d 705</a> <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>(1959), dealing with the analogous police pension benefit associations which receive the premiums tax paid to the Commonwealth by foreign casualty insurance companies.</p>
    <p id="b129-3" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[127,604,1151,695]]]'>I perceive no reason to retreat from this position. While appellant argues with some force that its special death benefit serves a useful purpose in the recruitment of volunteers and in practice costs very little, it cannot escape the fact that Commonwealth funds intended for the relief of all members of the association are being used to provide a benefit for fewer than all. This is improper and cannot be justified even for good reasons. Therefore, I would now squarely hold that the payments made by the Commonwealth under the Act of 1895 may be used only for the general relief of all active and formerly active members of the relief fund associations.</p>
    <p id="b129-4" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[125,1320,1153,812]]]'>With respect to the $100 per year payment by appellant to the Firemen’s Legislative Federation of Pennsylvania, I am tempted to say simply that this is <em>de minimis </em>in view of its negligible effect upon appellant’s funds. However, I do not believe that such a conclusion is warranted in a situation where we deal with a statutory directive of this nature. There is no way to comply with the legislative purpose of providing relief for firemen except to do so completely, and use of any of the Commonwealth funds for lobbying activity is not such a compliance. It just does not jell to say that the legislature has permitted funds that it allocated for a designated purpose to be used to influence and to direct the prospective determinations Of the appropriating authority.</p>
