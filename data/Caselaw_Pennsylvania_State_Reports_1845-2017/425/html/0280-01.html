The common pleas court held “that decedent’s ownership of the real estate terminated upon his remarriage so that the property never became part of his estate”, that the deed of November 5, 1956, constituted a cloud on the title of the children and that the common pleas court had jurisdiction of the subject matter. <em>(Tallarico v.

Such intention was made known to the children by reason of occasional conversations with some of the children concerning the contents and purpose of the agreement. That the second wife, after her marriage, became cognizant of such intention is evidenced by two occurrences: (1) the decedent had <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>written a letter to his second wife telling her that the “property belongs to the children”; (2) the second wife testified concerning a meeting,—which had taken place subsequent to her marriage to decedent—, between decedent, an attorney and herself whereat the attorney informed her that, before any transfer of the realty could be made to her, the children would have to sign such instrument. There can be no doubt on this record that the decedent definitely was of the opinion that his remarriage completely divested him of any title or claim of ownership to the realty.</p>

In such situations “. . . ‘the delivery may be proved by the declarations of the donor, just as the gift itself may be; and when the donor declares that he had given at a previous time, and that the donee had then become the owner, it is implied that delivery, and indeed every other formality necessary to create a gift, had taken place. The law always presumes knowledge of its requirements.’ ”: <em>Leitch v.

In the case at bar the decedent did so declare during his lifetime. Both tenants by the entireties, particularly the first wife, intended a gift of the realty to the children upon the occurrence of a remarriage and considered the delivery of the agreement to the first wife an effective delivery to the children. The effective date of such delivery relates back to the remarriage of decedent and the second wife. The donees of a gift of an executory interest are presumed to accept such gift absent any showing of an intent to the contrary, and the instant record reveals no such contrary intent. We are satisfied that, upon the remarriage of decedent, the gift of realty to the children became complete.</p>
