It has an active membership of 1,000, most of whom are over 65 years of age, and was incorporated for the purpose of fostering and promoting American-Jewish culture, the ideas of American democracy, and the improvement and enrichment of the social life of its members. For 45 of the 68 years of its existence, it has owned and maintained a four-story building located at 701 Pine Street, Philadelphia. It has used this building for meetings of its members and has also rented the meeting rooms for various other social, beneficial, charitable and union organizations. This rental was without regard to race, creed, color or national origin, and from this, Boslover received approximately $10,000 per year.</p>

The trouble in this case began when the Redevelopment Authority of Philadelphia prepared an Urban Renewal Plan for what is known as the Washington Square East Urban Renewal Area, Unit No. 3, the area including the Boslover property. On August 22,1962, the Authority sub<a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>mitted its plan to City Council which approved it through enactment of Ordinance No. 2219, which specifically recognized as one of the uses to be permitted: “The Boslover Beneficial Association at 701 Pine Street.” The Ordinance also stated that the premises were to be exempt from condemnation upon the execution of a Rehabilitation Contract with the authority.</p>
    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[212,787,1150,424]]]'>On May 16, 1963, the Authority advised the Boslover organization by letter that “this property is compatible with the residential character of the neighborhood and . . . can remain and be rehabilitated for its <em>present use.” </em>(Emphasis supplied). In accordance with this communication and after further conferring with the Authority, the Boslover organization expended $28,000 for improvements.</p>

    <p id="b576-6" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[211,1712,1151,694]]]'>Clause 19 came as a thunderclap in a clear sky to Boslover and its members. Throughout the course of the negotiations, discussions and legislative action by the City Council of Philadelphia, the entire emphasis was on physical rehabilitation of the building. Not even the shadow of a hint obtruded to suggest that the Authority would have, or could have, supervisory powers over how the Boslover building was to be used, except in the manner it had operated theretofore. When City Council, as I have stated, authorized the Boslover building as one of the uses to be permitted, it obviously meant the uses which had been historically associated with the building.</p>

      <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>Clause 19 thus arbitrarily offends against the law in the case laid down by City Council. But it goes further. It is capricious in the extreme. For instance, it prohibits members from inviting their wives to functions in the building unless the wives themselves become members. The Authority has, no more right to impose such a condition than it would have to demand that men entering the building must be attired in white tie and tails and the women arrayed in low-neck and floor-sweeping gowns.</p>
    <p id="b577-3" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[152,955,1161,750]]]'>Clause 19 is so high-handed, arbitrary, and capricious that Boslover would not be permitted to offer a dinner or an award to an astronaut or an ambassador unless he first became a member of the organization. But, apart from the absurdities residing in Clause 19, ,it invites Authorities from now on to embark on sociological ventures for which they have no authority, training or aptitude. To allow Authorities to stand at the door of those buildings which come within' their redevelopment areas and determine who should and should not enter, is to empower them with a tyrannical supervision which, if fully exercised, could change the sociological face of the communities in which they operate.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[158,1719,1153,421]]]'>Clause 19 would practically destroy the Boslover Association because, without its renting prerogatives, it would be deprived of the very sinews which hold it together; without income the building could not be operated, and without a structure within which to perform its functions, Boslover’s charitable enterprises would wither and die and thus the whole purpose of the Boslover Association would perish.</p>

This presented Boslover with virtual annihilation from either quarter. If <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>it accepted Clause 19, it would have no revenue with which to run the building, and if it did not accept, the building would be subject to demolition.</p>
    <p id="b578-4" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[196,566,1149,588]]]'>In this state of affairs, Boslover turned, as its only recourse, to the courts. On February 14, 1966, it filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, requesting that the Authority be compelled to enter into a Rehabilitation agreement with Boslover, without the self-destructive Clause 19 and as provided for by the Urban Renewal Plan. On March 11, 1966, the Authority filed preliminary objections in the form of a demurrer. The court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. The plaintiff appealed.</p>
    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.5",578,[197,1166,1151,749]]]'>The court conceded that the Redevelopment Authority is a proper subject for mandamus (Pa. R. C. P. 1094) but held that the writ could issue only to compel the performance of a ministerial act and not one which involved discretion. This is, of course, a correct statement of the law, but the court overlooked the realities of the case. The Authority’s discretion was limited to determining whether the property was to be acquired for rehabilitation or exempted from acquisition and a rehabilitation agreement to be entered into between the Authority and the owners. The Authority exercised its discretion by resolving that the property would not be acquired but “can remain and be rehabilitated for its <em>present use." </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b578-6" data-blocks='[["BL_578.6",578,[199,1927,1150,478]],["BL_579.1",579,[151,403,1155,1518]]]'>Having exercised this discretion in the manner indicated, the Authority should act in conformity with the scope of that discretionary decision. When it declared that 701 Pine Street was to be exempt from condemnation and Boslover was to accomplish the rehabilitation, Boslover acquired the right to a rehabilitation agreement, and the Authority acknowledged the duty of executing such an agreement. Having notified Boslover on May 16,1965, that it could remain and its <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>building be rehabilitated for “its present use”, the Authority exhausted its discretion. It could not later add the condition that the building was to be operated in a manner different from the manner in which it had theretofore been operated. The Authority’s remaining task for accomplishment was to execute the agreement on which there was a concord, and for which there existed a Oouncilmanic mandate. The Authority could not, after the contractual cement had hardened, smash it open with the sledge hammer of an alleged discretion in a field in which it had no discretion. “. . . [I]f the officer has exercised and has exhausted his discretion, and has thereby decided all the questions which come properly and legally within his discretion in the relator’s favor, and has refused to perform the act for a reason neither legally nor properly -within the scope of his discretion, the writ (of mandamus) will lie to compel him to do the specific act which his own judgment has shown him he should do, upon the ground that the act remaining to be performed by him is a mere ministerial duty.” (34 Am. Jur., Mandamus, §73, p. 863). In <em>Pearlman v. </em>Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/304/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="304 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1132407" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0024-01">304 Pa. 24</a>, this Court said: “There is a discretion vested in the board to determine who are and who are not responsible bidders,—a sound discretion to be exercised in a given way, as we shall point out later,—but once <em>it is determined which of the bidders are responsible, discretion ends." </em>(Emphasis supplied)</p>

Delay may deplete or irreparably impair those rights. Boslover is being considerably handicapped today in carrying out its functions because of the guillotine blade the Authority has raised above its <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>head. With the threat of legal demise constantly hovering over the premises, the Association cannot enter into long range commitments for the premises, it may not carry out its charitable enterprises with efficiency and dispatch.</p>

If Boslover has been allowed to rent its halls for wedding celebrations in the past, its continuing use for that purpose cannot become a basis for a Clause 19. A wedding is hardly a quiet affair. The gala event is bound to be celebrated with music, laughter and cheers for the bride. To demand that no audible sounds emanate from a marital jubilee is like demanding that no orange blossoms decorate the bridal veil. Bar mitzvahs also ring with music, speeches and applause for the younster about to turn from the carefree path of childhood onto the broad road of serious and religious dedication to his career. All this is traditional and cannot be changed by a redevelopment authority. Moreover Boslover has asserted, and it has not been denied, that all its functions are conducted with decorum and order, and they terminate no later than midnight; also that the premises are not utilized for social functions during the period from June 1st to October 1st.</p>

The Authority cited from §1711 (9) (b) to the effect that it may include in any deed or lease “such provisions as the Authority may deem desirable to run with the land in order to effectuate the purposes of this act.” Certain<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>ly the law would strike down auy covenant to run with the land which denied the Negroes and Puerto Ricans the right to peaceably assemble in a hall they have legally rented and legally paid for.</p>
    <p id="b583-3" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[156,612,1152,969]]]'>The Majority Opinion does not discuss these matters. It contents itself with saying that it is possible the plaintiff may be entitled to relief “in the proper forum and by a proper cause of action.” I submit that it has selected the proper forum and it has filed a proper cause of action. I submit that it is unanswerable that the Authority, having decided not to acquire the Boslover property, but to permit it to remain in the enjoyment of its “present use,” and having submitted a rehabilitation agreement, has exercised its discretion to the hilt and must, therefore, now perform on that exercised discretion. Its attempt to include in the agreement more than it was authorized to include, was an arbitrary act which should be declared null and void. Our compelling the Authority to execute the contract it must execute in view of its having exhausted its discretion in the matter would be merely compelling the performance of a ministerial act.</p>
    <p id="b583-4" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[156,1593,1152,479]]]'>I believe the Authority in this case has more important things to do than to tell the owners of property that the walls of their buildings may not ring with the music of wedding marches and the joyous singing of Bar Mitzvahs. I believe also that it is treading on dangerous territory when it says that property owners may not bring the Constitution onto their land as a protector against discrimination because of race or ethnic background.</p>

The appellant did not request the court below to compel the Redevelopment Authority to exercise its discretion in any manner. That discretion, as Mr. Justice Musmanno points out, has already been exercised; the enactment of City Council coupled with the prior acts of the Authority leaves no further ambit for discretionary action in the circumstances this case presents. All that remains to be done is for the Authority to express its formal assent to the agreement— drawn by it—with the unauthorized Clause 19<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">*</a> deleted.</p>

The clause which the Authority seeks to include in the rehabilitation agreement does not deal with the rehabiUtation of the property; rather the clause represents an attempt to regulate the internal policy of a private association as to the use of its facilities. Such interference with the internal affairs of the association is offensive not only to reason, but also to the legal powers of the Authority.</p>
