The motion was defeated. Throughout the entire period of the disagreement between the city and the defendant union, no incumbent councilman appeared as a candidate for reelection in the 29th Ward.

The plaintiffs, after posting $50 each, in accordance with union rules, appealed to the International President of the International Union. The president reversed the decision of <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>the local union which, in turn, appealed to the International Executive Board and to the International Convention.

Defendant lodge is part of a beneficial organization, and there is a finding that plaintiff has a substantial property interest therein; under these circumstances, it will not do to say that he can freely regain full liberty of action, at any time, by disassociating himself from the order; but, even if he could, the rule, as construed by defendants, would still be discountenanced, and void in law.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

When the plaintiff brought an action to be restored to the union, the defendant union argued that the plaintiff had violated the by-laws of the union and, therefore, had no rights the union was bound to recognize. The Superior Court ordered the plaintiff to be reinstated in the union, declaring: “If this were simply a question of sentiment, it might be that, even under such circumstances, courts would hesitate to interfere, but the plaintiff below had unquestioned property rights involved which the law is bound to protect. He <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>had for a number of years paid into the treasury of the association to meet its obligations to other members.

Even by his presence alone he may declare that he is objecting to a certain state of affairs. The union in this case, therefore, argues that to require members to exercise public speech through picketing is not to deny freedom of speech but to implement it. However, the defendant fails to realize that the right to speak carries with it its inevitable counterpart, the right not to speak. If freedom of speech meant forced speech, American skyscrapers to garrulity would make of the Tower of Babel a mute mud hut in comparison.</p>

The torture of the third degree was a coercion to speech. It was because of the heinous and often barbarous methods employed to force a tongue into action when its owner knew that closed lips were his only safety, that our forefathers wrote into the Constitution the 5th Amendment which protects his silence. “The liberty to write or speak includes the corresponding right to be silent and also the liberty to decline to write, and such rights, as well as the right of privacy, or the right to speak only when one may speak freely, are insured under this constitutional provision.” (First Amendment) 11 Am.

The alleged grievance of the union was with the mayor and the then current city council. The retaliatory action was directed at all those who might be candidates for council, even those who had never been councilmen. In addition, the picketing was aimed at candidates for office in no way involved in the friction between the union and the city. This meant, therefore, that the plaintiffs would be compelled to oppose by signs, and by picketing, candidates for whom they might well have a decided, preference.

The arena of the conflict between the union and the city was in the city hall, not in the outlying political territory. If, in a battle, a bullet ricochets and hits someone far removed from the battlefield, it would be difficult to assign fault for the chance wounding. But, here, the wounding would not be by chance. The defendant trained its batteries on the city wards and on persons not even remotely concerned with the controversy,* the artillery shots were aimed at candidates running for office which could not conceivably be brought <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>into the argument between the union and the city council.

It is possible to gauge the conduct of a person who is before one’s eyes, it is in order to appraise the demeanor of a person who is visible, one can rate a person on his attitude by watching him perform or listen to him speak, but it is impossible to say that a person’s conduct is unbecoming when he cannot be seen, felt or heard. The plaintiffs were convicted for doing nothing under an order which did not legally compel them to do anything. They were convicted in a vacuum.

Yet the constitutional importance of a group’s right to discipline members in furtherance of its common purpose makes it incumbent on courts to minimize judicial interference with such rights.

    <p id="b282-4" data-blocks='[["BL_282.4",282,[199,614,1151,1399]]]'>The opinion of the Court in this case appears to rest on two approaches which I think we would do well to avoid. First the Court appears to say that the fines (backed by a threat of expulsion) imposed on appellees may not be enforced because of appellees’ vested property rights in various union funds. Quite correctly the Court relies on <em>Spayd v. Ringing Rock Lodge, </em><a href="/pa/270/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="270 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1066015" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0067-01">270 Pa. 67</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.%2070" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="113 A. 70">113 Atl. 70</a> (1921) for this view. In light of the constitutional importance with which I view the right of a voluntary association to promote its legitimate common purpose, by determining its own membership, however, I believe it would be unnecessary and unwise in most cases to enjoin the imposition of discipline or expulsion merely to protect vested property rights. Such rights can be equally well protected by simply requiring the group to compensate the disciplined member for those losses incurred which courts feel are in violation of proprietal or contractual rights. Compensatory rather than injunctive relief will avoid in large part any interference with a group’s right to exclude from its ranks members who obstruct its legitimate common purposes. Moreover, such an approach is far more consistent with the practice of equity in declining to afford injunctive relief unless relief in damages would not remedy asserted injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a>

Putting aside <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>completely the question of whether any meaningful distinction can be drawn between union “political” and “economic” activities, see <em>International Ass’n of Machinists v. </em>Street, <a href="/us/367/0740-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="367 U.S. 740" data-case-ids="1785561" data-case-paths="/us/367/0740-01">367 U.S. 740</a>, 797-819, <a href="/us/367/0740-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="367 U.S. 740" data-case-ids="1785561" data-case-paths="/us/367/0740-01">81 S. Ct. 1784</a>, 1814-25 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), it seems to me that picketing here was reasonably related to the union’s economic objectives. After all, the employers whose conduct the union were seeking to affect were the mayor and members of city council. The power of these individuals to affect appellees’ terms of employment ultimately flows from the electorate and more immediately from those bodies, such as ward committees, which organize the diffuse wishes of the electorate into an articulate message understandable by its elected representatives. To say, therefore, that it was unreasonably outside the union’s central purpose for appellees, after trying and failing to secure their demands at the offices of the mayor and city council, to carry their picketed message to the source of the mayor and city councilmen’s power in the wards strikes me as distinctly unsound. As well, one might find unreasonable the picketing of a stockholders meeting by a union whose picketing of the management offices of a private business had failed to induce the management to negotiate.</p>

That this is so where a union is designated as an exclusive bargaining agent by virtue of a statutorily authorized process seems clear. But even where a union is not so vested with power by government, it is not realistic to view it as voluntary and private in the same sense as other groups are. <em>Mitchell v.

    <p id="b284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[195,1019,1150,586]]]'>Courts have been confronted before with a union’s claim to discipline members whose exercise of the right of free speech violated union policies. Unfortunately most of the earlier cases have been resolved on the basis of contractual fictions, the “reasonableness” of the union’s policy in light of what the courts believe should be the union’s “economic” objective<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_7" id="ref_footnote_3_7">7</a> or on statutory grounds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_8" id="ref_footnote_3_8">8</a> Such resolutions are not overly helpful in the task, as I conceive it, of reconciling the individual union member’s right to free speech with the union’s right to determine its membership.</p>

International Ass’n of Machinists, </em>supra, however, the court did resort to such a balancing test.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_9" id="ref_footnote_3_9">9</a> The issue in <em>Mitchell </em>was the union’s right to expel two members who had violated union rules by advocating, in their individual capacities, passage of a right to work law. The court upheld an injunction barring expulsion on the ground that the breach <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>of union discipline was not so inimical to the broad range of objectives espoused by the union as to warrant the imposition of a restraint of free speech. While it may be contended that the breach of union discipline here was more inimical to the union’s purposes than in the <em>Mitchell </em>case, I believe that the <em>Mitchell </em>analysis sustains the result reached by the Court here. Indeed the appellees’ conduct, while arguably decreasing the effectiveness of the union’s campaign of bringing pressure to bear on the mayor and city council, was not the least inimical to the broader purpose of the union’s endeavor. By contrast, the ability of the union to require its members to express themselves in a way in which they do not believe is to my mind even more offensive to constitutional protection of freedom of speech than would be a prohibition on their ability to express what they believed. It is by taking this into consideration with the fact that a member’s relation to his union is not of the same voluntary nature as that of a member to other private associations that I come to the conclusion that we must affirm the decision of the court below.</p>
