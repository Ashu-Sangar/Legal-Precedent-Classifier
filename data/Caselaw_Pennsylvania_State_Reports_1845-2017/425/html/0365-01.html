At approximately 4:00 a.m. on the same date, while Staino was in the Reading State Police Barracks with five police officers present, Captain Ferguson of the Philadelphia Police Department advised him: “that [he] did not have to make a statement but if [he] did, anything that [he] said would be used against [him] at [his] trial.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Captain Ferguson then read to Staino a statement of one Robert Poulson which implicated Staino in the Rich burglary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Throughout the reading of that statement, Staino time and again stated “I have nothing to say”.</p>

In <em>Dravecz, </em>Mr. Justice <em>Eagen in </em>a concurring opinion joined in by a majority of this Court, stated: “Our ruling in Shadd was directly responsive to a statement by the United States Supreme Court in <em>[Miranda] </em>.... However, since Shadd involved a collateral attack on a judgment finalized several years previously, we held that the new ruling declaring the evidentiary use of ‘tacit admissions’ impermissible did not apply or affect the validity of the judgment therein.</p>

Likewise, while the proscription against evidentiary use of ‘tacit admissions’ was implicit in Malloy, it was Miranda that first spelled it out.

When Staino arrived in Reading, he was greeted by a police captain who told him of the reason for his arrest, informed him that he had a constitutional right to remain silent and warned him that anything he might say could be used against him at trial. Thereupon, the police read to Staino a confession by one Robert Poulson, later repudiated, implicating Staino in the burglary for which he stands convicted; Staino responded by either informing the police that “I have nothing to say”, or by remaining mute. Yet despite the warnings given him prior to the reading of Poulson’s confession, Staino’s decision not to deny the truth of the statement was admitted, over objection, at his trial as a tacit admission.</p>
