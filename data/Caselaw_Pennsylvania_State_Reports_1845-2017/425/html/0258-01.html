After Thomi’s mother, Anna Marie Snellgrose (hereinafter referred to as “Mrs. Snellgrose”), had been notified of the proceedings, she filed an answer opposing the petition for adoption. Mrs. Snellgrose also filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in order to obtain custody of Thomi. Hearings in the adoption case were held on July 6, 12, and 14, 1966. Over the objection of counsel for the Harrises, the Court in Lebanon County proceeded to take evidence in the habeas corpus case as well as in the adoption case, the same Judge sitting as both an Orphans’ Court Judge and a Common Pleas Court Judge. The record in the adoption proceeding was incorporated by reference in the habeas corpus proceeding.</p>

In the meantime, while unmarried, she gave birth to Thomi on March 5,1956 in Stuttgart, Germany; the reputed father was an American serviceman.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.5",297,[151,795,1153,589]]]'>The Harrises took an active interest in the lives of both Thomi and Mrs. Snellgrose from the moment of their arrival in this Country. This interest resulted in Thomi’s living with the Harrises for two extended periods of time—from October 1959 to December 1961, and from June 1964 to the present time. The Harrises contend that during each and both of these periods Mrs. Snellgrose had abandoned Thomi. Before considering the specific circumstances surrounding Thomi’s living with the Harrises, it is appropriate to consider the law concerning adoption.</p>

The Act of April 4, 1925, P. L. 127, §2, 1 P.S. §2, provides that a child may be adopted if the child’s natural mother (1) consents to the adoption of the child, or (2) has “abandoned” the child for a period of six months or more. In the latter case, the child may be adopted, irrespective of whether the mother consents. There is neither any allegation nor any proof by the Harrises that Mrs. Snellgrose has consented to the adoption of Thomi. Therefore, the sole question presented by this appeal is whether there is adequate evidence to support the finding of the Court below that Mrs. Snellgrose has not abandoned Thomi for at least six months. <em>A finding of consent or abandonment is an absolute prerequisite to the approval of an adoption petition.

The Harrises offered to take Thomi to their home in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and Thomi’s mother consented. Thomi stayed with the Harrises until December 1961. While Mrs. Snellgrose corresponded infrequently with the Harrises and Thomi, she made three or four visits to see her daughter at the Harrises’ home during this time. She did not contribute to Thomi’s support because the Harrises advised her that this was not necessary and that she should use the money to help establish herself. During this period of time, Mrs. Snellgrose married Mr. Snellgrose, and when the Harrises indicated their desire to adopt Thomi, Mr. and Mrs. Snellgrose immediately reclaimed Thomi from the Harrises. Mr. Snellgrose then instituted adoption proceedings in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which culminated in his adoption of <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>Thomi as his daughter.

Mrs. Snellgrose agreed to this request. However, Thomi did not return to Mrs. Snellgrose at the end of the summer because of (a) Mrs. Snellgrose’s financial difficulties and (b) her illness, which resulted in her undergoing two operations—one in January 1965 and one in July 1965. In the summer of 1965, Mrs. Snellgrose visited Thomi before the Harrises, with Mrs. Snellgrose’s consent, took Thomi to Europe for a vacation. In the Fall of 1965, Mrs. Snellgrose sold a house which she had owned and bought another one in a better neighborhood. The purpose of her move was, at the suggestion of the Harrises, intended to improve the community in which Thomi was to live when she returned home. Mrs. Snellgrose prepared a room in the new house for Thomi. During this period of time, Mrs. Snellgrose corresponded with and telephoned the Harrises and Thomi at various times. When Mrs. Snellgrose received a letter from Thomi in November 1965, indicating that Thomi desired to remain with the Harrises on a permanent basis, she immediately telephoned Thomi to oppose this request. When the Harrises instituted this action to adopt Thomi, Mrs. Snellgrose immediately contested the action.</p>
