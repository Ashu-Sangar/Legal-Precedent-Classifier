There was some correspondence between the executor and New York counsel.

On February 9th or 10th, appellant was informed at the office of his New York counsel of the distribution decreed by the auditing judge and the amount of decedent’s estate decreed to the petitioners. Appellant had expected a greater share and refused to sign the distribution receipt for his share and discharged his New York counsel. However, the executor was not informed of their dissatisfaction, nor did they file exceptions thereto. <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>The first knowledge of dissatisfaction by the executor was when he was served with a copy of petition for review, which had been filed on April 7, 1965, two months and 10 days after the decree of distribution, and 7 days after decedent’s granddaughter had cashed her distribution check. This petition was denied by the court en banc, one judge dissenting, and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b434-4" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[204,856,1148,422]]]'>We agree with the conclusion reached by the lower court that in the absence of proof of fraud, and distribution of the decedent’s estate having been made by the executor in accordance with the decree of the court, §721 of the Fiduciaries Act is controlling, and we agree that the court below does not have the power to grant the review. See <em>Thomas Estate, </em><a href="/pa/397/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="397 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1286285" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0403-01">397 Pa. 403</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.2d%20816" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="155 A.2d 816">155 A. 2d 816</a> (1959).</p>
    <p id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.5",434,[203,1288,1149,587]]]'>Appellant contends that the fact that distribution was made before the petition for review was filed does not bar review of the decree of distribution. Appellant indicates that he was lulled into believing that his portion would be far greater than what he received, and that the executor should have informed him as to his recommended distribution. With this contention we cannot agree. A careful review of the record has failed to reveal any evidence of fraud, either actual or constructive, on the part of the executor. The court below reached the same opinion, stating:</p>
    <p id="b434-6" data-blocks='[["BL_434.6",434,[200,1887,1151,532]],["BL_435.1",435,[149,404,1150,307]]]'>“The correspondence between the executor’s counsel and the petitioners and their New York counsel,... demonstrates beyond cavil that the decedent’s executor, by his counsel fully, accurately, and truthfully informed the petitioners and their New York counsel as to all matters pertaining to the administration of the decedent’s estate, and gave them all notices required by statute and Court Rule. Copies of the decedent’s will, the inventory and appraisement, and the executor’s account were sent to and received by the petition<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>ers and their New York counsel. They were notified of the decedent’s widow’s election to take against his will, and a copy of the Pennsylvania Statute pertaining to the right of the widow to elect to take against the will was sent to and received by the petitioners’ New York counsel.”</p>
    <p id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[148,732,1152,1397]]]'>We also find to be without merit appellant’s contention that the decree of distribution is void by reason of the executor’s failure to notify him of his intention to seek an intestate distribution, or that a disputable question would arise. As the decedent’s widow had elected to take against the will, the burden of determining the effect of this election on the will was on the auditing judge and it was his duty to enter a decree of distribution in accordance with his determination. The executor had no duty to submit any proposed distribution, and if he did so, he did not relieve the orphans’ court judge of his burden. As stated by the court below : “Since the executor’s inclusion of a suggested distribution in his petition for distribution was not required and was surplusage, and was not, therefore, binding on the petitioners or the auditing Judge, and the petitioners knew that the auditing Judge would be required to determine the effect of the widow’s election on the provisions of the decedent’s will, the failure of the executor to notify the petitioners that the so-called ‘Statement of Proposed Distribution’ would be included in the petition for distribution which would be filed at the audit of his account, did not violate the statutes of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Orphans’ Court Rules of the Supreme Court, or the Rules of this Court.”</p>

If any party in interest shall, within five years after the final confirmation of any account of a personal representative, file a petition to review any part of the account, or of an auditor’s report, or of the adjudication or of any decree of distribution, setting forth specifically alleged errors therein, the court shall give such relief as equity and justice shall require: <em>Provided, That this section shall not authorise review as to any property distributed by the personal representative in accordance with a decree of court before the filing of the petition. </em>The court or master considering the petition may include in his adjudication or report, findings of fact and of law as to the entire controversy, in pursuance of which a final order may be made. 1949, April 18, P.

It was also in violation of the immemorial practice in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County which requires that actual notice of questions of law affecting distribution be given to the parties involved so that they may have an opportunity to be heard and to be represented by counsel. On this point it should be noted that on January 5, 1965, thirteen days before the audit on January 18, the representatives of the estate advised New York counsel for the sisters and brother of the decedent by letter (Exhibit F) which in part is as follows: ‘As you undoubtedly know, there is no requirement that you or your clients appear at the audit in order to participate in the distribution in this estate unless questions are raised which require judicial determination.’</p>
