    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.6",482,[199,468,1151,699]]]'>This is an appeal by Scott Paper Company (Scott) in connection with its Pennsylvania corporate net income tax for the calendar year 1955. During that year Scott, a major producer of paper products, cut various quantities of timber owned by it and located in states outside of Pennsylvania. This cut timber had a fair market value on January 1, 1955, of $5,128,136; and all of it had been held by Scott for more than six months prior to January 1, 1955. Of this cut timber Scott used in its own business a quantity valued at $3,272,923. The remaining timber, valued at $1,855,213, was sold by Scott to other persons for a total price of $3,390,022.</p>

Section 1231(a) of the Code states that if gains on sales or exchanges of property used in a taxpayer’s trade or business exceed the losses from such sales or exchanges during the year, these gains and losses shall be considered long-term in nature. Finally, §1231 (b)(2) rounds out this trail of 'artificial tax concepts by stating that the phrase “property used in the [taxpayer’s] trade or business” in §1231 (a) shall include timber covered by §631. By this labyrinthine route a cutting of timber for use in one’s own business may be transformed into a long-term capital gain subject to the attendant tax benefits <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>.applicable to such form of income for federal tax purposes.

    <p id="b483-4" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[154,507,1154,590]]]'>In its 1955 federal income tax report Scott made tbe election allowed by §631 (a) and showed the above gain as “net long-term capital gain” and so included it in federal taxable income. In its Pennsylvania corporate net income tax report it allocated all of this gain outside of Pennsylvania in accordance with the provision of §2 of the Corporate Net Income Tax Act which states that gains realized from the sale or exchange of tangible capital assets situated outside of Pennsylvania shall be allocated entirely outside of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b483-5" data-blocks='[["BL_483.6",483,[156,1110,1153,319]]]'>In settling Scott’s tax, however, the state refused to allocate this amount in accordance with the above provision.

As to the gain arising from the cutting by Scott of timber for use in its own business, the court disallowed the specific allocation outside of Pennsylvania, presumably on the ground that there was no sale or exchange. As to the remaining gain—that arising from the cutting of timber later sold to others—the court held there was a sale or exchange of a tangible capital asset and allowed the outside allocation. In reaching each of these conclusions, however, the lower court rejected Scott’s argument that the characterization of the transaction for federal tax purposes controlled the state treatment. Instead, it held that the matter was one solely governed by state law, being a problem of allocation rather than one of <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>computation of taxable income. Only tbe latter, it said, was controlled by federal concepts.</p>
    <p id="b484-4" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[204,521,1150,264]]]'>Scott appealed to this Court from tbe adverse ruling on tbe timber used by it in its business. No appeal has been taken by the Commonwealth with respect to the lower court’s allowance of an outside allocation for gain on the sold timber.</p>
    <p id="b484-5" data-blocks='[["BL_484.5",484,[198,794,1154,1130]]]'>Scott relies heavily in this appeal on our recent decision in <em>Commonwealth v. General Refractories Co., </em><a href="/pa/417/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="417 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1894002" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0153-01">417 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20833" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="207 A.2d 833">207 A. 2d 833</a> (1965), a case in which we dealt with the deduction granted corporations under the Corporate Net Income Tax Act for dividends received from other corporations. The problem there stemmed from Pennsylvania’s allowance of a 100% deduction while the Federal Code only provided for an 85% deduction in computing taxable income. Because of this a special state deduction had to be taken after federal taxable income was computed. We rejected the State’s argument that simply because the deduction was made “after” taxable income was determined, the state was free to apply its own ideas regarding what was or was not a dividend. In dismissing this “before” or “after” test, we stated the correct rule: “. . . it is whether or not the Corporate Net Income Tax Act requires that the deduction be taken by reference to federal standards or state concepts (if, in fact, there is a difference between them).” <a href="/pa/417/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="417 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1894002" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0153-01">417 Pa. 153</a>, 162, <a href="/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20833" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="207 A.2d 833">207 A. 2d 833</a>, 837.</p>
    <p id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.6",484,[195,1936,1151,427]]]'>We reaffirm this principle. The question in each case cannot be answered by some automatic reference to a “before taxable income or after taxable income” test. Rather, the meaning of the Corporate Net Income Tax Act (which may, as in the <em>General Refractories </em>case, or may not require reference to federal concepts) must be determined in the context of the problem involved.</p>
    <p id="b485-3" data-blocks='[["BL_485.3",485,[157,406,1153,974]]]'>
      <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>Similarly, we find no merit in the Commonwealth’s and lower court’s attempted distinction between the <em>General Refractories </em>case and this one. That distinction was based upon the presence in the Corporate Net Income Tax Act of a specific reference allowing a deduction for dividends to the extent they are included in “taxable income as returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government” and the absence of any similar reference regarding capital gains. But the quoted language was only added to the C.N.I. Act in 1955 in order to accommodate the 100% dividend deduction policy of that Act to a 1954 change in the Federal Code. It represented no change in the meaning of the Act from the time of its inception as, in our <em>General Refractories </em>opinion, we noted. Therefore, the specific reference to Federal taxable income with respect to dividends was not vital to that decision and is of no importance in determining the present issue.</p>
    <p id="b485-4" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[154,1392,1155,478]]]'>Simply reiterating our adherence to the basic principle of the <em>General Refractories </em>case (as Scott urges) and rejecting the State’s distinction between that case and this (again, as Scott urges) is hardly dispositive of the case in Scott’s favor, however. Here, too, as in <em>General Refractories, </em>we must look at the interpretative aids: The language of the C.N.I. Act, the history of the allocation provision and, if any, the administrative practices of the State.</p>
    <p id="b485-5" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[153,1882,1155,427]]]'>Scott argues that the language of the C.N.I. Act is so similar to the language of the Federal Code that the legislature must have intended to base the State allocation on the Federal concept. In fact, Scott says the use and history of the phrase “gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets” is so peculiarly federal that no other interpretation is possible. We are considerably less certain of this than is Scott, however.</p>

There was still no special tax treatment for capital transactions.</p>

It is equally, if not more, reasonable to conclude that the language of our capital gains provision Avas derived by the legislature from a concept of capital gains allocation of which the Massachusetts statute is a leading example. History, therefore, is far from compelling in Scott’s favor.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[214,1078,1153,1017]]]'>Similarly, we find no clear history of administrative practice here such as was stipulated by the parties in the <em>General Refractories </em>case. Scott refers to a recent ruling of the Department of Revenue known as Taxing Memorandum No. 56 which ties the <em>amount </em>of allocable capital gain to the amount recognized as capital gain by the Federal Government in the application of §§1245 and 1250 of the Internal Revenue Code to transactions of the taxpayer and requires the federally denominated “ordinary gain” to be allocated as ordinary income. This matter is not before us, of course; but we find it difficult to understand how, <em>under the Corporate Net Income Tans Act, </em>gain from an admitted sale or exchange of an admitted capital asset, can be so divided. If this be so, the administrative memorandum is wrong, and our conclusion here regarding the independence of the State’s determination of what is or is not capital gain subject to allocation is reinforced.</p>

The majority in my view suggests neither reason nor authority for its view that the procedure it requires the court to adopt should be the exclusive method of completing this litigation, and I fail to see why the court below could not adopt the procedure it followed, the procedure outlined by the majority or any other proper alternative in disposing of this case.</p>

This conclusion the majority purports to base on the exclusive power of the court below to enter a final judgment after a hearing de novo. I submit that the majority is proceeding upon a misunderstanding. The action of the court below in remitting the computation to the Department for resettlement in no way detracts from or interferes with its power to enter a final judgment and in furtherance thereof to hold any addition<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>'al hearings it deems necessary. Indeed, for the court below to do otherwise than to remit to the Department for resettlement would involve it in the mechanics of an intricate and detailed computation for which it, like this Court, is probably not particularly well equipped. Thus, where, as in the instant case, the computation to be made entails accounting rather than legal questions, I think the court below acted both permissibly and wisely in remitting to the Department. Thus the procedural ruling of the majority’s opinion not only lacks any basis in authority, but also in reason.</p>
