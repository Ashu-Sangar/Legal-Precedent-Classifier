On January 3, 1951, Walker Brothers and Local Union B-1088, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, entered into a pension agreement, implementing the pension plan and trust indenture. This agreement set forth eligibility, the amount of pensions, the determination of continuous service, pension trust, administration, appeals procedure, a pension committee (half of whom would be designated by the Company, the other half designated by the Union) and other general provisions as to the term of the plan (“The terms and conditions of this agreement shall continue in effect until midnight, December 31, 1955 and from year to year thereafter unless amended as follows: . . .”) and that if, for any <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>reason, the pension plan were dissolved, the way in which the funds would be distributed.</p>

The pension plan enabled Walker Brothers to hold out the prospect of pensions and, in addition, to achieve substantial savings in taxes under the provisions of the Internal R-evenue Code. The pension plan was administered and controlled solely by the representatives of Walker Brothers. The employes made no contribution of their own into the plan, and the Union had no voice in the operation of the plan or its policies or management. Under the terms of the pension plan and the trust indenture under which it was established, Walker Brothers, itself, was divested completely of any interest whatsoever in the pension fund.</p>

As a result of this curtailment, on December 28,1962, over 100 employees of Walker Brothers were laid off. A majority of the employees laid off worked at the Wire Mill, which was completely shut down in January of 1963. Those employees laid off in December consisted of 3 classes; those in the Reilly class, who had already completed more than 10 years of continuous service on the date of their lay-off; the Nolan class, whose continuous service was more than <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>9 years but less than 10 years at the date of lay-off, and the Wentz class, who had served less than 9 years at the date of lay-off. During the following 12 months, the company continued to lay off additional employees as part of its plan of terminating its operations.</p>

This provision shall also include all employees who have been laid off from the employ of Walker Brothers in the twelve (12) month period immediately prior to the dissolution of the fund.

    <p id="AZg" data-blocks='[["BL_41.5",41,[129,1506,1154,862]]]'>Following this amendment, Walker Brothers negotiated the sale of all of its assets to International Fastener, and the board of directors then notified the trustees of the pension fund to terminate the fund. Following this directive, the trustees adopted a resolution on October 31, 1963, wherein it was decided that the fund would terminate on December 31, 1963. The trustees, in making the necessary preparations to terminate the pension plan, ascertained the names of all employees who, pursuant to the rules of eligibility and dissolution, were eligible to share in the fund and their respective benefits. Preparations were then undertaken to submit those documents necessary to the Treasury Department of the United States so that the approval of the Internal Revenue Service could be secured with regard to the proposed termination.</p>

      <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>Prior to the liquidation and dissolution of the pension plan, the plaintiffs, along with those employees similarly situated, instituted a complaint in equity, setting forth therein that they were entitled to share in the fund about to be dissolved. Under the terms set forth in the pension plan, none of them were eligible, as they had all been laid-off for more than 1 year prior to the date of dissolution, or else had less than 10 years service at the time of dissolution. The pension plan specifically provided that a lay-off in excess of 12 months prior to dissolution, causing a break in continuous service, would render an employee ineligible for pension benefits regardless of prior service. The plan further held that an employee with less than 10 years service was not, under any circumstances, entitled to a share of any pension. Although, under the terms of the pension plan, the appellees were not entitled to any share or rights in regard to the pension plan, as their break in service was in excess of 12 months or because they did not have 10 years of service, the appellees sought an injunction against the proposed distribution of assets, and requested an order directing that they share in the pension benefits.</p>
    <p id="b42-4" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[231,1662,1150,633]]]'>After this action was instituted, all parties agreed that distribution would be delayed pending the outcome of this litigation. Hearings were held in the court below and the chancellor, on August 27, 1965, in his adjudication, directed that the plaintiffs and those in their class be permitted to share in the dissolution of the pension funds. Both the Union and Walker Brothers filed exceptions to the chancellor’s decree and order; those exceptions were dismissed on November 15, 1965, and, on December 27, 1966, the decree nisi of August 27, 1965, was made final.

The chancellor found that the board of. directors of the company was in complete control of the pension plan, especially as to its date of termination, that the members of IBEW desired to have the plaintiffs included in the distribution, and on October 20, 1963, had passed a resolution to this effect. The chancellor went on to say that “The amendment of April 24, 1962, which reduced the 15-year continuous service requirement to 10 years, and the final amendment are an attempt by the Board of Directors of the Company to discriminate unreasonably in favor of some employees and against others by tinkering with the Pension Plan, when the Board of Directors knew or should have known that the Company was about to cease operations and the Pension Plan was about to be terminated. Being in complete control of the Pension Fund and having recently agreed to enlarge the class entitled to share in the distribution, the Board of Directors again unreasonably discriminat<a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>ed among its employees by passing its resolution terminating the Trust on December 31, 1963, especially since those who would gain by its unreasonable discrimination had resolved to fulfill the expectations of their fellow employees. The will of the employee members of IBEW and the unreasonable discrimination of the Board of Directors of the Company are sufficient grounds for this Court to refuse to enforce the Board of Directors plan for distribution of the fund.</p>

Appellants went on to object to the failure of the chancellor to find that all of the plaintiffs and Donald Ayres, intervening plaintiff, have had their continuous service broken by a lapse of more than 12 months from the time of their lay-off on December 28, 1962, to the date of dissolution of the pension fund on December 31, 1963; and that no one of the plaintiffs or intervening plaintiff had any right or interest in the distribution of the funds, as not one of the plaintiffs or intervening plaintiff qualify to be included in the distribution under the terms of the original pension plan, pension agreement, or trust indenture, or any amendments to any of them.</p>
