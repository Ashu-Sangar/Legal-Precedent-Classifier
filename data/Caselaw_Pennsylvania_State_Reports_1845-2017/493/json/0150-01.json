        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nOn January 6, 1976, appellant, Angela Hayes, was struck and seriously injured by an automobile while crossing a street in Erie. The vehicle was insured by appellee, Erie Insurance Exchange (Erie), under the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act (the Act), 40 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1009.101-1009.701 (supp. 1980-81). Mrs. Hayes did not carry insurance on her own vehicle.\nMrs. Hayes submitted a claim with Erie for personal injury protection benefits pursuant to \u00a7 204(a)(4) of the Act, and submitted all necessary proofs of damages. Erie denied the claim asserting the legislature could not have intended to \u201cpenalize\u201d the insurance carrier of the vehicle owner where the victim failed to comply with the mandate of \u00a7 104 of the Act requiring all owners of vehicles to obtain no-fault insurance.\nMrs. Hayes filed an action in assumpsit against Erie in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, which court entered summary judgment in favor of Mrs. Hayes, holding that personal injury protection benefits were recoverable from Erie. That court refused, however, to make an award of counsel fees, see \u00a7 107 of the Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.107. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed both aspects of the trial court\u2019s decision. Hayes v. Erie Insurance Exchange, 261 Pa. Super. 171, 395 A.2d 1370 (1978).\nThereafter, Erie promptly paid the amount due, with interest calculated at the rate of 6% per annum. Mrs. Hayes insisted she was due interest at the rate of 18% pursuant to \u00a7 106(a)(1) of the Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.106(a)(1), relating to overdue payments. Upon Erie\u2019s denial of that claim, Mrs. Hayes filed a motion for assessment of damages at 18% and for attorney\u2019s fees, again with the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County. That court denied the motion, which denial was upheld by the Superior Court, reasoning that Erie\u2019s \u201cgood faith and reasonable cause\u201d for its initial denial of Mrs. Hayes\u2019 claim excused it from the 18% interest payment as well as from the claim for attorney\u2019s fees. Hayes v. Erie Insurance Exchange, 276 Pa.Super. 424, at 427, 419 A.2d 531, at 532 (1980).\nThis Court then granted Mrs. Hayes' petition for allowance of appeal. For the reasons stated below, we reverse in part and affirm in part.\nUnlike most cases wherein the courts have been called upon to glean the legislature\u2019s intent from various provisions of the No-fault Act, this is one of the few cases in which the following statement can be made: the intent of the legislature is clear. Section 106, \u201cPayment of claims for no-fault benefits\u201d, provides, in relevant portion:\n(a)(2) No-fault benefits are overdue if not paid within thirty days after the receipt by the obligor of each submission of reasonable proof of the fact and amount of loss sustained, unless the obligor designates, upon receipt of an initial claim for no-fault benefits, periods not to exceed thirty-one days each for accumulating all such claims received within each such period, in which case such benefits are overdue if not paid within fifteen days after the close of each such period. If reasonable proof is supplied as to only part of a claim, but the part amounts to one hundred dollars ($100) or more, benefits for such part are overdue if not paid within the time mandated by this paragraph. . . . Overdue payments bear interest at the rate of eighteen per cent (18%) per annum, (emphasis added)\nThere is no uncertainty in this section which defines \u201coverdue\u201d payments simply in terms of specified time periods, and simply states the consequences of a payment which is \u201coverdue\u201d \u2014 such payment bears 18% interest. There is no suggestion in \u00a7 106 that a late payment is any less overdue because the insurer denied the claim in \u201cgood faith and with reasonable foundation\u201d.\nNevertheless, the Superior Court engrafted a \u201cgood faith/reasonable foundation\u201d exception upon \u00a7 106 on the following reasoning:\n\u201cThat the 18% interest on overdue payments is a penalty is beyond dispute; the normal legal rate being 6%. And should the penalty be enforced indiscriminately a serious constitutional question would arise with regard to this section as it would attempt to discourage access to the courts by insurers, even in good faith and for reasonable cause. In this case, payment was withheld in good faith for reasonable cause and no penalty should be enforced against [Erie]. It also follows that no attorney\u2019s fees would be payable by [Erie]. 276 Pa.Super. 424, at 428, 419 A.2d 531, at 532 (1980).\nWhether the 18% interest is a \u201cpenalty\u201d (it is not, as shall be demonstrated infra) is of no moment to the interpretation of \u00a7 106 nor to ascertaining the legislative intent for \u201c[w]hen the words of the statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d The Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(b) (supp. pamphlet 1980-81).\nErie argues that, as a \u201cgood faith/reasonable foundation\u201d defense may be successfully asserted to a claim for attorney\u2019s fees, under \u00a7 107(3) this indicates the legislature similarly could not have intended to \u201cpenalize\u201d insurance carriers by imposing 18% interest on overdue payments wherein the delay was in \u201cgood faith and with reasonable foundation\u201d. However, exactly the converse is true \u2014 the quite clear negative implication of the appearance of a \u201cgood faith/reasonable foundation\u201d exception in \u00a7 107 coupled with its absence in the prior section, \u00a7 106, raises precisely the opposite inference. The legislature intended to create the exception to a claim for attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 they so indicated in \u00a7 107(3). The legislature did not intend to create the exception to a claim for 18% interest on overdue payments \u2014 they so indicated in \u00a7 106.\nWe hold, therefore, that where a payment is overdue as defined by \u00a7 106, 18% interest is owed on that payment regardless of the \u201cgood faith\u201d of the insurer or the \u201creasonable cause\u201d of the delay.\nErie and amicus curiae, the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, Inc., elaborate on the Superior Court\u2019s \u201cserious constitutional question\u201d \u2014 they argue that, unless \u00a7 106 be interpreted to include a \u201cgood faith/reasonable foundation\u201d exception, that section will run afoul of several constitutional principles, namely, due process, equal protection (specifically, they assert there is an illegal classification which discriminates between no-fault insurers and all other types of insurance carriers) and free access to the courts. We disagree.\nOf course, we must be mindful of the presumption in favor of constitutionality of lawfully-enacted legislation, i. e., an act of assembly will not be declared unconstitutional unless it clearly, palpably and plainly violates the constitution. Tosto v. Pennsylvania Nursing Home Loan Agency, 460 Pa. 1, 16, 331 A.2d 198, 203 (1975); Singer v. Sheppard, 464 Pa. 387, 393, 346 A.2d 897, 900 (1975). Any doubts are to be resolved in favor of sustaining the legislation. Id.\nOur case law has recognized that \u201cthe day has long passed when the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment could be used to indiscriminately strike down state economic regulatory statutes,\u201d Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy v. Pastor, 441 Pa. 186, 189, 272 A.2d 487, 490 (1975), and that economic legislation will withstand a substantive due process challenge so long as the law is not \u201cunreasonable, unduly oppressive or patently beyond the necessities of the case, and [so long as] the means which it employs [has] a real and substantial relation to the objects sought to be attained.\u201d Id., 441 Pa. at 191-92, 272 A.2d at 491. (citations omitted). Equal protection analysis of commercial or business legislation follows similar lines.\n\u201cThe Equal Protection Clause of both constitutions does not deny the State the power to treat different classes of persons [or corporations] in different ways, but does deny the right to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons [or corporations] placed by a statute into different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of the particular statute. The classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation so that all persons [or corporations] similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u201d\nMoyer v. Phillips, 462 Pa. 395, 400-01, 341 A.2d 441, 443 (1975).\nWith these principles in mind, we proceed to the legislation in question. The legislature has carefully studied the motor vehicle accident insurance system in this Commonwealth, and has made the following findings:\nThe General Assembly hereby finds and declares that:\n(1) motor vehicles are the primary instrumentality for the transportation of individuals;\n(2) the transportation of individuals by motor vehicle over Commonwealth highways and other highways significantly affects intrastate commerce, particularly in metropolitan areas;\n(3) the maximum feasible restoration of all individuals injured and compensation of the economic losses of the survivors of all individuals killed in motor vehicle accidents on Commonwealth highways, in intrastate commerce, and in activity affecting intrastate commerce is essential to the humane and purposeful functioning of commerce;\n(4) to avoid any undue burden on commerce during the intrastate transportation of individuals, it is necessary and proper to have a Statewide low-cost, comprehensive, and fair system of compensating and restoring motor vehicle accident victims and the survivors of deceased victims;\n(5) exhaustive studies by the United States Department of Transportation, the Congress of the United States and the General Assembly have determined that the present basic system of motor vehicle accident and insurance law ... is not such a low-cost, comprehensive, and fair system;\n(6) careful studies, intensive hearings, and some State experiments have demonstrated that a basic system of motor vehicle accident and insurance law which:\n(A) assures every victim payment of all his basic medical and rehabilitation costs, and recovery of a reasonable amount of work loss, replacement services and survivor\u2019s loss; and\n(B) eliminates the need to determine fault except when a victim is very seriously injured,\nis such a low-cost, comprehensive, and fair system;\n(7) adoption of the system described in paragraph (6) in place of the system described in paragraph (5) would remove an undue burden on commerce;\n(8) throughout the Commonwealth there should be uniformity as to the essential elements of the system of motor vehicle accident and insurance law to avoid confusion, complexity, uncertainty, and chaos which would be engendered by a multiplicity of noncomplementary systems, but the need for a basic system does not require that the Commonwealth itself directly administer, operate, or direct the administration or operation of such system; and\n(9) a Statewide low-cost, comprehensive, and fair system of compensating and restoring motor vehicle accident victims can save and restore the lives of countless victims by providing and paying the cost of services so that every victim has the opportunity to:\n(A) receive prompt and comprehensive professional treatment; and\n(B) be rehabilitated to the point where he can return as a useful member of society and a self-respecting and self-supporting citizen.\n(10) It is necessary to afford required coverages for motor vehicles to economically disadvantaged individuals at rates not so great as to deny such individuals access to insurance which it is necessary for them to have in order to earn income and to be or remain gainfully employed. \u00a7 102(a), 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.102(a).\nPrompted by these findings, the legislature enacted the comprehensive scheme of no-fault motor vehicle insurance with its avowed purpose to \u201cestablish at reasonable cost to the purchaser of insurance, a Statewide system of prompt and adequate basic loss benefits for motor vehicle accident victims and the survivors of deceased victims.\u201d \u00a7 102(b), 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.102(b).\nConsidering the extensive findings and the legitimate purpose to be attained, we cannot say that the 18% interest designed to assure prompt payment of claims is unreasonable, nor is it unrelated in a real and substantial way to the purpose sought. Neither is the classification improper merely because a no-fault insurer who unsuccessfully challenges a claim must pay 18% interest for the challenge while life, fire, etc. insurance carriers need only pay 6% interest as unsuccessful litigants. Each hazard or type of risk insured against has its own unique features and poses different problems of regulation. The general assembly has perceived a pressing need for revision of the motor vehicle accident insurance system, for the reasons stated in their findings, supra. Whether or not we agree with that determination, we cannot say the classification of no-fault insurers versus all other insurers is improper.\nOur research indicates that courts have been practically unanimous in upholding the validity of statutes imposing attorney\u2019s fees and additional interest upon insurers who delay payment, regardless of their good or bad faith. See Annotation, Validity of Statute Allowing Attorney\u2019s Fee to Successful Claimant But Not to Defendant, or vice versa, 73 A.L.R.3d 515, 521 (1976) (see especially \u00a7 2 at 521-26 and \u00a7 14 at 564-73). Justice Cardozo laid to rest, many years ago the arguments advanced by Erie and amicus. Life & Casualty Insurance Company v. Barefield, 291 U.S. 575, 54 S.Ct. 486, 78 L.Ed. 999 (1934) dealt with an almost identical situation. In Barefield, the Arkansas legislature had provided that where fire, life, health or accident insurers wrongfully failed to make timely payments, such insurers would be liable for attorney\u2019s fees plus an additional 12% interest. The insurance company there argued that, unless such statute would be construed to include a \u201cgood faith/reasonable foundation\u201d exception, it would violate due process, equal protection and \u201cfree access to the courts\u201d principles. Justice Cardozo made the following observations, as apt today as they were in 1934:\nNothing in the Fourteenth Amendment forbids [the legislative procedure] here. The assurance of due process has not stereotyped bills of costs at the rates known to the Fathers. . . . Nor is there an unjust discrimination, an arbitrary denial of the equal protection of the laws, in laying the burden on insurers and not on all defendants. Diversity of treatment in respect of the costs of litigation has its origin and warrant in diversity of social needs.... Classification prompted by these needs is not tyrannical or arbitrary. As to that, the judgments of this court in situations precisely apposite have set a closure to debate .... We discover nothing arbitrary or oppressive in imposing such a contract upon the business of insurance, a business subject, as all agree, to control and regulation. Id. at 570-71, 54 S.Ct. at 484.\nIn considering precedent, Justice Cardozo noted that the same result had obtained even where some forms of insur-anee, and not other forms, were affected by this type of legislation. Id. at 572, 54 S.Ct. at 485, citing Fidelity Mutual Life Association v. Mettler, 185 U.S. 308, 22 S.Ct. 662, 46 L.Ed. 922 (1901).\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear the 18% interest provision of \u00a7 106 of the Act violates neither due process nor equal protection considerations, notwithstanding an insurer\u2019s \u201cgood faith and reasonable basis\u201d for the delay.\nFinally, Erie\u2019s and amicus\u2019 \u201cfree access to the courts\u201d argument, see Pa.Const. art. Ill, sec. 32, also must fail. The additional 12% interest that an insurer is faced with (the difference between the required 18% and the \u201cnormal\u201d interest rate of 6%) is simply not \u201cso heavy as to erect an unfair barrier against the endeavor of an honest litigant to obtain the judgment of a court.\u201d Id., 291 U.S. at 574, 54 S.Ct. at 486. So long as an excessive measure is not meted-out, so long as the statute does no more than provide a reasonable incentive for the prompt settlement of just demands of a class admitting of special legislative treatment, then \u201c[in] that event, the litigant must pay for his experience, like others who have tried and lost.\u201d Id. at 574, 54 S.Ct. at 485-86. That appellees characterize the 18% interest provision as a \u201cpenalty\u201d is immaterial \u2014 it is the measure of the provision, not its label, that determines whether it denies free access. If the measure is reasonable, as it is here, there is no denial.\nWe affirm the denial of attorney\u2019s fees in this case. The lower courts (the court of Common Pleas of Erie County twice and the Superior Court twice) have consistently found no evidence of bad faith on Erie\u2019s part. Furthermore, Erie\u2019s arguments on both their liability to Mrs. Hayes initially and on the 18% interest were reasonable, albeit wrong. Accordingly, \u00a7 107(3) relieves Erie of any liability for counsel fees.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed insofar as it denies appellant recovery of 18% interest under \u00a7 106 of the Act, and affirmed insofar as it denies appellant attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 107(3) of the Act.\n. That section provides:\n(3) If, in any action by a claimant to recover no-fault benefits from an obligor, the court determines that the obligor has denied the claim or any significant part thereof without reasonable foundation, the court may award the claimant\u2019s attorney a reasonable fee based upon actual time expended.",
