        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Chief Justice.\nThis action for declaratory judgment was commenced in Commonwealth Court as a Petition for Review. We assumed extraordinary jurisdiction of the matter pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 726.\nPetitioners, Superior Court Judge James R. Cavanaugh and Commonwealth Court Judge David Craig, seek a judgment declaring that, for the purpose of determining seniority on their respective courts, priority of commission shall be measured from the beginning of service on the court, whether the initial service is by appointment or by election.\nJudge Craig and Judge John A. MacPhail were appointed to the Commonwealth Court on June 21, 1978. As a result of the casting of lots between the two appointees, Judge Craig was accorded seniority. Judge Cavanaugh was appointed to the Superior Court on June 28, 1979. Thereafter, all three appointed judges were elected to full terms dating from the first Monday of January 1980. Judge John G. Brosky and Judge Richard B. Wickersham were elected to the Superior Court and Judge Robert W. Williams, Jr. was elected to the Commonwealth Court for terms beginning the first Monday of January, 1980. Petitioners seek to establish priority of commission on the Superior Court for Judge Cavanaugh over Judges Brosky and Wickersham and on the Commonwealth Court for Judges Craig and MacPhail over Judge Williams. All five judges were first elected to a term of office on their respective courts at the same time.\nThe question presented by this case is the proper interpretation of Article 5, \u00a7 10(e) of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1968, which pertains to the casting of lots for priority of commission by two or more justices or judges who assume office at the same time. Petitioners herein assert that \u00a7 10(e) authorizes the measurement of judicial seniority from the time a judge or justice assumes office whether by election or appointment.\nThe primary legal implication which follows from establishing priority of commission or order of seniority among judges is in determining who shall serve as Chief Justice of Pennsylvania and as president judges of those courts composed of seven or less members. Pursuant to Article 5, \u00a7 10(d) of the Constitution, the positions of Chief Justice and President Judge are accorded to the justice or judge with the longest continuous service on each of the respective courts.\nThe Pennsylvania Constitution of 1874, art. V, \u00a7 17, provided for the casting of lots to determine seniority as follows:\n\u201cShould any two or more judges of the Supreme Court, or any two or more judges of the court of common pleas for the same district, be elected at the same time, they shall, as soon after the election as convenient, cast lots for priority of commission, and certify the result to the Governor, who shall issue their commissions in accordance therewith.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nThe Constitution of 1968, article V, \u00a7 10(e), contains a similar provision for determining priority of commission.\n\u201c(e) Should any two or more justices or judges of the same court assume office at the same time, they shall cast lots forthwith for priority of commission, and certify the results to the Governor who shall issue their commissions accordingly.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nPetitioners assert that the change in the language of the two constitutions from \u201cbe elected at the same time\u201d to \u201cassume office at the same time\u201d is significant and indicates an intention by the framers of the Constitution of 1968 and the voters who adopted it that judicial seniority be determined on the basis of length of experience on the court. Thus, they contend, seniority must date from the time judges take office, whether by gubernatorial appointment or election, rather than only from the time they are elected, as stated in \u00a7 17 of the Constitution of 1874. Therefore, petitioners conclude that a judge who initially assumed office by appointment is not required by \u00a7 10(e) of the Constitution of 1968 to cast lots for seniority following his election to office.\nNeither the Constitution of 1874 nor the Constitution of 1968 directly addresses the question petitioners raise \u2014 viz., whether appointive judicial service should be considered in determining which member of a court has priority of commission. \u25a0 Nevertheless, this Court has interpreted the Constitution of 1874, article V, \u00a7 17, to clearly mean that when two judges are elected to the same court at the same time, the casting of lots is the sole method of determining the order of seniority between them and no prior appointive service in the same court may be considered in determining the priority of their commissions. President Judges Determination Cases, 420 Pa. 243, 216 A.2d 326 (1966).\nThis Court gave the same interpretation to the Constitution of 1968, article V, \u00a7 10(e), when it adopted Rule 705 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Judicial Administration. Rule 705 provides, inter alia, that seniority among judges elected at the same time or appointed at the same time is to be determined by a separate casting of lots; that elected judges shall have seniority over appointed judges; and that appointive service shall not be considered in computing seniority among elected judges.\nPetitioners acknowledge that this Court\u2019s interpretation of Article V, \u00a7 17 of the Constitution of 1874, excluding consideration of appointive service from the computation of judicial seniority, was the correct one. They agree with the conclusion in President Judges Determination Cases, supra, that the phrase, \u201cbe elected at the same time\u201d, was \u201cabsolutely clear and unambiguous\u201d in its intention to compute seniority from the date of election. Thus, petitioners argue that the same clear and unambiguous language would have been retained in the Constitution of 1968 if the intention had been to continue to disregard appointive service. They maintain since the new Constitution employed different words in Article 5, \u00a7 10(e), a change in the meaning of this provision was intended, and appointive service was meant to be considered in determining seniority under the Constitution of 1968.\nMoreover, petitioners note a significant change from the former constitution in a related provision pertaining to the determination of Chief Justice and president judges, Article 5, \u00a7 10(d). The comparable provision in the Constitution of 1874 contained language which had been interpreted as applicable only to elected service. Yet the new language of \u00a7 10(d) accorded the positions of Chief Justice and president judge to the justice or judge \u201clongest in continuous service.\u201d Petitioners argue that the phrase \u201clongest in continuous service\u201d embraces appointive as well as elective service in this application of the seniority principle.\nWhile petitioners\u2019 textual argument is well-made, it is, nevertheless, unpersuasive in the context of the legislative history of the Constitution of 1968 and the clear public policy of this Commonwealth which favors an elected over an appointed judiciary. Berardocco v. Colden, 469 Pa. 452, 366 A.2d 574 (1976).\nThe official Journal of the Constitutional Convention of 1967-68 indicates that the amendment which eventually became \u00a7 10(e) was presented by Delegates Scranton and Amsterdam. Delegate Woodside spoke to the amendment explaining that it was \u201ca provision which is in the substantial form that was in the present constitution and was overlooked. It should be provided for in this Constitution.\u201d Delegate Amsterdam explained further:\n\u201cIn accordance with an amendment put in by Judge Woodside, we provided in courts of 7 or less that the judges shall be the President Judges or Chief Justice as the case may be for longest and continuous service. Because of this situation, we have to provide as the old Constitution did, in the event there are two or more justices or judges who assume offices at the same time, they shall cast lots for priority of commission and that is all this does.\u201d\nThose remarks do not suggest an intention by the delegates offering the amendment to change the established method of computing seniority inasmuch as the amendment under consideration by the Convention was described as substantially the same as the provision for casting lots in the Constitution of 1874. That provision, it will be recalled, had been interpreted to exclude appointive service in determining seniority. President Judges Determination Cases, supra.\nFurthermore, there is an obvious and practical explanation for the decision by the drafters of \u00a7 10(e) to substitute the phrase \u201cassume office at the same time\u201d for the phrase \u201cbe elected at the same time.\u201d Article V, \u00a7 13(d) of the proposed constitution offered the voters the option of an appointed judiciary. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the drafters purposely employed language which would be appropriate whether or not the option was accepted.\n. Pa.R.J.A. No. 705, in pertinent part, reads as follows:\n\u201cRule 705. Seniority of Judges\n\u201c(a) Seniority between elected and appointed judges. Elected judges shall have seniority over appointed judges.\n\u201c(b) Seniority among elected judges. The seniority of elected judges shall be determined on the basis of the date of election, if service is continuous on the same court. Service by appointment shall not be considered in computing seniority among elected judges.\n\u201c(c) Seniority among appointed judges. The seniority of appointed judges, for the duration of appointment, shall be computed from the date of appointment, if service is continuous on the same court.\n\u201c(d) Simultaneous election or appointment. Should any two judges of the same court be elected or appointed at the same time, they shall cast lots forthwith for priority of commission and seniority before the Chief Justice or the president judge of the court in which they are to serve, and certify the results to the Governor.\u201d\n. The Constitution of 1874, art. V, \u00a7 2, relating to the Supreme Court, provided in pertinent part: \u201c. . . The judge whose commission shall first expire shall be chief justice, and thereafter each judge whose commission shall first expire shall in turn be chief justice.\u201d In Selection of Presiding Judges, 15 Pa.D & C.2d 8 (1958) the attorney general interpreted that section to mean that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall be that judge who has served on the court the longest period of time under an elected term.\n. Remarks of Delegate Woodside and Delegate Amsterdam, February 23, 1968, Journal of the Constitutional Convention of 1967-68, Volume II at page 1201.\n. The Constitution of 1968, art. 5, \u00a7 13(d) provides as follows:\n\u201c(d) At the primary election in 1969, the electors of the Commonwealth may elect to have the justices and judges of the Supreme, Superior, Commonwealth and all other statewide courts appointed by the Governor from a list of persons qualified for the offices submitted to him by the Judicial Qualifications Commission. If a majority vote of those voting on the question is in favor of this method of appointment, then whenever any vacancy occurs thereafter for any reason in such court, the Governor shall fill the vacancy by appointment in the manner prescribed in this subsection. Such appointment shall not require the consent of the Senate.",

        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\ndissenting.\nOn June 21, 1978, Judges David Craig and John A. Mac-Phail were appointed to the Commonwealth Court. On November 7, 1979, Judges Craig and MacPhail and also Judge Robert W. Williams, Jr., one of the respondents, were elected to full terms on the Commonwealth Court, all of their terms to begin on January 7, 1980.\nOn June 28, 1979, Judge James R. Cavanaugh was appointed to the Superior Court. On November 7, 1979, Judge Cavanaugh, and also Judges John G. Brosky and Richard B. Wickersham, the other two respondents, were elected to full terms on the Superior Court, all of their terms to begin on January 7, 1980.\nPetitioners, Judges Cavanaugh and Craig, brought this orginal action for a declaratory judgment by Petition for Review addressed to this Court\u2019s extraordinary jurisdiction, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 726, asking for an adjudication of the proper manner of determining the priority of commission among the judges named above. Resolution of this issue involves the proper interpretation and application of Article V, \u00a7 10(e) of the Pennsylvania Constitution which provides:\nShould any two or more justices or judges of the same court assume office at the same time, they shall cast lots forthwith for priority of commission, and certify the results to the Governor who shall issue their commissions accordingly, (emphasis added)\nArt. V, \u00a7 10(e), has also been embodied in the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 325(a).\nThe consequence of priority of commission among judges is for purposes of determining seniority. Petitioners argue that, by virtue of their prior appointments, they have been in continuous service on their respective courts longer than respondents have been, and therefore, they should be declared to have priority of commissions. Respondents argue, however, that Art. V, \u00a7 10(e) requires all of the judges elected on the same day, regardless of prior appointments, to cast lots to determine the priority of commission.\nEssentially, petitioners make the unstartling assertion that the phrase \u201cassume office at the same time\u201d in section 10(e) refers to the time at which a judge assumes office. Respondents, on the other hand, take a less traditional linguistic approach \u2014 they argue, and the majority agrees, that \u201cassume office at the same time\u201d means \u201celected to office at the same time.\u201d Thus, the 1968 amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution has been judicially repealed and replaced by its predecessor, the related provision from the Constitution of 1874, Art. V, \u00a7 17. (\u201cShould any two or more judges of the Supreme Court, or any two or more judges of the court of common pleas for the same district, be elected at the same time, they shall, as soon after the election as convenient, cast lots for priority of commission ....\u201d) I am surprised by this unusual interpretation which negates a constitutional amendment adopted by the vote of the people of this Commonwealth.\nTo begin, the matter is simply one of taking the language of Art. V, \u00a7 10(e) and applying it in a straightforward manner to the facts of the instant petition. The majority runs through this analysis, and concedes \u201cpetitioners\u2019 textual argument is well-made . . . . \u201d 493 Pa. 560, 427 A.2d 156. Indeed the argument is well-made and, I submit, unassailable.\nAs petitioners have been longest in continuous service in their respective courts, they would have seniority over respondents unless Art. V, \u00a7 10(e) somehow alters that result. However, Art. V, \u00a7 10(e) merely provides unambiguously that judges who \u201cassume office at the same time\u201d shall cast lots to determine their priority of commission. We must therefore ask \u201cwhat does \u2018assume office\u2019 mean\u201d?\nThis phrase must be construed in its popular sense according to the common understanding of those adopting the amendment \u2014 the electorate of the Commonwealth. Berardocco v. Colden, 469 Pa. 452, 458-59, 366 A.2d 574, 577 (1976). As was stated long ago by this Court \u201cwhat the [Constitutional] Convention adopted, and what the electors of the Commonwealth accepted, is the Constitution as it is written, and its clear meaning cannot be distorted to fit the views of those particular delegates. It must be assumed that the people who voted upon the Constitution gave to the words employed their common and ordinary significance.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Margiotti v. Lawrence, 326 Pa. 526, 532, 193 A. 46 (1937) (citation omitted).\nThere is no need to catalogue the various definitions of \u201cassume\u201d in this context, for they uniformly are given as to take, to receive, to take upon oneself, to undertake, etc. See, e. g., Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary (2nd ed. unabridged); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed. West) (\u201cTo undertake; engage; promise.\u201d); 4A Words and Phrases, \u201cAssume\u201d (West 1969). While one \u201celected to\u201d office has certainly \u201cassumed office\u201d, the converse is not necessarily true and the common and ordinary usage of \u201cassume office\u201d recognizes there is more than one way to take on or engage in the duties of a public office. Indeed, one of the respondents in this case, Judge Brosky, admits that the word \u201cassume\u201d can encompass the taking of office by appointment. Brief for Respondent at 4.\nThe Pennsylvania Manual may be taken as a strong indicator of the meaning of \u201cassume office\u201d in the legal community. In the Manual, the common practice through the years has been to list the judges and justices as having \u201cassumed office\u201d on the date each began to perform judicial functions, whether they were appointed or elected. See, e. g., 1978\u201479 Pennsylvania Manual at 548-49 listing, inter alia Justice John P. Flaherty (June 15, 1979), former Justice Thomas W. Pomeroy, Jr. (Dec. 30, 1968) and former Chief Justice John C. Bell, Jr. (July 31, 1961) as \u201cassuming] office\u201d on the dates of their respective appointments.\nWith the foregoing in mind, the following questions become cogent, and their answers clear and free from ambiguity-\n1. When did Judge Craig \u201cassume office\u201d? Answer: June 21, 1978.\n2. When did Judge Cavanaugh \u201cassume office\u201d? Answer: June 28, 1979.*\n3. When did respondents \u201cassume office\u201d? Answer: January 7, 1980.\n4. Did Judges Craig and Cavanaugh, therefore, \u201cassume office at the same time\u201d as respondents? Answer: No.\nYet despite the explicit language of Art. V, \u00a7 10(e) and the simple and unambiguous application to the instant facts, the majority holds that the 1968 constitutional amendment means something other than what it says. In fact, they hold that it means what the 1874 Constitution says. What is the majority\u2019s justification for ignoring the constitutional mandate of 1968? The majority finds petitioners\u2019 well-made \u201ctextual\u201d argument \u201cunpersuasive in the context of the legislative [sic] history of the Constitution of 1968 and the clear public policy of this Commonwealth which favors an elected over an appointed judiciary.\u201d\nLet us examine the \u201clegislative\u201d history and the \u201cclear\u201d public policy. Before we do, however, it must be stressed that any consideration of \u201clegislative\u201d history or policy is improper. It is only where a constitutional provision is ambiguous and/or its applicability to a set of circumstances uncertain that an appellate court may look to such factors. \u201cWhere the Constitution has expressed its purpose in clear and explicit language, a court cannot delimit the meaning of the words used by reference to a supposed intent which might be evoked from it, or from the debates before the constitutional convention. ...\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. v. Acker, 308 Pa. 29, 34, 162 A. 159 (1932). The majority in this case looks to extraneous material to first create and then resolve an imagined \u201cambiguity\u201d. In dealing with construction of statutes, the legislature has admonished \u201c[w]hen the words of the statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(b) (Supp. Pamphlet 1980-81). This Court has generally complied with this admonition. \u201cWe may resort to legislative history, however, only when the words of a law are not explicit.\u201d Hellertown Manufacturing Co. v. Commonwealth, 480 Pa. 358, 365, 390 A.2d 732 (1978). These canons of construction are equally applicable where we are called upon to interpret the Constitution. Booth & Flinn Ltd. v. Miller, 237 Pa. 297, 306, 85 A. 457 (1912). Accordingly, having found \u201cpetitioners\u2019 textual argument well-made\u201d, the task was at an end, and it was both unnecessary and improper to examine \u201clegislative\u201d history and public policy.\nTurning to the majority\u2019s improper review of the \u201clegislative\u201d history and public policy, the inferences raised from both are precisely opposite those inferred by the majority. As the majority notes, there was a significant change in two respects from the language of the 1874 Constitution to that of the 1968 Constitution. The 1968 Constitution, Art. V, \u00a7 10(d), in no uncertain terms made the Chief Justice and president judges of courts with seven or less judges dependent upon the length of continuous service on the bench of the particular court. In keeping with this intention, the amendment altered \u201celected to office\u201d to \u201cassume office\u201d, in order to insure that length of service, and seniority, would remain the determinative factor regardless of whether service began by appointment or election. It defies logic and common sense to reason that this change was unintentional or was meant to maintain the pre-1968 status quo. \u201cA change in the language of a statute ordinarily indicates a change in legislative intent.\u201d Masland v. Bachman, 473 Pa. 280, 374 A.2d 517 (1977) (citations omitted). See also The Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c)(5).\nThe majority nullifies this change based on two passing comments of delegates to the 1968 Constitutional Convention. Delegate Amsterdam stated:\nIn accordance with an amendment put in by Judge Woodside, we provided in courts of 7 or less that the judges shall be the President Judges or Chief Justice as the case may be for longest and continuous service. Because of this situation, we have to provide as the old Constitution did, in the event there are two or more justices or judges who assume offices at the same time, they shall cast lots for priority of commission and that is all this does.\nDelegate Woodside is quoted as explaining the amendment as \u201ca provision which is in the substantial form that was in the present constitution and was overlooked.\u201d These two remarks are, certainly, inconclusive at best with regard to the intent of these two delegates on the meaning of \u201cassumed office\u201d and it is incredible that the majority grasps at these straws to \u201cinterpret\u201d Art. V, \u00a7 10(e) in direct contravention of the explicit language of that provision.\nMoreover, it is highly improper to attach any significance to remarks of delegates to the Constitutional Convention. There is a critical difference between \u201clegislative\u201d history and the record of a constitutional convention. In the legislature, its members debate the design and purposes of proposed legislation. These same members than enact or adopt the legislation. At a constitutional convention, on the other hand,' the delegates merely suggest or recommend the constitutional provisions. The electorate then adopts (or rejects) the provision. It is extremely doubtful that any of the electorate who adopted Art. V, \u00a7 10(e) in 1968 even knew of the two chance remarks of the delegates, let alone attached to the remarks the inference gleaned by the majority. As Justice Paxson stated in 1886, in Commonwealth v. Balph, 111 Pa. 365, 380, 3 A. 220:\nIn the consideration and discussion of this section of the Constitution I throw out of view the copious citations which have been furnished us from the debates in the convention. They are of value as showing the views of individual members, and as indicating the reasons for their votes. But they give us no light as to the views of the large majority who did not talk; much less of the mass of our fellow citizens whose votes at the polls gave that instrument the force of fundamental law. We think it safe to construe the Constitution from what appears upon its face.\u201d Quoted in Commonwealth ex rel. Margiotti v. Lawrence, supra at 326 Pa. 532, 193 A. 46.\nIt seems then, that the majority has implicitly overruled Commonwealth v. Balph, Commonwealth ex rel. Margiotti v. Lawrence, and the line of cases which has consistently heeded the instructions of those cases, and has developed a novel approach to constitutional interpretation by exhalting even chance and unclear remarks of constitutional convention delegates to such a lofty status that such remarks are permitted to cancel the expressed will of the electorate.\nIf we are going to consider the remarks of the delegates, however, then we must consider the excellent amicus brief submitted by the very delegate whose \u201csubstantial form\u201d remark has swayed the majority, namely Delegate, and former Judge, Robert E. Woodside, co-chairman of the 1968 Constitutional Convention subcommittee on Judicial Organization. I quote at length from Judge Woodside\u2019s brief:\nI file this amicus curiae brief solely in support of a principle with which I dealt in a great variety of capacities for a number of years, and because I, and I am sure other delegates to the Constitutional Convention concerned\u2019 with the relevant language, thought the issue was settled beyond any doubt by the deletion of the election language used in the Constitution of 1874, and the use of different language with a different meaning in the Constitution of 1968.\nsfc * * jfc *\nIn spite of the deletion of the \u201celection\u201d provision and the clarity of the substituted language contained in the present Constitution, it is contended that the Convention intended no change in the \u201celection\u201d provision of the 1874 Constitution. This contention, so contrary to the clear and unambiguous language used in the Constitution, is based upon a brief reference by me to the Convention concerning an amendment made to Article V, \u00a7 10 adding after paragraph \u201cd\u201d a new paragraph \u201ce\u201d. I am correctly quoted as saying that it was \u201ca provision in substantial form that is in the present Constitution and was overlooked. It should be provided in this Constitution.\u201d Paragraph \u201cd\u201d had provided beyond any shadow of a doubt that the judge longest in continuous service should be president judge. The election provision was deleted. It is axiomatic that one serving on the court by appointment at the time of election was longer in continuous service than one subsequently taking office by election.\nIII. Remarks and Amendment Misconstrued\nIt has been argued to you that the convention was led to believe that the changes of language from \u201celected at the same time\u201d to \u201cassume office at the same time\u201d in \u00a7 10 made no change in the provision of the Constitution relative to priority of commission and the determination of the Chief Justice and president judges. Nothing could be further from the truth. What happened, as the record will clearly show, was this: paragraph \u201cd\u201d set forth as clearly and accurately as anyone could write it that the Justice or judge longest in continuous service was always \u2014 not sometimes \u2014 entitled to the office of Chief Justice or president judgeship. That language settled that an appointed judge who served longer continuously on the court than one later elected with him had priority over the judge assuming office subsequently by election.\nWhat had been \u201coverlooked,\u201d using my language, on the convention floor? There was no provision in the proposed Article V to cover the situation where two or more judges assumed office at the same time. There was no provision for casting lots under any circumstances. There was no provision to determine priority of commission and the right to the Chief Judgeship or president judgeship where two judges would have been appointed or elected at the same time. That is why paragraph \u201ce\u201d was added, and for that reason alone, (emphasis added).\nBrief for Amicus Curiae, Robert E. Woodside at 3, 9-11.\nI am at a loss to understand why the majority has chosen to ignore this succinct and persuasive explanation of Delegate Woodside\u2019s remarks from the Delegate himself.\nClearly then, if it were legitimate to resort to \u201clegislative\u201d history, the inference would be 180\u00b0 away from the reading given the sparse convention record relied upon by the majority.\nThe other magic talisman employed by the majority to make the language of the 1968 amendment disappear is \u201cpolicy\u201d; the \u201cstrong public policy\u201d in favor of elected judges over appointed judges is also a make-weight pseudo-rationale under the circumstances of this case. It must be remembered that the correct constitutional interpretation and application in this case in no way favors an appointed judge over an elected judge \u2014 all of the judges involved have been duly elected. They all stand on equal footing in their elected roles, but petitioners have served an additional period \u2014 the period of their service as appointees. The proper constitutional construction merely implements the public policy expressed in Art. V, \u00a7 10(d) which places a premium on experience.\nThe framers of the 1968 amendment intended specifically to recognize experience, i. e., length of continuous service, as the only criteria for determining who shall be the president judge or chief justice of courts with seven or less judges. See Brief for Amicus Curiae, Robert E. Woodside, at 7-9. Experience comes from the length of time one serves a particular function. That experience is not diminished merely because part of that time was \u201cappointed time\u201d and not \u201celected time,\u201d and it is misleading to suggest otherwise. One can conceive of potential drawbacks to such a system wherein the sole consideration is length of service, and policies based on other important factors might favor another system. However, the existence of other legitimate policies is of no moment in this case. The constitutional mandate has established the policy and we are obliged to implement it, whether or not it is the best system. Accordingly, as Judges Craig and Cavanaugh have served their respective courts longer than have respondents, the Constitution dictates that petitioners have priority of commission over respondents.\nFinally, inasmuch as Rule 705(a) and (b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Judicial Administration (see note 1 of the majority opinion) is in direct and irreconcilable conflict with Art. V, \u00a7 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, as well as with The Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 325(a), it must be abrogated. This Court has no authority to adopt a rule of court or of administration which is unconstitutional. Art. V, \u00a7 10(c) of the Constitution provides this Court shall have the power to prescribe general rules of practice, procedure and administration if such rules are consistent with the Constitution. I understand the reluctance of those members of the majority who were on the bench when Rule 705 was adopted (in 1972) to reverse their position. However, this reluctance must be overcome and the conflict between Rule 705 and Art. V, \u00a7 10(e) resolved in favor of the Constitution. It must be remembered that this Court\u2019s informal rule promulgating process is not of an adversarial nature. A Rules Committee will make recommendations to this Court and we will act on those recommendations and proposals. Should a particular rule be inconsistent with the constitution, there is no advocate to argue its unconstitutionality. Thus, occasionally, an error is possible and when this Court becomes aware of such error, we should not hesitate to rectify it and conform our rules to the Constitution.\nBy stipulation of the parties, Judges Cavanaugh and Craig have performed their judicial functions for Superior and Commonwealth Courts, respectively, continuously from these dates.\n. All of the jurists involved in this case are highly competent and conscientious judges. This opinion should in no way be taken as support for, or opposition to, any particular judge, but rather, in support of the principle expressed in the explicit language of the Constitution.",
