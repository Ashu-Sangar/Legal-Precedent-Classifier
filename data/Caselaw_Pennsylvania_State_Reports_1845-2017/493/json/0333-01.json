He was sentenced to four to fifteen years imprisonment. The Superior Court affirmed appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence, and we granted allowance of appeal. Appellant claims that a codefendant\u2019s self-incriminating statement which exculpates appellant should have been admitted at trial as a declaration against penal interest.\nAfter reviewing the record, we find this claim to be without merit. Consequently, the judgment of sentence is affirmed.",
