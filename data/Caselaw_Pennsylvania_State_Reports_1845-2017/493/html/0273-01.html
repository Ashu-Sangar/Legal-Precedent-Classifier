On January 31, 1977, appellant was convicted by a jury of murder of the first degree, criminal conspiracy (murder), and other lesser offenses. The jury sentenced appellant to death. Post-verdict motions were filed, argued and denied. On January 4, 1980, our decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

The relevant facts are as follows.</p>
    <p id="b323-6" data-blocks='[["BL_323.6",323,[221,992,1143,407]]]'>On March 11, 1976, during the course of an armed robbery at the Shaw Oil Company, a gasoline station located in Allegheny Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania, at or near the Borough of Duncansville, George Karnes, an eighteen-year-old attendant, was shot five times in the head and killed instantly. At the same time the cash receipts of the station were taken. There were no witnesses to this incident.</p>

At the time of arrest appellant and his co-defendant were traveling in an automobile which was subsequently identified as having been used in Blair County, and which contained the handgun which was used in the Karnes murder as well as other tangible objects connected with various Blair County crimes.</p>
    <p id="b323-8" data-blocks='[["BL_323.8",323,[218,1979,1144,246]]]'>On December 8, 1976, appellant was convicted by a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County of murder of the first degree. This conviction was for appellant’s participation in an unrelated matter: the robbery-murder of Mrs. Elizabeth Shank.</p>

Indeed the record of the change of venue hearings<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> precludes any conclusion but that the publicity surrounding these trials was very extensive. Moreover, there is no allegation in this case that the pre-trial publicity was sensational; appellant apparently concedes the Commonwealth its point that the complained of publicity was largely factual and objective. Nevertheless, appellant claims the publicity was inherently prejudicial.</p>
