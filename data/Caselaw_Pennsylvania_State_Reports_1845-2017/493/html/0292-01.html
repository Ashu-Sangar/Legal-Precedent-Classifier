Father testified that he did not know if the gun was loaded, and that after he realized what he had done, he immediately returned it to his father, from who he had borrowed it. The record reveals no other violent incidents between the two and no evidence that mother was ever obstructed in her visits with Carol, or that Carol’s visits with other relatives were ever discouraged.

This incident was in no way related to Carol and none of the witnesses suggested that his behavior toward her had ever been impulsive or irrational. To the contrary, all evidence inexorably pointed to the conclusion that Carol had flourished while happily living with father and had repeatedly expressed her preference to remain with him.

However, the record also discloses that father had a permanent relationship with the woman he planned to marry and with whom, as the record clearly reveals, Carol enjoyed a loving and happy relationship. Without a scintilla of supporting evidence and in total disregard of the fact that Carol was obviously happy and thriving during the time father’s fiancee had been living in the home, the trial court arbitrarily concluded that it was “[qjuite frankly . . . not impressed with Mrs. Toth’s future capabilities to be a surrogate mother.” We obviously are not bound by impressions unrelated to fact.</p>

The record abundantly confirms the uninterrupted loving care and devotion of father for his daughter, reflected not only by words, but by the undisputed fact that Carol was a contented, well-adjusted twelve and one half year old who repeatedly asked to remain where she had been happy. In contrast, the only evidence we have of mother’s care and concern for Carol is the history of past neglect and the emptiness of future promises. Under these circumstances, to deny Carol the permanent stability of father’s daily love and affection in the home she expressly prefers would be a gross injustice and clearly not in her best interest.</p>

In awarding custody to a mother who made no attempt in three years either to establish frequent, regular visits with her daughter or to gain custody, the trial court overemphasized the relationship Carol enjoyed with her grandparents and other relatives in Pennsylvania and grossly undervalued father’s performance from the time of separation and Carol’s preference to remain with him. Custody therefore must be restored to father, with mother having visitation rights. ,</p>

I wouldn’t feel right living with her.” (R. 129).
