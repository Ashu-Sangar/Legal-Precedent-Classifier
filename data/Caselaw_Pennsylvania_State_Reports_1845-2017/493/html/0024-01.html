On June 5, 1974, appellant was indicted on the firearms charge. Two days later, appellant was given a preliminary arraignment on the heroin charge. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for August 1, but the record contains no indication that appellant ever received notice of that hearing until he was arrested pursuant to a bench warrant on September 16 for his failure to appear. Another preliminary hearing was then scheduled for November 4. Although notice of this hearing was mailed to appellant, he did not appear on that day. He claimed to have received the notice only after the hearing date, having moved temporarily to another address in Lancaster after a disagreement with his wife. Finally, on December 18, 1974, a preliminary hearing was held on the heroin charge, at which the Commonwealth established a prima facie case against appellant.</p>

At a hearing on March 13, the court granted the Commonwealth’s extension request over defense objection, and after another hearing on April 1, the court denied all of appellant’s pretrial motions.

Moreover, appellant’s challenges as to the legality of the stop and arrest, as well as to the credibility of the arresting officers, were as relevant to one charge as to the other. Furthermore, in appellant’s case, as in <em>Holmes, </em>appellant could not have moved for consolidation prior to his conviction on the first charge, since a grand jury had not yet indicted him on the second charge. As this Court stated in <em>Holmes, </em>“To place the responsibility upon appellant to expedite the indictment procedure, over which he had no control, or responsibility, would distort the concept of waiver.” <a href="/pa/480/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="480 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="1745058" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0536-01">480 Pa. at 541-42</a>, <a href="/pa/480/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="391 A.2d 1015" data-case-ids="1745058,1745075" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0536-01,/pa/480/0535-01">391 A.2d at 1018</a>.

Prior to appellant’s first trial, the Commonwealth had two avenues open to it, neither of which it attempted to pursue. The Commonwealth could have requested the court to grant separate trials. See 18 Pa.C.S. § 110(1)(ii); <em>Commonwealth v. Campana [I], </em><a href="/pa/452/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="452 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="575302" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0233-01">452 Pa. at </a>250 n. 37, <a href="/citations/?q=304%20A.2d%20432" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="304 A.2d 432">304 A.2d at </a>440 n. 37. Alternatively, the Commonwealth could have requested an extension of time to commence both trials on the ground that it wished to comply with its obligation to consolidate them. The court could have either granted separate trials under section 110(l)(ii) or allowed the extension. If appellant had opposed consolidation, he would then have waived his right to a single trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Saunders, </em><a href="/citations/?q=483%20Pa.%2026" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="483 Pa. 26">483 Pa. 26</a>, <a href="/pa/483/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="394 A.2d 522" data-case-ids="1751147" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0029-01">394 A.2d 522</a> (1978).

However, in so doing, the court overlooked the critical fact that appellant’s plea of guilty to the firearms charge, unlike the guilty plea of the defendant in <em>Tarver, </em>in no way necessitated the severance of the remaining charge. When the defendant in <em>Tarver </em>entered his plea of guilty to one charge, indictments on all the charges had been returned against him, and the Commonwealth was planning to try all the charges in a single proceeding. Thus, “[i]t was by his choice, not that of the state, that two separate proceedings were had to determine his guilt or innocence in charges arising from the same criminal episode.” <a href="/pa/467/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="467 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1717359" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0401-01">467 Pa. at 409</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="467 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1717359" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0401-01">357 A.2d at 543</a>. Here, on the other hand, the Commonwealth made no effort to consolidate the charges or to extend the time for trial on the firearms charge.
