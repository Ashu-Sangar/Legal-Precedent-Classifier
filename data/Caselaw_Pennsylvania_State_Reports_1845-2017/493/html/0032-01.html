    <p id="b81-11" data-blocks='[["BL_81.10",81,[205,1388,1146,725]]]'>Appellant, John Wesley Muffley, was arrested on July 1, 1976 and charged with possession of marijuana. While appellant was being processed at the police station, he was required to empty his pockets. At this time, police found one hundred fifty microcaps of what the police believed to be LSD. A criminal complaint charging appellant with possession of marijuana was filed shortly after his arrest. As outside laboratory analysis was required for the LSD, no charges were filed at that time. When the lab analysis subsequently confirmed that the substance was, in fact, LSD, the police, on September 21, 1976, filed a complaint charging appellant with possession of LSD. Meanwhile, on September 1, 1976, an information had been filed charging appellant with possession of marijuana.</p>

On June 17, 1977, appellant pled guilty to <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>possessing marijuana. An information on the LSD charge was filed on July 18, 1977. Appellant immediately thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the information, alleging that prosecution on the LSD charge would violate § 110 of the Crimes Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Court of Common Pleas, Lancaster County, denied appellant’s motion.
