A short time after 1:45 a.m. on March 25, 1979, a friend drove them to Coccioletti’s cabin located on County Line Road in a rural area of Westmore-land County.

A split second after passing them, the passenger heard a gunshot, the victim slumped forward, and the truck veered off the road and crashed.

Garrity denied involvement, and the group left the restaurant. But while driving back to Coccioletti’s cabin, appellants began to concoct a story to explain the whereabouts of certain guns in their possession. Garrity asked Coccioletti, “What are we going to do with the guns?” Coccioletti responded, “We could say they were in Jeanette [Jeanette, Pa.].” Prior to arriving at the cabin, Coccioletti emptied bullets from a .44 caliber revolver he was carrying. Coccioletti also hid the revolver and a .45 caliber automatic pistol that Garrity was carrying under some leaves in the woods.</p>

The least degree of concert or collusion is sufficient to sustain a finding of responsibility as an accomplice. <em>Commonwealth v.

In this case the record shows that the appellants were together prior to and during the homicide. Coccioletti stated that both appellants had been shooting across the roadway. Furthermore, appellants acted in concert to conceal their firearms and fabricate statements concerning the whereabouts of their firearms. It is unnecessary for the Commonwealth to show which appellant actually fired the fatal shot, because whichever appellant was not the actor would be equally responsible as an accomplice. <em>Commonwealth v.

Since the forensic pathologist testified that the fatal wound was made by a bullet, the pathologist’s testimony provides the foundation for properly admitting the three handguns, whether or not it has been proven that any of them are the murder weapon. Furthermore, two of the handguns were identified by appellants’ friend as being the same two weapons that appellants attempted to conceal after the homicide.</p>

Appellants’ declarations do not expressly admit the homicide, and as such, would not be given undue weight by the jury. Appellants were together throughout the incident and were fully aware of each other’s roles, so the declarations are clearly based on personal knowledge. Because the appellants made the declarations in each other’s presence, there would be no apparent reason to lie. The declarations, made soon after the homicide, have strong indicia of spontaneity. Finally, the declarations are against the appellants’ own penal interest. The reliability of appellant’s declarations satisfy the confrontation clause. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Appellants were co-participants in the crime: this has been established in the accomplice liability discussion. The declarations were made in the course of concealing evidence and in furtherance of common design of evading capture. Although the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule has not been applied when the declarations are made after arrest and termination of the conspiracy, <em>Commonwealth v. Ellsworth, </em><a href="/pa/409/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="409 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1883188" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0505-01">409 Pa. 505</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.2d%20640" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="187 A.2d 640">187 A.2d 640</a> (1963), the appellant’s declarations in this case were made prior to their arrest while the conspiracy was still in progress.

Appellants’ inculpatory declarations were made in each other’s presence, and if incorrect, would naturally have been denied. Pennsylvania follows a traditional exception to the hearsay rule which admits such declarations as implied admissions by the silent and acquiescing accused. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, the scope of <em>Dravecz </em>was limited to implied admissions made while in custody or in the presence of police officers. In <em>Commonwealth v.

The following rationale for the admissibility of such a weapon was stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Bederka, </em><a href="/pa/459/0653-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="459 Pa. 653" data-case-ids="480991" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0653-01">459 Pa. at 659</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0653-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="459 Pa. 653" data-case-ids="480991" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0653-01">331 A.2d at </a>183: “The possession by appellant of weapons similar to the ones used in the actual murder was certainly relevant to establish that appellant <em>possessed the necessary means </em>to commit the murder.” (Emphasis added). The opinion of Mr. Justice Larsen, while noting that only two of the three handguns admitted into evidence were identified by testimony as being the same two weapons that appellants attempted to conceal after the homicide, applies the foregoing principle of admissibility with respect to all three weapons. The third handgun, however, bore no connection with the homicide, other than that it was seized from appellant’s <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>residence during the course of investigation. Nor was admission into evidence of the third handgun necessary to prove that appellant <em>possessed the necessary means </em>to have committed the crime, since the other two handguns were certainly sufficient for that purpose. Handguns exist solely as instruments of destruction, and the introduction into evidence of a handgun, without a basis for its relevance, is inflammatory and prejudicial, due to the appearance of destructive character the weapon imputes to its possessor.</p>
    <p id="b163-4" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[212,767,1146,821]]]'>The court below deemed that if admission of the third weapon into evidence were error, such error could not be asserted as prejudicial because defense counsel, upon subsequent cross-examination of police officers, intentionally and repeatedly elicited the fact that not only were three weapons seized but rather a total of nine weapons were discovered in appellant’s residence. Testimony established that these other weapons included a shotgun and rifles which could be used for hunting. Counsel did object to admission of the three handguns, however, and one may only speculate as to counsel’s motive for bringing the other guns to the attention of the jury. Nevertheless, it cannot be assumed that cross-examination would have pursued the same course if any of the three handguns had previously been excluded from evidence. Based upon the improper admission into evidence of the third handgun, I would grant a new trial.</p>
