Herman, was suspended from the practice of law for a period of three years by an Order of this Court dated March 9, 1978, effective April 9, 1978.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>July, 1979, the Office of the Disciplinary Counsel filed a petition for additional discipline, alleging that respondent, in violation of Rules 217(d) and 217(e) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement (“Pa.R.D.E.”), had flagrantly failed to comply with the Suspension Order by (1) failing to file with the Disciplinary Board (“Board”) form DB — 25 (verified statement of compliance) within the prescribed time;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (2) failing to advise clients of his suspension and consequent inability to represent them, and failing to withdraw as attorney of record in pending cases, and (3) taking on <em>new </em>matters at least six months <em>after </em>the effective date of suspension.</p>

The Committee recommended that respondent be suspended for an additional twelve months to run consecutively with the original three years suspension. Disciplinary Counsel, petitioner here, filed with the Board a brief on exceptions to the Hearing Committee’s report, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Hearing Committee erred in failing to reach the merits of the third allegation, <em>supra, </em>and that its recommendation of an additional one year suspension did not reflect the seriousness of respondent’s misconduct. The Board, however, adopted the findings of the Hearing Committee and recommended the imposition of an additional twelve month suspension. On July 7, 1980, this Court rejected the Board’s recommendation and <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>entered a Rule to Show Cause why respondent should not be immediately disbarred from the practice of law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

To the contrary, his behavior evidenced a deliberate intent to circumvent that Order. The record shows that after the effective date of suspension, he continued to communicate with several clients in a number of matters on stationery identifying himself as an attorney and member of the firm of Herman and Bayer. When a filing or court appearance was required, however, respondent would arrange for another attorney to take over the matter without the client’s knowledge or consent, and the client would not become aware of the substitution until the time of trial or arbitration. This did not occur as an isolated incident. Respondent continuously represented and advised various clients until he was notified of an investigation of his activities by the Disciplinary Counsel in February, 1979. As late as April, 1979, he still had not withdrawn his <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>appearance in a pending litigation matter. His name remained on the door to his office suite and in the lobby directory of his building. In short, respondent’s law practice was effectively uninterrupted by this Court’s Order of Suspension.</p>
    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.4",320,[260,564,1152,1052]]]'>Faced with the overwhelming evidence of his unrepentant refusal to comply with the Suspension Order, and having abandoned his earlier efforts to excuse this behavior, respondent now seeks an opportunity to introduce evidence of personal problems which might tend to mitigate his conduct. He lists several family illnesses and deaths. All of these, however, occurred long before the commission of any of the offenses here at issue. He suffered a heart attack in April, 1978, which, he suggests, adversely affected his ability to comply with the applicable Rules of Disciplinary enforcement. But respondent’s heart attack occurred <em>after </em>the deadline for notifying clients of his suspension, and his noncompliance with the Suspension Order continued well past the date that he returned to work. In any event, evidence of respondent’s heart attack and resulting disability is not new information, for it was admitted and considered at the disciplinary hearing on October 4, 1979. Respondent’s defense at that hearing was not that he was unable to comply, but that compliance was unnecessary because his clients were assets of a professional corporation.</p>
    <p id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[260,1638,1150,684]]]'>Finally, he argues that this Court’s issuance of the Rule to Show Cause has “changed the dimensions of this case”, therefore requiring a new hearing. At all times since the Petition for Discipline was filed, however, respondent knew that the final disposition would be made by this Court. In imposing the original three year suspension, we rejected a recommendation of a one year suspension made by both the Hearing Committee and the Board. Respondent was aware that the Disciplinary Counsel had excepted to the recommendation of the Hearing Committee in the present matter, and had argued strongly for disbarment. Respondent has had ample opportunity to show cause why he should not be disbarred, and no further hearing is necessary.</p>

The immediate grounds for suspension were gross neglect of a bankruptcy matter and deliberate misrepresentations to the client and others, acts which resulted in substantial losses to respondent’s client and which were found by the Disciplinary Board to have constituted violation of a number of Disciplinary Rules, including DR1-102(A)(4) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation). The three year term of suspension was deemed appropriate also because respondent is a recidivist in disciplinary matters. In June, 1963, respondent was censured by the Philadelphia Bar Association Committee of Censors for flagrant commingling and misappropriation of a client’s funds in a personal injury case. In April, 1970, respondent was censured by a disciplinary panel of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County for a <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>further instance of commingling and misappropriation of a client’s funds. In October, 1970, respondent was reprimanded by the Committee of Censors for neglect of a personal injury claim. In June, 1975, respondent received an informal admonition from the Office of the Disciplinary Counsel, again for neglect of a personal injury claim.</p>
