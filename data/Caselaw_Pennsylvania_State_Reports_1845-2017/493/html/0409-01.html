Yewdall Street in Philadelphia in response to a police radio call. Upon his arrival, he found Horace Alexander (“the victim”) lying on the living room floor in a blood soaked shirt. Officer Kopena returned momentarily to his patrol car to call for assistance. When he re-entered the house, appellant appeared from the kitchen holding a shopping bag in which she had packed a change of clothes. She saw the officer and stated spontaneously: “I’m ready to go to jail now. I hope he dies and I’m glad I stabbed him.” (N.T. 40, Vol. I). Appellant was immediately placed under arrest, and while she was being escorted to the patrol car, she yelled that she “did it” and that she wanted the whole block to know. (N.T. 53, Vol. I). Inside the patrol car, she told another officer: “I’m glad I killed [him]. Is he dead? Is he dead? I’ll teach him to mess with that bitch.” (N.T. 49, Vol. I).</p>

Appellant responded: “Well, if he’s not [dead], tell me what room he’s in and I’ll finish the job.” (N.T. 68-69, Vol. I).
