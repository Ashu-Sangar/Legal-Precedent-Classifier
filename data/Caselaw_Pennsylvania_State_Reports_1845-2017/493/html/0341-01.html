While testator instantly named appellant as residuary legatee, we do not believe this is sufficient to curtail use of the abatement statute. Further, although the testator and appellant lived together for a long period of time, appellant did receive their jointly held home by operation of law. Combining all of these factors, we cannot find any positive indication that testator intended that appellant should receive twenty-five percent of the Sears stock remaining in testator’s estate.</p>

In that case, testator had provided for a pro rata reduction should assets be insufficient to pay all legacies. Further, all of the legatees involved with the diminished assets were either aunts or cousins of testator; all people who under § 3541 would fall into subsection 3.
