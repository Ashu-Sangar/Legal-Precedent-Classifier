Therefore, immunity will be permitted to bar any suit based upon a theory of vicarious responsibility. Liability predicated upon the principles of respondeat superior or allegations of negligence because of inadequate supervision must reflect the dilution of control of the conduct of a subordinate in the public sector because of the restrictions imposed by civil service and tenure laws. The superior often has little, if any, input into the hiring of his subordinate. The power to discipline is usually circumscribed by inflexible regulations and ponderous procedures.</p>

As noted by the Commonwealth Court, the gist of the complaint against Dellmuth and Patterson is an assertion of vicarious responsibility. The closest appellant comes to assigning actionable conduct on the part of these appellees is a vague assertion of inadequate supervision of certain remote employees in the chain of command. <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>There would be no public purpose served by exposing these public servants to personal liability for complaints of this nature. To the contrary, the people of this Commonwealth will be hard pressed to find qualified and responsible persons willing to accept responsibility of the major departments of government at the risk of personal liability for the action of an employee who they may never have seen or with whom they have little or no personal contact. The Department of Banking is charged with the responsibility of regulating an entire industry in this Commonwealth. To hold the Secretary of that department personally liable for an alleged dereliction of one of his remote employees when that employee was derelict in the discharge of his responsibility over one or two companies within the entire industry, would create the kind of impediment that would stymie the effective operation of government. Absent a showing that the Secretary had failed to prescribe reasonable regulations and directives for the operation of the department as a whole, the assessment of personal liability would in fact be no more than the adoption of a theory of respondeat superior, which has been rejected by the Court in <em>DuBree. </em>An analysis of the instant complaint satisfies us that recovery, accepting at face value the validity of the averments of the complaint, would only be justified upon a vicarious liability theory. Therefore we agree with the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that the complaint against Dellmuth and Patterson should have been dismissed.</p>

The Commonwealth Court, relying on their decision in <em>Brungard v. Hartman, </em>46 Pa.Cmwlth. 10, <a href="/citations/?q=405%20A.2d%201089" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="405 A.2d 1089">405 A.2d 1089</a> (1979), held that Act 152 did control and the sovereign immunity barred this action against the Department. However, this Court has since concluded that Act 152 may not constitutionally have retroactive applications to claims that arose prior to its enactment. <em>Gibson v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/490/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="490 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1763757" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0156-01">490 Pa. 156</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="490 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1763757" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0156-01">415 A.2d 80</a> (1980). Since this cause of action allegedly became actiona<a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>ble prior to the enactment of Act 152, this Court’s decision in <em>Mayle v.
