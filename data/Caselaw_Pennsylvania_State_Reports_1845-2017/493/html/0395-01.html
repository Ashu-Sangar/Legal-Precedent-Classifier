Appellant then filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel on various theories. On appeal to this Court from denial of that petition, these allegations were all held to be without merit. <em>Commonwealth v. McNeal, </em><a href="/pa/479/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="479 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="1742090" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0112-01">479 Pa. 112</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="479 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="1742090" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0112-01">387 A.2d 860</a> (1978).

    <p id="b445-8" data-blocks='[["BL_445.7",445,[189,1163,1144,303]]]'>Appellant apparently alleges (1) that trial, direct appeal and first P.C.H.A. counsel were ineffective for failing to preserve for review the issue of whether a demurrer to the Commonwealth’s evidence should have been sustained at trial, and (2) that the trial court erred in denying the demurrer to the charges of conspiracy, rape and murder.</p>

However, when there is an improper challenge to the trial court’s ruling on the demurrer, this Court may treat the question as if properly framed, namely, whether the trial court erred in refusing appellant’s motion in arrest of judgment — whether the evidence was sufficient in law to support appellant’s conviction. <em>Commonwealth v.

The allegation that all counsel below and on prior appeals or P.C.H.A. petitions were ineffective constitutes “extraordinary circumstances” which, under the majority view, allows petitioner to escape waiver.
