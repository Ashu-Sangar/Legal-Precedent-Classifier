These two incidents are: (1) at some time at least four days, and perhaps as many as fourteen days, prior to the execution of the search warrant an informant observed “10 bundles of alleged Heroin” in appellant’s apartment which were to be sold and removed within half an hour of the informant’s observation; and (2) on an unspecified date, this same informant saw appellant leave appellant’s apartment with three bundles of heroin to sell to two individuals at a bar.</p>
