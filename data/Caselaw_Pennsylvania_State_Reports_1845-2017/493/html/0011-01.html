Cummings questioning the dismissal of their petition to vacate the surviving spouse’s election to take against the will of decedent. The basic question to be answered is whether the appellee, Elizabeth Cummings, the widow, was barred from electing to take against the will under the terms of an antenuptial agreement which she and the decedent had entered. There is no disagreement that appellee and the decedent entered into the antenuptial agreement and that the agreement was a valid one and, therefore, binding upon them. The specific question is whether the decedent fulfilled a certain covenant of that agreement which required, <em>inter alia, </em>the decedent, under his last will and testament, to provide a trust fund in the amount of not less than $30,000.00 for the benefit of appel-lee whereby she would receive the income therefrom for the remainder of her life.</p>

However, the court below accepted the decedent’s good faith intention of establishing a fund of $30,000.00 to provide income for his spouse. This finding was not challenged. The fact that the vicissitudes of the market reduced the value of the stock between the execution of the will in response to the agreement and the date of death does not force the conclusion that the agreement was breached. We do not accept, however, appellants’ position that this deficiency was <em>de minimis </em>and should be ignored.

Appellants, on the contrary, argue that there was full compliance by the decedent with the covenant of the antenuptial agreement, for under the provisions of the will, a trust was created as a matter of law.

This power, in appellants’ view, would provide the flexibility to increase the fund’s income potential. The lower court disagreed on the ground that the application of section 6113 is dependent upon the existence of a power of consumption in the life tenant. We reject the reasoning of the lower court since the application of the section is not dependent on the power to consume.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> We agree with the reasoning of appellants as far as it goes.

The words “and not a debtor to the remainderman” were added to emphasize the fact that the earlier debtor-creditor rule no longer applied. Further, “except that he shall not be required to change the form of the investment to an investment authorized for Pennsylvania fiduciaries” was included to make it clear that the life beneficiary may retain the original property so long as he considers it advisable. New investments are required to be in legal investments, as the life tenant is subject to “the ordinary powers and duties of a trustee.”</p>

The appellee fastens upon the phrase “full and exact performance” used on one occasion in the opinion <em>Harrison Estate, supra </em>at 363, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%205" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="319 A.2d 5">319 A.2d 5</a>. It is clear, however, the use of the term “exact” was not intended to suggest a requirement higher than the full and fair performance standard. Throughout the <em>Harrison </em>opinion, we maintained the full and fair performance standard and we reaffirm that standard today. If the literal meaning of the phrase “full and exact performance” had been intended in <em>Harrison Estate, </em>the fact that the terms of the bargained-for promise were not carried out by will, as agreed, would have been controlling. . That opinion was not based upon the decedent’s failure to make the promised provision in his will, but rather, that the executor’s offer to provide the “minimum benefits” promised deprived the surviving spouse of the “reasonable expectation” that their relationship may have inspired the decedent to have been more generous when the will was executed. <em>Harrison Estate, supra, </em><a href="/pa/456/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="456 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="584441" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0356-01">456 Pa. at 364, n. 10</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%205" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="319 A.2d 5">319 A.2d at 9, n. 10</a>.</p>

Appellee, in her brief, argues the fact that the transfer of the cottage was an inter vivos one rather than by will should be deemed significant. We find this contention to be totally without merit, since the interest received would have been exactly the same, if it had been conferred under the terms of the will. In this instance appellee enjoyed the ownership of the cottage prior to the death of the decedent. What is of importance is that there has been no assertion that there was an unfulfilled expectation with regard to the lease.</p>
