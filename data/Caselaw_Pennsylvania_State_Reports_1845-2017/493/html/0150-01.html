      <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>Our research indicates that courts have been practically unanimous in upholding the validity of statutes imposing attorney’s fees and additional interest upon insurers who delay payment, regardless of their good or bad faith. <em>See </em>Annotation, <em>Validity of Statute Allowing Attorney’s Fee to Successful Claimant But Not to Defendant, or vice versa, </em><a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.L.R.%203d%20515" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="73 A.L.R. 3d 515">73 A.L.R.3d 515</a>, 521 (1976) (see especially § 2 at 521-26 and § 14 at 564-73). Justice Cardozo laid to rest, many years ago the arguments advanced by Erie and amicus. <em>Life &amp; Casualty Insurance Company v. Barefield, </em><a href="/us/291/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="291 U.S. 575" data-case-ids="1497923" data-case-paths="/us/291/0575-01">291 U.S. 575</a>, <a href="/us/291/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="291 U.S. 575" data-case-ids="1497923" data-case-paths="/us/291/0575-01">54 S.Ct. 486</a>, <a href="/us/291/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="78 L.

In <em>Barefield, </em>the Arkansas legislature had provided that where fire, life, health or accident insurers wrongfully failed to make timely payments, such insurers would be liable for attorney’s fees plus an additional 12% interest. The insurance company there argued that, unless such statute would be construed to include a “good faith/reasonable foundation” exception, it would violate due process, equal protection and “free access to the courts” principles. Justice Cardozo made the following observations, as apt today as they were in 1934:</p>
    <blockquote id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[264,1434,1104,790]]]'>Nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment forbids [the legislative procedure] here. The assurance of due process has not stereotyped bills of costs at the rates known to the Fathers. . . . Nor is there an unjust discrimination, an arbitrary denial of the equal protection of the laws, in laying the burden on insurers and not on all defendants. Diversity of treatment in respect of the costs of litigation has its origin and warrant in diversity of social needs.... Classification prompted by these needs is not tyrannical or arbitrary. As to that, the judgments of this court in situations precisely apposite have set a closure to debate .... We discover nothing arbitrary or oppressive in imposing such a contract upon the business of insurance, a business subject, as all agree, to control and regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 570-71, <a href="/us/291/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="291 U.S. 575" data-case-ids="1497923" data-case-paths="/us/291/0575-01">54 S.Ct. at 484</a>.</blockquote>

The additional 12% interest that an insurer is faced with (the difference between the required 18% and the “normal” interest rate of 6%) is simply not “so heavy as to erect an unfair barrier against the endeavor of an honest litigant to obtain the judgment of a court.” <em><a href="/us/185/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="185 U.S. 308" data-case-ids="3624553" data-case-paths="/us/185/0308-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/us/291/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="291 U.S. 575" data-case-ids="1497923" data-case-paths="/us/291/0575-01">291 U.S. at 574</a>, <a href="/us/291/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="291 U.S. 575" data-case-ids="1497923" data-case-paths="/us/291/0575-01">54 S.Ct. at 486</a>. So long as an excessive measure is not meted-out, so long as the statute does no more than provide a reasonable incentive for the prompt settlement of just demands of a class admitting of special legislative treatment, then “[in] that event, the litigant must pay for his experience, like others who have tried and lost.” <em>Id. </em>at 574, <a href="/us/291/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="291 U.S. 575" data-case-ids="1497923" data-case-paths="/us/291/0575-01">54 S.Ct. at 485-86</a>. That appellees characterize the 18% interest provision as a “penalty” is immaterial — it is the measure of the provision, not its label, that determines whether it denies free access. If the measure is reasonable, as it is here, there is no denial.</p>

The lower courts (the court of Common Pleas of Erie County twice and the Superior Court twice) have consistently found no evidence of bad faith on Erie’s part.

Accordingly, § 107(3) relieves Erie of any liability for counsel fees.</p>
