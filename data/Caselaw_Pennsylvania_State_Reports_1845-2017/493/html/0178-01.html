A review of the procedural history is critical to the resolution of the questions involved. The charges herein involved stem from a robbery which occurred in the City of Philadelphia on October 29, 1974. During the course of an omnibus suppression hearing that had been reserved for the time of trial, appellee first raised a Rule 1100 violation and sought his release. The suppression hearing proceedings were interrupted by the assigned trial judge and the cause was referred back to the calendar judge for disposition of the Rule 1100 claim. The Rule 1100 claim was heard, denied and the matter was sent back to the assigned trial judge who completed the suppression proceedings and presided over the trial before a jury. The appellee was convicted on the charges and post-verdict motions were filed.</p>

That question was whether there was a waiver in this case under paragraph (f) of the Rule, as found by the trial court.

Moreover, the Rule 1100 question was again raised in post-verdict motions. It therefore cannot be said that the opportunity for response provided to the Commonwealth under paragraph (f) was not afforded in this case. Additionally, the Commonwealth’s suggestion that they had been surprised by the assertion of the claim of ineffectiveness of counsel in the Superior Court is also inaccurate.

This would have been beyond the Rule 1100 period as presently computed by the Commonwealth (August 31, 1975). On August 7, 1975, the Commonwealth filed a petition to extend the Rule 1100 time frame. This action is consistent with the Commonwealth’s present contention. <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>The petition was contested by the defense and argued on August 14, 1975.

It therefore would appear in that proceeding the parties were in agreement that the Rule 1100 time frame was August 31, 1975. In any event, this circumstance virtually excludes the possibility that the Rule 1100 claim was inadvertently overlooked by the defense until after the commencement of trial on August 25, 1975.

The 180-day calendar period would have expired on April 28, 1975. Trial in fact commenced on August 25, 1975, 299 days after the filing of the complaint. Appellee argues from his factual premise at most 90 of the 299 days were excludable pursuant to paragraph (d). Thus, under their computation the presumptive period Would have expired on July 28, 1975. The majority of the Superior Court determined that the 180-day period expired on June 27, 1975. The Commonwealth urges the position that the 180-day period did not expire until August 31, 1975.</p>
