      <em>Tunison v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/347/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="347 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="1217378" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0076-01">347 Pa. 76</a>, 78, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.2d%20521" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="31 A.2d 521">31 A.2d 521</a>, 522 (1943). Surely, as the “plain meaning” of “public question” indicates, the Legislature approved at least this existing rule, prohibiting imposition of costs against the Commonwealth and perhaps intended its expansion to cover those cases involving other political subdivision litigants.</p>
    <p id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[203,948,1143,404]]]'>This record also demonstrates that the “applicable law [was] uncertain and the purpose of the litigants [was] primarily to clarify the law.” No previous case of this Court had considered the rule established in <em>Commonwealth v. Passell, </em>supra, as applied where the transfer, as here, was not made directly to shareholders. And no basis exists for concluding that the appeal was necessitated by any reason other than to clarify the scope of <em>Passell.</em>

    <p id="b473-6" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[200,1372,1145,979]]]'>The Opinion’s reliance upon <em>Tunison, </em>supra, is misplaced. There, legislation regulating the power of eminent domain expressly authorized courts “to make such orders relative to the payment of the necessary costs incurred as to the court shall appear right and just.” Because the legislation applied “without stipulation as to the party exercising such authority,” <a href="/pa/347/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="347 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="1217378" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0076-01">347 Pa. at 78</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.2d%20521" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="31 A.2d 521">31 A.2d at 522</a>, this Court concluded that “it was the legislative intention to include the Commonwealth within the import of the statute, as a party against whom the court may assess costs.” <a href="/pa/347/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="347 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="1217378" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0076-01">347 Pa. at 79</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.2d%20521" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="31 A.2d 521">31 A.2d at 523</a>. Here, however, unlike <em>Tunison, </em>there is no similar statutory scheme permitting imposition of costs upon a governmental unit. Indeed, there now exists the prohibition against imposition of costs in matters involving a “public question.” Thus, although <em>Tunison </em>does suggest a policy that cost statutes should be “liberally interpreted,” under no principle of statutory interpretation, liberal or otherwise, can it be said that imposition of costs against a litigant representing the public interest has been permitted.</p>

We disagree. The Legislature has vested this Court with general statutory power to tax costs against <em>all </em>litigants, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 1726, and Pa.R.A.P. 2741 and 2742 were promulgated under that legislative authority. The Commonwealth was a party litigant in the underlying action, which no one argues was barred by sovereign immunity, and the Commonwealth Court had jurisdiction of the cause and of the parties. Incident to that jurisdiction was the power to tax costs.</p>
