At approximately 7:15 p. m. on that date, a man subsequently identified as William Kahley approached the kitchen door of the Szabo residence. Michael Szabo, at that time fifteen years old, answered the door and admitted Kahley. Kahley, armed with a pistol, directed Michael Sza-bo to raise and lower a window shade several times. After Michael Szabo did as ordered, a second man, wearing a ski mask and also armed with a pistol, entered the kitchen. The men asked for money which Davidina gave them from her purse and rosary case. Subsequently shots were fired which struck and wounded Michael Szabo and struck and killed Frank Szabo. Doctor Mark Reed, Director of Pathology of Reading Hospital, testified that his post-mortem examination of the body of Frank Szabo revealed that the victim had been shot four times in the neck and chest. The cause of death was determined to have been massive hemorrhage caused by bullet wounds of the chest.</p>

Appellant returned to the apartment he shared with Manwiller after dark on that date accompanied by Kahley, packed some clothing with Manwil-ler’s assistance, and left. Appellant never returned to the Reading apartment. Ms. Manwiller further testified she owned a black vinyl folder which she kept in a bureau drawer.

Mrs. Chesonis testified the three men argued concerning a “folder” which they had “forgotten.” Thomas Chesonis said “Why did they leave any witnesses, they should have killed everyone.” Mrs. Chesonis testified appellant and Kahley changed out of their clothes and burned the clothing they had been wearing when they arrived.

Ms. Anderson testified that in April, 1976, she questioned appellant concerning his background. In response to her inquiries appellant told Ms. Anderson that “him and his friend, a guy named Sloopy, went over to this man’s house and the man supposedly owed them some money or something, and they went to pick it up and the guy didn’t want to pay them and so, I guess, they were looking for something that was worth that much.

Indeed, the request was improper. A bill of particulars is intended to give notice to the accused of the offenses charged in the indictment so that he may prepare a defense, avoid surprise, or intelligently raise pleas of double jeopardy and the statute of limitations. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[209,467,1142,787]]]'>However, appellant argues that even though his request was improper, he was entitled to rely upon the Commonwealth’s response. Appellant directs us to a case decided in the Superior Court, <em>Commonwealth v. Bartman, </em><a href="/pa-super/240/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="240 Pa. Super. 495" data-case-ids="818050" data-case-paths="/pa-super/240/0495-01">240 Pa.

There a request for a bill of particulars had been filed in which the Commonwealth was asked “whether or not any statements, admissions, or confessions allegedly made by any of the defendants will be introduced into evidence.” The Commonwealth replied “there are no confessions or admissions written or verbal in the hands of the Commonwealth, beyond the statements made during the altercation. . . ”. Nevertheless, at trial several prosecution witnesses gave testimony concerning admissions made by the accused.</p>
    <p id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[209,1275,1143,308]]]'>The Superior Court correctly observed that the requested information was beyond the scope of a bill of particulars and the Commonwealth would have been justified in not responding. The court held, however, that even though not required to respond to appellant’s request, the Commonwealth having done so was bound by its answer.</p>
    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[208,1608,1142,736]],["BL_522.1",522,[242,313,1148,95]]]'>In our view the distinction between <em>Bartman </em>and the instant case is apparent. In <em>Bartman </em>the Commonwealth’s response was an all-inclusive statement that it possessed no admissions by the accused. Instantly the Commonwealth’s response was much more limited: the prosecution possessed no confessions or statements which were the result of custodial interrogation. Although clearly not required to respond to appellant’s request, the Commonwealth nevertheless did so in narrowly circumscribed terms. Even binding the Commonwealth to its answer, we find in the record no instance where the terms of that answer were contravened. The Commonwealth produced no statements which were the product of custodial interrogation. At no time did the prosecution indicate whether or not it possessed non-custodi<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>al admissions. We conclude the trial court properly found the proffered testimony to be admissible.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[241,431,1150,997]]]'>Second, appellant argues the testimony of Ms. Anderson and Mrs. Chesonis concerning appellant’s admissions should have been excluded as irrelevant. This contention is predicated principally upon appellant’s interpretation of the holding in <em>Commonwealth v. Turner, </em><a href="/pa/389/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="389 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1274019" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0239-01">389 Pa. 239</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=133%20A.2d%20187" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="133 A.2d 187">133 A.2d 187</a> (1957). That opinion was written in a case where the appellant had been five times tried, five times convicted of murder of the first degree, and had five times appealed. After four reversals the only substantial evidence remaining in the Commonwealth’s case was the testimony of two detectives who recounted alleged statements of the accused which they said they had overheard. On the fifth appeal this court reversed again, holding that the alleged statements of the accused, admitted through the testimony of the detectives, “were not so conclusive in their import as to warrant a finding by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that they constituted an admission [of guilt].... The evidence in this case was patently far from sufficient to justify the jury’s verdict.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=133%20A.2d%20187" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="133 A.2d 187">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/389/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="389 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1274019" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0239-01">389 Pa. at 266-267</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=133%20A.2d%20187" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="133 A.2d 187">133 A.2d 187</a>.</p>
    <p id="b522-6" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[241,1449,1149,414]]]'>Thus, while it is true the admissions in <em>Turner </em>were troublesome in that they lacked specificity or were inconclusive, it is equally clear that we considered that to bear upon the weight to be accorded the evidence rather than its admissibility. So, too, in the instant case, appellant’s relevancy argument is one which in fact contests the weight of the evidence. We find no error in the admission of the testimony at issue.</p>
    <p id="b522-7" data-blocks='[["BL_522.6",522,[241,1883,1149,467]],["BL_523.1",523,[201,287,1141,199]]]'>Next appellant asserts the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Mrs. Roberta Chesonis. Mrs. Chesonis testified at trial concerning conversations held among her husband, appellant and appellant’s confederate, Kahley. The conversations about which Mrs. Chesonis testified were held outside her presence; she was either in another room or upstairs. None of the conversation was directed to her. Moreover, although the witness knew the participants in the conversations, she could identify by voice only those state<a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>ments which had been uttered by her husband.

While at Chesonis’ home they shaved, cut and dyed their hair, changed their clothes, burned their old clothing and buried their weapons. When appellant and Kahley determined to flee Berks County it was Chesonis who transported them to Philadelphia. Chesonis agreed to assist and in fact did assist appellant and Kahley in avoiding apprehension; Chesonis conspired to commit an unlawful act.

    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[231,1009,1152,623]]]'>Preliminarily, we note that our review of the record discloses not thirteen but seven objections to the examination of Mrs. Chesonis which complained of leading questions; of these two were sustained.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A leading question has been defined as one which puts the desired answer in the mouth of the witness. <em>Kelly's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/399/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="399 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1290560" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0153-01">399 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20739" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="159 A.2d 739">159 A.2d 739</a> (1960). Our review of the questions to which counsel objected as leading convinces us the court properly permitted the questions. It is true certain of the questions might have been more artfully phrased, but they were not leading. On the record before us we conclude the prosecution did not impermissibly attempt to cross-examine its witness.</p>

Appellant argues the prosecutor engaged in unfairly prejudicial conduct during his closing argument. One of the defense theories advanced at trial was that it was not appellant but another who had accompanied William Kahley to the Szabo residence. That other person was Joseph Molino, who was dead at the time of trial. In response to this defense theory the prosecutor argued to the jury:</p>
    <blockquote id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[251,712,1100,623]]]'>“He comes here now almost four years later to tell us about Mr. Molino, also known as Stumpo, with a clear and absolute recollection where the Commonwealth witnesses never have any and what do they come with? The name of a man, Joseph Molino, Stumpo, and how convenient for Mr. Cichowicz and for Mr. Hodge and, indeed, for Mr. Dreibelbis. How convenient because what? Joseph Moli-no died in 1974 and cannot come in here to say, ‘Hey, man’ — -I would assume that’s his language — T didn’t do that and I never said I did.’ But wasn’t it convenient to pick a man who couldn’t do that, a man we couldn’t find, no matter how hard we tried because he never existed.”</blockquote>
    <p id="AkD" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[207,1364,1142,308]]]'>The Commonwealth had established that Molino had died in 1974. Appellant argues the prosecutor erred in arguing to the jury that if Molino could have testified he would have contravened the defense theory. A timely objection to the offending remarks was sustained and a cautionary instruction given. We conclude no more was required.</p>

If the prosecutor’s argument here went further and implied to the jury that Molino would have testified in a certain fashion, that impropriety is minimal. A new trial is not mandated every time a prosecutor makes an intemperate or improper remark. <em>Commonwealth v. Perkins, </em><a href="/pa/473/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="473 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1730266" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0116-01">473 Pa. 116</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=378%20A.2d%201076" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="378 A.2d 1076">378 A.2d 1076</a> (1977). To constitute reversible error the language must be such that its “unavoidable effect would be to prejudice the jury, forming in their minds fixed bias and hostility towards the defendant, so that they could not weigh the evidence and render a true <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>verdict.” <em>Commonwealth v.

We perceive no error in the denial of the Motion for Mistrial.</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[238,474,1149,523]]]'>Appellant’s sixth and seventh claims of error concern the relevancy of the testimony of two Commonwealth witnesses: Calvin Rice and Joan Man wilier. Man wilier testified she was the'owner of a 1966 green Volkswagen automobile, to which appellant had a set of keys. Rice testified that on the night of the crime, at approximately 7:30 p. m., a green Volkswagen with two men in it stopped at the service station where he was employed. The service station was located approximately one-half mile from the scene of the crime. Appellant argues this testimony was irrelevant.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[239,1022,1148,470]]]'>“Evidence is relevant if it tends to establish some fact material to the case or tends to make the fact at issue more or less probable.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Clearly the testimony of Rice and Manwiller was relevant. Appellant’s complaint is actually directed at the weight to be accorded that evidence. That, however, is a function of the jury, which has decided the issue adversely to appellant. There was no error in admitting the testimony.</p>
    <p id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[238,1517,1150,688]]]'>Next appellant contends the court erred in permitting improper rebuttal testimony by Commonwealth witness Patty Anderson. Appellant’s complaint is, however, not one of improper rebuttal, but rather of improper redirect examination. During the cross-examination of Ms. Anderson the defense attempted to impeach the credibility of the witness by exposing possible bias. Toward this end defense counsel questioned the witness concerning any threats of prosecution which may have been made to her. Most of this questioning concerned a threat of prosecution which had been made by an F.B.I. agent. However counsel also inquired: “Isn’t that your motive for testifying, you have been threatened by other people in connection with this case?”</p>

    <p id="b527-10" data-blocks='[["BL_527.10",527,[207,1163,1144,633]]]'>The scope of redirect examination is largely within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v. Stokes, </em><a href="/pa/475/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="475 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1734118" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0312-01">475 Pa. 312</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="475 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1734118" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0312-01">380 A.2d 370</a> (1977). Moreover, when a party raises an issue on cross-examination, it will be no abuse of discretion for the court to permit re-direct on that issue in order to dispel any unfair inferences. <em>Commonwealth v. Lewis, </em><a href="/pa/472/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="472 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1727733" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0235-01">472 Pa. 235</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="472 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1727733" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0235-01">372 A.2d 399</a> (1977). Instantly appellant raised the issue of bias. While it is true appellant emphasized the conduct of an F.B.I. agent, inferences that other parties had threatened the witness with prosecution could also have beén drawn. The Commonwealth was entitled to dispel such inferences on re-direct.</p>
    <p id="b527-11" data-blocks='[["BL_527.11",527,[207,1835,1142,416]]]'>Finally appellant claims the trial court erred in refusing to permit an interview of a Commonwealth witness by defense counsel prior to cross-examination.
