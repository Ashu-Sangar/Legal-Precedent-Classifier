Counsel there had argued that item # 1 (“Tire imprints left at the scene are similar to imprints of the tires of the [automobile registered in the name of appellant’s wife]”) should play no part in our determination of probable cause as that item was discovered by a prior illegal search of appellant’s automobile tires. We examined oral testimony to determine the legality of <em>that </em>challenged “search.” Having found no illegal “search” within the ambit of Fourth Amendment protections (and thus finding item # 1 was proper) we then had no difficulty finding the search warrants had been supported by probable cause by the items listed. <em><a href="/pa/478/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="478 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1740547" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0147-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/478/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="478 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1740547" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0147-01">478 Pa. at 158</a>, <a href="/pa/478/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="478 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1740547" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0147-01">386 A.2d at 487</a>.

VI, Pa.Const. art. I, Section 9, and perpetuates the ineffective assistance of prior trial counsel. The issue can be stated thusly: Whether prior trial testimony of a witness who is presently unavailable may be introduced in a criminal trial where defense counsel at the prior trial has been found ineffective for, <em>inter alia, </em>failure to either request a competency hearing for that witness or to lodge an objection to his competency on the record?

The PCHA court, however, found that counsel had instead chosen a reasonable “alternative” strategy designed to effectuate his client’s interests, namely he chose to attempt to discredit the witness on cross-examination.</p>

If he succeeded in this attempt, there would be no need to pursue the less certain method of discrediting the witness on cross. If he failed in the attempt, he still could fall back on cross-examination. There was no reason offered at the PCHA hearing, nor in the opinion of the PCHA court, as to why that first [obviously more desirable] alternative was ignored other than counsel felt the second alternative would work.
