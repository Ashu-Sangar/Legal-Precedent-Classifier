Elizabeth Crozer and William Schaffer resigned in 1938, and John Hannum died in 1942. On the death of Hannum, the Orphans’ Court of Delaware County, without objection, appointed Jay Allen Hodge to serve with the corporate fiduciary. Hodge died in 1966.

Additionally, First Pennsylvania petitioned the orphans’ court to appoint Van Dyke as co-trustee, at a rate of compensation of one per cent of trust income. First Pennsylvania expressed no willingness to accept a corresponding reduction of its compensation.</p>
    <p id="b402-6" data-blocks='[["BL_402.6",402,[241,1379,1150,369]]]'>Van Dyke, a great-grandchild of settlor and an income beneficiary of the trust, is employed by the brokerage firm of E. F. Hutton Company. At the time of First Pennsylvania’s petition, Van Dyke was sérving as broker of record for the trust. Thus any transactions made by the trustee were executed through E. F. Hutton, and Van Dyke received credit for the brokerage commissions.</p>

Appellant Lober contended, as he contends here, that in paragraph 11 of settlor’s will settlor expressed the intent that, as the various individual trustees ceased service, those trustees remaining would continue to serve, alone. According to appellant, this intent of settlor forecloses the appointment of new trustees unless the performance of the remaining trustee or trustees is inadequate. In appellant’s view, First Pennsylvania has administered the trust adequately since it began to serve <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>alone fifteen years ago. No party in interest argues to the contrary.</p>

    <p id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.5",403,[204,835,1144,805]]]'>Nonetheless, the orphans’ court granted First Pennsylvania’s petition. In its opinion in support of the dismissal of appellant’s exceptions, the orphans’ court disagreed with appellant’s interpretation of settlor’s intent. According to the court, paragraph 11 of settlor’s will is silent on the permissibility of appointments. Thus the orphans’ court rejected appellant’s contention that appointment is permissible only if First Pennsylvania is performing inadequately. Instead it applied a standard permitting appointment if “conducive to the proper administration of the trust.” According to the court, “proper administration” would be advanced here because Van Dyke, a family member and stock broker, “would be infusing direct input of the various family beneficiaries, as well as adding a second expert opinion with respect to investments.”</p>

Both parties also agree that if, as <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>appellant argues, settlor intended that new trustees not be named, a much more stringent standard must be applied. That standard would permit appointment of a new trustee only if the administration of the trust is in some respe'ct inadequate, or reasonably likely to become so.

Where, as here, the orphans’ court, with full support on the record, has specifically determined that performance of the sole surviving fiduciary has been “much more than adequate,” it is clear that appointment of an additional trustee is unnecessary and inappropriate. See <em>Badenhausen Estate, </em><a href="/misc2d/38/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="38 Misc. 2d 698" data-case-ids="1124605" data-case-paths="/misc2d/38/0698-01">38 Misc.2d 698</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=237%20N.Y.S.2d%20928" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="237 N.Y.S.2d 928">237 N.Y.S.2d 928</a> (1963) (refusing to appoint additional trustee where existing trustee was merely “semi-retired” and did not desire sole responsibility for administering trust).</p>
