They are not on special forms which might indicate the manner in which disciplinary problems are customarily reported, nor is there any testimony showing that disciplinary problems are handled in any standard, routine manner. The employer failed to lay any foundation for introduction of its documents as business records, and thus they are not competent evidence under the UBREA exception to the hearsay rule.

It is another frequent characteristic of quasi-judicial proceedings that the parties are not represented by counsel.

Discarding the exclusionary rules of admission eliminates the need for the parties to interpose protective objections — the objections being preserved by their briefs to the examiner or agency — and relieves the examiner of making difficult rulings before the evidence is available.

In disregard of the Board’s own regulation (34 Pa.Code § 101.21, <em>supra), </em>the referee failed to advise the uncounseled claimant of her rights. She was given virtually no meaningful opportunity to challenge the hearsay documents, upon which employer’s entire case was based, much less cross-examine the declarants. Moreover, although employer made no attempt to lay a foundation for reliability of the hearsay documents, the referee failed to put employer’s evidence to any test of reliability. The referee also fell short of the regulatory mandate by failing to aid claimant’s efforts to articulate her challenge. When employer’s representative began reading the exhibits into <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>the record, claimant attempted to interrupt the presentation but was cut off by the referee:</p>

Rather than being instructive, the referee’s comment may well have prevented this and later attempts to dispute the reliability of the hearsay evidence. At the end of the reading of the first exhibit, the referee, without addressing claimant, simply announced that the record would show employer’s submission of Exhibit 1. Claimant, having been rebuffed in her one attempt to interpose a challenge to the veracity of the documents, thereafter sat quietly while twelve more exhibits were read into the record. Under the statute, and, in fact, by any conscientious standard, we would expect the hearing officer to ask an unrepresented claimant whether there was any objection to the introduction of each exhibit as it was offered. Yet, no effort whatsoever was made by the referee to solicit claimant’s view in an orderly manner designed to test the credibility of the documents.</p>

Not surprisingly, claimant launched into a confused and convoluted account of the episodes detailed in the exhibits, in a vain attempt to answer all at once the myriad accusations therein. Instead of making a sincere effort to unravel claimant’s testimony and clarify her grounds for challenging employer’s adverse evidence, the referee, aided by employer’s counsel, in effect cross-examined her for what appears from the record to be the contrary purpose of reinforcing employer’s case.</p>

In such cases the referee must be especially sensitive to the quality of the evidence and the claimant’s challenge thereto in determining whether cross-examination of the declarant will substantially increase the likelihood of an informed decision. “The duty of the referee and the Board is not fulfilled merely by hearing the witnesses who voluntarily appear.. .

The uncorroborated hearsay evidence presented by the employer, Department of Revenue, clearly did not meet the employer’s burden of proving willful misconduct on the part of appellee which would bar unemployment compensation benefits.

Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>27 Pa.Cmwlth. 522, <a href="/citations/?q=367%20A.2d%20366" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="367 A.2d 366">367 A.2d 366</a> (1976).</p>

These “guidelines” are utterly unnecessary as demonstrated by the affirmance of the Commonwealth Court’s order. Further, Mr. Justice Kauff-man provides no guidance as to how these “guidelines” should be applied. The “guidelines” are to be applied on a “case by case basis” using “simple common-sense analysis,” 427 A.2d at 642, resulting “in <em>some proceedings </em>[where] circumstantial guarantees of reliability will suffice to render <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>uncorroborated hearsay competent,” 427 A.2d at 640 (emphasis added). Not only do these “guidelines” escape comprehension, they also invite confusion and lack of uniformity both in the conduct of administrative hearings and in judicial review of such hearings.</p>
    <p id="b663-4" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[185,591,1142,1046]]]'>That confusion will result is evident from the application of Mr. Justice Kauffman’s “guidelines” to the facts of this case. The “guidelines” require that (1) all hearsay evidence, even if objected to, is “generally” admissible and that (2) hearsay alone can be relied upon as support for a factual finding, even if not corroborated, if either the proponent establishes “some foundation” for the hearsay’s reliability or reliability is “apparent on its face.” 427 A.2d at 642-644. Applied to the facts of this case, these “guidelines” should clearly result in an adverse determination to appellee and reversal, rather than affirmance, of the Commonwealth Court’s order. None of the documents introduced at appel-lee’s hearing were objected to, and even if objected to, all would have been properly admitted. The documents were prepared close in time to the events they purport to relate, were kept as part of the employer’s records and included two eyewitness accounts of the allegedly “willful misconduct” in dispute. Thus, under Mr. Justice Kauffman’s theory, there is “some foundation” for the hearsay’s reliability.</p>
    <p id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.5",663,[188,1677,1141,645]]]'>Although Mr. Justice Kauffman’s own “common-sense analysis” of the trustworthiness of these documents results in a determination favorable to appellee, the result is in no respect mandated by the application of the suggested “guidelines.” Thus, as vividly illustrated by this case, each administrative determination as to the sufficiency of hearsay evidence, under the novel approach proposed today, would be potentially subject to appeal for an appellate determination of “common-sense.” However, because appellate courts do not function as fact-finders, there inevitably would be widely disparate and irreconcilable administrative adjudications.</p>

As a result, these “guidelines” would deny claimants in administrative proceedings the due process protections regarding admissibility of hearsay evidence which are afforded civil litigants who proceed to trial. The “routine” nature of administrative proceedings and the need for summary adjudications, to which the opinion of Mr. Justice Kauffman refers, cannot justify such a deprivation. To the claimant the administrative hearing is not “routine.” Often it is the proceeding which will determine his very livelihood, a fundamental property right protected by the due process requirements of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.</p>

However, should the claimant assert the right of cross-examination by objecting to the admission of hearsay evidence, his constitutional right must be recognized. Moreover, where objection is not made, as is often the case in uncounseled proceedings, the fairness of the adjudicatory process is assured by requiring that an administrative decision cannot rest solely upon hearsay. The hearing examiner may use the hearsay evidence in reaching a decision, but hearsay relied upon must be corroborated by competent evidence. Since claimants in administrative proceedings are <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>often unrepresented by counsel this minimal requirement is salutary indeed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>

    <p id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[185,409,1144,891]]]'>The fact that an administrative adjudication need be supported by no more than “substantial evidence” to withstand judicial review further displays the need for protection against the decision-maker’s sole reliance on unsworn statements not subject to cross-examination. The “opportunity to challenge the hearsay documents,” 427 A.2d at 644, to which Mr. Justice Kauffman refers, is indeed a hollow opportunity. Without the ability to cross-examine his accusers, the claimant can counter only with denials, which hardly have the same probative effect. Compare <em>Peters v.

In <em>Perales, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that unsworn medical reports, uncorroborated and admitted despite objection by the claimant, could constitute “substantial evidence” in a social security disability hearing “when the claimant has not exercised his right to subpoena the reporting physician and thereby provide himself with the opportunity for cross-examination of the physician.” <a href="/us/402/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="402 U.S. 389" data-case-ids="11733715" data-case-paths="/us/402/0389-01">Id. at 402</a>, <a href="/us/402/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="402 U.S. 389" data-case-ids="11733715" data-case-paths="/us/402/0389-01">91 S.Ct. at 1428</a>.

Further, the claimant not only had the right, but had exercised the right, to a supplemental hearing after the first agency hearing was completed.</p>

In the case now before the Court, the fair adjudication of appellee’s alleged “willful misconduct,” the subject to which the hearsay documents relate, clearly requires a determination of the credibility and veracity of the authors of those documents. Unlike the reports in <em>Perales, </em>the documents cannot be said to be unbiased. Further, the Board of Compensation Review alone, and not the claimant, has the right to subpoena witnesses. 43 P.S. § 826.

This tenet of our law is not a “technicality”, but rather lies at the root of the truth determining process. Our common law and statutory law recognize certain exceptions to the hearsay rule, and these exceptions could well be the subject of a degree of relaxation in an administrative type of adjudication. In this regard the hearing officer should be in a position to determine whether hearsay evidence which would constitute an exception to the hearsay rule should be admissible notwithstanding the absence of proper qualification. It might well be wise to permit the hearing officer to determine whether <em>this type </em>of hearsay evidence is “reliable”. In addition, reports, opinions, and statements of charge submitted by licensed professionals could be an exception. The majority opinion, however, in my view, goes too far and could lead to a determination of rights based upon <em>rank </em>hearsay. This result is repugnant to centuries of tradition. I must, therefore, concur only in the result.</p>
