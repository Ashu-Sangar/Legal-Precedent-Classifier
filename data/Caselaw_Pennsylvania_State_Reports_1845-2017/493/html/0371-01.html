An objection to the question was promptly sustained and the question was not answered. No further relief was sought by appellee during trial. There was no request for cautionary instructions nor was there a request for the withdrawal of a juror. On post-verdict motions, after the jury had obviously decided the liability question in favor of the defendant-appellants, the court <em>en banc </em>concluded that the improper, unanswered question was so prejudicial that a new trial was warranted.

This process removes the professional necessity for trial counsel to be prepared to litigate the case fully at trial and to create a record adequate for appellate review. The ill-prepared advocate’s hope is that an appellate court <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>will come to his aid after the fact and afford him relief despite his failure at trial to object to an alleged error. The diligent and prepared trial lawyer — and his client— are penalized when an entire case is retried because an appellate court reverses on the basis of an error opposing counsel failed to call to the trial court’s attention. Failure to interpose a timely objection at trial denies the trial court the chance to hear argument on the issue and an opportunity to correct error.

The concerns expressed in <em>Dilliplaine </em>are equally applicable in both instances. The claimed taint in this case is that the mere sustaining of the objection to the improper question was inadequate to protect appellee’s interests. If this asserted inadequacy had been called to the trial court’s attention at the time of the occurrence, that court would have had the option of giving a cautionary instruction which could have removed any prejudice which may have resulted from the asking of the improper question. Appellee’s failure to pursue further relief after the court sustained the objection justified the court in concluding that no further action with reference to that complaint was necessary. As a consequence, the unnecessary waste of judicial resources resulting from the failure to afford the trial court the <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>opportunity to correct error during the trial and thereby avoid the necessity of a retrial is graphically demonstrated in this case.

A distinction between the <em>Hill </em>decision and the instant matter does exist in that this complaint does not rise to the level of offending “justice and fairness.” The offensive question in this case could only have prejudiced plaintiff-appellee’s case as to damages, while the verdict reflects that the jury decided against plaintiff-appellee on the liability question. Because of the importance of the issue involved, we decline to use this distinction as the basis of our decision here.</p>
