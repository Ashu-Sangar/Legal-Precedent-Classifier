In 1970, the Philadelphia Bar Association Committee of Censors (Committee) privately reprimanded respondent for failure to act competently because he mishandled a client’s case during 1966-67. The Committee also noted that respondent’s testimony at a hearing on the matter was misleading.

(He <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>had been court-appointed counsel in a murder case tried in 1971 — 72.) The petition was fraudulent and was filed for the purpose of obtaining fees for work respondent did not perform. In the other incident, respondent filed a false complaint in connection with a tenant’s negligence action against a landlord. The tenant’s accident occurred on February 27, 1969, but the complaint which was filed on March 1, 1971 falsely showed the date of accident as March 1, 1969. Respondent had missed the statute of limitations, so he changed the date on the complaint after the tenant had signed it. The fraud was eventually discovered and the action was barred. On April 19, 1979 this Court publicly censured respondent for these incidents.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Respondent admits one of the charges: filing a false sworn application for a driver’s license. Because a 1968 judgment against respondent arising out of a car accident remained unsatisfied, respondent’s driver’s license (issued to “John T. Grigsby, III”) was revoked in 1972. In 1975, respondent submitted a sworn application for a driver’s license under the name “John T. Grigsby, Jr.” In the application he falsely stated that no license had ever been issued to him, that no judgments against him arising out of a car accident were unsatisfied, and that no license issued to him had ever been revoked. A new license was issued in response to this application but revoked when the fraud was discovered.</p>

The judgment creditor who held the unsatisfied 1968 judgment sought to execute against respondent by garnishing his checking account.

Soon <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>afterward, however, respondent voluntarily surrendered the account to the creditor.

This contention is without merit. Evidence is sufficient to prove unprofessional conduct if a preponderance of the evidence establishes the conduct and the proof of such conduct is clear and satisfactory. <em>In re Berlant, </em><a href="/pa/458/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="458 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="479722" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0439-01">458 Pa. 439</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=328%20A.2d%20471" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="328 A.2d 471">328 A.2d 471</a> (1974).

In this case, various checks which the respondent had drawn on the garnished account were introduced into evidence. The checks were made out to “cash” (cash withdrawal), the “Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pa.” (a personal annual fee), and “Citizens for Judge Carson” (a political contribution). Because these payments were clearly for private purposes, the checks circumstantially prove that the account was not a client account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Additionally, respondent later voluntarily surrendered the account to the judgment creditor, an act inconsistent with client ownership. Finally, respondent’s own testimony<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> in the garnishment proceeding supported his ownership: He <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>testified that he could not state why the client funds were being held and he could not identify the clients who owned the funds. He also admitted that he paid his secretary from the account. This evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion that the account was not a client account, contrary to respondent’s sworn pleading.</p>

Although this Court is now presented with additional, substantiated charges of serious misconduct by respondent, including a falsely sworn application for a driver’s license, there is, in light of the majority’s previous public censure, no basis in “fairness for disbarment. The charges now before us all pre-date this Court’s public censure. There is no evidence that, since this censure, <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>respondent has engaged in any improper conduct. On this record, I would agree with the Disciplinary Board that suspension, and not disbarment, is the appropriate penalty. In view of the seriousness of the present charges, however, I would suspend respondent for a period of three years, rather than one year as recommended by the Board.</p>
