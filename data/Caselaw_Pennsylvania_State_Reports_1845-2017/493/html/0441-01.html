The bank, on July 14, 1978, filed exceptions to this original adjudication. Thereafter, on December 11, 1978, the court reversed its prior decision and, in another decree and adjudication, ordered that the proceeds from the sales of Berretta’s real properties be paid to the bank to satisfy its claim against the estate. On January 10, 1979, the United States filed a timely notice of appeal. The bank, on January 17, 1979, filed a cross-appeal.</p>

    <p id="b491-8" data-blocks='[["BL_491.6",491,[212,1169,1141,308]]]'>Berretta died testate on February 11, 1974. The bank was appointed administrator of his estate. The estate does not have sufficient assets to pay all valid claims of indebtedness and is thus insolvent. However, among the assets of the estate were two parcels of real property located in Luzerne County.</p>
    <p id="b491-9" data-blocks='[["BL_491.7",491,[209,1516,1143,579]]]'>The bank had claims against Berretta’s estate by virtue of two outstanding mortgages and bonds, which encumbered the two parcels of real property included in the estate. The bank also held a judgment note for $10,000, which was executed on August 31, 1971. It is the judgment lien arising from this note that is in competition with the federal tax claim. The note was entered as a judgment in the Prothon-otary’s Office of Luzerne County on January 24, 1974. By virtue of the filing and indexing of this judgment, the bank attained the status of a judgment lien creditor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The debt on the note has an outstanding balance of $7,408.02.</p>

      <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>The decedent was the sole proprietor of Berretta Construction Company and had established a commercial line of credit with the bank. The security for the line of credit was a series of three mortgages, the first of which was the March 1, 1961 mortgage to The First National Bank of Exeter, which was acquired through merger by The Wyoming National Bank of Wilkes-Barre. Pursuant to the approved line of credit, the bank made various advances to the decedent on the basis of demand judgment notes, which were periodically consolidated and refinanced with subsequent mortgages; the first of the refinancing mortgages being dated December 3, 1964; the second, April 11, 1972.</p>
    <p id="b492-5" data-blocks='[["BL_492.4",492,[238,924,1149,307]]]'>The three mortgages reflected loans in face amounts of sixteen thousand eight hundred dollars ($16,800.00) in 1961, thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) in 1964, and sixty thousand dollars ($60,000.00) in 1972. When the government’s tax liens were entered, both the 1961 mortgage and the 1972 mortgage were unsatisfied as of record.</p>
    <p id="b492-6" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[234,1252,1150,1060]]]'>The United States filed a proof of claim with the bank, as administrator of the insolvent estate, on June 10, 1974. The claim of the United States is for federal employment taxes, interest and penalties assessed against Berretta, in the total amount of $63,291.54, for the quarterly periods from January 1, 1973, through March 3, 1974. Notice of federal tax liens were filed with the Prothonotary’s Office, Luzerne County, on January 28, 1974, with respect to the taxes for the first three quarters of 1973, and on April 26, 1974, with respect to the taxes due for the fourth quarter of 1973 and the first quarter of 1974. It is under the authority of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206322" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="26 U.S.C. §§ 6322">26 U.S.C. §§ 6322</a>, 6323, that the United States filed such notice. This filing serves as notice to four named classes of creditors that a federal tax lien exists, and the tax lien is not effective against these four classes until such notice is filed. Judgment lien creditors are among the four protected classes. As to other creditors, not specifically protected by the statute, the tax lien is effective upon mere assessment without the necessity of filing.</p>

      <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>By decree of the court, dated October 22, 1974, the two real properties included in Berretta’s estate were sold free and clear of all liens. The liens of the claimants against the estate were to attach to the proceeds of these two sales in the same order of priority as such liens had previously attached to the real properties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The proceeds of the sale were, accordingly, first used to satisfy the outstanding mortgages on the properties held by the bank and also to satisfy a mortgage on one of the properties which was held by the Small Business Administration. After the payments of these mortgages, which are not in issue in this case, $7,633.35 in sales proceeds remained in the estate for distribution to other creditors. The United States did not contest the payment of these mortgages.</p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[204,1061,1142,359]]]'>Both the bank and the United States claimed entitlement to these sales proceeds. The bank’s claim was to satisfy the balance due on the judgment note of August 31, 1971. The United States made claim to all proceeds remaining in the estate, under Revised Statutes, Section 3466, The Federal Insolvency Statute, because the estate was insolvent. The Insolvency Statute, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20191" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="31 U.S.C. § 191">31 U.S.C. § 191</a>, provides:</p>

First, the bank contended its claim constituted a “specific lien” and thus came within a narrow case law exception to the Federal Insolvency Statute. <em>Thelusson v. Smith, </em><a href="/us/15/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Wheat. 396" data-case-ids="1444885" data-case-paths="/us/15/0396-01">2 Wheat. 396</a>, 426, <a href="/us/15/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 L.

The bank alleged that it came within this “specific lien” exception to the Federal Insolvency Statute because the debt secured by the note of August 31, 1971, was also secured by the bank’s mortgages on the two parcels of Berretta’s real properties. Thus, the funds due under the note, according to the bank, were also due under the mortgages because of the “collateral security” or “dragnet” clauses contained in those mortgages.</p>

The court held that this judgment provided the only basis for the bank’s claim, and that the bank did not have a “specific lien” since Berretta had not conveyed to the bank prior to his death, by mortgage or otherwise, any property thereby secured. Therefore, the court found that the bank’s claim did not come within the exception to the statutory priority afforded claims of the United States under the Federal Insolvency Statute.

Further, the circuit court held that the future advances clause covered subsequent inventory purchases.

Had it done so, I am confident the Insolvency Statute would have been repealed or substantially amended, for all of the time, attention and effort expended in drafting, considering and passing the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 will be fruitless, except in bankruptcy cases, if the Insolvency Statute is applied to preserve the super-priorities which the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 undertook to withdraw from tax claims. The question of priorities is wholly or largely academic, unless the debtor is insolvent, and the clearly stated purpose of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 was to regulate the priority of federal tax claims when competing for payment out of the assets of an insolvent taxpayer with secured claims which would enjoy priority under state law.</blockquote>

In any event, the bank was, in this case, acting with commercial reasonableness. It had advanced money to Mr. Berretta over many years in commercial loans secured by real property.' Surely, this sort of lending arrangement is socially beneficial. If we were to decide in this case the government has priority over the bank, lenders, in order to protect themselves henceforth against a possible insolvency, would be forced to refinance <em>all </em>outstanding debts when they refinance a borrower’s loans. Since the cost to the borrower could be substantially greater under such a scheme, this sort of refinancing could not be said to stimulate commerce or to be commercially desirable.</p>
