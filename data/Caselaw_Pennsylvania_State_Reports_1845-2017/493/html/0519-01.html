Respondent represented Ms. Vernell London in regard to personal injuries she suffered in an automobile accident. The case was to be handled on a contingent fee basis wherein respondent would receive 50% of the balance after medical expenses, expenses of suit, investigation, and witness fees were paid. However, there was no agreement between respondent and Ms. London as to the fee to be charged for processing her no-fault claim. Respondent collected the sum of $3,954.66 from Ms. London’s insurance carrier in payment of no-fault benefits under her policy. Approximately $850.00 of this amount represented payment for medical fees. Respondent then caused Ms. London to endorse and return the insurance check to him, asserting that he would pay the outstanding medical bills and return to Ms. London the balance.</p>

Later that month respondent advised the Disciplinary Board that he was preparing the first and final account for this estate and would file it in time for the next Orphans’ Court audit. Accordingly, in January, 1977 the complaint against respondent concerning the administration of this estate was dismissed based on respondent’s representations that the matter would be concluded shortly. In spite of these representations, the first and final account was not filed until September 12, 1977.

The court filed its adjudication on April 6, 1978.
