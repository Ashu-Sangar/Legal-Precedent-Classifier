(contractor) was replacing a gas pipeline for appellee Peoples Natural Gas Co. (gas company) along Saltsburg Road in Plum Township, Allegheny County. An uncovered excavation, which was barricaded with metal horses and dirt, obstructed the entire berm on the north side of Satlsburg Road.</p>

These Scouts encountered the excavation. At the same time a truck with a trailer driven by appellant Bruce A. Campbell (truck driver) and owned by appellant Turner Dairy Farms, Inc. (truck driver’s employer) was approaching the excavation westbound on the same side of the highway. When the truck driver was about three hundred feet away, he observed the approaching Boy Scouts and the excavation, and moved his truck partially over the double yellow center line of the two-lane highway since there was no on-coming traffic. One of the Scouts, observing that the truck had moved to accommodate their passage, proceeded around the excavation on the paved roadway and Thomas Grainy followed. Although there was no on-coming traffic, the truck driver moved back into the westbound lane as he passed the boys. Thomas Grainy was struck and thrown into the excavation, suffering severe injuries. This lawsuit ensued.</p>

Prosser, The Law of Torts § 42, at 244 (1971). This Court has stated that the policy of the law is connected to social arid economic considerations: “[T]he concept [of proximate cause], like that of negligence itself, was designed not only to permit recovery for a wrong but to place such limits upon liability as are deemed socially or economically desirable from time to time.” <em>Whitner v. Lojeski, </em><a href="/pa/437/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="437 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="1927791" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0448-01">437 Pa. 448</a>, 455, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20889" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="263 A.2d 889">263 A.2d 889</a>, 893 (1970). In overruling <em>Kline, </em>this Court adopts a test for intervening negligence which we feel is more in accord with contemporary social and economic policy than the restrictive approach of our 1937 <em>Kline </em>decision. The result is fair and reasonable because the first actor was, in fact, negligent. We also feel that the § 447 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts is more practical because it does not focus on the awareness of the second actor, a subjective factor; instead, it considers (a) the <em>foreseeability </em>of the. second actor’s conduct, (b) whether a <em>reasonable </em>man would regard the intervening conduct as extraordinary or (c) whether the intervening conduct was a <em>normal </em>consequence (§ 447), all of which are objective factors.</p>
