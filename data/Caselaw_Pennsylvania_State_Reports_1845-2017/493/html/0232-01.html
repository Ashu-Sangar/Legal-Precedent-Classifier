The rationale for this conclusion was since a person with means would have the right of an appeal, even though the claims may be without merit, that same right should be afforded the indigent appellant.</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[199,972,1143,708]]]'>Without commenting upon the wisdom of this judgment (we are bound under the Supremacy Clause<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> to follow that holding), I do think it imperative to note that, that holding was limited to the first direct appeal from a criminal conviction. In this case, we are concerned not with a direct appeal, but a collateral attack under a state statutory provision. To suggest that a person with means might be able to frustrate the purpose requires that we permit all defendants the right to misuse this statutory scheme for relief is clearly a <em>non sequitur. </em>The sound jurisprudential way of eliminating abuse of process is not to provide the opportunity for that abuse to all equally but, rather, to eradicate it completely.</p>

Here, as manifestly displayed by the portions of the PCHA hearing transcript previously quoted, the role of appellant’s first PCHA counsel might more aptly be characterized as that of assistant to the prosecutor. Before the hearing he neither amended appellant’s inarticulate petition nor filed a brief in support of appellant’s claims. At the hearing, he began by stating that he felt “constrained to agree” with the assistant district attorney’s assessment of the issues raised in appellant’s petition. He then stated that he had told appellant that his claims as to matters not previously litigated had been waived through trial counsel’s failure to raise them on direct appeal. Rather than amending appellant’s petition to allege a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to raise these issues, appellant’s appointed counsel usurped the function of the hearing court and opined that these omissions were “harmless error,” concluding his testimony with the gratuitous expression of his belief that appellant was “ably represented in his case.” Moreover, he admitted, to the surprise of the assistant district attorney, <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>that his conclusions and advice were based on only a partial reading of the transcript of appellant’s case.

Indeed, if appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance had been decided against him after the hearing, appellant would then properly be deemed to have waived any claims which could have been raised in post-trial motions or on direct appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">3</a> It is clear that these minimal, yet valuable, requirements for effective post-conviction counsel provide a far less Draconian means of achieving the desired goal of finality than does the elimination of <em>any </em>standard for effective assistance in these proceedings, which Justices Nix and Flaherty appear to advocate in their Opinions in Support of Affirmance. Unlike the solutions proposed in those opinions, these requirements would serve not only to reduce the burden of repeated post-conviction petitions and hearings upon our judiciary but also to foster and preserve respect for the value of our adversary system of justice in the eyes of both defendants and the rest of society.</p>

To argue that counsel cannot properly assess the stewardship of prior counsel without reading every word of the transcript regardless how voluminous, is absurd. Certainly the mere appointment of new counsel to represent the defendant in a post conviction proceeding is not sufficient. Pursuant to that appointment, new counsel must <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>“discharge the responsibilities required by his representation.” <em>Commonwealth v.

This point applies equally to appellant’s second PCHA counsel, who should have realized that appellant’s belated claim of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel was vital to the preservation of his other claims and thus should have been raised by appellant’s first PCHA counsel. If appellant’s second PCHA counsel also regarded all of appellant’s claims as meritless, he should nonetheless have amended appellant’s petition to allege the ineffectiveness of all prior counsel, followed the remaining steps described above, and then petitioned to withdraw, thus obviating the need for this appeal. We reiterate, however, that none of this would have been necessary if appellant’s first PCHA counsel had himself performed the minimal advocate’s role.</p>
