Unlike the trial court, we are satisfied that appellant validly sought to introduce evidence of his witness’s acquittal for the limited purpose of removing a “cloud” cast over the witness’s testimony by Commonwealth evidence indicating the witness’s involvement in the alleged crimes. Because the court erred in refusing appellant’s valid request for permission to make limited use of evidence of his witness’s acquittal, judgment of sentence must be vacated and appellant must be granted a new trial.</p>

The majority states, “.. . we are satisfied that appellant validly sought to introduce evidence of his witness’s acquittal for the limited purpose of removing a ‘cloud’ cast over the witness’s testimony by Commonwealth evidence indicating the witness’s involvement in the alleged crimes.” However, it is a well established principle that in the absence of an attack upon credibility, no sustaining evidence is allowed. <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>Section 49 (2d ed. 1972).</p>

    <p id="b59-6" data-blocks='[["BL_59.6",59,[176,771,1153,741]]]'>It is probable that evidence of the acquittal of defense witness Geraldine Stetler would have created the impression before the jury that the defendant was equally innocent, and the majority recognizes that admission of such evidence generally would be improper. <em>See Commonwealth v. Amato, </em><a href="/pa/449/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="449 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1945621" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0592-01">449 Pa. 592</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20462" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="297 A.2d 462">297 A.2d 462</a> (1972). I agree with the courts below that evidence of whether Geraldine Stetler was charged in connection with this episode and, if so, whether she was acquitted is not relevant to resolution of appellant’s guilt or innocence. Since the prejudice resulting from admission of such evidence, even for a limited purpose, would be overwhelming and not in the interest of truth-seeking and justice, it was appropriately excluded. Accordingly, I would affirm the Judgment of Sentence.</p>
