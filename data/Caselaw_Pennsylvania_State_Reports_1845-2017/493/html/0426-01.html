Mr. Justice Nix noted that the Act of Assembly of April 22, 1794, divided the crime of murder into two degrees and required the trial court to submit the question of the degree of the offense to the jury. He noted further that while the 1794 statute was silent on the jury’s common law right to determine the existence of murder or manslaughter, commentaries on the law at that time indicate the General Assembly’s intention to continue the jury’s common law mercy dispensing power. The Penal Code of 1939 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> continued to authorize the jury to determine the degree of murder, while case law after 1939 continued to permit a verdict of voluntary manslaughter under facts justifying a finding of murder.

It has been argued that enactment of the Crimes Code evidenced an intent by the General Assembly to depart from reliance on the common law for the definition of criminal offenses and provided the opportunity to abandon the common law doctrines of lesser included offenses and the jury’s mercy dispensing power in favor of vesting the charging decision in the prosecutor. <em>See Commonwealth v.
