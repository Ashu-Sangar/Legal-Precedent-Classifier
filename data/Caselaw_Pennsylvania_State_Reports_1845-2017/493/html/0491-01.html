The decree of January 10, 1980 continued the preliminary injunction restraining The Washington Memorial Chapel and The Rector, Church Wardens and Vestrymen of The Washington Memorial Chapel at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania (“Chapel”) from proceeding in any manner to evict The Valley Forge Historical Society (“Society”) from its present quarters in the Washington <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>Memorial until the petition for declaratory judgment filed by the Society is finally determined, and in any way interfering with the Society’s free access to its quarters or that of the public at such reasonable times as the Society determines it should be open to the public.</p>

    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[240,904,1149,572]]]'>The Valley Forge Historical Society and the Washington Memorial Chapel have occupied the same buildings at The Washington Memorial since the early part of this century when both the Society and the Chapel were founded by an Episcopal Churchman, Dr. W. Herbert Burk. Since the creation of the Society in 1918, it has maintained its offices and its collection of historical artifacts dating from the colonial and revolutionary periods in the same buildings occupied by the Chapel. The artifacts are displayed in an area of the premises open to the public. The Society also operates a souvenir shop upon the premises.</p>
    <p id="b542-6" data-blocks='[["BL_542.6",542,[239,1497,1148,467]]]'>There is no dispute that title to the entire property is held by the Chapel. The Society, however, claims a right to remain in its present premises based on a trust relationship it contends exists between itself and the Chapel. The Chapel, on the contrary, contends the Society is merely a tenant whose leasehold interest in the premises has expired. It wishes to dispossess the Society so that it may demolish that part of the structure occupied by the Society and engage upon a building project for its own purposes.</p>
    <p id="b542-7" data-blocks='[["BL_542.7",542,[238,1984,1147,362]],["BL_543.1",543,[191,323,1141,395]]]'>In the last two decades, there have been extended negotiations between these parties concerning the relocation of the Society, so that the Chapel’s expansion would not be impeded. The negotiations proved unsuccessful. In 1973, the parties entered into a written lease. This lease characterized the parties as landlord (the Chapel) and tenant (the Society), described the premises, and provided for rent and <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>for other provisions applicable to a landlord-tenant relationship. The Society, however, claims that the lease was entered into only to formalize the basis for sharing operating expenses as requested by the Chapel for the first time in 1973. There was never a written lease prior to 1973, and the Chapel never characterized the relationship between itself and the Society as one of lessor-lessee at anytime prior to 1973.</p>

In response, the Society commenced this action requesting the court below to declare the rights of the parties as to perpetual use and occupancy of the premises and to enjoin the Chapel from interfering with the Society’s alleged rights of occupancy. As previously noted, the injunction was granted. This appeal by the Chapel followed.</p>

More particularly, the Chapel’s argument is that the Society failed to plead facts sufficient to establish a trust, without the existence of which the Orphans’ Court cannot entertain this action. The Society’s argument, however, is that it has clearly averred the existence of a charitable trust of which the Society is a beneficiary for the housing of the historical collection at The Washington Memorial.</p>

Enforcement of the duty owed by the Chapel, to use the property in question for “religious and patriotic purposes,” was therefore left to enforce by either a member of the charitable organization or by someone having a special interest in the trust. We agree with appellant that the Society has neither pleaded nor established facts which would designate it as a member of the charitable organization. Under the theory of a charitable trust for the benefit of the public generally, appellees would not be designated charitable organization; thus they must satisfy the standing requirement by demonstrating a special interest in the trust.

Upon review of the record we find the lower court had reasonable grounds for its action. Although appellant challenges the authenticity, value and quantity of the artifacts currently for public viewing at the museum, it is clear that removal and storage of these artifacts could expose them to risk of loss or destruction.</p>
    <p id="b549-8" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[215,1008,1144,716]]]'>Secondly, according to appellant, there has been no showing by the Society that greater injury will result by refusing rather than granting the preliminary injunction. Again we note the risk of loss and destruction inherent in removing and storing historical artifacts. Moreover, as appellee appropriately argues, the harm to the public must also be considered. <em>See McMullan v. Wohlgemuth, </em><a href="/pa/444/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="444 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="1938577" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0563-01">444 Pa. 563</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=281%20A.2d%20836" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="281 A.2d 836">281 A.2d 836</a> (1971) (where an adverse effect upon the public will result from the issuance of a preliminary injunction, it should not be granted).

The status quo to be maintained by a preliminary injunction is the last actual, peaceable and lawful noncontested status which preceded the pending controversy. <em>Commonwealth v. Coward, </em><a href="/pa/489/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="489 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1762391" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0327-01">489 Pa. 327</a>, 341, <a href="/pa/489/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="489 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1762391" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0327-01">414 A.2d 91</a>, 99 (1980). There is no question that the presence of the Society on the premises up to May 1979 was lawful. Appellee has occupied the premises since the early part of the twentieth century. Whether its occupancy since May 1979 is lawful is the very heart of the matter pending in the lower court. Plainly stated, the court <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>below must determine the legality of appellant’s eviction notice in 1979. Thus it was proper that an injunction issue in order to preserve the status quo pending a decision on the merits.</p>
    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[236,533,1149,968]]]'>Finally, appellant argues the Society failed to establish a clear right to the relief requested. Appellant reviews the arguments in support of the assertion that the Society has failed to prove any right of perpetual occupancy to the real property in question and concludes that the Society’s failure to establish that it is the beneficiary of the charitable trust precludes it from obtaining injunctive relief. Appellant is correct in asserting that speculative considerations cannot form the basis for issuing a preliminary injunction. However, where, as in the present case, the status quo sought to be altered has continued undisturbed for more than sixty years, the merits of the litigation cannot be reached until completion of discovery and full hearing, it is not clear that the petitioner’s claim is purely speculative and the three prongs of the test for issuance of a preliminary injunction have been satisfied, it is unreasonable to deny injunctive relief pending a definitive ruling on the merits. The grant of a preliminary injunction is proper and will not be disturbed.</p>

Appellant, in the alternative, contends that the facts as alleged by the Society <em>may </em>permit a court to find a constructive or resulting trust in favor of the Society, but that the Orphans’ Court is without jurisdiction to make such a determination. The Society averred in its petition that since the founding of the Chapel and the Society, the Chapel had solicited and accepted contributions for the joint use of the parties, and that such representations and co-mingling gave rise to a charitable trust. However, appellant argues, constructive or resulting trusts are specifically excluded from the definition of <em>inter vivos </em>trusts and, therefore, from the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>Court.

If appellants are successful in establishing the grantor’s intent to create a charitable trust, we need not reach the issue of whether a constructive or resulting trust exists by virtue of the alleged solicitation and acceptance of funds for the joint use of the parties.</p>

In <em>Nevil Estate, supra, </em>the Society for the Advancement of the Deaf filed a petition to review a final decree of the Orphans’ Court approving a partial distribution of funds to certain institutions for the blind and the deaf from a charitable trust. The Attorney General, <em>inter alia, </em>questioned the standing of the Society for the Advancement of the Deaf to present the review petition. On appeal, this Court found the Society, as an agency devoted to aiding the deaf generally, had no legally recognized private interest in the disposition of the fund and was, therefore, not a proper party to appeal from a decree in a charitable trust proceeding. The Society for the Advancement of the Deaf, had no interest different in kind from that of the public generally. We believe a marked difference exists between the position of the Society in <em>Nevil Estate </em>and the Society in the present case. The Valley Forge Historical Society is not an institution which merely hopes to be a beneficiary of a charitable trust. Rather, its interest is a real and distinct one arising from the special circumstances of its creation and relationship with the Chapel.</p>
