Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to indicate that appellant was likely to commit a future crime if he was not imprisoned. Although appellant was arrested on three occasions in 1971 and 1972, these charges did not result in convictions and no inference adverse to appellant can be drawn from the fact of those arrests. Appellant was not charged with any further crimes between 1972 and the time of the revocation of his probation in 1976. It is therefore apparent that the interest of society reflected in the first and second criteria of § 1371(c) did not require the imposition of the maximum sentence in this case.</p>

Clearly, the failure to abide by the court’s directive to meet the terms of probation offends the dignity of the court. However, subparagraph (3) of section 1371(c) requires more than merely an affront to the court’s authority. The language specifically requires that the sentence be <em>“essential </em>to vindicate the authority of the court.” It is our judgment that under these unique facts it cannot be said that the imposition of the maximum sentence was <em>“essential </em>” to vindicate the court’s authority.</p>

In the instant case, Mr. Cottle’s adjustment obviously required the overcoming of his alcoholic problem and his need to find gainful steady employment. Thus, although he did not meet the strict terms of the probationary requirements, he did in fact accomplish that which the probation was designed to achieve. This does not mean that Mr. Cottle should necessarily be absolved completely for his failure to comply with the court’s directive but it does suggest that the imposition of maximum confinement in this case is suspect. To ignore Mr. Cottle’s efforts in his own behalf and act solely on the basis of his failure to comply with the court’s directive, would place form over substance. It would ignore the <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>ultimate objective that has been achieved and the fact that, that accomplishment resulted from the efforts of the offender himself. We are here faced with a man who has demonstrated that he is now able to live successfully in the community. The imposition of the maximum sentence at this point in Mr. Cottle’s life would be more punitive than corrective in nature. Moreover, it may very well destroy that which has already been accomplished, i. e., his readjustment.

Appellant has asserted that Judge Braig was prejudicially predisposed towards appellant and has requested that a new judge be chosen for the purpose of resentencing. The normal procedure is for the sentencing judge to preside over probation revocation matters. In this case, since the sentencing judge, Judge Levin, had retired, the judge then serving on the criminal motions list, Judge Braig, heard the matter. It was therefore a fortuitous circumstance that Judge Braig heard this matter. We cannot assume that upon remand to the Court of Common Pleas that the cause will be again assigned before Judge Braig. Thus, there is no occasion for us to consider appellant’s objection to Judge Braig’s further participation at this juncture. If the matter is in fact assigned again to Judge Braig, these objections may then be properly raised and appellant’s rights to appeal from such a ruling are preserved.</p>
