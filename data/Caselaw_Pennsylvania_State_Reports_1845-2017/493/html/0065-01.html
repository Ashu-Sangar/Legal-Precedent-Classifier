On September 14, 1978, the Commonwealth had filed a petition for extension of time which was denied on October 6, 1978 on the ground that the Commonwealth had failed to establish “due diligence” as required by Rule 1100(c). Appellee here maintains that since the Commonwealth failed to appeal from the October 6 order, it waived all future opportunity to question the appropriate time period under Rule 1100. He argues that the petition for extension was actually a request for a determination that the 180 day period commenced from the filing of the second complaint rather than from the first complaint, and hence, that it was a final, appealable order. The opinion and order of October 6 reflect, however, that the court treated the Commonwealth’s petition merely as a Rule 1100(c) petition for extension, the denial of which is not an appealable final order. Thus, the Commonwealth is not barred from here contending that the 180 day period commenced from the second, not the first, complaint.</p>

Wingo, </em><a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">407 U.S. 514</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">92 S.Ct. 2182</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">33 L.Ed.2d 101</a> (1972). That period was arrived at after input was received from members of the bar throughout the Commonwealth. Consideration was given to the unique problems of the various judicial districts. The attempt to accommodate all legitimate concerns was evidenced by the fact that initially a much longer period was prescribed to permit adjustment to the rule. The period finally arrived at was deemed to be a reasonable time in which to bring a criminal case to trial. Where the trial cannot be commenced, with reasonable diligence, within the prescribed period, the Commonwealth has the option of seeking an extension. There is no limitation on the number of extensions or the length of the extensions. The only requirement is that the Commonwealth must show that it has proceeded <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>with due diligence. A proper determination of due diligence must take into account factors such as case load and the resources available to the prosecutor. A denial of a petition for extension is subject to appellate review. Here the Commonwealth sought an extension within the prescribed period and was denied the relief sought on the basis that they had failed to establish “due diligence.” This decision was not appealed. The Commonwealth had the option of seeking interlocutory review under the authority of <em>Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, </em><a href="/pa/411/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="411 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="1885971" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0056-01">411 Pa. 56</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20304" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="190 A.2d 304">190 A.2d 304</a> (1963). The Commonwealth elected not to seek review which suggests an implicit concession that they did not exercise “due diligence.” Finally, periods of delay attributable to the defense are automatically excluded from the computation. Thus there can be no legitimate excuse for a prosecutor allowing a prosecution to be barred under the provisions of the rule. Nor can such a result occur except where the prosecutor has failed to act with due diligence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

    <p id="b124-6" data-blocks='[["BL_124.6",124,[258,802,1152,1005]]]'>The majority seeks to distinguish <em>Johnson </em>in this factual situation on the grounds that in <em>Johnson </em>there was only one complaint filed. This analysis is in my judgment superficial and ignores the clear meaning of the <em>Johnson </em>decision. In this case, we are faced with a rearrest after a determination by the original district justice that there was not a <em>prima facie case. </em>There was no allegation that the complaint was defective, in fact the second complaint was identical to the first. Thus the interruption did not occur because of a deficiency in the complaint but rather as the result of an apparently erroneous judgment of the first district justice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> The rearrest procedure does not necessarily require the filing of a new complaint. Thus if we accept the majority’s attempt to distinguish <em>Johnson, </em>we would have to conclude the applicability of the <em>Johnson </em>rationale would be dependent upon whether the Commonwealth elected to file a second paper reciting verbatim the contents of the first. Such a trivial basis for determining substantial rights is abhorrent in an enlightened society.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a>
