This conclusion is unsupportable. The record does not even indicate who owns the land to the west and at the time of the conveyance to Brady and Spark, the common grantors still held the lands to the east of the Brady and Spark parcels and the reservation was to benefit “other land now owned by the parties . . . and adjoining the land hereby granted.” This language does not hint at the possibility that the common grantors intended that the reserved easement should benefit only part of their retained land. “If the words of a deed are sufficiently clear to define the character and extent of a reservation, they speak for themselves and there is no room for construction against a grantor and in favor of a grantee.” <em>Baptist Church in the Great Valley v.
