No allegation has been made, however, of fraud, embezzlement, or other criminal conduct. The township solicitor undertook to defend Silver and Parker in accordance with her understanding of Section 582 of the Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S. § 65582 (“Section 582”), which provides in pertinent part:</p>

When petitioners sought to depose Downs in an effort to establish a factual record to challenge these allegations, Downs refused to appear. After several unsuccessful attempts to reschedule his deposition, petitioners moved for an order to compel Downs to appear. Respondents’ counsel, in turn, sought and obtained a Rule to Show Cause why a protective order should not be issued, returnable May 27, 1980.</p>

These requests were rejected, again without opinion, on July 3, 1980. The petition now before us was filed on August 4,1980, and an application for stay was filed on August 13, 1980. The following day this writer entered an order staying all proceedings, directing the trial court to file an opinion setting forth the basis for its orders of May 27 and July 3, and scheduling the matter for oral argument.</p>

This would virtually invite abuse of Section 503 by political opponents to achieve indirectly that which they have been unable to accomplish directly at the polls, thereby frustrating the will of the <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>electorate.

(Id.) Definitive clarification of this and other questions pertinent to disqualification was the express purpose of the discovery sought by petitioners.

Although the court notes that “it is far from obvious on the face of the letter requesting an opinion that this [petitioners’ assertion] is so” (slip opinion p. 6), no explanation is offered as to why discovery was not permitted to proceed in an effort to clarify the circumstances surrounding Downs’ letter.</p>

Although respondents addressed this issue in their disqualification motion and also sought, unsuccessfully, a preliminary injunction barring the use of township funds in defense of the recall action, the issue was left unresolved at the time of the disqualification order. Respondents, having successfully alleged a conflict in the solicitor’s duties, instead threatened petitioners with personal liability in the event they might attempt to retain substitute counsel with township funds. The trial court, as noted earlier, refused to rule on the issue of substitute counsel when requested to do so by petitioners. Clearly, however, this is a more basic question than is the matter of disqualification, for if the defense of the recall action falls within the scope of the solicitor’s duties under Section 582, then a <em>fortiori, </em>if the solicitor is disqualified, substitute counsel must be provided; while if such representation is outside the scope of the solicitor’s duties, the motion to disqualify is superfluous. For this reason, we consider the question of petitioners’ right to public representation before proceeding to the merits of the disqualification order.</p>
