This Court has never had occasion to define those circumstances which constitute “poverty” within the meaning of the statute. The Superior Court has stated that “[t]he Act [of June 16, 1836] ... is to be read not with an accountant’s but a housewife’s eyes. ‘Poverty’ does not refer solely to a petitioner’s ‘net worth’ but to whether he is able to obtain the necessities of life.” <em>Gerlitzki v.

We agree with the Superior Court that the determination of “poverty” within the meaning of § 72 is not to be a mere mathematical exercise offsetting credits against debits.

In this case, there is evidence in the record that appellant uses his car to obtain groceries, medical care and other necessities. He also uses his car to visit his sisters, his only living relatives, in an adjacent state. There is no evidence, however, concerning the availability and cost of alternate modes of transportation or the availability and cost of substitute goods and services that appellant now uses his automobile to obtain. We are satisfied from the record that appellant uses his automobile for legitimate, necessary purposes and that he is not attempting to subvert the purpose of § 72 by refusing to sell his automobile in order to generate funds for the payment of court costs.

While our analysis under § 72 fully justifies our disposition of this case, we note also that in this case, where there is a right to jury trial, that right could be seriously impeded if we were to approve of the reasoning of the lower court to the effect that appellant should sell his automobile in order to raise funds for the costs of an appeal. The sole purpose of the appeal which appellant is attempting to <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>obtain is to protect his only valuable asset — his automobile — from execution. Placing appellant in the position of having to lose his automobile in order to obtain a jury trial, the purpose of which is to protect that very automobile from execution, would amount to an “onerous condition . . . which would make the right [to a jury trial] practically unavailable.” <em>Smith Case, infra, </em>381 Pa. at 231, 112 A.2d at 629.</p>
