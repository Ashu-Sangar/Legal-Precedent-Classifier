    <p id="b333-11" data-blocks='[["BL_333.11",333,[209,1546,1147,785]]]'>Appellant was charged in connection with the death of Edith Morford, who lived in a trailer park in White Township, Indiana County. On February 22, 1979, decedent’s daughter, Cora Ondo, discovered her mother’s dead body, in the trailer. The body had a knife embedded in the chest. A pathologist determined that the stab wound of the chest was the cause of death and that there were other injuries indicating violence, including abdominal stab wounds, a crushed larynx, distention of the rectum, and multiple abrasions and contusions. State troopers who arrived at the scene found empty cans of Stroh’s beer, head and pubic hairs that a forensic chemist found to be consistent with those of appellant, and a shirt that two co-workers identified as belonging to appellant. One of them said he was wearing it the previous day.</p>

Arthur Stumbaugh, who knew them both, testified that he arrived at the tavern between 5:00 and 5:30 p. m. that day and that they were both there. Appellant drove Stumbaugh home at approximately 7:30 p. m., and asked him if he knew decedent. Stumbaugh said he knew her as “Edie.” Appellant asked Stumbaugh if he thought she would go out with him and Stumbaugh said he did not know. Appellant said he would go back and try to talk to her.</p>
    <p id="b334-5" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[240,816,1149,453]]]'>Antonio Arroyo, a bartender at the Red Onion, confirmed that appellant drove Stumbaugh home, returned ten to fifteen minutes later, began talking to decedent, and then bought her a drink. Arroyo heard fragments of their conversation, during which they talked about where their cars were parked. Arroyo sold appellant a six-pack of Stroh’s beer and shortly afterward, he noticed appellant and decedent were gone. He did not see them leave and could not say whether they left together.</p>

She saw decedent arrive at her trailer by car with another car following. Batistelli returned between 11:30 and 11:45 and noticed there were no lights on at decedent’s trailer and there was a car being jump-started by another car. She went into her own trailer and heard noises shortly afterwards. She looked out and saw a different car being pushed.</p>
    <p id="b334-7" data-blocks='[["BL_334.6",334,[239,1710,1150,608]]]'>John Georgianni testified that at about the time referred to by Batistelli, he was called by his brother-in-law, who was visiting at the trailer park and whose friend’s car would not start. He further testified that he drove over and jump-started the car. While he was there, he observed decedent’s trailer and saw that there were no lights turned on. He heard screams coming from the trailer and then heard the opening of the door and the footsteps of someone leaving on the opposite side of the trailer from where he was. He testified that it sounded to him as though the person was walking around toward his side and then suddenly changed direction.</p>

    <p id="b335-4" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[224,624,1141,196]]]'>Appellant admitted that he was with decedent in the tavern but denied that he went anywhere else with her. He presented witnesses in an attempt to establish an alibi defense.</p>
    <p id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.5",335,[220,867,1147,1116]]]'>Appellant alleges various errors. The first is that the court erred in refusing to sustain his demurrer. Appellant presented evidence after the ruling and having done so, he cannot now question its correctness. We will instead treat his claim as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Ilgenfritz, </em><a href="/pa/466/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="466 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1715011" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0345-01">466 Pa. 345</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="466 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1715011" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0345-01">353 A.2d 387</a> (1976). The evidence is sufficient if it supports the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt when construed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, with all proper inferences drawn favoring the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Yost, </em><a href="/pa/478/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="478 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1740526" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0327-01">478 Pa. 327</a>, <a href="/pa/478/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="478 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1740526" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0327-01">386 A.2d 956</a> (1978). From the Commonwealth’s evidence, as summarized above, it may be inferred that appellant left the tavern with decedent and accompanied her to her trailer, that decedent’s screams were heard from the trailer later that evening, and that appellant left just afterward and was trying to avoid being seen. When these inferences are considered, along with the fact that appellant was positively identified as having been with decedent and that she had been stabbed when she was next seen, it may be further inferred that it was appellant who did the stabbing. We find the evidence to be sufficient.</p>

If a defendant receives a death sentence and successfully challenges the validity of the statute under which it is imposed, the proper relief is to modify the sentence, as was done in cases where previous death penalty laws were invalidated. <em>Commonwealth v.

There was no showing that the prosecution excluded blacks and appellant is entitled to no relief in the absence of such a showing. <em>Swain v.

The trial court held a hearing on appellant’s challenge to the panel during which the jury commissioner of the county testified that the panel was randomly selected from voter registration lists and that a questionnaire sent to prospective jurors contained no question that would reveal race.

The photograph was in black and <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>white and did not show any blood. We held that it was admissible because it was not unduly gruesome and had evidentiary value in that it showed what happened to the victims, and thereby aided in understanding the alleged crime. In the instant case, the photographs had similar evidentiary value in showing what happened to the victim. The photo showing the knife handle, with no part of the blade showing, gave the jury an indication of the force used, thus establishing the specific intent to kill. We find the evidentiary value to be sufficient for admission. The photographs were no more inflammatory than necessary, given that there are no gaping wounds, the face is not shown, and the amount of blood that appears is minimal.</p>

    <p id="b339-8" data-blocks='[["BL_339.9",339,[222,1858,1141,471]]]'>Although I agree the judgment of sentence must be affirmed, I cannot join the majority opinion because of its reliance upon <em>Commonwealth v. Futch, </em><a href="/pa/492/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="492 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1767154" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0359-01">492 Pa. 359</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="492 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1767154" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0359-01">424 A.2d 1231</a> (1981) and <em>Commonwealth v.

The majority uses these two decisions in denying relief as to the appellant’s claims relating to the possibility of racial prejudice in the jury selection process. I agree with the ultimate result that no prejudice has been shown in this particular record.</p>

      <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>In <em>Commonwealth v.

Futch, <a href="/pa/492/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="492 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1767154" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0359-01">supra,</a> </em>(Nix, J., Concurring Opinion, filed January 30, 1981). While I did not participate in <em>Commonwealth v.

There are too many other easily accessible methods for selecting prospective jurors from all segments of the community to permit the exclusive use of a means which is inherently suspect. Again, I find that there is no indication of such a problem in this particular record.</p>
