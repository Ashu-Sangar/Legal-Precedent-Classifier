Immediately upon his appearance in court, prior to the commencement of any proceedings, appellant filed a motion for a continuance so that he could proceed in civilian clothes before a tribunal which would not be exposed to the outward evidence of his prior conviction. This motion was <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>denied. The court then conducted a colloquy with appellant in which appellant waived his constitutional right to a jury trial and pleaded not guilty. Trial immediately followed. Appellant was again found guilty of retail theft and conspiracy. This time, however, the court imposed the maximum sentence permitted by law — two and one-half to five years for each offense, to be served consecutively. These sentences were also to be served consecutively to the three to ten year sentence that appellant was then serving in Grater-ford State Penitentiary. The Superior Court affirmed, with Judge Spaeth dissenting. <a href="/pa-super/258/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="258 Pa.

First, he asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence greater than that imposed at his first trial without providing any reasons for the substantial increase in sentence, despite appellant’s request that reasons appear on the record. Second, appellant asserts that it was error for the trial court to deny his pretrial motion for a continuance so that he could obtain civilian clothes and stand trial before a tribunal unexposed to the evidence of his prior conviction for an unrelated offense. Because we agree with appellant that the trial court committed reversible error in commencing trial over appellant’s specific objection that he be permitted to stand trial in civilian clothing, we would reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand for a new trial.</p>

This evidence, impermissibly before the trier of fact before trial ever began, is unlike inadmissible prejudicial evidence which comes to the attention of the trial judge during the course of trial. In order to avoid the unnecessary and unwarranted effect of requiring an automatic mistrial when such evidence arises during trial, we rely upon the trial judge to exercise his discretion in determining whether, given his training and expertise, he is able to disregard the prejudicial evidence and render a decision based only upon that evidence which is admissible. However, where as here, trial has not yet begun, and the trial court has the easily available alternative of a continuance, there is no compelling interest to be served by proceeding to trial in the face of potential prejudice.
