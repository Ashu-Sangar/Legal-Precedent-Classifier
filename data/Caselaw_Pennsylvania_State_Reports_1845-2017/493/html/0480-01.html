This intention <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>becomes even clearer when consideration is given to the fact that the provision prior to amendment simply stated “when purchased solely for residential use.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[240,446,1148,459]]]'>Appellant seeks to place itself in the role of a mere conduit and suggests that factor is not deserving of any tax consequences. However, it is clear that the legislature intended to distinguish between purchases by those who intended to use the utility for their own residential use and those who purchased the tangible personal property for a commercial purpose. The fact that appellant is in the business of supplying residences for hire does not make it any less a commercial venture.</p>
    <p id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[238,938,1153,1103]]]'>Aldine argues that under the first sentence of section 201(m) “steam and natural and manufactured . . . gas” and “electricity” are classified as tangible personal property <em>only where it is purchased for a nonresidential use. </em>That first sentence of section 201(m) is not qualified by the use of the phrase “purchased directly by the user thereof.” Thus appellant reasons that where gas and electricity are used for residential use, it is not corporeal personal property under section 201(m) and that the second sentence of the section is of no moment. We cannot accept such a strained interpretation of the clear language of the section. Section 201(m) reveals an obvious legislative intent to distinguish based upon the use to which the purchaser of the property makes of the item as opposed to the ultimate use of the item itself. To accept the suggested construction would render the second sentence of section 201(m) meaningless insofar as it relates to gas and electricity, although these items were expressly referred to in that sentence. This approach would be offensive to the fundamental principle of statutory construction that all provisions of a statute are to be given meaning. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(a) (Supp. Pamphlet 1964-79).</p>

This argument rests upon the fact that section 202(a) provides for the imposition of the tax only on <em>sales at retail. </em>The issue raised by this contention is whether the fact that Aldine passes on to the tenants through the rental payments the cost of these items constitutes a resale by Aldine of these items to the tenant.</p>
    <p id="b533-5" data-blocks='[["BL_533.4",533,[209,694,1142,519]]]'>Upon scrutiny we find Aldine’s position to be fallacious. In providing these items the landlord is furnishing a complete rental unit and is not selling any particular item therein. The provisions of these utilities for the rental price is part of the inducement to the tenant to enter the lease for the unit. The tenant does not obtain any more ownership in these utilities than it does in the bathroom or kitchen facilities that may be supplied with the unit. All of these items are supplied for the use of the tenant during the term of the lease.</p>

The holding of <em>Monumental Properties </em>is clearly not supportive of the argument in this context. The fact that in <em>Monumental Properties </em>we held, for strong policy reasons, that the leasing of residences falls within the ambit of the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, Act of December 17, 1968, P.L. 1224, §§ 1-9, 73 P.S. §§ 201 1 to 201 9 (1971) does not require us to ignore the traditionally accepted differences between a sale and a lease in interpreting the instant statute.</p>

Appellant argues that the distinction resulting from our <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>interpretation of section 201(m) is one between two types of residential users, i. e., users living in buildings whose utilities are master-metered and users living in buildings whose utilities are sub-metered. Our view, and certainly the one mandated by the language of section 201(m), however, is that the Legislature sought to distinguish between purchasers of utility services for their private residential use and purchasers of those services who, because of the nature of their commercial venture, choose to provide utility services to their tenants. When viewed in this light, it is manifest that the classification created by the Legislature rests upon a “reasonable and just” basis and is neither capricious nor discriminatory, thus “capable of reasonable comprehension.”</p>

One example of this difference is that a large volume commercial purchaser receives a discount on bulk purchases of most utilities which the individual residential purchaser does not enjoy. We cannot view the landlord’s role as a mere conduit or intermediary which should not have tax consequences. Rather, the landlord purchases utility services and fuel oil as part of a commercial enterprise, and it would be naive to treat it as anything other than a commercial venture.</p>

The majority misconstrues the statute, ignoring the legislative mandate that taxing statutes “shall be strictly construed.” Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C. S.A. § 1928(b)(3) (Supp.1964-1979); <em>See Estate of Carlson, </em><a href="/pa/479/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="479 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1742220" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0421-01">479 Pa. 421</a>, 424, <a href="/pa/479/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="479 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1742220" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0421-01">388 A.2d 726</a>, 728 (1978) (“A taxing statute <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>must not only be strictly construed, but all reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.”) This principle of construction is particularly compelling in times when taxation and inflation ravage taxpayers.</p>
    <p id="b537-4" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[195,519,1141,150]]]'>The Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7202(a) imposes a six percent sales tax on retail sales of “tangible personal property”, defined by 72 P.S. § 7201(m) as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b537-5" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[236,694,1100,533]]]'>(m) “Tangible personal property.” Corporeal personal property including, but not limited to, goods, wares, merchandise, steam and natural and manufactured and bottled gas for non-residential use, electricity for non-residential use, intrastate telephone and telegraph service for non-residential use.... Nor shall said term include steam, natural and manufactured and bottled gas, fuel oil, electricity or intrastate telephone or telegraph service when purchased directly by the user thereof solely for his own residential use.</blockquote>
    <p id="b537-6" data-blocks='[["BL_537.6",537,[194,1275,1141,308]]]'>The taxpayer in this case, landlord of an apartment building, purchases electricity, gas, and fuel oil for the entire apartment building. The Commonwealth contends that the sales tax applies because these utilities are not purchased directly by the tenants. The Commonwealth’s contention is without merit.</p>
    <p id="b537-7" data-blocks='[["BL_537.7",537,[192,1632,1143,319]]]'>The utilities are put to residential use and are simply not encompassed in the definition of “tangible personal property” which includes “gas for <em>non-residential </em>use, electricity for <em>non-residential </em>use . . . . ” (emphasis supplied). As long as the utilities are put to residential use it is irrelevant that the landlord pays for them.</p>
    <p id="b537-8" data-blocks='[["BL_537.8",537,[192,1991,1143,317]],["BL_538.1",538,[243,259,1151,601]]]'>The Commonwealth Court maintained that the statutory language “including <em>but not limited to ” </em>(emphasis supplied) suggests a legislative intent to “exclude nothing”. <em>Aldine Apartments, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Pa.Cmwlth. 204, 208, <a href="/citations/?q=395%20A.2d%20299" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="395 A.2d 299">395 A.2d 299</a>, 302 (1978). The court concluded that utilities purchased by the landlord are taxable because, unlike utili<a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>ties purchased directly by residential users, they are not expressly excluded from the broad statutory language. This analysis is offensive to the legislative mandate that taxing statutes be strictly construed. The inclusion of property in a taxing statute must be express and cannot be inferred from a failure to exclude. <em>See Commonwealth v. Repplier Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/348/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="348 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="1220262" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0372-01">348 Pa. 372</a>, 380, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%20319" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="35 A.2d 319">35 A.2d 319</a>, 323 (1944) (“The words imposing the tax should be clear and unambiguous . . . nor can words be extended by implication”); <em>Commonwealth v. Allied Building Credits, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/385/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="385 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1267048" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0370-01">385 Pa. 370</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.2d%20686" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="123 A.2d 686">123 A.2d 686</a> (1956).</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[243,901,1149,378]]]'>The majority maintains that the last sentence of the definition which excludes utilities purchased by residential users implies a legislative intent to tax utilities purchased by a landlord. The majority erroneously infers an intent <em>to include </em>from an express intent <em>to exclude </em>a similar property. Such an inference is illogical and wholly ignores the legislative mandate of construing taxing statutes strictly.</p>
    <p id="b538-6" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[240,1318,1150,713]]]'>The majority also suggests that the position advanced in this dissent would render the last sentence of the definition “meaningless” since the utilities purchased directly are not included in the definition in the first place. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A., § 1921(a) (Supp.1964-1979) (“Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions”) The last sentence of the definition is not rendered “meaningless” but at most redundant. Further, the principle of giving effect to all statutory provisions is in direct conflict with the principle of strictly construing taxation statutes. When such conflict exists, the principle of giving effect to all statutory provisions must yield because it is stated in conditional terms — “if possible.”</p>
    <p id="b538-7" data-blocks='[["BL_538.6",538,[241,2071,1147,88]]]'>Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
