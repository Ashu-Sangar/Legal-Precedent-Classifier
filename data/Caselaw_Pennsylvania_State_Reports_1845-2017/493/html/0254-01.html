In fact, the examples which follow the definition are garden-variety “losses”: “damages, judgments, settlements and costs, cost of investigation and defense of legal actions ...” etc. The language of the policy does not require that an eccentric meaning be given to the word “loss”, and permitting the schopl district to recover the amount of the refunded taxes from the insurance company would disregard the plain and ordinary meaning rule set forth in <em>Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Association Insurance Co. v.

However, there is not a scintilla of evidence of bad faith on the part of the School District in entering into or attempting to enforce the insurance contract.

It would neither condone nor encourage bad faith abuse of insurance contracts for the plain reason that bad faith has not even been suggested here.
