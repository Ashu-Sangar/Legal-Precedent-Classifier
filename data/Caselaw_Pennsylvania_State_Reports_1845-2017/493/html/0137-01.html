Marshall Blank, appellee, her farm containing approximately seventy (70) acres in Unity Township, West-moreland County, for the sum of $15,000.00, of which $500.00 was paid prior to the execution of the agreement and the remaining balance of $14,500.00 no later than one year following the death of Ms. Frowen. Interest computed at the rate of five percent per annum was to be paid quarterly on the unpaid balance. The instant action was initiated by a complaint in equity filed November 29, 1973 by Blanche Frowen as plaintiff. This action resulted in a decree by the Chancellor which was affirmed by the Court <em>en banc, </em>with one judge dissenting,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> dismissing the complaint, holding that Ms. Frowen had failed to establish her burden of proof regarding the allegations of fraud.

The basic theory to establish the fraud allegation is that the decedent was deceived into believing that the agreement entered into on May 22, 1968 conveyed a leasehold interest to appellee and was not an outright sale. To support this view, appellant points to the age of decedent at the time of execution (eighty-six years of age); her infirmities at the time (impaired hearing); her limited formal training (two years of elementary training); and the agreement itself. It is argued that the payment of interest <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>on a quarterly basis, that the total consideration was $15,000 for a property worth approximately $35,000 at the time of the purported sale, that only $500 of the “purchase price” was required to be paid within her lifetime would comport to a lease agreement and not the sale of a fee interest.
