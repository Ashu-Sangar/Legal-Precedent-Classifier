Thus, they contend, seniority must date from the time judges take office, whether by gubernatorial appointment or election, rather than only from the time they are elected, as stated in § 17 of the Constitution of 1874.

Thus, petitioners argue that the same clear and unambiguous language would have been retained in the Constitution of 1968 if the intention had been to continue to disregard appointive service. They maintain since the new Constitution employed different words in Article 5, § 10(e), a change in the meaning of this provision was intended, and appointive service was meant to be considered in determining seniority under the Constitution of 1968.</p>

As the majority notes, there was a significant change in two respects from the language of the 1874 Constitution to that of the 1968 Constitution. The 1968 Constitution, Art. V, § 10(d), in no uncertain terms made the Chief Justice and president judges of courts with seven or less judges dependent upon the length of continuous service on the bench of the particular court. In keeping with this intention, the amendment altered “elected to office” to “assume office”, in order to insure that length of service, and seniority, would remain the determinative factor regardless of whether service began by appointment or election. It defies logic and common sense to reason that this change was unintentional or was meant to maintain the pre-1968 status quo. “A change in the language of a statute ordinarily indicates a change in legislative intent.” <em>Masland v.
