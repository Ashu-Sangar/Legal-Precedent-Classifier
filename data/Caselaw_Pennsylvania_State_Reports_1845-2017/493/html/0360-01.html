Following the dismissal of post-verdict motions, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the first degree murder conviction and to a concurrent term of two and one-half to five years imprisonment on the <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>weapons offense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In this direct appeal the sole claim advanced is directed to the asserted impropriety of the prosecutor’s closing statement.

It is contended by appellant, and we agree, that the record does not provide a basis for drawing such an inference.</p>

Mr. Morrow testified that appellant woke him at or about 3:00 or 3:30 a. m. on November 9, 1977 and told the witness that he, appellant, had just killed a man. Appellant, who appeared to be intoxicated, stated that three Puerto Ricans tried to rob him, that one of them slapped him and that he stabbed the person who had struck him. At first the witness dismissed the conversation as being fantasy. However, later during the day after receiving further information which established that a killing had in fact occurred, Mr. Morrow went to the police and reported what he had been told by appellant. After his arrest for this crime, appellant provided the police with the following version of the events.</p>

The fact that the inference drawn because of the nature of the killing might alone support a verdict of first degree murder does not provide a basis for concluding that the evidence was so overwhelming that the prejudice resulting from the error could not have influenced the factfinder’s judgment on that point. <em>See e. g. Commonwealth v. Story; supra. </em>Thus the judgment of sentence imposed upon the murder information must be reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>
    <p id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[214,1096,1144,577]]]'>However, a different result must be reached as to the conviction of the crime of possessing an instrument of crime generally. There was in this case overwhelming evidence to establish this offense. In addition to the various admissions by appellant of the use of the knife in the killing, the weapon was recovered from appellant’s residence after the killing. Under these circumstances, it cannot be concluded that the unavoidable effect of the improper argument tainted the jury’s judgment in reaching the verdict as to this charge. <em>See, Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth urges us not to accept jurisdiction of the non-homicide offense in view of the failure of appellant to appeal that judgment of sentence to the Superior Court. See 42 Pa. C.S.A. §§ 704(a) and 742. The bifurcation of the direct appeal responsibility in criminal cases that resulted from our former obligation to take initial appeals from convictions in homicide cases, 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 722 has now been rectified by recent legislation. 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 722, <em>as amended </em>September 23, 1980, Act No. 1980-137. Under prior practice we required an appeal of the non-homicide convictions to the Superior Court and the perfunctory certification of those appeals to this Court. The instant objection by the Commonwealth is premised upon the appellant’s failure in this instance to follow that procedure. Instead, appellant attempted to appeal both judgments of sentence to this Court.</p>
      <p id="b411-7" data-blocks='[["BL_411.7",411,[219,1895,1113,419]]]'>If we were to refuse to assume jurisdiction over the appeal from the non-homicide judgment of sentence, we would be required to refer it to the Superior Court for disposition. In view of the belated objection raised by the Commonwealth, considering also the fact that if the correct procedure had been followed we would have decided these matters together, and that our disposition of the appeal from the homicide conviction may cast doubt as to the disposition of the appeal from the non-homicide judgment of sentence (which we would ultimately be called upon to resolve), we are satisfied that judicial economy would be best served by assuming jurisdiction over the entire matter.</p>

We believe that this argument misses the mark. The issue is not whether the areas of inquiry were proper but rather whether the Commonwealth can use the implications arising from its questions to form a factual predicate for a theory where the responses to those questions refuted the suggested theory. Clearly, it is the response to the question that has evidentiary value not the question itself. <em>Phelin v.

The evidence introduced in the instant case discloses that: a) the victim was very slight of build and mentally retarded; b) both the victim and appellant were intoxicated; c) the victim showed some sort of picture to one of appellant’s friends; d) appellant’s friend then put his arm around the victim, who was not previously acquainted with appellant or his friend, and the two escorted the victim into the bushes; and e) appellant had recently separated from his girlfriend. From this evidence, it is quite reasonable to infer that appellant and his friend had sexual motives in taking the victim into the bushes and, as the trial court which heard and observed all of the witnesses in this case noted on page 3 of its opinion: “we do not think a pronouncement from Dr. Freud was required as a prerequisite to the reasonable assumption that some sort of homosexual activity was afoot.” It was, therefore, clearly permissible for the prosecutor to argue this theory to the jury in his closing remarks, <em>Commonwealth v. Tucker, <a href="/pa/461/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="461 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="483667" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0191-01">supra,</a> </em>and the trial court did not err in denying appellant's request for a mistrial.</p>

This was a heinous and brutal murder in which <em>the victim was stabbed 57 times. </em>The majority suggests that if the jury believed appellant’s contention that this merciless attack was provoked by a single <em>slap </em>in the face <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>(not a blow), it could have found that appellant did not possess a design to kill while inflicting 57 stab wounds. This suggestion is absurd. And, the majority’s conclusion that a reference to the possibility of homosexual activity by adults could have so inflamed the jury as to prevent them from giving objective consideration to appellant’s degree of guilt in stabbing a person more than 50 times, is even more ludicrous. In my opinion, as a matter of law, the type of attack involved here shows an intent to kill and, also as a matter of law, a mere slap in the face could not affect that conclusion. Therefore, the prosecutor’s remarks were clearly unrelated to the jury’s verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree, the majority’s imagined connection to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
