Pearce Holton died in 1931, leaving a will dated March 16, 1929, creating a number of trusts. One of the trusts, created by paragraph eleven of the will, was for the benefit of settlor’s son, Howard C. Holton, for his life. Upon the son’s death, trust income was to be paid to the son’s “children.” If the son died without “children,” the corpus of the trust was to be divided in two equal parts. <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>One-half of the corpus was to be made subject to a general, testamentary power of appointment in favor of the son. The other half was to be added to a residuary trust created by settlor under paragraph 14(c) of his will for the exclusive benefit of his natural grandchildren, appellees John M. Hol-ton, Jr., and Mary C. Holton.</p>

Following Howard Holton’s death in 1957, appellants sought to claim the benefits of the Paragraph 11 Trust. In 1960, this Court affirmed a decree of the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia which held that appellants were not “children” of Howard Holton for purposes of the trust. <em>Holton Estate, </em><a href="/pa/399/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="399 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1290566" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0241-01">399 Pa. 241</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20883" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="159 A.2d 883">159 A.2d 883</a> <em>(Holton I).</em>

This appellant, as well as appellant Henrietta D. Thomas, also claims entitlement under <em>Tafel </em>to the principal of that same portion of the Paragraph 14(c) Residuary Trust as of December 4, 1978, the date the Paragraph 11 Trust would have expired had appellants been deemed “children” in <em>Holton I.</em>

However, the Paragraph 11 Trust was terminated in 1960 and its corpus was distributed in accordance with court decree.
