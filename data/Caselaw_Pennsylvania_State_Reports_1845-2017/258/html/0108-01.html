A testator gave the residue of his estate to his executors as trustees and after disposing of all of his personal and one-third of his real estate, directed them to pay one-half of the income of two-thirds of his real estate to a son, and the remaining one-half to three daughters for their lives. The will further provided, “upon the conversion of any of my real estate into money as hereinafter mentioned, I direct the proceeds thereof shall be disposed of as follows......one-third part thereof shall be paid to my son...... absolutely......the said trustees or the survivors of them are hereby authorized to sell and convert all or part of my real estate into money at such time or times and in such parcels as they in their discretion may deem best for the advantage of my estate ......and......to make, execute and deliver......in fee simple good and sufficient conveyances for the same.” The son died after the testator leaving a -sGdow and children. A child of such son contended that the funds realized from sales of real estate should be treated as real estate and that one-third thereof should be awarded to the widow for her life only. The Orphans’ Court decided that the will worked a conversion of the real, estate and awarded one-third of the proceeds of the sale of the son’s share of the real estate to his widow absolutely. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

To effect gifts of proceeds, sales must at some time be made. The inevitable conclusion is that while the trustees are merely authorized by the will to sell, that authorization, because of the necessity to sell to carry out the scheme of the will is equivalent to a positive direction to sell.</p>

She does not devise her real estate, but empowers her executrix to sell without any alternative disposition of it. It is not given as real estate to the persons named in the will, nor to any other person for any purpose whatever, but, in the language of the instrument, ‘the proceeds of the sale of the said premises I direct my said executrix to divide among my said three daughters share and share alike.’ We, therefore, have in the will an authority given to the executrix to sell and a direction to divide the proceeds of the sale in equal shares among the three legatees. In order to carry out the provisions of the will and make that distribution of the proceeds of the property, a sale of the real estate becomes imperative and is an absolute necessity. This, as appears from the authorities cited above, meets the requirements of our cases and operates as an equitable conversion. The fact that the time when, and the terms upon which, the sale should be made are discretionary with the executrix does not give the latter authority to prevent a sale, nor to postpone it indefinitely. The discretion reposed in the executrix is a reasonable and not an arbitrary one, and must be exercised to carry out the plain intention of the testatrix that the property shall be converted into per<a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>sonalty and the proceeds distributed equally among the three sisters.”</p>
