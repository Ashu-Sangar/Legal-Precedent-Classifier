Defendant agreed to pay for completing said work in accordance with the plans and specifications $48,980.59. On the proposal was a notice “bidders will fill in the cost per foot or yard of each item as indicated on the above blank, carrying out the total cost of such items and add. the bid, showing total cost of work, according to their proposal.” It was also provided “all work and materials to be paid for shall be measured by the engineer and his assistants according to the plans and specifications and the lines given on the ground.” Plaintiff contended that the city was liable for the total sum of $48,980.59. The court charged that defendant was liable not for the total amount but for the aggregate actual measurements at the prices specified. <em>Held, </em>plaintiff’s proposal was a part of the contract, the charge of the court wag proper and a verdict in accordance therewith was sustained.</p>
