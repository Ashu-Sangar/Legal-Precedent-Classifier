      <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>As to the second point, the evidence Avas that, after the engineers had severed their connection Avith the building operations, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a modification of the contract as originally made, or made a new or supplemental contract. By the new arrangement, the plaintiff was to furnish a kind of gravel, or granite grit, different from that specified in the contract, and the defendant was to furnish a certain ingredient to mix with that gravel to be used as a hardener. The plaintiff claimed that the defective condition of the floors resulted from the use of the hardener and the manner in which the floors were laid; that the floors were laid under the supervision of another agent of the defendant, Mr. Darrow, and the plaintiff was required to lay them as he directed. The defendant contended that the plaintiff did not use the kind of substance exhibited as “M,” as agreed, but did use a different substance, exhibited as “N,” and that it was by reason of the use of the latter substance that the defective condition of the floors resulted. This was the issue on this subject, and we affirmed plaintiff’s second point, because we believed that if the jury found that the defective condition of the floors resulted from the substance furnished by the defendant and from the direction by the defendant of the manner of their laying,* then the plaintiff would be in no way responsible, for the defective condition of the floors was the result of what the defendant furnished and directed done, and not on account of what the plaintiff furnished and did, that then the plaintiff could not and ought not to be held responsible therefor. This was purely a question of fact for the jury, and the point was properly answered and put and fully warranted under the evidence.</p>

It is sufficient to say upon this subject that the parties submitted their cause to this forum by a general appearance and trial offithe case, without demurring, or taking any other steps to question or-oust the jurisdiction.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b253-8" data-blocks='[["BL_253.8",253,[156,1275,1151,803]]]'>There was no time set in the contract when the building was required to be completed. The contract didj however, set forth in Article Y that if the contractor failed to prosecute the work with promptness and diligence, such refusal, neglect, or failure, being certified by the engineers, the owner should be at liberty, after five days written notice, to provide such labor and materials, and to deduct the cost from the money due. thereafter, and proceed with the work at once. This being the remedy provided in the contract for expediting the work, we are of the opinion that this remedy would first have to be exhausted, and there being no evidence in the case that defendant availed itself or attempted to avail itself of this provision of the contract,- we are 'of the opinion that it could not recover damages for delay.</p>

The contract provided in Article I that the plaintiff, under the direction of, and to the satisfaction of the owner, as expressed by Irvin and Witherow, engineers, acting for the <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>purpose of the contract as the agents of the owner, was to perform the contract. The undisputed evidence was that the whole of the work done by the plaintiff, except the laying of the floors, was done under the direction of, and to the satisfaction - of the owner, as expressed by Irvin and Witherow, the engineers,- and it being expressly provided in the contract that they were the agents of the defendant, we held that the defendant could not recover damages from the plaintiff for doing the work as it had directed the plaintiff to do it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[285,842,1145,152]]]'>The fifth reason for a new trial was our holding the plaintiff could recover without a final certificate, and our reasons for so holding are in part given above.</p>

To this we cannot accede as a legal proposition. But even if this final certificate was required and the defendant could have relied upon the fact it was not given, still it is conceded that had this certificate been withheld by fraud or for any other wrongful reason, then suit might have been brought to recover without it. Now the undisputed evidence on this subject is that long prior to the bringing of the suit, the engineers, named in the contract, had withdrawn from the job;''that there had never been any other engineers appointed in their place, and of this fact both parties were cognizant, so it is clear that there was no engineer to whom the plaintiff could go to obtain such certificate, and, as the law does not require a party <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>to do useless or attempt impossible and unnecessary things, we could see no reason why the plaintiff should be required in this case to make an attempt to procure a certificate from engineers who did not exist, that the plaintiff knew did not exist, and that the defendant knew did not exist prior to the bringing of the action.</p>

In other words, the' only question was, did the plaintiff perform the work as Irvin &amp; Witherow <em>directed; </em>if it did, that ended it; if it did not, then the defendant could prove noncompliance with the specifications, but as Mr. Irvin testified,</p>

That is, when a contract specifies that work is to be done in a certain way and the owner reserves the right for his designated agent to stand by and direct it to be done in another way: If his designated agent does stand by and see it done, or changes it, and it afterwards appears that the construction was wrongly or defectively done, he cannot be held to say that he has been damaged.

The offers were all to prove faulty construction, and construction not according to the plans and specifications,, which, if true, Avould be the act, or at least the result of the act, of the defendant’s agents, and hence defendant could not claim that it had been damaged thereby. It will be observed in this connection that we did permit the defendant to prove its damage on account of the board marks not being removed, and we did this because there Avas no evidence to show when the frames were removed, which caused the marks, and therefore they might have been removed after Irvin and Witherow severed their connection with the work, but this branch of the case was clearly for the jury, and they having decided it, we cannot' now interfere.</p>
