Not only the bill and the relief sought fail to point out Carolyne Streit Rothert’s liability, but the parties themselves after the decree of the court had been entered apparently recognized that the liability was confined to the George F.

Saupp, Sr., in presenting a petition for the appointment of a receiver sets forth “That counsel for the respective parties in this suit by stipulation filed on <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>the 1st day of March, 1909, agreed that on August 5, 1905, Francis I).

Would the Central Trust Company, a trustee appointed long after the indebtedness was incurred, but a defendant, be also held liable with Carolyne Streit Rothert? Such an intention is inconceivable.
