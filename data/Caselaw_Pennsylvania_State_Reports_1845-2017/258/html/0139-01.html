In other words, the court could not enter a judgment against a dead man, in a case like the <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>present, when, under its own rules, had the latter lived, he might have added to his defense.</p>

Hocker, 1 Miles (Pa.) 263, this point is discussed. We there say that the rule just stated is “indispensable to protect interests that would be otherwise defenseless, and to afford security to creditors, distributees and heirs”; and we add, “A dead man’s estate would be in utter peril, if a creditor could convert his demand into a judgment upon no proof other than the statement of his claim filed at the commencement of his suit.” It is to be noted that Leibert v. Hocker, cited in the case just reviewed, was an action against the executors of an endorser of a promissory note, and that it was there held an affidavit of defense was not required.
