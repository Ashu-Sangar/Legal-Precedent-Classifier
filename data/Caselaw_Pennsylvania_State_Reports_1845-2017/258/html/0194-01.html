For the injuries sustained this action was brought, in which, after plaintiff had closed his case, a compulsory nonsuit was entered. Nothing in the testimony could have justified a finding by the jury that the starting of the colliding car down the incline was due to any negligence of the defendant. If the question of its negligence had been submitted to the jury, there would have been, as the court properly held, an invitation to them to guess as to the cause of the accident, and to infer negligence against the employer from the mere fact of its happening. For this reason the case was not for them: Snodgrass v.
