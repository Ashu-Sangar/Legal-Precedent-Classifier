Ford’s .duty was in part to signal to the engineer the manner in which the trip was to be hoisted or lowered. This signal was given from an electric push button hanging from a wire and situated about three or four feet from the rail, and between the slope and a lift <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>or branch. The lifts are openings that ran off from the slope and vary in dimensions. The place where Ford was killed was several hundred feet from the bottom of the slope. Two cars were being lowered from the top of the slope by means of a rope. In some manner the lower car became separated from the car attached to the rope and ran down the slope, jumping the track a few feet above the point where Ford was attempting to ring the bell to signal the engineer to slack up on the trip, striking him and causing his death.</p>

    <p id="b157-7" data-blocks='[["BL_157.13",157,[146,1565,1153,635]]]'>It appears from the testimony in this case that in other mines, and in other parts of appellant’s mine, the signal to hoist or lower cars was located in a safety hole. If the deceased had been in such a hole when he was attempting to ring the bell to signal the engineer, he could not have been struck by the car which ran down the slope and jumped the track. Whether the defendant’s failure to provide a safety hole where the deceased was working, was negligence, was properly regarded by the learned trial judge as a question of fact for the jury. It was the only question in the case, and judgment on the verdict is affirmed.</p>
