Plaintiff was superintendent of the Department of Public Safety, but there was no allegation that the alleged slanderous words referred to him in such capacity.

While the affidavit to hold to bail, made by the plaintiff, set forth that he was the superintendent of the Department of Public Safety of the City of Hazleton, such averment was omitted from his statement of his cause of action. It follows that in determining the legal import of the words constituting the cause of action, their sense must be confined to their application to the plaintiff as a private citizen.

By no sound reasoning can it be inferred as claimed by plaintiffs counsel when the motion for non-suit was being argued, that the defendant charged the plaintiff with fornication. Nor is any other criminal offense more clearly ascribed. Concede that upon every citizen there is imposed the moral obligation of exercising his influence for good, in his community, it does not result that his failure so to do makes him liable to indictment.</p>
