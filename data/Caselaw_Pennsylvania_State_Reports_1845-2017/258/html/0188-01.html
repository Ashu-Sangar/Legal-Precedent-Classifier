The contract provided that on the first day of every month estimates should be made by the architect of the work done on the building and on the same day the amount of said estimate, less ten per cent., should be paid the contractor. ,Au estimate was made with which plaintifE was not satisfied, and he thereafter notified defendant that he would not prosecute the work until upon a re-estimate he was paid what was due him. After the re-estimate was made defendant did not pay what was due plaintifE thereunder, but finished the work at his own expense. <em>Held, </em>the court properly submitted to the jury the question whether plaintiff had abandoned the contract by refusing to proceed until he was paid, and a verdict for plaintifE was sustained.</p>

If so, this being an entire contract, I would instruct you that Mr. Hack could not recover. But if it was only a notice that he would cease work pending the determination of the estimate, then we would say to you that after Mr. Shovlin ! got the estimate on the 7th of January, it is our opinion that he would be liable for its amount and having himself forfeited the contract afterward by the letter of the 8th of January, he could not recover for anything that he afterward spent in the erection of the building, and could only recover in the way of set-off the amount that he may have had to spend for work that was not properly done while the contractor was in possession.”</p>
