    <p id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.12",476,[233,907,1148,1296]]]'>In. an altercation between Italian laborers on the evening of September 25, 1916, at Kulpmont, Northumberland County, one Feremento Manella was shot and killed. For this crime defendant and Frank Christianna were indicted jointly but tried separately. The latter’s case being called first resulted in an acquittal, then defendant’s trial proceeded and thereat three eye witnesses testified that they saw defendant shoot and kill the deceased, while five others for defendant testified that Christianna fired the fatal shot. Defendant fled and was later arrested or surrendered to the officers at Scranton. Several shots were exchanged at the time of the homicide, one of which defendant admitted but stated that it was after the deceased had fallen and not in his direction. The crime seems to have been committed with a thirty-eight calibre revolver, and defendant admitted his was of that calibre, and that he threw it away after the occurrence. The Commonwealth did not contend that the defendant and Christianna were acting in concert, so the real question was as to which did the shooting, and it was admitted that each used his revolver during the trouble. Defendant is the appellant here, as the jury found him guilty of murder in the second degree, on which he was duly sentenced. We find nothing to justify a reversal.</p>
    <p id="b476-8" data-blocks='[["BL_476.13",476,[235,2215,1145,152]],["BL_477.1",477,[159,304,1147,144]]]'>Defendant submitted two requests on the question of reasonable doubt, both of which were affirmed; and in the general charge the trial judge stated that, “The de<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>fendant is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt fairly arising out of the testimony.” One of the requests was:</p>

Answer. That is affirmed. It is the duty of the Commonwealth in all criminal cases to'prove the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, and in this case it is the duty of the Commonwealth to prove every ingredient of the crime beyond a. reasonable doubt. Any reasonable doubt, fairly arising out of the testimony, is the property of the defendant and you must give him the benefit of it.”</p>
    <p id="b477-4" data-blocks='[["BL_477.6",477,[155,1015,1150,1026]]]'>Later the judge asked defendant’s counsel if there was anything else he wished the court to say to the jury; to which counsel replied, “Nothing, your Honor.” While it is the duty of the court in a capital case to define the meaning of the words “reasonable doubt,” yet in view of What took place hére we cannot convict the court of error in that regard.
