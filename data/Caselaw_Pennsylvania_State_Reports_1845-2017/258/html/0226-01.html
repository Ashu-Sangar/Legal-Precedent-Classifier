While there he determined to return home, and joined with him, as a companion, one Jasper Fletcher. Before starting he procured for the latter a 15 Colt revolver in which lead bullets were used. For himself he purchased a new Colt automatic revolver, and steel jacketed bullets. At that time he declared his purpose to see that no “bull” would get him on his road home. They left Jersey City by freight, finally reaching Highspire. From that point they went by foot to Harrisburg, and thence across the bridge to the Cumberland County side and to the tracks of the Northern Central Railroad. Proceeding to the north, a tramp was met, who told them of being driven off the track, and that if they went on they would be arrested. The defendant used a coarse expression in regard to the “bulls,” but proceeded. At that time the officers were not in sight. Miller then put back his cap, removed his revolver from his right pocket—he was left handed—took it into his left hand, and there held it <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>under the apron of the overalls he was wearing. Thus prepared, he continued on his way until in sight of the officers. Beisser came from the third to the second track in front of Miller, and when from fifteen to twenty feet away called “where are you going” ? In answer, Miller pulled the prepared revolver, and shot, saying “that is where I am going.” When the officer was falling he shot him a second time, and then shot the second officer who was on the track above. From the evidence, the jury was clearly justified in finding, as it did, that no other words had passed, and that no attempt had been made by Beisser to either arrest or assault the defendant. After falling, Beisser turned on his side, pulled out his revolver, and shot after the fleeing defendant, until he fell back dead. Miller was captured about one-half mile from the scene of the occurrence. In the meantime he had disposed in some way of his revolver. His companion, Fletcher, who had run at the first shot, was likewise found. He had thrown his revolver into the river. It was found with no bullets exploded. Those in his gun were lead, while Miller used steel jacketed ones, the same as found in the body of Beisser and the leg of Chubb. There was practically no contradiction of any of the facts above narrated. Miller himself did not take, the stand.</p>

The evidence to support even a suspicion of the same was far from convincing. The mother testified to various acts of badness during the youth of the defendant, and gave it as her opinion that he was insane. And a Doctor Jenkins, keeper of a reformatory in which Miller was confined, from the age of twelve to fourteen, gave a like opinion. Doctor Johnston, a colored physician of Charleston, South Carolina, and the family doctor, gave it as his opinion that the defendant was suffering from dementia prsecox, and that he could not distinguish between right and wrong when “he had an expansive moment.” He had not seen the defendant for three years before the trial, nor had <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>the mother seen him for months, or Dr. Jenkins for years. The mental condition was described as hereditary, and' evidence was offered to show that the grandfather became insane at 66, and .that a brother was confined in an asylum. The mother and the doctor stated that as a boy Miller was afraid of things without cause. From this the jury was asked to find that he was insane when he shot Beisser, and that he was suffering from some indefinite delusion when he so acted.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="A6-" data-blocks='[["BL_261.6",261,[157,1123,1159,701]]]'>The expert for the defendant declared that he, Miller, could distinguish between right and wrong, except during an “expansive moment,” but that such a mental condition was existing' when the killing occurred was absolutely without support in the evidence. Though •this was the view of the court when the case was tried,, and still is, yet every possible instruction which could be of benefit to the defendant was given. In answer to the points on delusion, the jury was permitted to find such, from the evidence, if they could, though the court would have been fully justified under the, authorities in withdrawing. the matter entirely from its consideration: Commonwealth v. Henderson, <a href="/pa/242/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="242 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="998838" data-case-paths="/pa/242/0372-01">242 Pa. 372</a>.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.8",261,[158,2216,1150,156]],["BL_262.1",262,[256,303,1148,1131]]]'>-Complaint is made of the answers to points 3, 11, 12 and 16 presented by the defendant.

All four were based on the assumption that the evidence justified a finding that the defendant was acting under some delusion that he was in fear of death or great bodily harm. There was nothing in the evidence to justify such a conclusion, though it was left to the jury. The court would have been fully justified in refusing the points: Commonwealth v. Henderson, <a href="/pa/242/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="242 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="998838" data-case-paths="/pa/242/0372-01">242 Pa. 372</a>; Commonwealth v.

Any assumption of delusion would necessarily have been drawn from the proof that Miller as a child was needlessly afraid of things. The testimony as to this covered a period, years before the killing. Not a word to show impaired mental condition was offered for a period more than three years before, while the testimony of the acts and conduct of Miller immediately before and at the time of the killing showed him to be fully conscious of his actions and surroundings. In the answers to the points complained of the defendant received more favorable treatment than he had the right to demand.</p>

So that the jury might not get the impression from so doing, that the fact that the weapon was deadly could not be considered by them, we stated that from its use the intention may be inferred. This, in connection with the remainder of the point affirmed, was an introduction [instruction] that it should be considered with all the circumstances of the case in determining the intent. We do not think the jury could have misunderstood this. Later in the charge the weight to be given to the fact that the weapon was deadly was carefully defined. “When death ensues from the use of a deadly weapon, the jury must scan closely the conduct of both parties, taking into consideration the character of the weapon, the manner of its use, and the time of its use, the place of its use, and the circumstances attending it, and by a careful survey of the evidence the jury must endeavor to arrive at the true <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>cause which prompted the fatal shot or shots.” And further, in the next paragraph we said: “Again, gentlemen of the jury, the nature of the weapon and the place and character of the wounds are important and should be considered by you. Was the weapon a deadly weapon? The deadliness of the weapon, gentlemen, tends to indi-' cate the intention with which it is used. The place or places where the wound or wounds are inflicted tend also to throw light on the intention with which the shots were fired.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b263-4" data-blocks='[["BL_263.6",263,[140,1233,1151,482]]]'>The eighteenth point was affirmed as stated. The wording of the same was to the mind of the court confusing.

Nor do we see anything prejudicial to the defendant in the rulings upon the evidence. But one point therein is worthy of mention. The defendant used a 45-calibre automatic Colt revolver, but threw the same away in some concealed place after the killing. A duplicate was produced, which was identified by Fletcher as in all respects the same as carried by Miller. This fac-simile was offered in evidence so that the jury might consider the character of weapon used, which they had the right to do in connection with the other evidence in the case, in passing upon the question of intent. The duplicate having been proven to be identical, the admission was proper. “In any case where the nature and properties of an article' require consideration by the jury, it is proper to submit a duplicate or fac-simile conveying a correct impression”: 17 Cyc. 293; Commonwealth v.

The conclusion of the presence of an intent to kill from all the circumstances was justified. The deliberation and premeditation appeared in the preparation of the gun for use before the deceased was in sight, but after Miller was notified that he was farther up the track. The shooting was without provocation, and the jury properly took into consideration that after the first shot had taken effect, and the deceased was falling, he shot again: Commonwealth v.
