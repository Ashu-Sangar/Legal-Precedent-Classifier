A city of the third class passed an ordinance requiring an annual inspection and supervision of conduits of gas companies occupying the public streets of the city, and imposed an annual license fee therefor of $30 per mile of such pipe.

It appeared that no regular inspection was made in behalf of the city other than what the police, fire, engineering and street departments did in the performance of their other duties, and that no extra expenses were incurred for such inspection; and that the actual cost to the city for such inspection and regulation of the mains and conduit's of the petitioner did not exceed $7.50 per mile. <em>Held, </em>the lower court did not err in declaring the amount fixed in the ordinance to be excessive and that $7.50 per mile be fixed as the annual 'fee to be collected by the city from the petitioner.</p>
