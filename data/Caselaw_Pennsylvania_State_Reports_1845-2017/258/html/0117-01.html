By this assignment, William and Isabella B.

It was to secure the estate to their three children in equal shares, subject to certain life payments which they reserved to themselves. It was to give up their former rights in the leases and the coal and substitute therefor other rights specified in the assignment, to-wit, on the part of William, to substitute for his interest which was entire and absolute, a yearly cash payment of three hundred dollars a year; on the part of his wife, to substitute for her interest, whether dower or such as the intestate laAvs gave her in her husband’s personal estate, a cash payment of one-fourth the royalty during his life after his three hundred dollars ■was deducted, and one-third after his death. The trustee was to pay money, and when they directed the trustee, after the death of William, “to pay to the said Isabella B. Hancock such amount as she would be entitled to receive under the intestate laws of the Commonwealth <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>of Pennsylvania as widow of the said William Hancock,” they meant “such amount” of money. It was a rather clumsy method of measuring the amount of money to be paid, to-wit, one-third. They did not mean that the trustee was to convey a one-third or other interest in the estate to the widow. This was the interpretation of the language put upon it by the widow, for she accepted the one-third of the royalty in cash and made no demand for a conveyance of an interest in the leases or the coal.</p>

If Isabella had died first, William would have continued to receive three hundred dollars a year, nor could he have conveyed any interest by deed or will. William derived his estate by descent from his father. If his interest in the coal after it was leased was real estate his wife had a dower interest which could only be released by her own act, but which she released when she. executed the assignment. If his interest was personalty he could convey it without any act on her part and did convey it when he executed the assignment. The conveyance was absolute during the term of the trust which was coterminous with the life of the survivor.
