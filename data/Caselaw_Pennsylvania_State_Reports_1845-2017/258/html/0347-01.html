Certain real estate was held by a trust company in trust for a land company. The land company had agreed to sell the property, and the vendee had arranged for the construction of houses thereon, Before the completion of the houses, the vendee absconded and the land company declared the contract forfeited under a clause of the contract authorizing such action. Thereafter, at the request of the land company and upon assurance that he would receive payment in full, the builder completed the houses. Upon advice of counsel, he waived his right to file mechanic’s liens, and the land company caused the property to be conveyed to a straw man, who executed a declaration providing that he held the property in trust to pay certain debts and out of the balance the following should “pro-rate” according to the “amounts or sums” named: the builder, “$3,205; Lyman Felheim, $125; brickwork and brick, $250; Andrews Land Company, for bills paid, $175.” The builder received $1,63.5 from a mortgage which had been raised upon the property by the straw man, which represented his pro rata share of the proceeds "in accordance with the declaration of trust. Thereafter the builder petitioned the court for a sale of the property, alleging that the premises were conveyed to the straw man, in trust, to pay plaintiff in full for his work, and not for the purposes set forth in the written declaration, which petitioner attempted to repudiate as having been made without his knowledge. There was no proof of <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>fraud by the straw man or those associated with him in procuring the conveyance. Plaintiff made no offer to return the money which he had received under the declaration of trust. The lower court awarded the relief prayed for. <em>Held, </em>that, as plaintiff had accepted and retained benefits under the written declaration of trust, he must take the provisions contained therein cum onere, and that if he did not abide by the declaration of trust the statute of frauds denied him the right to set up a parol trust in conflict therewith.</p>

Brown contracted with the plaintiff, Fred Jourdan, a carpenter, and with other mechanics, for the construction of houses upon two of the lots, plaintiff agreeing to do his part of the work for $2,950. Subsequently Brown borrowed a considerable sum of money from the trust company, and shortly thereafter absconded, the buildings being then unfinished, the lots unpaid for, and the contractors, including plaintiff, not paid in full for their labor and material. The land company declared the contract of purchase forfeited; and two of its representatives held conferences with the' plaintiff, in which they urged him to proceed with his work, holding out promises that, if the houses were completed, he would receive payment in full. Jourdan and the other contractors finished the houses, at an expense to the former of $3,205. On or about December 15,1912, at the suggestion of W. J. Young, Esquire, an attorney who-had been retained by plaintiff, the latter signed and delivered a waiver of the right to file mechanic’s liens. The next day, the trust company, under instructions from the land company, deeded the three lots to one James A. Andrews, for a nominal consideration. Prior to this time, Mr. Andrews does not appear to have taken any active part in the transactions with which we are dealing. Immediately upon delivery of' the deed, the <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>grantee mortgaged the two improved properties for $1,-750 each, thus obtaining $3,500. December 17,1912, Andrews executed a written declaration of trust, drawn by plaintiff’s attorney, Mr. Young, which recites that builders, materialmen and the land company are all “interested” in this real estate. Therein he declared that the three properties in question were held by him to pay, out of the money realized therefrom, the unpaid purchase-price due the land company and certain enumerated bills which had accumulated for work already done upon the unfinished houses, totaling $1,583.53. Next, he declared that, “out of any additional mortgage money or purchase-price for said lots,” the following should “pro-rate” according to the “amounts or sums” named: Fred Jourdan, “builder,” $3,205; Lyman Felheim, $125; “brickwork and brick,” $250; Andrews Land Company, “for bills paid,” $175. Finally, the declaration states that the trustee is vested with authority either to sell or mortgage the properties therein referred to. Plaintiff received and accepted $1,635 from the $3,-500 mortgage fund raised by Mr. Andrews, which represents his proportionate share thereof in accordance with the terms of the declaration; this money was first paid to Mr. Jourdan’s attorney, and then turned over by the latter to his client, who accepted the amount without comment other than, “Is that all,” and, “This looks to be a bad deal.” A day or so after receiving his proportion of the fund, Mr. Jourdan asked his attorney whether the latter did not think he ought to have some kind of a paper to show his interest in the mortgaged premises; whereupon Mr. Young delivered to him a copy of the Andrews declaration of trust, which, so far as the evidence shows, he. accepted without comment. On April 24, 1915, however, Mr. Jourdan presented a petition to the court below for a sale of the properties here in controversy, and therein he averred that the premises were conveyed to Andrews, in trust, to pay him, the plaintiff, in fall for his work, and not for the pur<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>poses set forth in the written declaration, which latter document the petitioner attempted to repudiate as having been made without his knowledge or consent. He prayed that the court should order an account to be filed by the trustee, after the sale occurred, and that this should be referred to an auditor to make distribution of the fund and adjudge the rights of the claimants thereon. It was so ordered; whereupon the premises were exposed at public vendue, and purchased by plaintiff for '$5,400, payable by the assumption of the mortgages, amounting to $8,500, with interest from June 1, 1915, and the balance in cash. The trustee filed an account, and, on July 6,1915, the court-below referred the same to an auditor, who found the material facts as we have recited them.</p>
    <p id="b383-3" data-blocks='[["BL_383.5",383,[123,1128,1154,803]]]'>The auditor concluded that, after plaintiff waived his right to file mechanic’s liens, under the law, he was not in a position to claim any special interest in the properties subsequently placed in trust; that the land company “had a perfect right to direct” the conveyance to Andrews, and plaintiff could not set up a parol trust for himself contrary to the written declaration made by the former; finally, that the assurances given plaintiff by the representatives of the land company, that he should be paid in full, could have no further effect than to confer upon him a possible right of action against that company or the members thereof who made the promises in question. After stating these conclusions, the auditor directed distribution of the fund in accordance with the provisions of the written declaration of trust.</p>

L. 532, haS no application.” In support of this conclusion, the court below states the following reason: “The defendant himself alleges a trust and admits that he holds the land for the benefit of others,” therefore it is not “necessary to find either fraud or resort to the finding that he is a trustee ex maleficio” (citing Hamnett v. Monongahela Trust Company, <a href="/pa/223/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="223 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="960954" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0247-01">223 Pa. 247</a>). The report was sent back to the auditor, with this direction as to the latter’s duty: “We are......of opinion that the plaintiff, Fred Jourdan, is entitled1 to recover out of the fund arising from the sale of the houses payment in full for expenditures made after Brown absconded, before any other creditor is permitted to participate in said fund, and that he is entitled to pro-rate with the other creditors on his claim for expenditures made before.” The auditor found accordingly, and his report was duly approved; whereupon the trustee appealed.</p>
    <p id="b384-6" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[267,1500,1147,863]]]'>It may readily be seen that, if the court below is right as to' the law governing this case, the distributive share of the plaintiff will be largely increased, while that of the other creditors will be proportionately reduced ; hence, the trustee is fully justified in taking this appeal. There is not much disagreement concerning the material facts; but, as already indicated, there exists a wide divergence of opinion upon the controlling rules of law. The appellant contends that the restrictive provisions of the Act of 1856, supra, control and that thereunder the legal conclusions of the auditor are not only right, but inevitable. While we appreciate the desire of the court below to work out what it conceived to be the equities of this case, yet the Pennsylvania statute of frauds, and applicable principles of láw, impel us to sustain the appellant’s contentions.</p>

It is contended, however, that, notwithstanding plaintiff’s attorney drew this declaration, and the former accepted $1,635 paid in accordance therewith, yet he is not bound thereby, since no express notice of its provisions was brought home to him, personally; but an amply sufficient answer to this contention is: there being no evidence adequate to raise a trust ex maleficio, plaintiff had to plead and now has to stand upon the written declaration in order to show any trust at all; under such circumstances, he cannot be permitted to cling to the instrument with one hand while he assails it with the other (Eyrick &amp; Deppen v. Hetrick, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Pa.%20487" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="13 Pa. 487">13 Pa. 487</a>, 493). Moreover, plaintiff makes no direct assault upon the integrity of his attorney, nor does he deny retaining him, and Mr. Young testified that he “was in touch” with his client “as to all agreements and negotiations in reference to his [the latter’s] claim”; but, be this as it may, since Mr. Jour dan, as already stated, accepted and retains benefits received under the written declaration, and has no position as a cestui que trust without its aid, he must take the provisions contained therein cum onere: Mundorff v. Wickersham, <a href="/pa/63/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="63 Pa. 87" data-case-ids="1019029" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0087-01">63 Pa. 87</a>, 89; Crans &amp; Van Duzer v. Hunter et al., <a href="/ny/28/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="28 N.Y. 389" data-case-ids="2036827" data-case-paths="/ny/28/0389-01">28 N. Y. 389</a>. In brief, on the material facts involved, the case comes to this: if plaintiff does not abide by the written declaration, then the statute of frauds denies him the right to set up a parol trust in conflict therewith; and this is true even though at the time of its execution he was not personally informed as to the exact terms of the document now under attack. Therefore, we think the learned trial .court put undue significance upon the alleged lack of notice.</p>

Monongahela Trust Company, 223 Pal 247, cited by plaintiff and relied upon by the court below, is not a controlling authority in the present instance.
