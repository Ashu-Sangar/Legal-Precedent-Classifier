John Wurst’s farm is situated on that side of the highway, and his farm buildings are about one-fourth of a mile north of Kearsarge. His driveway extends easterly along the south side of the buildings, and to reach the highway passes over the-railway by a right angle grade crossing. There is an orchard back of the buildings where picnics are held, called “Orchard grove picnic ground.” And this driveway is used for farm purposes and also to reach the picnic ground.</p>

He probably intended to drive to the orchard where a picnic was being held. The wagon was open, except a top over the seat. The track was straight, and, as he turned to cross it, he had an unobstructed view to the south for at least a quarter of a mile. The day was fair and there was no other person near the crossing and nothing to distract his attention from the approaching car, the sound of which was heard by persons about the farm buildings. The evidence tended to show that no gong was sounded or other warning given of the approach of the car. A young girl who saw the car said it was going pretty fast, and it ran eighty-seven feet after the collision. No witness was called who saw the accident.</p>

The deceased had a clear and unobstructed view to the south for a quarter of a mile, and, by a glance in that direction as the horse neared the crossing, would have seen the approaching car, which was so near that he was struck by it before he had gone fifteen feet.

As the deceased approached the crossing the car was in full view; if he did not see it he was negligent, if he did see it and attempted to drive in front of the car he was equally so, for he who attempts to drive across the track when a car is approaching in dangerous proximity to the crossing assumes the risk of so doing. One may cross the <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>track in advance of an approaching car if apparently he has ample time to do so. But the theory that the deceased was justified in making that attempt here is not tenable; for he was struck almost immediately after passing the point where he should have looked, in fact so soon that the wagon was left on that side of the track. See Weber v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., <a href="/pa/256/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="256 Pa. 595" data-case-ids="1030710" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0595-01">256 Pa. 595</a>; Hicks v.

Superior Ct. 174</a>. This was not the case of a diagonal crossing, or where the driver had to pass over several tracks and was misled by the unlawful speed' of the approaching car.

The top over the driver’s seat did not excuse his failure to look; and as the horse and wagon turned to the west he could have looked south and it was his duty to do’ so, even if he had to lean forward in his seat: Pieper v. Union Traction Co., <a href="/pa/202/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="202 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="992304" data-case-paths="/pa/202/0100-01">202 Pa. 100</a>; Wheelahan v. Phila.

This was a place requiring care on both sides and neither was bound to anticipate that the other would be negligent.

While the deceased knew he was about to turn into the driveway, the motorman had no such advance notice. As the deceased’s contributory negligence was fatal to plaintiff’s case it is not necessary to decide whether there was evidence of defendant’s negligence sufficient to justify the submission of that question to the jury. The case of King v. Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler &amp; New Castle Ry.

There plaintiff had a heavily loaded wagon and took every precaution, by stopping, listening and sending his son forward, to ascertain if the tracks were clear, and could obtain a view of only from four to six hundred feet, and the hind end of his wagon as it passed over the second rail was struck by a rapidly moving car.</p>
