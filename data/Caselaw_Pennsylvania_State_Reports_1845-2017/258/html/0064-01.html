And in that respect we see no controlling difference between the sale of a turnpike road and that of other property. In this case it is the abandonment of the turnpike road and not of the franchise that under the proviso in the original deed gives rise to the reversion. In West Philadelphia Pass. Ry. Co. v. Philadelphia &amp; West Chester Turnpike Road Co., <a href="/pa/186/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="186 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="989680" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0459-01">186 Pa. 459</a>, the defendant having the right to'maintain and operate a street railway in the western end of Market street, Philadelphia, expressly and by statutory authority, released to the city all its rights, privileges, franchises, etc., in said street; and over twenty years later attempted to build a <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>street railway therein, but was enjoined on the ground that defendant had relinquished and in fact abandoned all its rights in the street. However, the question whether a sale of property constitutes an abandonment was not before the court in that case. In Black v. Elkhorn Mining Co., <a href="/us/163/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="163 U.S. 445" data-case-ids="468261" data-case-paths="/us/163/0445-01">163 U. S. 445</a>, a locator of an undi-' vided interest in a mining claim, who had neither bought nor paid for the same, sold his .interest and left the property. And it is there held that he had no such vested interest in the mining claim, as, after his death, would entitle his widow, who had not joined in such sale, to a dower interest therein. The locator is there referred to aSthaving abandoned his claim, but the question as to the sale of the property constituting an abandonment was not necessarily involved in the decision of the case. A grant is in general construed against the grantor; and here the rights of the parties were fixed by the deed to the turnpike company and were not affected by the stipulations in the later deed to Levi Horst. As the former deed was to the turnpike company, its successors and assigns, the company was within its rights in making the sale to the Commonwealth. There is nothing to justify the conclusion that a sale of the turnpike road caused a forfeiture of the title to the half acre; nor any provisión in the first deed that the property should revert to the grantor when the turnpike ceased to be a toll road; the clause giving Mr. McClure the first right to purchase on the removal of the gatehouse might seem to negative such an intent; and as the gatehouse has never been removed the right to that option has not arisen. The law will not imply a different agreement from that which the parties have made: Aye v. Philadelphia Co., <a href="/pa/193/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="193 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="910306" data-case-paths="/pa/193/0451-01">193 Pa. 451</a>. Mr. McClure might have provided that the house and lot should revert upon a sale of the turnpike road, but as he did not we must construe the deed as it is written.</p>
