Payments were made by owners of certain of the lots and such lots were released from the lien of the mortgage. The owner of the bond entered up judgment thereon. The owner of certain of the lots which have not been released from the lien of the mortgage petitioned the court to open the judgment, alleging that under the judgment as entered the lots held by him would be chargeable with a larger amount of the debt than they were chargeable with under the terms of the mortgage, and further alleging that the judgment represented .a larger amount than was due upon the mortgage. The lower court dismissed the petition. <em>Held, </em>(1) the lots owned by the petitioner should not be subjected to a higher charge than was represented by the amount due computed at the foot front price, and (2) the judgment should have been opened so as to permit the petitioner to show that under the judgment the plaintiff would receive a greater sum than he would be equitably entitled to if payment were made in full on such basis, and the order was reversed.</p>

The bond and mortgage in question were given June 21,1911, by Harry G. Hugus to the Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh to secure the payment of $20,000. The mortgage covered 134 lots and contained a provision reserving to the mortgagor and his assignees the right to have lots released from the lien of the encumbrance upon payment of $10 or $30 a front foot, depending upon their location. Nine of the lots were subsequently sold and payments made on account of the mortgage, and on June 24, 1912, Hugus sold the remainder of the property to B. M. McAnulty, subject to the lien of the mortgage. Payments on account of the <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>indebtedness were made by McAnulty and other purchasers of lots from time to time until April 11, 1914, when the balance due and unpaid was $9,885, and on that date McAnulty conveyed 34 of the lots to Lawrence Happe “subject to a certain mortgage given by Harry G. Hugus to the Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh, dated June 21,1911,......setting forth a release of $30 per front foot on Marshall avenue and $10 per front foot on Delaware and Mayfield avenues amounting to $18,270, which the party of the second part assumes and agrees to pay with six per cent, interest, from date hereof as part of the consideration.” On May 8, 1914, these lots were conveyed by Happe to the Marshall Place Land Company “subject to that certain mortgage given by Harry G. Hugus to- the Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh, Pa., dated June 21, 1911......containing a release clause wherein said lots are to be released upon payment of Thirty ($30.00) dollars per foot front on Marshall avenue and Ten ($10.00) dollars per foot front on Delaware and Mayfield avenues; said mortgage upon said lots amounting to the sum of Eighteen Thousand Two Hundred Seventy ($18,270.00) dollars with interest thereon at six per cent, from 21st day of April, 1914.” The land company afterwards conveyed 13% of the lots to H. S. Swartz, the petitioner in this case, by deed that made no reference to the Hugus mortgage. In the meantime payments on account of the mortgage were made from time to time by various lot owners, and, on December 23, 1915, there remained a balance due the Union Trust Company of $2,473.40 with interest, which amount was paid by Wakefield, the use-plaintiff, to whom the mortgage was assigned by the trust company. On the same date McAnulty assigned to Wakefield all his right, title and interest in the mortgage, Hugus having previously assigned his interest to McAnulty. Wakefield entered judgment on the bond assessing damages, including debt, interest and commissions, at $15,512.28. A fi. fa.-, sheriff’s sale and petition to set aside the sale and <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>open the judgment followed. Petitioner averred the sum due to be the balance paid the Union Trust Company by Wakefield amounting to $2,473.40, and asked that he be permitted to defend as to the remainder of the judgment. The supplemental answer avers, and the testimony taken shows, the parties to the several conveyances were interested in the Marshall Place Land Company and, at a meeting of that company held June 1, 1915, for the purpose of settling its affairs, a division of the lots was agreed upon, and, for the purpose of facilitating the sale of lots, conveyances were made to the various stockholders, including petitioner, of portions of the property, and it was further agreed that the grantee in each case should pay to McÁnulty for releases the foot frontage price stipulated in the Hugus mortgage. According to the petition appellant seems to concede a possible liability to pay the. sum of $7,423.20 with interest from April 11,1914, and denies liability for any sum over and above the amount remaining unpaid to the mortgagee, the Union Trust Company, at the time of the assignment to Wakefield.</p>

The statement of the total amount of the indebtedness is merely descriptive and apparently represented the unpaid balance due at that time, and was inserted in place of the original amount of $20,000. Under the terms of the mortgage a purchaser of one or more lots had a right to demand a release from the mortgage upon tender of the proper amount, computed on the basis of the front foot price set out in the encumbrance. Any other construction of the mortgage would render the latter provisions useless, by conferring upon the mortgagee the right to demand payment of the entire indebtedness as a consideration for the release of a single lot, notwithstanding the amount due on the mortgage was <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>out of all proportion to the value of the property. The .lots owned by petitioner should not therefore be subjected to a higher charge than was represented by the amount due computed at the front foot price, aggregating $7,423.20 with interest. • ,</p>

So far as appears from the record, such share was represented and fixed by the terms of the mortgage itself. If an adjustment upon this basis would result in the payment of a total of more than is due the assignee of the mortgage and thus permit him to profit at the expense of other parties to the transaction, the burden is on petitioner to show this fact. If the assignee of the mortgage made payments to the mortgagee from time to time to protect his individual interests and the interests of the land company in which they were mutually concerned, such payments not being <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>made with intention of cancelling the mortgage pro tanto, he is entitled to subrogation to the rights of the mortgagee to the extent of such payments: 27 Cyc. 1435; Forest Oil Company’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/118/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="118 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="556761" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0138-01">118 Pa. 138</a>.
