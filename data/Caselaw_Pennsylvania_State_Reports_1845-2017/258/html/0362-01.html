A written contract for the sale of land provided that the consideration money of $3,000 was “to be paid $200 on the signing of the agreement, which deposit shall be forfeited to the (vendors) as liquidated damages in case of default by the (vendees) in the payment of the purchase-price” and the balance at the time of settlement within thirty days, said time to be of the essence of the agreement. The purchaser paid the down-money, but refused to complete the purchase, though a proper deed was tendered. In an action by the grantor for the recovery of the balance of the' purchase-price, the affidavit of defense alleged (1) that plaintiff had no other remedy than the retention of the deposit money and (2) that time being of the essence of the contract, the contract was at an end upon failure of the vendees to pay the balance of the purchase-price and accept the deed and that plaintiff had no further rights under the contract. The lower court entered judgment for plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. <em>Held, no </em>error.</p>
