There he took a position facing the unopened vestibule door through which he expected to go. In order to steady himself in that position, he placed his right hand against the jamb of the car door, with his fingers in the space between the door and the jamb. Before the station was reached, the trainman who stood in the vestibule in front of the plaintiff reached into the car and pulled shut the open door upon the plaintiff’s fingers, inflicting the injury for which the action was brought. The reason for thus -shutting the door was not disclosed on the trial, as the defendant offered no evidence.</p>
