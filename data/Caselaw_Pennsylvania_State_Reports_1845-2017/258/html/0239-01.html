On an appeal from an award of viewers plaintiff alleged he had suffered damages by reason of the substitution or diversion of a public road through plaintiff’s farm, at the direction of the State highway commissioner. It appeared that the road, which had been designated as part of a State highway under the Act of 1911, had been diverted from its original course through plaintiff’s land in a township of the second class by the construction of a new road through other property. The termini of the new road connected with the original route of the State highway and the new course avoided two railroad grade crossings. There was no formal vacation of the old road by the Court of Quarter Sessions. The lower court held (1) that there was in fact no vacation; and (2) that even if there had been, no statute provides damages therefor, and entered a compulsory nonsuit. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>
