Trainer et al., Appellants.\nContracts\u2014Beal estate\u2014Agreement of sale\u2014Vendor and vendee \u2014Purchase-price\u2014Default by vendee\u2014Affidavit of defense\u2014Insufficient averments.\n1. Where an agreement for the sale of real estate does not provide by clear, precise and unequivocal language that the purchaser may terminate it by his own default, such effect will not be given it.\n2. A written contract for the sale of land provided that the consideration money of $3,000 was \u201cto be paid $200 on the signing of the agreement, which deposit shall be forfeited to the (vendors) as liquidated damages in case of default by the (vendees) in the payment of the purchase-price\u201d and the balance at the time of settlement within thirty days, said time to be of the essence of the agreement. The purchaser paid the down-money, but refused to complete the purchase, though a proper deed was tendered. In an action by the grantor for the recovery of the balance of the' purchase-price, the affidavit of defense alleged (1) that plaintiff had no other remedy than the retention of the deposit money and (2) that time being of the essence of the contract, the contract was at an end upon failure of the vendees to pay the balance of the purchase-price and accept the deed and that plaintiff had no further rights under the contract. The lower court entered judgment for plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. Held, no error.\nArgued May 2, 1917.\nAppeal, No. 34, Jan. T., 1917, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Philadelphia Co., Dec. T., 1916, No. 1138, for want of sufficient affidavit of defense in case of Jacob Korman and Rosie Norman, his wife, v. Joseph C. Trainer and John A. Trainer, Trading as Edward Trainer.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestbezat, Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit for recovery of balance of purchase-price und\u00e9r agreement for sale of real estate.\nRule for judgment for want of a. sufficient affidavit of defense.\nThe facts appear from the following opinion by Shoemaker, J.:\nIn response to the request of the Supreme Court, this opinion is filed, giving the reasons upon which the court entered judgment in this case.\nThis action was brought to recover the bal\u00e1nce of the purchase-money claimed by plaintiffs to be due to them by the defendants under an agreement for the sale of real estate.\nBy an agreement dated November 2, 1916, plaintiffs covenanted to sell defendants two lots situated in the City of Philadelphia, for the sum of $3,000; to be paid, $200 at the signing of the agreement \u201c(which deposit shall be forfeited to the said party of the first part),\u201d (the plaintiffs) \u201cas liquidated damages in case of the default by the party of the second part,\u201d (the defendants) in the performance of this -agreement, and the balance of the purchase-money as follows: $2,800 to be paid in cash at the time of settlement.\u201d\nAnd the parties bound themselves, their heirs, executors and administrators for the faithful performance of the agreement within thirty days from the date thereof. \u201cSaid time to be the essence of this agreement.\u201d\nThe $200 was paid about November 2, 1916, and on November 28,1916, the defendants notified plaintiffs that they would not consummate the purchase and would refuse to accept plaintiffs\u2019 deed for the premises. On December 2, 1916, plaintiffs tendered to defendants a sufficient deed in compliance with all the conditions contained in said agreement and demanded the balance of the purchase-money, which defendants refused to accept or pay the purchase-money and continued so to do, although plaintiffs were and are ready and willing to perform their part of said agreement; and tendered a deed of the premises at the time the statement was filed.\nThe defendants in their affidavit of defense averred that the lots mentioned in the agreement were vacant and unimproved, and that the clause in the agreement \u201cwhich deposit shall be forfeited to the said party of the first part as liquidated damages in case of the default by the party of the second part in the performance of the terms of this agreement\u201d limited the plaintiffs\u2019 rights, so that they had \u201cno other remedy in law or equity than the retention of the said $200 deposit money\u201d; that the agreement provided a remedy for the vendors in case of breach which was meant to be exclusive, and time being the essence of the agreement, it was at an end upon failure of vendees to pay the balance of the purchase-money and refusal to accept the deed; the forfeiture was by way of liquidated damages, that the effect of said forfeiture clause is a release and discharge of vendees from any and all subsequent liability under the agreement, and the large sum forfeited, $200, showed such intention of the parties.\nIn support of a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, the plaintiffs assigned the following reasons:\n1. \u201cThe clause relating to the forfeiture of deposit is for the benefit of the plaintiffs\u2019 vendor.\u201d\n2. \u201cThe plaintiffs have their choice of resorting to the forfeiture clause or insist upon their right to consummate the sale and receive the purchase-money from defendants.\u201d\n3. \u201cThe defendants, being in default, cannot set up their own wrong to work a forfeiture of their contract.\u201d\nIn our judgment, the questions raised by this record have been determined by Cape May Real Estate Co. v. Henderson, 231 Pa. 82, and the long line of cases cited in the opinion of Judge Porter, of the Superior Court, upon which opinion the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court.\nIt is settled by those cases that in- a covenant such as contained in the agreement in this case, which does not provide by clear, precise and unequivocal language, that the purchaser may terminate it by his own default, such effect will not be given it. The presumption is that the forfeiture clause is for the benefit of the grantor and enforceable at his election. Without such election and actions, the purchaser will not be relieved from his obligation to pay.\nIn Ruane\u2019s Est., 25 Pa. D. R. 347, the Orphans\u2019 Court of this county, in a case almost identical with the one at bar, followed Cape May Real Estate Co. v. Henderson, 231 Pa. 82, and held the vendee\u2019s estate liable, upon an agreement for the balance of the purchase-money.\nThe argument of the defendants\u2019 counsel, that the large amount of the deposit showed the intention of the parties to restrict the vendors to that sum, is not convincing, and is not so plain as to unavoidably sustain such a construction. On the contrary, it is not an uncommon practice to require a deposit of the proportions made in this case, as appears in Ruane\u2019s estate.\nThe lower court made absolute plaintiff\u2019s rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned\nwas in making absolute plaintiff\u2019s, rule for judgment.\nHenry A. Hoefler, for appellants.\nHenry Arronson, of Shoyer & Arronson, with him Frederick J. Shoyer and Martin Feldman, for appellees.\nMay 22, 1917:"
