Sibley, accepted the same subject to the condition that the said fund was to be used by the defendant for the benefit of the granges and grange organizations of Erie and Crawford Counties, as those granges should decide, was to be used only for the benefit of those granges, and that it was in no sense a gift or donation to the members of the defendant association or to the defendant association itself.\u201d This finding was'decisive of the question at issue, and justified the decree which was entered against the defendants. \u2022\nDecree affirmed.",
