Mantello, that he had signed it as a subscribing witness to its execution at the request of the decedent. In the face of strongly persuasive evidence that the note was a forgery, the jnry found that it was not; but on this appeal we cannot disturb their finding, because no complaint is made of the court\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial. The single assignment of error is to the admission of the note in evidence. Under Mantello\u2019s testimony its execution. by the deceased was for the jury, and to them the single issue was submitted as to the genuineness of A. B. Morton\u2019s signature. In the light of strong evidence submitted by the defense, followed by a charge directing the attention of the jury to it, the verdict may well be regarded as an untrue finding, but there is no assignment asking us to disturb it, and the judgment on it must, therefore, be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed.",

On appeal from a judgment for plaintiff rendered in an action upon a promissory note, the Supreme Court will not reverse, although they may he of the opinion that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, where there is no assignment of error complaining of the refusal of the lower court to grant a new trial.\n2. Where in such case the defense was that the note was a forgery, the note was nevertheless admissible in evidence, when its execution was testified to by a subscribing witness, and an assignment of error, complaining of the admission of the note in evidence was without merit.\nArgued May 7, 1917.\nAppeal, No. 221, Jan.
