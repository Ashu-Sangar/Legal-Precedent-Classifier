    "head_matter": "JOSEPH SONDHEIMER v. M. B. HOOVER.\nAPPEAL BY DEFENDANT FROM THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF LANCASTER COUNTY.\nArgued May 20,1891\nDecided October 5, 1891.\n(a) In an action for the breach of a warranty of soundness on the sale of a horse, the defendant requested the court to charge that \u201cif the jury believe that the alleged defect was a patent defect, apparent upon careless inspection, then the same is not covered by a general warranty : \u201d\n1. The jury having found the fact of the warranty and its breach, and no testimony having been submitted showing that the \u201calleged defect was a patent defect, apparent upon a careless inspection,\u201d the Supreme Court was not called upon to consider the proposition of law as presented.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Clark, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 123 January Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 53 December Term 1887, C. P.\nOn December 19, 1887, an appeal was entered by tbe defendant from the judgment of a justice of the peace in favor of Joseph Sondheimer against Moses B. Hoover. The plaintiff filed a statement of claim averring that, on November 10,1887, he bought from the defendant a mare which the defendant at the time warranted to be sound; that the mare proved to be unsound and defective, in that she had a bad and unsound eye, which defect could not be seen when the plaintiff bought her; and that the plaintiff had sold the mare at a loss of sixty dollars, to recover which this suit was brought. The defendant pleaded non-assumpsit.\nAt the trial, on October 24, 1890, the plaintiff testified that at the time of the sale of the mare the defendant guaranteed her to be sound and all right, with the exception of \u201c one big teat.\u201d In this he was corroborated. The defendant testified that he merely represented the mare to be sound as far as he knew. There was testimony submitted to the effect that a day or two after the purchase of the mare it was found that she had a defective eye, known as \u201c blue-eye,\u201d discoverable by examination in the light. One of defendant\u2019s witnesses testified that he had worked with the mare, had led her out for examination at the time of the sale, and that he never noticed the defect in the eye. Another witness, called by the defendant, testified that he had worked with the mare, and saw her a few days before the sale, but did not see anything wrong with her eyes.\nAt the close of the testimony, the court, Patterson, J., submitted to the jury the testimony on the subject of the warranty, and answered certain points presented for instruction as follows :\nThe plaintiff requests the court to charge the jury :\n1. If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the eye of the horse was defective and that this defect impaired its value, even if Hoover was utterly ignorant of the defect, if he warranted the horse to be sound, the verdict must be for the plaintiff for such an amount as will compensate him for the damage he has suffered.\nAnswer: Affirmed.\n2. It makes no difference whether Hoover knew the horse was unsound or not; if he warranted it sound, and the defect existed at the time of the sale, the verdict must be for plaintiff.\nAnswer: Affirmed.\nThe defendant requests the court to charge the jury:\n1. If the jury believe the testimony of the defendant, that when he sold the mare in controversy, he sold the mare to him to be sound \u201c only as far as he knew,\u201d that these words do not amount to a warranty.\nAnswer: Affirmed.\n2. That, if the jury believe that the alleged defect was a patent defect, apparent upon careless inspection, then the same is not covered by a general warranty.\nAnswer: Refused.1\n\u2014The jury returned a verdict in favor of the .plaintiff for 170.64. Judgment having been entered, the defendant took this appeal and assigned for error:\n1. The refusal of the defendant\u2019s point.1\nMr. Philip B. Baker (with him Mr. A. W. Snader), for the appellant.\nThat a general warranty does not usually extend to defects apparent on simple inspection, requiring no skill to discover them, nor to defects known to the buyer, counsel cited: 2 Benj. on Sales, *610, \u00a7 821.\nMr. J. Say Brown (with him Mr. W. U. Sensei), for the appellee.\nCounsel cited: 1 Benj. on Sales, 2d ed., 502."
