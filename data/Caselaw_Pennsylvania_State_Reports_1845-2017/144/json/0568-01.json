BUTLER.\nPETITION BY DEFENDANT FOR THE ALLOWANCE OF A CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF QUARTER SESSIONS OF PIKE COUNTY.\nSubmitted November 5, 1891 Refused November 9, 1891.\nIt is unnecessary that an indictment for larceny should aver an intent, on the part of the defendant, to deprive the owner permanently of his property and to convert it to the taker\u2019s own use, against the will of the owner; or that the verdict finding the defendant guilty should find also the value of the property taken: Allocatur refused.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Clark, Wn>. liams and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 000 January Term 1892, Sup. Ct.\nOn November 5, 1892, W. B. Butler presented his petition to the Supreme Court, verified by affidavit and setting forth:\nThat to No. 7 October Term 1891 of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Pike county, he was indicted, convicted and sentenced upon a charge of larceny; that, after verdict and before sentence, he filed his motion in arrest of judgment, which motion was overruled, the ruling excepted to, and exception sealed; that, on October 23, 1891, the petitioner was sentenced upon said indictment and conviction; all of which would be shown by the exemplification of the record submitted.\nThat manifest errors were committed by the court below, to wit:\n1, 2. In refusing to arrest the judgment for the first and second reasons assigned therefor.\n3, 4. In the sentence, in that it was in the alternative, and vague, uncertain and unintelligible as to a part of the penalty imposed, and was unreasonably excessive and unjust.\nPraying for an allocatur, and for an order staying proceedings.\nThe record filed with the petition showed that the indictment charged that William B. Butler, at the county of Pike, on the night of August 13, 1891, one pair of oxen of the value of seventy-five dollars, of the goods and chattels of Melvin Young, \u201cfeloniously did steal, take and lead away from the pasture field occupied and used by Melvin Young,\u201d contrary etc.; that the jury returned a verdict finding the defendant \u201c guilty; \u201d that, after verdict and before sentence, the defendant moved the court in arrest of judgment for the following reasons :\n\u201c 1. For that the indictment herein does not allege the taking of the property described in the indictment to have been with an \u2018 intent to deprive the owner permanently of his property, nor with an intent to convert it to the taker\u2019s own use,\u2019 against the will of the owner.\n\u201c 2. For that the verdict does not find any value of the property described in the indictment.\u201d\nThe record showed further, that, the motion being overruled, the sentence of the court was that the said William B. Butler pay the costs of prosecution, and a fine of fifty dollars; that he restore the stolen property to the owner if not already restored, or pay the owner the value thereof or of so much of the same as had not been restored; that he undergo an imprisonment in the state penitentiary for the eastern district of Pennsylvania at separate or solitary confinement for the term of three years; and that he stand committed, etc.\nThat larceny is a felonious taking with an intent to deprive the owner permanently of his property, and to convert it to the taker\u2019s own use, the petitioner in a brief filed cited: Rex v. Halloway, 2 C. & K. 945; Cassels v. State, 4 Yerg. 149; Wright v. State, 5 Yerg. 154 (26 Am. Dec. 258) ; McDaniel v. State, 8 Sm. & M. 401 (47 Am. Dec. 93); Russell on Crimes, 6th ed., 7; State v. Bonwell, 2 Harr. 529; Commonwealth v. Weld, Thatcher\u2019s C. C. 157 ; and the intent should be averred: People v. Lohman, 2 Barb. S. C. 216 ; Gobe v. State, 1 Eng. (Ark.) 519; Rex v. Osmer, 5 East 304; 2 Hawk. P. C. 25, \u00a7 57. That the verdict should find the value of the property stolen: \u00a7 72, act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 447; Hope v.
