If this is so, there is a remedy by the act of 1836, which empowers courts of equity to prevent or restrain “ the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the interests of the community, or the rights of individuals.” But, whether any person other than one who has engaged “ as manager ” merely, in the business of an apothecary or pharmacist, or of retailing drugs, chemicals and poisons, etc., either directly or indirectly, without having obtained a certificate as required by the act, is criminally liable, is another question. For the answer, we must ascertain whether the act includes any person but a manager; or, in other words, who is embraced within that term.</p>

The purpose of the act, of course, was to require that persons engaged in the business of druggists or apothecaries should possess practical knowledge of the business and science of pharmacy; but, in my opinion, there is no reason why any person should not be the proprietor or owner of the stock in trade, if he takes no part in conducting or keeping the <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>store; and for such a case provision is made in the acts of legislatures of other states. In the present case, we Save nothing to do with a question of policy, the only question being upon the words in the sixth section of the act, namely, “ That no person shall hereafter engage as manager in the business of an apothecary, etc.; ” and then follows the penalty for violation or failure to comply with the provisions of that section.</p>

The current of authority, at the present day, said Mr. Justice Bronson, is in favor of reading statutes according to the natural and most obvious import of the language, without resorting to subtle and forced constructions for the purpose of either limiting or extending their operation: ” 1 Kent’s Com., 463, and cases there cited. Penal statutes must be strictly construed in favor of the accused; and, so far as statutes for the regulation of trade impose fines and forfeitures, they are to be construed strictly as penal, and not liberally as remedial laws.</p>

Ordinarily, the term manager means “ one who has the conduct or direction of anything; as the manager of a theatre ; the manager of a lottery, of a ball, etc: ” Webster. To manage, means “ to direct, control, govern, administer, oversee.” In Anderson’s Law D., 650, cases are cited in which the courts of this country and of England have held that the word manager “ may mean either a person retained generally, to represent the principal in his absence, or one who has the superintendence of a particular contract or job, in which latter case he is like a <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>fellow-workman.” It is often applied to an officer of a corporation chosen to superintend its affairs. I am of the opinion that the court ought not, in a case that involves the liberty of a citizen, to reject the plain, obvious and ordinary signification of a word or term used in a penal statute, unless it 'is very clear that the legislature intended that it should be applied differently.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[280,760,1170,960]]]'>As before stated, for the purposes of this case it may be conceded that the first section of the act was intended to prevent all persons, whether as owners, proprietors, or managers, from opening and carrying on any retail drug or chemical store; but‘it seems that by the sixth section only the managers thereof, that is, the persons who have the conduct or direction of the business are liable to be punished by fine and imprisonment, and not an owner who takes no part in conducting the same. One person may own a business and furnish the money necessary to carry it on, and another may have the entire conduct and direction of it, that is to say, be the manager thereof; and who can certainly say that a statute which imposes a penalty on a “ manager,” for carrying on such a business, applies to both ? The court should not resort to a forced construction for the purpose of extending the operation of a penal act so as to cover cases not plainly expressed therein. The citizen ought to be plainly informed by the act itself, before he should be made subject to a fine' and imprisonment not exceeding one year.</p>
