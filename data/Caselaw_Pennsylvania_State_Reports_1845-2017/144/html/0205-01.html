Subsequently they were sold in Hanover by the constable. She alleges that the property was hers; that she had the right to possession of it and was in possession of it by her husband, who she says was her agent. She says that she bought it at a public sale of her husband’s property, a judicial sale, in October, 1887, and that the property seized and sold by the defendants was hers at the time of its seizure. On cross-examination, he denied that at the time of its seizure he had said the mule was a neighbor’s and the horse his. He also denied having suggested at the same time the expediency of alleging that the property was his wife’s. One of the defendants contradicted Bollinger in this, and testified that he did make both the statements referred to. This is only of importance as affecting his credibility and the truthfulness of his testimony; for, if the property was hers, no declarations or statements of his in her absence can in any wise affect or impair her ownership; he cannot thus take away her title or right to this property.</p>

Miller, and of plaintiff, supplemented by the record of the chattel mortgage, and the proceedings under it, resulting in the sale of the property involved in this suit, among a large quantity of other articles of personalty, at which sale Mrs. Bollinger and Miller testify that she bought the mule, bridles, saddle, and a horse which was traded for the one involved in this suit.</p>

She bought in the stock and utensils at the sale, if you believe her un contradicted oral evidence, but had no money or separate estate of her own, out <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>of which to pay for them.

It is unnecessary to decide whether her ownership would be sufficient, as against a creditor of her husband seizing it and selling it on lawful process, for that question does not arise in this ease. It came out incidentally in the testimony that Mr. Johns, one of- the defendants, was a creditor of George Bollinger; and he undertook. to justify the seizure of the property as that of George Bollinger, by the attachment issued by Philip S. Bowman, Esq., a justice, of the peace, of which the record is the evidence. But that entirely failed as a justification, for the proceedings were commenced without the plaintiff Johns making an affidavit of the non-residence of the defendant, which is an essential prerequisite to the issuing of an attachment in such a case.

A married woman, resident in Pennsylvania, may surely maintain a suit in her own name, upon any contract or right which she may have, “ for the protection or recovery of her owñ property, as an unmarried person: § 4, act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332. This proposition is general, and is not confined to citizens or residents. It is remedial and therefore is to be liberally construed. To deny this right of remedy to a married woman, a resident and citizeir of another state, would violate § 2, article IY. of the constitution of the United States: “ The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>and immunities of citizens in the several states.” In these privileges is included the right to institute and maintain actions : Corfield v. Coryell, 4 W. C. C. R. 371-381.</p>
    <p id="b239-4" data-blocks='[["BL_239.5",239,[133,550,1175,764]]]'>2. The plaintiff’s husband had testified to the seizure of the property on the road as he was going from Hanover towards home, and that Gallagher who seized it took it to Hanover and locked it up. The offer of the defendants, under cross-examination, to ask the witness whether the seizure was not under legal process at the suit of Johns, the other defendant, was incompetent. The inquiry was clearly aside from anything the witness had testified to in chief, and besides, the record was the best evidence of whether the property was seized on legal process. And the record of the attachment proceedings was not offered to show “ the relation of debtor and creditor,” and that the property was taken in execution for the husband’s debt. The only specified purpose of the offer was in mitigation of damages. It was not offered as a justification.</p>
    <p id="b239-5" data-blocks='[["BL_239.6",239,[136,1322,1175,914]]]'>3. The plaintiff had established her title and possession of the property by a judicial sale. As against a trespasser this was sufficient: Entriken v. Brown, <a href="/pa/32/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="32 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="986628" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0364-01">32 Pa. 364</a>. Were the defendants trespassers ? This depended upon whether the record of the justice in the attachment proceedings protected them. We submit that it did not, for two reasons: (a) It was not offered for that purpose.; (5) it shows upon its face that the remedy was one which the plaintiff had a right to invoke. The proceeding was under the act of May 8, 1874, P. L. 123, and is specially restricted to claims not exceeding $100. The act of July 7, 1879, P. L. 194, is inapplicable : Ross v. Miller, 14 W. N. 253. Hence the proceedings were not merely irregular but void, and this might be shown collaterally: Vansyckel’s App., <a href="/pa/13/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="13 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="964900" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0128-01">13 Pa. 128</a>. If,- however, the proceeding were under §§ 26, 27, act of July 12, 1842, P. L. 345, and the plaintiff’s husband was a resident of Maryland, as the constable’s writ showed, the justice was entirely without jurisdiction: Vansyckel’s App., supra.</p>

Her complaint, as stated in the declaration, is that “ John Gallagher, one of the defendants, upon the advice, order, direction, and authority of John P. Johns, the other defendant, and by virtue of certain proceedings alleged to be instituted before Philip S. Bowman, Esq., one of the justices of the peace in and for said county, by said John P. Johns against George Bollinger, seized and attached the said chattels, and on the third day of March sold the same.” This “ seizure, attachment, and sale ” she alleges were unlawful and malicious, and made after the notice of her title to the articles so seized and sold.</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[272,908,1168,289]]]'>Two questions were thus raised, viz.: Was the seizure and sale under the attachment lawful as against the defendant therein, George Bollinger ? If so, does the plaintiff show a title in herself good against her husband’s creditor ? The seventh and eighth assignments relate to the first of these questions.</p>
    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[271,1216,1167,746]]]'>The learned judge seems to have held that the attachment proceedings were absolutely void, because the plaintiffs affidavit did not set out the non-residence of the defendant. This would have been fatal to the attachment on a motion to quash, but no motion to quash was made. The attachment was returned with a personal service on the defendant. On the return day the defendant appeared in person and by counsel. A trial was had upon the merits, and judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff for one hundred and fifty dollars, with costs of suit. On this judgment an execution was issued, and by virtue of the execution the attached property was sold. We have no doubt that the sale so made divested the defendant’s title, and justified the sale by the constable, so far as George Bollinger is concerned. The third, seventh, and eighth assignments are therefore sustained.</p>

She was claiming to be the owner of property in her husband’s possession, and making this claim against one who is shown to be a creditor of her husband. It was therefore her duty to show that she paid for it out of her separate estate : Gamber v. Gamber, <a href="/pa/18/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="18 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="969090" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0363-01">18 Pa. 363</a>; Bradford’s App., <a href="/pa/29/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="29 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="982828" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0513-01">29 Pa. 513</a>; Seeds v.

    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[155,518,1172,559]]]'>The defendant’s third point should also have been affirmed. The laws of a sister state, affecting the rights of married women, are not taken judicial notice of by the courts of this state; and for that reason they will be assumed to be the same as our own, unless shown by competent evidence to be different. The alleged trespass was committed in this state. The action was brought here. The lex fori was to be applied, unless some reason for refraining from its application was made to appear on the trial. No such reason was shown, and plaintiff was therefore bound to make her case in accordance with the laws of this state. For the reasons now given</p>
