The very name, declaration of trust, involves the idea that the testator must declare his assumption of the trust; in other words, must say something, or write something, or exhibit something to some person, or to the world at large. If he stands <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>alone in a room and repeats his intention to himself, that is not a declaration. Nor is the writing of a memorandum, not intended to be shown to any one during his life. A writing may be a testamentary disposition, if he looks forward to its discovery and inspection after his death; but it cannot be a declaration of trust, if he does not intend to communicate it in his lifetime. As in gifts there must be a delivery, so in declarations of trust there must be something equivalent to a delivery, to wit, a declaration made in the donor’s lifetime to some one beside himself. No case can be found in which a trust has been held to have been declared, unless there has been such a communication, substantially identifying the cestui que trust and the trust property.</p>
    <p id="b458-6" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[290,1062,1164,801]]]'>2. It is clear that the indorsement on the envelope, and the entries in testator’s books, do not amount to a declaration. In point of fact they show an intention to make a gift, constituting the bonds “ the property of” his nephew; and all the cases agree that an intention to make a gift excludes the idea of a declaration of trust. However, there is not the slightest evidence that the decedent ever showed these memoranda to any one, or ever intended that they should be seen until after his death. The only declaration made to any one, was the conversation with the father of the alleged cestui que trust. It was more consistent with the idea of an undelivered gift, than with that of a trust; but, at all events, it wholly failed to identify the subject of the trust, and there is nothing to connect it with the secret memoranda above mentioned. If there was not a trust which the cestui que trust could have enforced in the donor’s lifetime, he is out of court.</p>

To avoid this difficulty, the court below calls the trust a ■ revocable one, but overlooks the distinction between a revocable ac.t creating the trust, and a power of revocation annexed to a completed trust. If a declaration is of such a character that the donor may change his mind before he communicates it to any one, as in the case of a secret memorandum, it is not a declaration, but only an intention to declare. If it is complete, it cannot be revoked so as to prevent the trust from taking effect. The citation of a few authorities will show how strict has been the enforcement of the rule that there must be some act on the part of the donor, divesting him of the legal <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>or equitable dominion over tbe property, and vesting in tbe donee an immediate right, legal or equitable: Bispham’s Eq., § 66; Richards v.

It is well settled, however, that whether a gift or a trust is intended, if the transaction still remains imperfect and executory, equity will not aid in its enforcement. The expression of a mere intention to create a trust, therefore, without more, is insufficient; like a promise to give, it will not be enforced in equity: Dipple v. Corles, 11 Hare 188; Helfenstein’s Est., <a href="/pa/77/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="77 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="436289" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0328-01">77 Pa. 328</a>. Almost all trusts are in a certain sense executory. Ordinarily, a trust cannot be executed except by conveyance; there is, in most cases, something to be done. But this is not the sense in which a trust is ■ said to be executory. An executory trust, properly so called, is one in which the limitations are imperfectly declared, and the donor’s intention is expressed in such general terms that something not fully declared is required to be done, in order to complete and perfect the trust, and to give it effect. When the limitations of a trust are fully and perfectly declared, the trust is regarded as an executed trust: Egerton v. Brownlow, 4 H. L. 210 ; Cushing v.

If this were not so, an expression of present gift <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>would in all cases amount to a declaration of trust, and any imperfect gift might be made effectual simply by converting it into a trust. There is no principle of equity which will perfect an imperfect gift, and a court of equity will not impute a trust where a trust was not in contemplation: Milroy v.

Rogers, L. R. 16 Eq. 340. In Richards v. Delbridge, L. R. 18 Eq. 11-13, it was held, overruling Morgan v. Malleson, L. R. 10 Eq. 475, and Richardson v. Richardson, L. R. 3 Eq. 686, that to create a trust there must be the expression of an intention, not to create a present gift, but to become a trustee. See, also, Milroy v. Lord, supra; Brett’s Lead. Cas., 58; Long’s App., <a href="/pa/86/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="86 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1056612" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0196-01">86 Pa. 196</a>. Although the cases may not be altogether consistent, the rule is now, we think, well settled in accordance with the doctrine declared in Richards v. Del-bridge, supra, that, if the transaction is intended to be effected by gift, the court will not give it effect by construing it as a trust. It is well settled that nothing can take effect as an assignment or gift which does not manifest an intention to relinquish the right of dominion on one hand and to create it on the other. If the donor has perfected his gift as he intended, and has placed the subject beyond his power or dominion, the want of consideration is immaterial; the donee’s right will be enforced. A gift can only be effectual after the intention to make it has been accompanied by delivery of possession or some equivalent act; if it is not, the transaction is not a gift, but a contract merely.</p>

In other words, he may constitute either himself or another person trustee. If he makes himself trustee, no transfer of the subject-matter of the trust is necessary; but if he selects a third party, the sub<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>ject of the trust must be transferred to him in such mode as will be effectual to pass .the legal title Bispham’s Eq., 78; Perry on Trusts, §§96-98; Hill on Trustees, 117 et seq.; Dickerson’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=115%20Pa.%20210" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="115 Pa. 210">115 Pa. 210</a>. In Richards v. Delbridge, L. R. 18 Eq. 11-13, Sir George Jessel said: “A man may transfer his property without valuable consideration in one of two ways: He may either do such acts as amount in law to a conveyance or assignment of the property, and thus completely divest himself of the legal ownership, in which case the person who by those acts acquires the property, takes it beneficially or on trust, as the case may be; or, the legal owner of the property may, by one or other of the modes recognized as amounting to a valid declaration of trust, constitute himself a trustee, and, without an actual transfer of the title, may so deal with the property as to deprive himself of its beneficial ownership, and declare that he will hold it from that time forward in trust for the other person.” Heartley v. Nicholson, L. R. 19 Eq. 233, is to the same effect. If the donor makes a third party a trustee,1 he must transfer to him the subject of the trust in such mode as will be effectual to pass the title. The transaction, as in the case of a gift, to be effectual must be accompanied by delivery of the subject of the trust, or by some act so strongly indicative of the donor’s intention as to be tantamount to such a delivery; but, where the donor makes himself the trustee, no transfer of the subject-matter is necessary. Ex parte Pye, 18 Ves. 140; Donaldson v. Donaldson, Kay, 711; and Crawford’s App., <a href="/pa/61/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="61 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="428580" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0052-01">61 Pa. 52</a>, are illustrations of trusts in this form. In such cases, no assignment of the legal title is required, for the nature and effect of the transaction is that the legal title remains in the donor for the benefit of the donee. It is conceded that, as the bonds of the Pensacola &amp; Atlantic Railroad Company, the bonds in question, were not delivered to Thomas <em>, </em>Smith Kelly by Thomas Smith, the transaction cannot be sustained as a gift. It is clear that a gift was not in contemplation, and the only question for our determination is, whether or not a complete and valid trust was created, for a trust would seem to have been contemplated.</p>

In the case of personal property or dioses in action, trusts may be proved by parol. If the declaration be in writing, it is <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>not essential, as a general rule, that it should be in any particular form. It may be couched in any language which is sufficiently expressive of the intention to create a trust. “ Three things, it has been said, must concur to raise a trust; sufficient words to create it, a definite subject, and a certain or ascertained object; and to these requisites may be added another, viz., that the terms'of the trust should be sufficiently declared: ” Bispham’s Eq., 65, citing Cruwys v. Colman, 9 Ves. 323; Knight v. Boughton, 11 Cl. &amp; F. 513. The intention must be a complete one, and this requisite is especially "applicable tó trusts created by voluntary dispositions. “ A mere inchoate and executory design is not enough, and unless there is some distinct equity, as fraud, for example, it cannot be enforced: ” Bispham’s Eq., 65. The intention must be plainly manifest, and not derived from loose and equivocal expressions of parties, made at different times and upon different occasions; but any words which indicate with sufficient certainty a purpose to create a trust will be effective in so doing. It is not necessary that the terms “trust” and “trustee” should be used. The donor need not say in so many words, “ I declare myself a trustee,” but he must do something which is equivalent to it, and use expressions which have that meaning; for, however anxious the court may be to carry out a man’s intention, it is not at liberty to construe words otherwise than according to their proper meaning: Richards v. Delbridge, supra. In Heartley v. Nicholson, supra, Vice-Chancellor Bacon says : “ It is not necessary that the declaration of a trust should be in terms explicit, but what I take the law to require is that the donor should have evinced by his acts which admit of no other interpretation, that he himself had ceased to be, and that some other person had become the beneficial owner of the subject of the gift or transfer, and that such legal right of it, if any, as he retained, was held in trust for the donee.” . “ The one thing necessary,” says the same learned judge in Warriner v. Rogers, supra, “ to give validity to a declaration of trust, the indispensable thing, I take to be that the donor or grantor, or whatever he may be called, should have absolutely parted with that interest which had been his up to the time of the declaration <em>; </em>should have effectually changed his right in that respect, and put the property out of his power, at least in the <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>way of interest.” The acts or words relied upon must be unequivocal, plainly implying that the person holds the property as trustee: Martin v. Funk, <a href="/ny/75/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="75 N.Y. 134" data-case-ids="536939" data-case-paths="/ny/75/0134-01">75 N. Y. 134</a>. Therefore, in Young v.

Y. 422</a>, where the donor signed a paper certifying simply that certain bonds belonged to his sons, but did not declare in any words of plain import that he held them in trust for them, the declaration was held to be insufficient.

He was the owner of a large estate, the personalty alone aggregating about $1,000,000. Thomas Smith Kelly was his nephew, his godson and namesake; and, although his father and mother were both lining* he lived with and was maintained and educated by his uncle from the age of three years until the time of the decedent’s death on the twentieth of May, 1883, when he was about thirteen years of age. His uncle admittedly stood in loco parentis, which would seem to furnish a sufficient motive for making this disposition of the bonds, and would have like effect generally to that which attends the relation of parent and child: Ex parte Pye, 18 Ves. 146. The bonds were purchased the twenty-eighth of January, 1882, and the death of the decedent occurred on the twentieth of May, 1883. A year or more before his decease, which was presumably near the time when the bonds were purchased, Thomas Smith, in a conversation with John H. Kelly, the father of Thomas Smith Kelly, stated “ he had laid by or appropriated some bonds for Tom.” After his death, when his box in the trust company’s vaults was opened, the bonds in question were found amongst his assets.

The argument of appellant’s counsel is that a “ declaration ” of trust involves the idea that the donor must declare his assumption of the trust; in other words, that he must say something, or write something, or exhibit something, to some other person, or to the world at large. “If he stands alone,” say the learned counsel, “ in a room, and repeats his intention to himself, that is not a declaration. If he writes a memorandum, not intended to be shown to any one during his lifetime, that is not a declaration. It may be a testamentary disposition, if he looks forward to its discovery and inspection after death; but it cannot be a declaration of trust, if he does not intend to communicate it in his lifetime. As in^ifts there must be a <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>delivery, so in declarations of trust there must be something equivalent to a delivery, to wit, a declaration made to some other person or to the world at large, which constitues the donor at once a trustee and conveys to the cestui que trust an immediate equitable interest.”</p>

The envelope containing the bonds in question had an informal declaration indorsed thereon that the bonds were held for Tom Smith Kelly; the account-book showed, not only that they were bought for his nephew, but that they belonged to him,—they were his property. For whose inspection were those written declarations intended? Certainly not for the inspection of the donor, but for those who might have occasion at any time in the future to investigate his affairs. The donor was advanced in years, and was subject to the ordinary ills, accidents, and misfortunes of life, both physically and mentally. He was liable, although living, to be incapacitated for all business affairs, or he might be removed by death. In any event, his purpose would seem to have been <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>to leave a memorandum for the eyes of others, exhibiting his intention and purpose with respect to these bonds. It is unnecessary for us to consider whether or not the donor might have revoked the declaration. He did not revoke it; he put it away with the bonds themselves, and carefully preserved it. He collected the interest semi-annually,, and, in recognition of the existing trust, placed the several amounts to the credit of the donee. It is not essential to the validity of a trust of personal property that it should be irrevocable; indeed, a right of revocation may be expressly reserved: Dickerson’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="115 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="551661" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0198-01">115 Pa. 198</a>; Lines v.

The question in such case is not so much whether in the lifetime of the decedent the declaration was actually exhibited to the inspection of others, as whether, under all the circumstances of the case, it would appear to have been written and preserved for the inspection of others. If thd%eclaration had been a formal one, under the hand and seal of the declarant, upon proof of its execution we think its effectuality would not have been questioned, even though it never had been exhibited to the cestui que trust or to any other person; and we cannot see that the informal nature of the writing could alter its effect, if the donor’s intention is otherwise clearly established.</p>

They were simply ordinary coupon bonds, transferable by delivery. A formal assignment was unnecessary to transfer the title. The rights of creditors do not intervene. The appellants stand in the shoes of the testator, and their rights do not rise superior to his. Whilst a gift, in its proper legal acceptation, was not contemplated by Thomas Smith, it is plain that his purpose was to vest the equitable ownership of these bonds in his nephew, and to apply the interest for bis benefit. In the language of the president judge of the Orphans’ Court, his “ declarations and subsequent acts, evidenced by his admissions and solemn entries in his books, and the indorsement upon the envelope containing the bonds, furnish incontrovertible proofs of his intention to hold them as a trustee.”</p>

The book-keeper was directed to enter the credit simply “ for cash received.” It does not appear that any declaration of trust was communicated to him by Crawford, or, in fact, that a trust was expressly declared to any other person. Mrs. Crawford at no time afterwards received any portion of the principal or interest of the money standing to her credit, but interest was from year to year credited upon it. After the husband’s death, on the distribution of his estate the widow claimed this three thousand dollars with the accrued interest. It was held by this court that her claim could not be supported as a gift, but it was sustained upon the footing of a trust. We are of opinion upon similar grounds that the railroad bonds were, in this instance, intended, not as a present gift, for the testator retained the possession of them, and exhibited no intention whatever of parting with them; on the contrary, he expressly declared in writing that he “ held ” them for Thomas Smith Kelly, for whom he had bought and paid for them, and that the bonds were his property. Completeness of the trust is to be judged of, not only by what the testator said and what was written, but by what the testator did. He did not read the declaration to others, but he put it away with the bonds in his box in the trust company’s vaults, and carefully preserved it; and he received and properly applied the' interest, circumstances which give rise to the reasonable implication that the writing was intended for the eyes of others, and not merely for his own.</p>
