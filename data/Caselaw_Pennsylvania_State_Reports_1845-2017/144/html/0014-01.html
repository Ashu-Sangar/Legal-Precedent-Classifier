The law says that what they ought to know they are presumed to know; and if by ordinary care they could have known this dangerous use, then they are charged with notice of it, whether they did know it or not; and that is what is called constructive notice.</p>

This the court declines to do. [It is sufficient if the Stearns Manufacturing Co. were accustomed <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>to use the lawn in a like dangerous way, storing other wheels there, if not the same wheel, a sufficient length of time to charge the city with notice. The continuous, habitual, and open use of the lawn in a dangerous way, similar to the use that was made of it by means of which this injury occurred, if continued long enough to give the city constructive notice of that use, is sufficient to charge them with the consequences of it. Whether the lawn was so used by the Stearns Manufacturing Co. is a question for you to decide. Whether they were in the habit of placing machinery and wheels, similar to the wheel that caused the injury, upon the lawn in close proximity to the sidewalk, so that it would be dangerous to passers-by, or not, is for you to determine. Upon that question you have the testimony of a number of witnesses. Mrs. Mattimore, Mr. 'Mattimore, Mr. Carney, Mr. Fagan, Mr. Mangold, and perhaps one or two other witnesses, testified to you that, for several months prior to the happening of the accident, the company had been in the habit of placing wheels (some larger and some smaller than the one which caused this accident) upon the lawn close to the sidewalk, so that if they should tumble over it would endanger any one who was passing along the sidewalk, without having them sufficiently secured so that they would not fall over.] 7 Now if you believe that testimony you are instructed that that would be sufficient to justify you in finding that the city had constructive notice of that dangerous condition of the sidewalk ; and if they did have constructive notice of it, it was their duty to see to it that that use of it was stopped, that the safety of people passing upon the sidewalk might not be endangered.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b43-5" data-blocks='[["BL_43.4",43,[137,1863,1168,553]],["BL_44.1",44,[277,390,1161,147]]]'>On the other hand, you have the testimony of Mr. Barnhurst, and several other witnesses; who say that they saw the machinery there; and Mr. Barnhurst especially tells you that he inspected the machinery almost daily that was upon the lawn, and that if he saw any that was in an apparently dangerous situation, he tested it to find whether it was dangerous or not; and that in every instance he found it perfectly secure, and no danger of it toppling over. You have the testimony of other witnesses, that with the exception of this one occasion, no wheel was ever known to fall over which had been placed by the company upon the lawn. That is not conclusive evi<a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>denee that there was not any dangerous use made of the lawn by the company, but it is evidence which you will be justified in considering in arriving at the truth in regard to that question.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b44-6" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[272,544,1167,1209]]]'>Now, it appears from the evidence that not only wheels were placed upon the lawn, but that articles of machinery, engines and engine beds and saw-mill machinery; and one or two witnesses testified that there were boilers or portions of boilers stored upon the lawn and against the building on the north side of the sidewalk. It may be that the company had no right to use that lawn for storing such articles of machinery upon; it may be that they were using it in an unlawful manner, but that would be no reason for making the city responsible in this case, if that unlawful use did not contribute or was not such a use of this lawn, or was not similar to the use which contributed to this injury. In other words, although they might violate the law in one respect, it would not be reason for visiting them with the consequences of neglect in another respect. The engines and saw-mill machinery and a great many of the articles which were placed upon the lawn, the testimony shows, could not have possibly fallen upon any one to injure them; so that, although they may have had the lawn covered with such machinery as that, it would not be such a use of it as would give the city notice of such dangerous condition. It was only such use of it as would be dangerous to passers-by, similar to the storing of wheels in the manner in which this particular wheel was stored, if you find that it was insecurely placed, which would operate as constructive notice to the city.</p>

He would be guilty of contributory negligence; his own act of playing with the wheel would contribute towards the sustaining of the injury. Mrs. Richter is the only witness who testifies to that fact. She cannot give you the exact time. She says it was either on a Sunday or a holiday. I do not know that she fixes the exact year; but she says that a few days after she saw the young boy playing with the wheel, she heard of the accident to Willie Mattimore, and that is the way she fixes the time. Now, if you believe that she did see a boy playing in that way, and if you believe it was this young hoy whom she did see, then it would be your duty to find a verdict for the defendant, because it would show contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff which helped to cause the injury. Her testimony is inconsistent with the testimony of Willie Mattimore himself, who tells you that he was not flaying with the wheel; that he was going along the sidewalk, looking back at the time over his shoulder, and that he accidentally touched either the wheel or the board upon which it rested, and that that caused it to fall over. If his story is true, then there would be no contributory negligence on his part, because it would be doing nothing which was negligent or showed any want of care. If, by merely walking upon the sidewalk he accidentally touched the board upon which the wheel was resting, and that caused it to topple over, that would not be an act of negligence upon his part which contributed to the injury.</p>

In this action, he could recover no compensation for the loss of earning-capacity before he arrives at the age of twenty-one, because his earnings up to that time would belong to his father, and his father would have to bring a suit for that. This suit is not by his father, but by himself; so that you could only estimate the loss of earning-power after he arrives at the age of twenty-one years. Now, your verdict in this case should be for such an amount as will compensate him for the pain and suffering and inconvenience, and this loss of earning-power that I have explained; if he is entitled to recover at all, he is entitled to recover for that. It is not a case in which you can give vindictive or punitive damages. Where an injury is inflicted by one person upon another in a malicious, cruel or wanton manner, and intentionally, then the law permits the recovery of vindictive or punitive damages in such a sum as will punish the offender for the <em>wrong </em>which he has committed ; but where the injury is inflicted without any malice, and not wantonly, cruelly or intentionally, as the evidence shows this%injury to have been inflicted, if at all, then all that the jury can give the plaintiff is compensation; not such a verdict as will punish the person who is responsible for the injury, but such as will compensate him for the loss which he has sustained or will probably sustain from the time he arrives at the age of twenty-one, for the remainder of his life. So that your verdict, if you find for the plaintiff, should be compensation and not punishment. It should be compensation for the pain and suffering, compensation for the inconvenience, and compensation for the loss of earning-power which the plaintiff has sustained or will probably sustain from the time of his arrival at the age of twenty-one until his death.] 9.....</p>

Fischer, <a href="/pa/111/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="111 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="545444" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0009-01">111 Pa. 9</a>; Oil City Supply Co. v. Boundy, <a href="/pa/122/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="122 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="1948398" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0449-01">122 Pa. 449</a>. In both these it was held that any limitation upon the effect of any degree of contributory negligence of the plaintiff, as defeating his right of recovery, was vicious, and could not be tolerated. In the first of them the present Chief Justice said: “But if we substitute the word ‘ material ’ for the word ‘ any,’ we practically abolish the rule, for a jury can always find a way to avoid it. The rule itself is valuable, and rests upon sound principles. We are not disposed to allow it to be undermined.” It is contended, however, that the law was correctly stated in the subsequent part of the charge, and therefore the jury was not misled, or may not have been misled by the erroneous instruction. Upon examining the charge, however, we find that the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>only portion oí it in which the legal principle is stated is the part above quoted, and there the error distinctly appears in the statement of the principle itself and as a part of it. There is no qualification of it anywhere else in the charge. What follows is merely by way of illustration, as applied to the facts óf the present case. The learned judge did tell the jury that if they found that the boy was playing with the wheel, and attempting to move it, and thereby caused it to fall, he would be guilty of contributory negligence and could not recover. But under the charge as it then stood, it would be quite possible for the jury to find that, although the boy was playing with the wheel, his action did not materially contribute to the injury, and therefore they could render a verdict in his favor. There was evidence that the wheel was very insecurely placed in its position, and tilted over upon the least touching of it; and the jury may have very naturally thought its insecure position was more material in producing its fall than the boy’s playing with it. It is this very opportunity to misapply the law, if degrees of contributory negligence are tolerated, which requires from the court a rigid adherence to the rule which forbids a recovery by a plaintiff in an action for negligence, who has contributed in <em>any </em>degree to his own injury.</p>
    <p id="b50-6" data-blocks='[["BL_50.4",50,[277,1508,1161,702]]]'>For some unexplained reason, the present action was not brought against the parties who were guilty of the actual negligence which caused the plaintiff’s injury. It was brought against the city instead of the Stearns Manufacturing Company. The conditions of liability are very different in the case of the city from those which are controlling in the case of the company. The liability of the latter depends only upon the fact of their negligence resulting in the plaintiff’s injury. But the liability of the city is not a necessary consequence of the mere neglect of the company. Something more is required to be proved in the action .against the city than the fact that the company was guilty of the negligence which resulted in the plaintiff’s injury. Other elements enter into the inquiry as to the responsibility of the city.</p>
    <p id="b50-7" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[281,2218,1160,197]],["BL_51.1",51,[119,389,1183,2033]],["BL_52.1",52,[268,383,1176,194]]]'>The city had nothing to do with the placing of the. wheel which fell upon the plaintiff, and therefore cannot be charged with the consequences which resulted from its negligent placing. The wheel was not standing in any part of the public <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>highway; and therefore, the mere fact of its being where it was did not contribute to an obstruction to the travel on either the road or the sidewalk. While it must be conceded that a municipality is chargeable with the consequences of the presence of an actual obstruction in the highway, as soon, at least, as it can be said to have knowledge of the obstruction, there is scarcely a parallelism between the conditions of liability in such circumstances, and those which are required in such a case as this. Of course, if this wheel had been upon private grounds, it will not be pretended that the city would be responsible, even though it stood veiy near to the highwajn Being upon ground which, though public, was not in use as a highway, it certainly does not follow, by any necessary inference, that the city would be liable upon the principle that it is an obstruction to the highway. It is plain that, as the injury in question was not the result of the mere presence of the wheel on the lawn, the city is not liable because of such presence only. We think it follows, hence, that the city is not liable for the negligence of placing it, unless it had at least distinct notice of that particular negligence in the placing of either this wheel or of other wheels. There was not a particle of evidence of any such notice as this in the case, either as to this wheel or others. On the contrary, there was ample proof that no accident of this kind had ever occurred from the placing of any of the' machinery, and there was no plausible or possible ground of inference that an accident would happen simply because of the manner in which the machinery was placed upon the lawn. If, then, the city’s liability must be worked out as the consequence of a disregarded notice, such notice must have been directed to the particular negligence which produced the injury, and of that kind of notice there was no proof. The mere fact of the presence of the machinery might give rise to a duty to remove it, but that is not the dutjr whose violation occasioned the injury, and it is inconsequential as a source of legal liability. The petition of citizens, presented to city councils, during the year before the accident, was rather a remonstrance against the presence of the whole body of machinery' on the lawn, as being an unsightly spectacle and injurious to the rights of property owners, than as a source of danger to individuals. It was charged in the petition that the storage of <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>such a great quantity of machinery so near the road, would tend to frighten horses and cause runaways, but there was no specific notice of any special negligence in the manner of placing particular articles.</p>
    <p id="b52-5" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[264,587,1177,455]]]'>We are of opinion, therefore, that the facts necessary to give rise to the liability of the city for this particular injury do not appear in the testimony; and, as there was no proof that the wheel that caused the injury had been placed in its position any considerable length of time before the accident, we think the first, second, fourth, sixth, g,nd seventh assignments are sustained. We do not sustain tire fifth and ninth assignments, as there was some evidence of a permanent loss of earning power to some extent, and its effect was for the jury.</p>
