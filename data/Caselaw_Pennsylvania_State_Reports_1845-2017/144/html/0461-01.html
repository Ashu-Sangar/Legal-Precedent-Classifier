A wire netting was produced in court by the defendant as having been taken from the spark-arresting appliance on that engine, and experts were examined on each side of the case as to its sufficiency. Doubts having been raised by the testimony as to whether this netting could be the one that was taken out of engine No. 72, the court suggested that the engine be brought to a convenient place and examined in the presence of the <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>court and jury. This suggestion was carried out, and it was. found that the netting could be fitted into place, in that engine, but when so placed there were certain open spaces at the back part of it, between its edge and a certain pipe against which it was designed to fit, large enough for sparks of considerable size to pass through. The defendant claimed that the existence of these spaces was due to the twisting and bending to which it had been subjected, in taking it out and handling it in court.

In the discussion of the law that took place several days ago, counsel for the plaintiffs frankly conceded that the mere fact of the fire taking place along the track was not of itself sufficient on which to base, a verdict against the railroad company. Nor, is it enough that a spark from their engine set fire to it, if that spark was such an one that no reasonable precaution on the part of the railroad company could have prevented it. If, in other words, this railroad had, in point of fact, in the engine that went by that mill that afternoon, within a reasonable time during which a spark could have smouldered, the best approved spark-arrester in general use, or if they had a spark-arrester which was thoroughly sufficient for the purpose and did as well as the approved spark-arrester would, the fact that a spark might have escaped and set fire to the building would not render them liable, provided the appliances were in good order. So that you come to a later and other point, and will have to say, in the first place, what locomotive or locomotives could have caused this fire; and secondly, what was the condition and management of those locomotives.</p>

      <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>In regard to the engine that passed that place, there is no doubt, I suppose, and I hardly think it is contested, but that locomotive No. 72 passed that mill about ten minutes of six that afternoon. The passage of that engine agrees with the evidence as to when the fire took place. As far as the time is concerned, it may have set fire to the mill. In addition to that, the witness Staib testified to a coal train passing north somewhere near that time, it is said about a quarter of an hour before ; but as Mr. Rothermel argued yesterday, and as both counsel have said, you are not obliged to be excessively strict with witnesses in regard to exact points of time, considering how long it has been since this event occurred. We must, however, consider, on the witness Staib’s testimony, that if he is correct in what he says, that coal train passed by there going north about the time or very near the time No. 72 passed, and probably before No. 72 passed. In regard to that, the railroad company has produced an amount of evidence here, which, I am frank to say to you, I think is very conclusive; not conclusive in law, but I think very persuasive of the fact that no coal train went north within an hour of the time that No. 72 passed; that the train that passed nearest to No. 72 was a passenger train called No. 1, which passed about six or seven minutes after five. Of course, you are at liberty to find, under the evidence in this case, that, supposing for a moment you consider No. 72 as being an engine which could not have caused the fire, and I will speak about that later, it then remains on this evidence, I think you will find, that the only train that was likely to have caused it was the passenger train coming north.</p>

Now, if this was not an <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>unknown engine, or an unknown coal train, or it was not train No. 1 that went up about six minutes after seven,—if it was not either one of those trains, then the only other train it could have been was train No. 72.

With a view of ascertaining whether that was so, by fitting it into the engine, we had the examination which took place on Thursday. This spark-arrester was fitted into that engine. You will agree with me, I believe, in thinking that, so far as the front part of that spark-arrester was concerned, there did not seem to be even the slightest possibility of any sparks getting out. That is a view which, I think, you will take, although you are not, of course, obliged to follow any conclusion of mine; but the front part of the spark-arrester was entirely tight, so that no sparks of any unusual size could get out.</p>

But the witness Staib also said that there was nothing unusual in the acts of the engine; that it was not laboring, or, in other words, not puffing, so as to draw an unusual amount of coal out of,the fires. He says the same thing, as I recollect, about the coal train which he said was going up. The defendant is entitled to the benefit of that consideration; that these were not, according to the plaintiffs’ own testimony, engines that were laboring in an unusual way so as to cause sparks to go out, which would not ordinarily have gone <em>out; </em>it being admitted, I think, on both sides that an engine going up a high grade, or pulling a very heavy load, will use its exhaust in such a quick, jerking way that it will drag fire out which would not come out in the ordinary use of a locomotive. There are, therefore, those two points in regard to Staib’s testimony. But the point that the defendant asks me to charge here I am obliged to refuse.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b497-7" data-blocks='[["BL_497.7",497,[162,739,1170,1726]]]'>The law of the case was considered so fully upon the trial that it is unnecessary to elaborate the discussion at this time. We think that, in view of the proof offered by the plaintiffs of an unidentified train passing their mill just before the fire, the trial judge was bound, under Gowen v. Glaser, 3 Cent. R. 109, to admit the evidence of the general bad condition or bad management of the defendant’s locomotives, as indicated by the quantity of large sparks thrown out. The fact that the defendant’s evidence went almost conclusively to show that no such train as described could have passed, does not make the previous admission of the plaintiffs’evidence an error. Nor is it sufficient ground for a new trial, inasmuch as two trains, not identified until the defendant’s testimony was put in, passed within a time during which a spark might have smouldered and caused the conflagration, and also because there was other evidence adequate to support a verdict for the plaintiffs. The testimony of the witness Staib, that he noticed nothing irregular in the action of the engines which passed the mill not long before the time of its destruction, and that he saw no sparks, does not justify the conclusion contended for by the defendant that these engines were harmless, and so shut out proof of a general mismanagement by the defendant of its locomotives in the matter of spark-throwing. The admission of evidence, to the effect that within three months previously, and in the neighborhood of the plaintiffs’ mill, locomotive No. 72 had thrown from its stack very large sparks, was, we think, proper, for the reason that the condition of that engine, during this entire period, was the subject of keen dispute; and the very fact that the defendant’s evidence as to the good order of No. 72 was so strong, makes the admission of any countervailing proof all the more fair.

Railway Co., <a href="/citations/?q=98%20Pa.%20318" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="98 Pa. 318">98 Pa. 318</a>, does not lay down a contrary rule ; it merely holds that proof, generally, of what other engines might do, would be no evidence “ to show that the spark-arrester on engines 21 and 126 were out of order.”</p>

Moreover, their claim that seeing an engine is identification, though the person seeing it cannot distinguish it in any way from any other engine on the road, is not supported by the cases. Inability to identify means inability to produce direct proof as to its conduct, because it is not known. The contention that the offer in the present case differs from that made in Gowen v. Glaser, 3 Cent. R. 109, is not well founded. The evidence held competent and sufficient to show, presumptively, negligent construction and management of unknown engines, in Gowen v.

For the ordinary risks, the landowner is compensated in the damages for right of way; negligence, therefore, is the gist of the action, and the burden of proof is upon the plaintiffs to establish it. And as all engines, whether provided with spark-arresters or not, emit sparks, the mere existence of a fire along the line of the road, caused by sparks from the company’s engines, is not enough to fasten upon the company the charge either of negligence or want of skill: Phila. etc. R.

The effect of this ruling was to establish the principle in Pennsylvania that in case of loss by fire, fairly attributable to sparks from a railroad company’s locomotive engine, the absence of a spark-arrester is prima-facie evidence of negligence on the part : of the company. It is the duty of railroad companies to adopt the best precautions against danger in general use and which experience has shown to be superior and effectual, and to avail themselves of every such known safeguard or generally approved invention to lessen the danger. But mechanical invention and skill have all provided a merely partial protection against the emission of sparks. The mere fact that sparks are thrown from the stack of an engine is not, therefore, evidence in itself of negligence.

In the case cited, the house of the plaintiff, which stood near the track of the defendant’s railroad, was destroyed by fire on the sixth of March, 1872. The plaintiff alleged that the fire originated from sparks thrown from locomotive engine No. 458, belonging to the defendants, which passed his house about the time the fire commenced, and that the throwing of the sparks was from the negligence of the defendants in not having their apparatus in proper order. Mr. Justice Gobdon, in the opinion of the court, says: “ It appears from the evidence, and it was conceded in the argument, that the only locomotive that could have fired the premises in question was that numbered 458, in charge of Alfred Carpenter as engineer. It follows, therefore, that the condition of this engine and its management were all that were legitimately before the court. If it was properly constructed as to its furnace and smoke-stack, and was furnished with a spark-arresting grate of the proper character, the company would not be liable, though the building were burned by fire accidentally issuing from it: Lackawanna etc. R.

If, then, this engine was in a proper condition, it mattered not that every other engine owned by the company was without the proper appliances for preventing the ejection of coals and sparks. On the other hand, if this engine was dangerous in this respect, it was of no consequence that all others upon the road were safe. Such being the case, it is manifest that all evidence going to prove defects in engines belonging to this company, other than the one alleged to have produced the injury complained of, was irrelevant to the issue pending, and should have been excluded.”</p>

Hence, it is entirely clear that evidence that other engines, upon some other day, threw out an unusual amount of large sparks and live coals, was immaterial, and if received could only have confused and might have misled the jury; nor would it have been evidence to show that the spark-arresters on engines 21 and 126 were out of order.” That is to say, for the last sentence is perhaps a little obscure, the fact that other engines, at other times, threw out an unusual amount of large sparks and live coals, would not have been evidence to show that the sparkarresters on engines 21 and 126 were out of order.

The evidence, however, must be confined to its operation at or about the time of the occurrence. In Phila. etc. R. Co. v.

It is not required that the fact be established by direct or positive proof; like any other fact, it may be established by circumstantial evidence ; and, on account of the great difficulty in proving negligence in such cases, any proper evidence from which negligence may be inferred is sufficient to throw the burden on the defendant. “A slight presumption of negligence, however, raised by the plaintiff’s case,” says Mr. Wharton in his Law of Evidence, § 871, “is sufficient to throw the burden of disproving negligence on the defendant. It is a mistake, as has been elsewhere shown, to suppose that negligence can be only proved by positive and affirmatory evidence. There may be no direct proofs of negligence, yet the way in which an injury is done may be such that negligence is the most probable hypothesis by which it can be explained; and when this is so, the defendant must disprove negligence by showing that he exercised care.” In Thompson on Negligence, 159, it is said: “ The business of running railroad trains suggests a unity of management, and a general similarity in the construction of the engines. For this reason, and on account of the difficulty of proving negligence in these cases, as before pointed out, the admission of evidence as to other and distinct fires from the one alleged to have caused the injury is permitted. The rule is adopted in England, and prevails in all the states, with one, or possibly two, exceptions. More particularly, it may be stated as follows: That, in actions for damages caused by the negligent escape of fire from locomotive engines, it is compe<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>tent for the plaintiff to show that, about the time when the fire in question happened, the trains which the company were running past the location of the fire were so managed, in respect to their furnaces, as to be likely to set on fire objects in the position of the property burned, or to show the emission of sparks or ignited matter from other engines of the defendant passing thé spot upon other occasions, either before or after the damage occurred, without showing that they were under the charge of the same driver, or were of the same construction as the one occasioning the damage.” The rule is more precisely stated in Shear. &amp; Redf. on Negligence, § 675, as follows: “When the particular engine which caused the fire cannot be fully identified, evidence that sparks and burning coals were frequently dropped by engines passing on the same road upon previous occasions, is relevant and competent to show habitual negligence, and to make it probable that the plaintiff’s injury proceeded from the same quarter. If the engine which emitted the fire is identified, then evidence on either side as to the condition of other engines, and of their causing fires, has been held irrelevant, but not so if it is not fully identified.”</p>

Two trains had passed about noon. The fire appeared to have commenced at the fence on the road, and burned over the field to the barn. The sparks falling set fire in many other places along the road. The engine from which the sparks were alleged to have been thrown was unknown and unidentified, and the plaintiff proposed to show by a witness who lived nineteen miles distant on the line of the railroad, the extent to which the locomotives on that road going east, on or about the time of the occurrence, threw sparks from the smokestacks. The testimony was admitted. The witness testified that it was “ a common occurrence for the engines to throw sparks, and set fire for rods from the railroad track; they were from a pea to a walnut in size; it appeared worse sometimes than others; they were usually freight trains; sometimes passenger trains,” etc. The admission of this testimony was assigned for error here. In a per Curiam opinion, this court said: “ This was <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>not a case where a certain engine had thrown out the sparks which set fire to plaintiff’s barn; but it was where the engine was unknown, yet the cause of the fire was clearly traced to the railroad track, and left the belief that some one of the engines of the defendant had emitted the coals which set the barn on fire. It therefore became necessary to establish the fact by such proof as rendered the belief a certain fact. This could be done, not by the proof that a certain engine emitted the sparks incessantly; for non constat that this particular engine had passed the plaintiff’s premises that day. Hence it was necessary to permit the party to show that the emitting of coals and sparks in unusual quantities was frequent, and permitted to be done by a number of engines.” In Gowen v. Glaser, 3 Cent. R. 109, the action was for damages for the destruction by fire of the plaintiff’s rags, which were scattered in a field adjoining the defendant’s road. The allegation was that they were set on fire by sparks from the defendant’s engines, but it was not known by what engine. The offer made was as follows: To show that several engines on this road had insufficient spark-catchers ; that the engines of this road had repeatedly set fire to property, and to vegetation along that part of the track, very shortly before and very shortly after this occurrence ; that sparks as large as a hickory-nut escaped in large quantities from the engines, causing these fires; that, after this fire, what remained of the rags, and what was saved, were spread on the field and watched day and night, and that they were set on fire repeatedly by the engines passing on this road. This offer was received to show by circumstantial evidence that the damage was done by some engine with an insufficient spark-arrester. The jury were to infer from the fact that many of the company’s engines, about the time of this occurrence, shortly before and shortly after, emitted sparks of unusual size and quantity, that they were without sufficient spark-arresters; and that, upon consideration of all the evidence, the injury complained of resulted from some one of the engines thus imperfectly constructed. The offer was subsequently enlarged by adding to it a proposition to prove, not that the whole number of defendant’s engines were defective, but that the defendant habitually used engines with defective spark-arresters. The offer, as a whole, was admitted, and in <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>this court was assigned for error. In a per Curiam opinion, this court held that there was no error in the admission of this offer. In Railroad Co. v. Page, 21 W. N. 52, the action was for burning the plaintiff’s barn, one hundred fifty feet distant from the track. The evidence was that the company’s trains had passed the barn shortly before the fire broke out, emitting cinders, smoke, and small sparks about the size of a pea. There was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, to justify the jury in finding that the sparks were of any larger size. It was further shown that the wind was blowing from the track towards the barn, and that sparks had been known to have been blown that distance. It was not shown that any spark-arrester in use would effectually prevent the emission of sparks of this size. Whilst the evidence was, perhaps, sufficient to satisfy the jury that sparks from the engine had caused the fire, there was no proof of any defect in the spark-arresters ; on the contrary, it was shown they were in perfect condition. There was therefore no proof of negligence or mismanagement; and it was upon this ground that we said it would have been the duty of the court below, if a proper request had been made, to instruct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant. ■</p>

The saw-mill, etc., of Richardson, the plaintiff, was burned on the seventh of June, 1870. The evidence tended to show that the fire was communicated from one of two engines belonging to the company; the first, drawing a passenger train westerly, passing the mill about half past 1 o’clock in the afternoon; the other, drawing a freight train easterly, passing it about 4 o’clock the same afternoon. One. half to three fourths of an hour after the last-mentioned train passed by the mill, the fire was discovered burning on the westerly end of a covered railroad bridge, from which it was communicated to the saw-mill. The evidence of the plaintiff in error tended to show that the fire was not communicated by either of the engines complained of, but, on the contrary, from a constant fire at the end of the tramway, about one hundred sixty-three feet down the stream, on the same bank of the river, maintained at the westerly end of the railroad bridge for the purpose of burning edgings, stickings, slabs, and other waste material from the saw-mill. After the company <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>had rested its case, Richardson was allowed to prove that at various times during the same summer,, before this fire occurred, some of the company’s locomotives in an unusual manner scattered fire in passing the mill and bridge, without showing either that those which it was claimed communicated the fire in question were among the number,, or that they were similar in their make, state of repair, or management to said locomotives. The engines were unknown and unidentified. Mr. Justice Steong-, in ruling upon this question, said: “The third assignment of error is that the plaintiff was allowed to prove, notwithstanding objection by the defendant, that at various times during the same summer, before the fire occurred, some of defendant’s locomotives scattered fire when coming past the mill and bridge, without showing that either of those which the plaintiff claimed communicated the fire was among the number, and without showing that the locomotives were similar in their make, their state of repair, or management to those claimed to have caused the fire complained of. The evidence was admitted after the defendant’s ease had closed. But whether it was strictly rebutting or not, if it tended to prove the plaintiff’s case its admission as rebutting was within the discretion of the court below, and not reviewable here. The. question, therefore, is whether it tended in any degree to show that the burning of the bridge, and the consequent destruction of the plaintiff’s property, were caused by any of defendant’s locomotives. The question has often been considered by the courts in this country and in England, and such evidence has, we think, been generally held admissible, as tending to prove the possibility and the consequent probability that some locomotive caused the fire, and as tending to show a negligent habit of the' officers and agents of the railroad company: ” citing Piggot v.

Railroad Co., <a href="/ny/14/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="14 N.Y. 218" data-case-ids="496113" data-case-paths="/ny/14/0218-01">14 N. Y. 218</a>, the plaintiff gave evidence which tended to show that the engines used by the defendant lacked some apparatus which was in use upon some <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>other locomotive engines, and which rendered the latter less liable to communicate fire to substances at the side of the road than those which were without that apparatus; that, shortly before the fire, sparks and fire had been thrown from the engines used by the defendant, in running its trains through the witness’s premises, a greater distance than this building stood from the track of the railroad; and that he had picked up from the track, after the passage of trains, lighted coals more than two inches in length. It was argued by the defendant’s counsel that the evidence was too remote and indefinite ; that it did not refer to any particular engine, etc. Chief Justice Denio, in delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ This argument is not without force, but at the same time I think it is met by the peculiar circumstances of this case. These engines run night and day, and with such speed that no particular note can be taken of them as they pass. Moreover, there is such a general resemblance among them that a stranger to the business cannot readily distinguish one from another. It will therefore generally happen that when the property of a person is set on fire by an engine, the owner, though he may be perfectly satisfied that it was caused by an engine and may be able to show facts sufficient, legitimately, to establish it, yet he may be utterly ignorant what particular engine did the mischief. It would be practically quite impossible, by any inquiries, to find out the offending engine, for a large proportion of those owned by the company are constantly in rapid motion. The business of running the trains on a railroad supposes a unity of management, and a general similarity in the fashion of the engines and the character of operation. I think, therefore, it is competent prima-facie evidence for a person, seeking to establish the responsibility of the company for a burning upon the track of the road, after refuting every other probable cause of the fire, to show that, about the time when it happened, the trains which the company was running past the location of the fire were so managed in respect to the furnaces as to be likely to set on fire objects not more remote than the property burned. It is presumed to be in the power of the company, which is intimately related with all its engineers and conductors, to controvert the fact sworn to if it is untrue, or, if true in a particular instance, that it was not so in respect to the <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>engines which passed the place at a particular time before the occurrence of the fire. The effect of the evidence would only be to shift the onus probandi upon the company, and that, under the circumstances of this case, seems to me to be unavoidable.”</p>

C. 11, which was an action to recover damages for the destruction of plaintiff’s mill by fire falling from one of defendant’s locomotives. What particular engine this was the evidence did not disclose, nor was the plaintiff able to ascertain or make proof of its identification from other engines of the company; but, to strengthen the inference that the burning of the mill originated in sparks from this engine, and to show habitual negligence of the officers and agents of the railroad company, he introduced evidence to show that other engines, of like appearance and construction, frequently scattered fire in large quantities, and set other fires along the track, prior and subsequent to the burning complained of. Mr. Justice Lobd, in delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ On account of this difficulty of identifying a passing engine, especially at night-time, so as to make direct proof of such negligence, and also for the reason, as stated by Mr. Thompson, that the business of running railroad trains supposes a unity of management, and a general similarity in the construction of engines, the admission of evidence as to other and distinct fires from the one alleged to have caused the injury, is permitted. Nor is it requisite that the testimony must also show that the engine which it is claimed caused the fire was one of those which had previously or subsequently scattered fire along defendant’s track, but it is enough, as was shown, that it is similar in appearance and construction, and under the same general management. Hence it is quite generally held that evidence that sparks were frequently ejected from passing engines, causing fire along its track, on other occasions, is relevant and competent to show habitual negligence, and to strengthen and sustain the inference that the fire originated from the cause alleged. As the plaintiff must proceed with his evidence in the first instance, the fact that the defendant may be able to prove the identity of the engine, cannot have the effect to make the admission of such evidence error.” <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>In Field v. Railroad Co., <a href="/ny/32/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="32 N.Y. 339" data-case-ids="16241" data-case-paths="/ny/32/0339-01">32 N. Y. 339</a>, the court, in speaking of this quality of evidence, says: “At all events, it showed that a practice was indulged in on the part of the company, about the time and near the place, which would have injured the plaintiff’s property, rendering it probable, to a certain degree, that the injury was attributable to that cause.”</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[173,688,1173,808]]]'>We have quoted extensively from these authorities to show that the rule of evidence referred to, although, perhaps, comparatively new in its application in Pennsylvania, is the rule generally recognized in this country, not only by the text-writers, but by the courts. It may therefore be considered as settled, in cases of this kind, where the offending engine is not clearly or satisfactorily identified, that it is competent for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant’s locomotives generally, or many of them, at or about the time of the occurrence, threw sparks of unusual size and kindled numerous fires upon that part of their road, to sustain or strengthen the inference that the fire originated from the cause alleged. And as, in the case at bar, it is not definitely ascertained to which of the four engines this fire was attributable, three of them being unknown and unidentified, we cannot see how testimony of this character could be excluded.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[173,1513,1173,913]],["BL_514.1",514,[274,381,1163,802]]]'>But the objective point of the inquiry is the condition of the passing engines at the time of the occurrence. It is a matter of little consequence what may have been their condition ten years or two years before that; for the precautions against fire, and the management of the engines, may have been greatly changed within that period. It does not follow because the company, in its official management, may have been negligent in this respect at a time so remote, that it still remains so. The habits of individuals may, in some sense, be spoken of as fixed habits; but the official control and management of the affairs of a railroad company, as well as the various devices used as precautions against danger, are liable to frequent and radical changes. The line must be drawn somewhere. This class of testimony is exceptional in character at the best, and is only admissible because the ordinary sources of proof are inaccessible, and direct evidence impracticable. The rule should not, therefore, be carried beyond the necessity which justifies its admission. If at or about the time <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>when fires are alleged to have been set by locomotive engines, unknown by number or other means of identification, the company is shown to have been habitually negligent in the equipment or management of its engines, or of many of them, this is a circumstance to be considered in connection with others, not only in determining the origin of the fire, but in deciding whether or not the company was, at the time, in this as in many other instances, negligent in failing to provide suitable precautions against danger. If many of the company’s engines, at or about the time, are without sufficient spark-arresters, and frequent fires are kindled in consequence, it may well be inferred, in-view of the effectual character of mechanical inventions of this kind, not only that the fire in question originated from this cause, but that it occurred from the habitual negligence of the company in failing to provide sufficient spark-arresters.</p>
    <p id="b514-6" data-blocks='[["BL_514.6",514,[268,1193,1166,653]]]'>Reasonable latitude must, of course, be allowed. The purpose of such proofs would be defeated if they were confined to the exact or precise time of the occurrence. In Stranahan’s case, the court admitted proof of the extent to which the various locomotives of the company threw sparks on or about the ninth (sixth) of November, 1867, when the fire occurred. In Growen v. Glaser, the inquiry was as to sparks thrown and fires set very shortly before and very shortly after the occurrence. In Sheldon v. Railroad Co., supra, the inquiry was restricted to matters occurring about the time and near the place of the fire. In Koontz v. Railway Co., the offer was somewhat more extended in its effects, but we are of opinion that the rule should not be given greater latitude than we have given it.</p>

The testimony received under it was, in some instances, confined to two or three months, in some to six months, and in some the testimony was general, and in such form as not to indicate to what period of time it referred. The second offer was: “ To prove that many of the locomotive engines of the defendant, which they cannot identify and which passed the plaintiff’s mill frequently during a period of six months preceding the fire, habitually threw sparks of the size of a hickory-nut, or larger; ” etc. We are of opinion that the admission of these offers was error. The examination should be confined to the negligent operation of the engines of the company at or about the time of the fire, with such reasonable latitude, before and after the occurrence, as is sufficient to enable such proofs to be practicable.</p>
