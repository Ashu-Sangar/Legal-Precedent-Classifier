His. real estate consisted of two lots of ground in the borough of Wrightsville, one of which, on Front street, near the rented store-house occupied by him, was unimproved. He had purchased it with a view to building a residence upon it, thereby making it valuable and productive. Pie was engaged in general merchandise, and so continued to the time of his death. He had also a horse, cow, canal boat, mules for the boating, etc.; also, household property. His whole personal estate was, after his death, appraised at $4,399.09, as found by the auditor. The dwelling-house of the testator rented at $150 per year, after it was vacated by the widow-The testator left to survive him, ten children, five of whom were minors, William, himself, being only twenty-two years of age.</p>

The stock of goods in the store could only retain its value by the business being carried on by the widow or the executors, and by the constant addition of new goods to keep <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>up the stock, an uncertain and hazardous business. The testator did not intend the business of store-keeping and boating to be continued for his estate, or he would have provided for the same in his will. It would have been easy, and that it was not done demonstrates that such was not his intention. His wife, a careful, managing, economical, business woman, as clearly established by the evidence, was the first object of his bounty. She was to be left to struggle alone, after his death, with five minor children, (more when he made his will,) to support, educate and care for. He therefore provided the means of support in his will, by giving his wife the whole of his estate, real and personal, for life, with the right to manage and use the same to support herself and family out of the same. She was not confined to the income and interest, as that would have been inadequate. It was not such a support and maintenance as was intended for her and her children.</p>

These muniments of sale and title are not appropriate to the sale of personalty.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b290-6" data-blocks='[["BL_290.6",290,[258,842,1170,1557]]]'>Fault is found that the widow built out of the moneys of the estate a house and stable on the Front-street lot, and that this was beyond her power. Evidently the will does not contemplate such action or investment of moneys by the executors or the widow, but she paid all the debts of the testator, supported herself and minor children, advanced to her children about $1,000, from time to time as they had use for it, and besides erected a house and stable on said Front-street lot, at an expense of $2,445.01, thereby making it valuable and productive. She erected these buildings, the evidence shows, because the act was contemplated by her husband, in his lifetime, and she piously perfected his plans and intentions. A most credible.showing was made by the accountant of the items of cost of the work and materials for these buildings, the expenditures having been made by his mother. The improvements necessarily enhanced the value of the property to the extent of their cost. The fact that said property was sold,' after the widow’s death, for $2,415, at a time of great depression in real estate values, especially when it is remembered that it was rented for more than six per cent interest on $3,000, counting taxes and repairs, shows that it was a prudent and safe investment of part of the fund bequeathed to the children after the death of the widow, and is still available. It is included in the balance, now claimed by the legatees, in this distribution. This complaint about the management of their widowed mother, of her affairs, comes with bad grace from her children, or some of them, who are not content with recovering their shares out of the real estate she improved as above shown, but are striving to compel their brother, the surviving executor, to pay them again out of his own pocket by this effort to surcharge the accountant.</p>
