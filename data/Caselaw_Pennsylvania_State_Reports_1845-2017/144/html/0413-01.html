Ridelsperger, post, 423. In cases coming up from counties outside of Philadelphia, rarely, if ever, is a formal bill of exceptions shown; only an “ appendix ” containing such of the pleadings as it was thought proper to print, and a verbatim copy of the stenographer’s notes of testimony, translated into longhand. Exceptions to the rulings on offers of testimony and to the charge are usually noted, but seldom do the printed notes show an actual sealing of an exception, which is done, of course, only by the signature and seal of the trial judge. When exceptions are sealed at all, the signature and seal of the judge follow immediately the ruling excepted to. But, in Philadelphia, the regular practice is to present and have sealed by the trial judge a formal “ bill of exceptions ” showing, briefly, all the proceedings on the trial, and the offers and rulings excepted to fully and carefully, the whole certified at the end and signed and sealed by the trial judge. This bill of exceptions is then printed in the appendix to the paper-book. The entire subject is clearly discussed, and forms given, in 2 Brewst. Pr., § 3057, et seq., p. 1249 Rep.</p>

Such an arrangement was unusual, perhaps improbable, but the appellant had a right to give it in evidence, and ask the.jury to believe it; and, if they did so, it would put the occurrence in a different light, perhaps <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>even to the extent of justifying the prisoner in attempting to eject Osborne forcibly.
