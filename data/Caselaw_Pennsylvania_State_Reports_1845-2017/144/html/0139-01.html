On January 6th, M. H. Mathews, as M. H. Mathews &amp; Co., made an assignment of all his estate, real and personal, to J. D. Armstrong, for the benefit of his creditors. Mr. R. P. Kennedy had charge of all the said executions, and represented the assignee after the assignment was made. On January 8th, Mr. Kennedy gave written directions to the sheriff to make a levy on said writs, and to place J. D. Armstrong, plaintiff in one of them and the defendant’s assignee, in charge of the property of the defendant and assignor, the assignee to account to the sheriff for all sales of goods made and of goods, etc., in stock from date, and not to execute any of the writs until further notice. Mr. Kennedy testified that there was no design “ to withhold execution of the writs to keep the property from the other creditors. The only desire was to have Armstrong sell these goods to the best advantage, and turn the money over to the sheriff, so as to reach as far as possible in paying the judgment creditors.” Thereupon, the assignee, having given bond and filed an inventory and appraisement, took charge of the stock of goods assigned, employing the assignor and his daughter Luella A. Mathews as clerks, the former at $85, and the latter at $25 per month. About fifteen months were taken up in disposing of the goods, and out of the receipts from sales new goods to the amount of $2,336.32 were purchased to help sell the old. Out of said receipts, also, were paid to the execution creditors, from time to time, the sums represented by the vouchers 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, as well as the clerk hire and other expenses of managing the trust-estate.</p>

The sum represented by voucher 17, $115.59, paid to sheriff Miller on April 25, 1888, on Mrs. Martha S. Mathews’ judgment, the auditor was of the opinion stood upon different ground. All the executions issued January 4, 1887, were returnable the first Monday of March following. The writs were marked “ stayed ” by Mr. Kennedy, when the assignee was ready to file his account. On April 9, 1888, however, an alias writ of fieri facias was issued upon the judgment in favor of Mrs. Mathews, upon which writ certain real estate of the assignor was sold by the sheriff on April 30th. The auditor, citing Missimer v. Ebersole, <a href="/pa/87/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="87 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1057843" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0109-01">87 Pa. 109</a>, was of the opinion that this alias fieri facias and the levy under it amounted to an abandonment of the levy upon the original fieri facias, and therefore, that the payment to Mrs. Mathews’ judgment of $115.59 out of the personal estate on April 25, 1888, was invalid. The validity of the several judgments on which the executions were issued was sustained by the auditor, on the evidence submitted, but, finding that there was unnecessary delay on the part of the assignee in closing out the stock of goods, he surcharged the accountant as follows:</p>

In the account the assignee claimed credits for moneys paid to the sheriff on executions against the assignor, and for moneys expended for clerk hire and other assistance in disposing of a stock of merchandise. To these credits Campbell &amp; Dick, J. Ullman &amp; Co., and Joseph Horne &amp; Co. filed exceptions, on the ground that the expenditures in the conversion of the goods were unnecessary and excessive, and that the judgments which supported the executions were collusive and fraudulent.</p>

In strict compliance with this agreement the assignee disposed of the property and ac<a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>counted for the moneys received for it. The gross amount of the sales was three thousand dollars less than the face of the executions, and, applied in the order of lien, was not enough to satisfy five of them with their accrued interest and costs. In this connection it should be mentioned that the fund realized from these sales was all that remained for the creditors of the assignor, as his real estate had been sold and its proceeds appropriated to the mortgages and judgments according to their priority. It should also be stated here that it was not claimed by any creditor that the property, real or personal, was sold for less than its value. Upon these facts, it is clear that, if the five executions referred to were valid, neither the general creditors nor the holders of subsequent executions have any standing to contest the expenditures connected with the sale of the personalty. The auditor has found that these executions represented an actual bona-fide indebtedness of the assignor, and that there was no fraud in the confession of the judgments which supported them. The court below has approved the findings, and we think the evidence justifies them. The agreement under which the property was sold by the assignee was valid, and advantageous to all concerned: Kent’s App., <a href="/pa/87/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="87 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="1057817" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0165-01">87 Pa. 165</a>. There is nothing in the evidence to justify an inference that the executions were issued for the mere purpose of lien. The directions to the sheriff, under date of January 8, 1887, must be considered together and in connection with the agreement. Besides, as was said by the present Chief Justice, in the case cited: “ This is a matter, however, of which the defendant cannot complain. The execution in such case is good against him. It is postponed only as to purchasers and subsequent execution creditors. An assignee for creditors is not a purchaser. He is a mere volunteer: Ritter v. Brendlinger, 8 P. F. S. 68; Missimer v. Ebersole, reported, ante, page 109. The assignee claims through the assignor. His rights rise no higher. The creditors claim through the assignee. They have his title, nothing more.”</p>
    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[291,2137,1160,296]],["BL_171.1",171,[123,389,1168,653]]]'>The alias fieri facias on the Martha Mathews judgment was not an abandonment of the levy on the prior writ upon the personalty. The property included in that levy had been disposed of when the alias writ was issued; the proceeds of it were appropriated by the agreement under which it was sold, and no execution creditor excepted to the return of the sheriff, <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>or the account of the assignee. It is certain that there was no intention to abandon the levy, and it is clear that the facts do not bring the case within the principle of Missimer v. Ebersole, <a href="/pa/87/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="87 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1057843" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0109-01">87 Pa. 109</a>. It follows from these views that the fund arising from the sale of property by the assignee belonged to the five executions mentioned. It was paid upon them, and whether it was reduced by unnecessary or excessive expenditures in the sale was a matter which only concerned the holders of the executions. We think, as against the parties contesting them, the assignee was entitled to the credits claimed in his account, and that the exceptions thereto should have been dismissed. This conclusion leaves no fund from which to pay the costs of audit, and the parties who made them should bear the burden.</p>
