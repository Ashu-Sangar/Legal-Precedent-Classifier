I agree with the learned counsel for some of the defendants, Mr. Corbett, that, under the law, the merger should be of one existing railroad company into another existing railroad company. But I do not agree with him that, because two railroad companies have merged into a new company, or into a company with a new name, such merger is so illegal as to constitute a valid defence in favor of the subscribers to the capital stock of one of the companies, in a suit by judgment creditors of the new corporation. The law carefully gives a remedy to the stockholders, if they are dissatisfied with or object to the consolidation. Section 8, act of May 16,1861, P. L. 708, entitled “ An Act relating to railroad companies,” provides for the disposition of the stock of dissatisfied stockholders, in cases of consolidated companies. Section 2 of the same act provides for <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>notice to the stockholders, of the intended consolidation and method of voting thereon. The forms of law have been gone through with, and the agreement of consolidation of the two companies has been filed in the proper office at Harrisburg. No objection to this consolidation was raised by any one of these defendants so far as we are advised by the evidence. After all this, it will be presumed that the law was complied with so far as notice to them of the intended consolidation was concerned, and that they were satisfied with the merger. But, more than that; in this case several of the defendants have dealt with the new corporation in various ways. In so far, they have invited others to deal with the consolidated corporation, and I think are held out to the world to give it credit.</p>

I think this would be a complete defence in an action by the corporation to recover unpaid subscriptions to its capital stock. But it does not follow that a defence, good between the subscriber to its capital stock and the corporation, is good in a suit between such subscriber and a creditor of the corporation.

Yet, if a subscriber, knowing that the requisite subscriptions had not been obtained, should attend meetings of the corporation and co-operate in votes for expending money and for making contracts, or take part in any other acts which could be properly done only upon the assumption that the capital of the company had been fully subscribed, he would not be permitted to refuse to contribute his proportion of capital, upon the ground that the amount required b}r the charter had not been subscribed.” In § 134 of the same work it is said: “ For similar reasons, it has been held that a stockholder might he estopped by his conduct from setting up as a defence to an action for calls, that the number of shares required by law to authorize the corporation to be formed have not been subscribed.” It is urged, in opposition to this view, that those dealing with the corporation are bound to know that all the stock has not been subscribed to. There is some force in this view; yet I think that those persons who originate a corporation should see that it does not act, until the implied condition on which they subscribed has been complied with; and that when it does act, persons dealing with it have a right to assume that the precedent conditions have been complied with.</p>

It is the stock that is canceled and not the subscriptions for stock. Any other construction would have been to denude the consolidated company of all advantages from the subscriptions to the capital stock of the two companies merged in it.</p>

But, aside from this consideration, it is by no means clear that the agreement to transfer to the Mahoning Improvement Co. $6,000,000 of the full-paid capital stock of the defendant company, would have operated to convey this unpaid-.subscription owing by the defendants.</p>

But it is insolvent, and these creditors have exhausted every remedy at law against it in vain. It is not possible for the corporation, or these defendants, to defeat their right of action, through either neglecting or refusing to make a call upon the unpaid subscriptions for means to pay them.

No question seems to have been raised as to the regularity of such joinder, and of course that case is not decisive on that point. The nature of the relief sought, the relation of the deceased and living parties with each other, and with the defendant corporation, make the case one peculiarly for a court of equity to determine. No full and just determination of the case can be made without considering the rights of Thomas K. Litch, deceased. A proceeding against his administrator in the Orphans’ Court would deprive his estate of the advantage and relief obtainable in a court of equity. The powers of the Orphans’ Court are not adequate to deal with all the questions that might arise; especially, to equalize liability and enforce contribution among the subscribers to the capital stock. And there is no good reason why these should be compelled to have the question between them determined in two separate courts, when one court is fully competent to administer entire justice to all the parties. It may be necessary ultimately to go into the Orphans’ Court, to enforce the liability ascertained in this proceeding against the estate of Thomas K. Litch, deceased.

The entire unpaid subscription of each subscriber is liable for the payment of a creditor. There does not seem to be much good reason why the creditors should concern themselves about the adjustment of the payments among the debtors. The latter have taken no action to bring about the payment of the creditors. Such payment comes, if at all, after the end of the litigation. Besides, some of the defendants are non-residents of the state, and it may or may not be that some of them are insolvent.

(1) There never existed such a corporation as the Mahoning &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Company. It is alleged to have been created by act of April 19, 1854, P. L. (1855) 687, and the supplements thereto. The last of the supplements, act of April 5, 1873, P. L. 587, extended the time of completion four years. But it does not appear that a patent was ever issued, nor was there evidence that there ever was an organization under the acts before December 6, 1881; and the sole evidence of organization at that date is contained in the articles of consolidation dated that day, and the certificate of approval by a vote of 510 shares of stock on December 20, 1881. No part of the road was ever built or completed, nor was a single step ever taken towards it. The time to build and complete having expired, the special acts ceased to have any validity ; and they are void for the additional reason that all such special acts were annulled by § 1, article XVI. of the constitution. After the expiration of the time fixed by law, the defence of non-completion can be set up as a valid defence, in a collateral action for the recovery of stock subscriptions: MeCully v.

As in the case of the Mahoning &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Co., no letters patent were ever issued to the Conewango &amp; Clarion Railroad Co., and such a corporation as the latter never had a legal existence.

The power of consolidation, granted by § 1, act of May 16, 1861, P. L. 702, is by the terms of the grant limited to “chartered” companies. No power is.granted to consolidate an unchartered corporation with a chartered one ; still less, to consolidate a chartered corporation with an absolute nonentity, or to consolidate two such fictions. “ That there never was such a person or corporation as the plaintiff, goes to the right of action and is pleadable in bar: ” Northumb.

If liable at all the liability is claimed to have arisen from their subscription to the stock of the Conewango &amp; Clarion company. That company never opened any subscription books and never issued any stock. The only subscription alleged to have been made was contained in the original articles of association of that company. A corporation cannot sustain an action against one who, before it was chartered, signed a paper with others agreeing to take a certain quantitjr of its stock and afterwards refused to do so : Strasburg R.

While the articles of consolidation provided that the subscribers to each of the companies were entitled to receive stock on the subscriptions that were canceled, yet, unless the subscribers elected to receive, or did receive it, they were not bound by the subscription.

The company, if the corporation existed either de jure or de facto, could lawfully appropriate the same for that purpose. The sale and setting aside of all the stock, by the contract of December 21, 1881, between the defendant company and the Mahoning Improvement Co., was for that purpose, and the covenant of the improvement company was a full and valuable consideration for the transfer. There is no question as to the bona fides of that contract. And there is no evidence that any of the present alleged debts then existed; the evidence shows they did not. The articles of consolidation canceled the subscription, and left all the stock in the ownership and possession of the consolidated company. The option of the stockholders, unaccepted by them, did not vest any stock in them, nor entitle them to any unless accepted ; and before any stock was accepted, the consolidated company disposed of all of it to the improvement company. By virtue of that transfer, the liability for stock of the Conewango &amp; Clarion Railroad Co., if any existed, enured to the benefit of the improvement company, in preference to the creditors of the consolidated company, whose debts were afterward contracted.</p>

Stock, in cases of insolvency, is due as an entirety. It is due to the aggregate of the creditors ; and only so much is due as is requisite to discharge the indebtedness of the corporation, after all other assets have been thereto applied. As a necessary consequence, there must be an account of debts, assets, and unpaid <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>capital taken. When such an account has been taken, and the amount required from each stockholder has been ascertained, an assessment ordering the payment of such proportionate amount by each may be made. This is the doctrine of Lane’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=105%20Pa.%2067" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="105 Pa. 67">105 Pa. 67</a>, which declares further: “Except in cases where the corporate authorities have themselves made calls which are authorized by the subscription contracts, there is absolutely no liability of any kind whatever on the part of the'stockholder to pay any part of his unpaid capital, except under and by force of an assessment made as above stated.” The only exception to this mode of procedure is where the whole of the unpaid stock is necessary to pay the creditors. The general principle is recognized and the exception declared in Citizens etc. Bank v.

L. 702, and the various supplements thereto, that the liabilities of the constituent companies, as well as their assets, passed to the new company. One important asset of the Conewango &amp; Clarion Railroad Co. was the subscriptions by the defendants to its stock. Both by virtue of the agreement of consolidation and by force of the statutes, that subscription became an asset of the defendant corporation. Simultaneously with the extinguishment of the liability of these subscribers to the old company, came the assumption of a new liability to the corporation defendant. It was but the substitution of a new for on old obligation. But the old obligation was not extinguished until the substitution was complete. The issuance and acceptance of certificates of stock do not affect the liability of the subscriber upon his agreement to pay; and the cancellation of the old stock certificates did not cancel the subscriptions.

The returns to the writs of fieri facias, and the decree pro confesso determined this question. And there was a determination of the amount of debts owed by the defendant corporation and who the creditors were, and for anything that appeared before the master that was all the indebtedness. Besides, upon payment by these defendants, the court can still retain the bill, to work out the equities of contribution among the several stockholders.

    <p id="b85-5" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[133,897,1167,1417]]]'>It would be tedious to detail all the proceedings in relation to the organization of these companies, and the merger of the first two companies into a consolidated corporation under the name of the Clarion, Mahoning &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company. All this has been carefully done by the learned master. It is enough to say that the merger sufficiently appeared by the certificate of the secretary of the commonwealthand the effect of it was, under the third section of the act of May 16, 1861, P. L. 702, to vest in the consolidated company all the property, rights and franchises of said companies, subject to all rights of their respective creditors. The consolidated company is estopped by'the decree pro confesso from alleging that it is not a corporation de jure, and liable as charged in the bill to the plaintiffs, who are the appellees here, and who have recovered judgments against it in actions at law. It is idle, as against creditors, to set up the defence that the corporation had no legal existence. It had sufficient existence to contract debts, and, in the interests of its creditors, it must at least be treated as a de-facto corporation. And if there is anything settled in the law, it is that the existence of a corporation de facto cannot be inquired into- collaterally: Cochran v. Arnold, <a href="/pa/58/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="58 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="1013184" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0399-01">58 Pa. 399</a>. Much less can such a corporation, or a stockholder therein, set up a defect in its charter as against a creditor who has contracted with it upon the faith of its charter. We are not considering the case of a subscriber to shares who refuses to pay his subscription on the ground that the organization has not been perfected, and the cases cited upon this point have no application.</p>

This bill was filed to enforce this personal liability against certain of the stockholders. The corporation itself is admittedly insolvent. It does not appear to have any available assets. While it is well settled that a single creditor may not sue a particular stockholder at law, and thus secure an advantage over other stockholders; see Lane’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="105 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="454279" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0049-01">105 Pa. 49</a>; yet this bill was filed by or on behalf of all the creditors against the corporation and its stockholders, precisely as was done in Lane’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="105 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="454279" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0049-01">supra.</a> The rights of all parties, therefore, can be adjusted in the one. proceeding, and the decree of the court below is so framed as to compel contribution in case any one defendant is required to pay more than his just proportion.</p>

Litch in Warren county, for the reason that he is sued as administrator of Thomas K. Litch, deceased, the domicile of said administrator being in Jefferson county, in which county the letters of administration were taken out. See eleventh assignment. This objection is based upon the ground that the Orphans’ Court of Jefferson has the exclusive jurisdiction over the estate of said decedent. It may be conceded that the estate of Thomas K. Litch cannot be distributed by the Common Pleas of Warren, but no such question arises here. It is not a question of distribution, but of the fixing of a liability or of a right. When that is ascertained, it will be for the Orphans’ Court of Jefferson to decide to what extent it can be enforced against the estate. That will depend upon the amount of the estate and the rights of other creditors. Aside from this, it must not be overlooked that it was a bill in equity, and that the court acquired jurisdiction over E. A. Litch, administrator, because said court had “ acquired jurisdiction of the subject matter in controversy, by the service of its process on one or more of the principal defendants: ” Act of April 6, 1859, P. L. 887. No question appears to have been raised as to the regularity of the proceeding under this act. It was urged that the administrator should not have been joined with living par<a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>ties, and we are asked, what execution would issue on a judgment against a survivor and the representative of a deceased party ? If this were a judgment at law there would have been more force in this suggestion ; but a court of equity can always mould its decrees to meet the difficulties of the case, and do no injustice to any one.</p>
