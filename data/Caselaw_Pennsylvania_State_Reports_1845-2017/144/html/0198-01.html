Evans, all his household goods, carriage horses, carriages and other chattels, and twenty-five hundred dollars, absolutely; then his dwelling-house during her life; then he bequeathed fifty thousand dollars to his executors, in trust to pay her the interest thereof, after deducting expenses, semi-annually. As before stated, Robert A. Evans accepted a deed, being the purchaser at.an Orphans’ Court sale by the administrators of James Woodrow, deceased, charged with the widow’s dower, to wit, $394.45, and paid the interest on the same during his life and up to his death. And the widow of the said Robert A.

The devisees of said farm are therefore restricted in the enjoyment of their devise, it being encumbered with the said Woodrow dower and. also the statutory dower of $1,000, the interest payable to the widow of Robert A. Evans, and the interest on said sum at six per cent during the lifetime of the said widow.</p>
