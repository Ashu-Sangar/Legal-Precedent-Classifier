N. 432, the court says that a sheriff’s sale under a mortgage will be set aside for uncertainty in the description of the premises, even though it follows the mortgage. In the case before us, the testimony shows a misdescription of the property; the posting of bills, intended to be put up on the property to be sold, on property not included in the writs, as well as a failure on the part of the sheriff to serve the writ, or give notice of the writ or bills of sale, upon or to the defendant.</p>

Gordon, 1 Bro. 320, the court says that the notice must be proved by the sheriff; but that it need not he a written or printed notice. In Topple v. Taylor, 6 S. &amp; R. 173, the Supreme Court says that when the law directs the sheriff to give notice of the sale (on a levari facias), it is presumed that he performed his duty. But this presumption may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary. When such evidence is produced as renders it probable that notice was not given, the burden of proving the notice is thrown upon the person who claims under the deed, (in a case like the present, upon the sheriff.) This has been the construction and general practice under the act of assembly. In re real estate of Lucas Raubenhold, 1 Woodw. 478, rule to set aside a sheriffs sale, it was held, that the defendant had the statutory right to demand any reasonable number of additional advertisements, to be disposed of at his own discretion, if he had thought such a demand to be expedient. And, in Daniel Miller’s Appeal, the court says: “ A court is bound to protect parties from the negligence, mistakes, and errors of its officers, and the power should be liberally exercised, where the rights of others do not intervene.”</p>
