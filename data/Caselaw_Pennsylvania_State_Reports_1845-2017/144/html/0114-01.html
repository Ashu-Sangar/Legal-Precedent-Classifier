According to all the evidence, he put in that spring about five million seven hundred and twenty thousand and some feet of logs. The act of assembly anthorizes these companies to charge a reasonable amount of tolls, not exceeding ten cents per thousand feet, for floating logs over the streams for which the charters are granted.

It seems to you, I do not doubt, a great hardship that the defendant was not allowed to give evidence tending to support that allegation; but we have excluded all that kind of evidence, and we are constrained to say from the act of assembly, as we understand it, and we say it not without some doubts, that you have, and the court have nothing to do with that question; that what is a reasonable charge per thousand feet, is not for the court to fix, and not for the jury to fix, but is for the company itself to fix, the law simply fixing the maximum price beyond which the}’' cannot go..... But we feel constrained to say to you that this plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action the amount which it charged, ten cents per thousand feet for all the logs that the defendant Ives floated out of the stream during the year 1889; that was, five million seven hundred and twenty thousand feet and upwards, with interest upon that amount.

The condition of the bond is in exact conformity with the requirement of the fifth section. It was duly approved by the court on March 24, 1888, and was therefore a full compliance with the statutory requirement in that regard. It is still contended, however, that the plaintiff was obliged to file another bond under the fourth section of the act, before it could exercise its corporate franchise. While we do not consider that the defendant is entitled to raise this question, in the present collateral proceeding, an examination of the fourth section satisfies us that there was no necessity for the giving of any other bond than the one required by the fifth section. The fourth section merely provides a method of proceeding for the assessment of damages sustained by the owners of dams and land along the streams, and simply directs that when the company and the owner cannot agree as to the damages, the assessment shall be made under the forty-first section of the act of 1874, to which the act of 1883 is a supplement. Upon recurring to that section, we find that it contains an elaborate provision for the assessment of damages by the appointment of viewers whose proceedings are prescribed in about the <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>usual manner in which views for such purposes are conducted. The section contains a further provision that when the parties cannot agree upon the amount of the damages to be paid, the corporation shall tender a bond to the party claiming damages, with condition that the corporation will pay such amount of damages as the party shall be entitled to receive, after the same shall have been agreed upon by the parties or assessed in the manner provided for in the act. It is plain that the duty to tender this bond arises as a part of the proceedings for the assessment of damages in the cases covered by the act of 1874. Had the .act of 1883 contained no other provision for the giving of a bond than is contained in the act of 1874, it would have been necessary for the plaintiff to have given the bond required by that act. But the act of 1883 does contain a specific provision for the giving of a bond in its fifth section. The condition of the bond there required to be given is for the indemnification of “ all and every person whose property may be injured by reason of the construction and operation of the improvements of the corporation.” As this language is broad enough to include all owners of dams and lands on the stream in question, it is manifest that it is ample to confer every remedy afforded by the bond required by the forty-first section of the act of 1874. The giving of such a bond, therefore, is entirely unnecessary when the bond required by the fifth section of the act of 1883 has been given. The first assignment of error is not sustained.</p>

The right to appropriate the stream for the purpose of floating logs upon it was conferred by the act of 1883, under which the plaintiff was organized. It could not be tolerated that the right to exercise the franchise and collect the tolls allowed.by the act, should be defeated by objections which deny the necessity of the franchise, or call in question the degree of perfection in the improvements made by the company. Although it might be possible for an owner to float his logs upon the natural state of the water, and without assistance from the dams, at times, that is no reason why the company may not claim the fruits of its franchise; and so also as to its right to collect tolls, which <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>is called in question under the sixth and seventh assignments. So long as the company keeps within the discretionary limit fixed by the .statute, its right to collect the tolls cannot be defeated, nor its discretion to fix the amount questioned,</p>
    <p id="b149-4" data-blocks='[["BL_149.5",149,[156,591,1170,1821]]]'>All of this was decided in the cases of Boyle v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/54/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="54 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="1006265" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0310-01">54 Pa. 310</a>, and Cumberland V. R.

J., said: “ The company has therefore the clear warrant of the charter for demanding the aggregate of the sums, viz., seven cents per mile per ton, for private freight in their own cars on their own road. Within this limit no court can interfere with them. This is settled by the charter, and by the decision in the case of Boyle v. Phila. &amp; Reading R. Co., supra. The master finds that the company has not transcended this limit, and the court, very properly concurring with the master, dismissed this portion of the bill.” In the case of Parke’s App., <a href="/pa/64/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="64 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="1021245" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0137-01">64 Pa. 137</a>, we held that the court has no right to interfere with a company’s location of their road, on the score of preference, within the limit of their charter.

We are clearly of opinion that the learned judge was right in excluding evidence of this character, and also in his answers to the points in which the same question was presented. The discretion of the company in locating its road cannot be reviewed in this manner. The location was made in the exercise of an undoubted power.” It was said in Parke’s App., <a href="/pa/64/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="64 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="1021245" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0137-01">64 Pa. 137</a>: “ Neither the court below nor this court has any right to interfere with the location made by the company on the score of preference, if any be felt. The only question is whether it has or has not exceeded a discretion on the subject, apparent on the face of the act of incorporation.” In the case of Bennett’s Branch Imp. Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/65/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="65 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="430628" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0242-01">65 Pa. 242</a>, in which the company was authorized to clear out, improve, and use Bennett’s branch, to use dams erected and erect new dams, and to use all of said dams and the waters of the said stream in the floating of saw-logs down the same, Thompson, C. J., in delivering the opinion, said: .</p>

      <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>“ The company, having authority by law to improve the stream in the manner prescribed, for the consideration of taking toll on the lumber and logs floated thereon, would not lose its franchises, because tlie improvement was in fact not beneficial, there being no such condition prescribed. The legislature determined that question in granting the charter; and all the franchises granted will remain, in the absence of any limitation, until taken away by some direct action for that purpose, legislative or judicial. . . . The right to impose tolls as a consideration for the completion of an enterprise intended to benefit the public, is a right of government. It is conceded to the promoters as a compensation for the benefit, in contemplation of law, which every individual receives for an improved mode of transit of person or property. Individual complaints avail nothing against the right. These individual inconveniences must yield to the wants of the whole public. In most of these cases of improved navigation by companies or the state, if not all, individuals have always been found who would claim to be as well off without such improvements as with them; and yet they are obliged to pass over them with their property, and pay tolls. There is no reason in this for impeaching the validity of the law. This results from the aecidency of location, and of this nobody is to blame but the owner, and he must submit to all legal consequences incident thereto.”</p>

As we have already held that this is a subject within the discretion of the company, we think there was no error in this portion of the charge. We are bound to consider that,’ so long as the charge did not exceed ten cents per one thousand, it was reasonable within the contemplation of the law.</p>

The full amount charged was ten cents per one thousand upon the number of feet of logs floated as stated in the testimony, and it is not claimed that there was any error in the court’s statement of the quantity. It is true that the court did direct a verdict absolutely in favor of the plaintiff, although the right of recovery depended upon oral testimony. This ordinarily would be error, as it includes substantially an instruction that the jury must believe the plaintiff’s witnesses, and that is a subject over which the jury has exclusive control. The ninth assignment is in violation of our rule of court, as it does not contain the language of the court in totidem verbis. Expressed as it is, and discussed as it is, it complains only of the amount charged, and not of the direction to find for the plaintiff. Were we at liberty to reverse for the technical error of the charge in this respect, we do not think any interest of the defendant would be subserved by our doing so. We prefer to say, therefore, that we disregard this feature of the assignment, because it is not properly expressed, nor is the question itself anywhere discussed in the argument for the appellant.</p>

Moreover, this point was not made in the court below, and no exception on the record raises the question.</p>
