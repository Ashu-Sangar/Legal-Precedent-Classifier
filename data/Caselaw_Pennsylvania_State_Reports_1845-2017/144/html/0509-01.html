This claim may be subdivided, first, into a claim for damages for the fouling of the stream; second, for damages to the land which was injured or destroyed by the overflowing of the stream and the deposit of culm upon it; and third, for the depreciation in value of his whole farm.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b538-8" data-blocks='[["BL_538.7",538,[249,1936,1175,501]],["BL_539.1",539,[132,387,1171,1068]]]'>Now, the defendants are liable to him for such injui’y as they caused. This is the law; it is conceded by the defendants. They had no right, in law, to deposit this culm in the stream in such a way that it would be carried upon the plaintiff’s land, and for such injuries as they caused by so doing they are liable. Now, if the whole injury which the plaintiff suffered was simply that done to the land which has heen covered by the culm, then his measure of damages would be the difference in the value of that land by reason of the deposit. If the land is totally destroyed in value, then his damages would be the value <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>of the land. If it is not totally destroyed in value, but is depreciated in value, then his damages would be the difference between the value of the land before the deposit, and the value of the land after the deposit, in October, 1887, at the time the suit was brought. That would be the damages which he would be entitled to recover from the parties who caused this deposit to be made; and the defendants would be liable for only such proportion of the damage as they caused. According to the testimony in the case, the Highland Coal Co., or G. B. Markle &amp; Co., had two breakers on the same stream, above defendants’ breaker. It is testified by Mr. Leisenring, I believe, that one of these had been in operation for eleven years, and the other, one year, before the defendants began; and it is alleged upon the part of-the defendants and, indeed, it is not denied, that to some extent at least, the Highland Coal Co., or G. B. Markle &amp; Co., deposited culm in such a way that it was carried down the stream; and it is apparent here from the testimony, that the injury which the plaintiff suffered was to some extent, at least, caused by the action of the Highland Coal Co., or G. B. Markle &amp; Co. The defendants would be liable for only the damages caused by them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b539-5" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[131,1462,1170,350]]]'>Now, in deciding that question, you are authorized to take into consideration the nature of the stream, the location of these several breakers, the length of time they had been in operation, and the difference in the methods of preparing coal for the market. I shall not refer to these matters in detail, but you will take them into consideration in determining what was the proportion of injury caused by the defendants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b539-6" data-blocks='[["BL_539.6",539,[131,1818,1170,602]],["BL_540.1",540,[279,390,1172,1011]]]'>It is claimed on the part of the plaintiff that, in addition to the depreciation or total destruction of the value of the land covered by the culm, he has also suffered damages by reason of the fouling of the stream, so that it is now unfit for culinary purposes, and for drinking purposes, either by man or beast. If at the time the defendants commenced their operations, the stream was pure, or nearly so, and was rendered impure by their acts, then that would be a proper fact to take into consideration in estimating the damages. If, however, the value of the stream was destroyed for these purposes by the action of G. B. Markle &amp; Co., before the defendants commenced their operations, then it would not be a proper fact for your consideration, <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>for two reasons: First, if the value of the stream had been destroyed for such purposes, then it would have no value to lose; and in the second place, G. B. Markle &amp; Co., according to the testimony, have paid the plaintiff for such damages and injuries as they had caused him, and for such as they might cause him in the future, in the preparation of their coal. It is claimed, in the third place, by the plaintiff, that he is entitled to recover damages, because, in addition to the destruction for farming purposes of the land which has been covered by culm, the rest of his farm has been depreciated in value. The mere fact that this culm is unsightly, is not of itself a fact to be considered upon this branch of the case. If, however, it affected the market value of the rest of the land, it would be a proper fact to be considered. Therefore, if you find, as a matter of fact, that the farm as a whole was injured in its market value, then the difference in the fair market value before the deposits of culm, and its fair market value when this suit was brought, in 1887, would be the measure of damages ; bearing in mind, however, what has been said before, that the defendants are liable only for that proportion of the damages which they caused.....</p>

The injury to which the plaintiff was subjected was of' such a character that, as between individuals who may have caused it, it could not have been divisible, so as to ascertain and determine what part each may have caused. It was such that if there had been two persons who committed it, the results to the plaintiff would have been the same. Hence, when the plaintiff executed the release in evidence, it was a quit-claim and discharge of the whole injury that had been done to him. Moreover, Sandy Run creek was not a public highway at the points where the mine-waste entered it, but was the private property of the Highland Coal Co. and the defendants; so that these operators, at their respective works, did no injury to any person and violated no legal right. They were carrying on the process of anthracite-coal mining as it is carried on in the locality where they operated, and in the approved way, upon their own private property. On their own land, therefore, they committed no wrong: Penna. Coal Co. v.

The liability commenced with the act of the defendants on their own premises, and this act was separate from and independent of the acts of others. The defendants’ act being several when it was committed, cannot be made joint because of the consequences which followed in connection with others who had done the same or a similar act.</p>

The creek has its source in the mountains, about four or five miles above Gallagher’s land through which it passes. The defendants’ operations were commenced in the year 1877. The plaintiff alleges that in the process of washing <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>their coal, the refuse, culm, and dirt were conducted in chutes, which emptied the dirt into the creek, and by the waters of the creek were carried to and thrown upon his meadow land, covering twenty acres or more, and rendering the land barren and wholly unproductive. It appears, however, that the Highland Coal Co., operated by Markle &amp; Co., had been mining coal several miles above on the same stream from 1864, and that that company has ever since been so engaged continuously to the bringing of this suit. The plaintiff alleges that the culm and dirt from both these mines could, at a moderate and reasonable expense, have been banked, and if this had been done no appreciable injury would have resulted; and, further, that the Highland Coal Co., to some extent at least, pursued this plan, but the defendant company dumped the refuse of their mines directly into the stream. In August, 1884, Bernard Gallagher, in consideration of the sum of four hundred dollars, by formal writing under seal released the Highland Coal Co. from all claims and demands for damages, and from compensation for injuries then or thereafter done to his property, either from' the pollution of the stream, or from the deposit of refuse matter upon his lands by that company. It may be fairly inferred from this that the Highland Coal Co. did, in some degree, contribute to the injuries of which the plaintiff complains.</p>
    <p id="b543-6" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[135,1625,1166,95]]]'>At the trial, the defendant presented a point for instruction to the jury, as follows:</p>
    <p id="b543-7" data-blocks='[["BL_543.5",543,[135,1727,1167,448]]]'>“That, as it appears from the evidence that the plaintiff settled with Markle &amp; Co. for damages sustained by him for the fouling of Sandy Run and the deposit of culm on his land by them, and it being impossible, under the evidence, to separate and ascertain the proportion of damage caused by them and by the defendants, it having been occasioned by simultaneous and contemporaneous acts, the settlement must be regarded as an accord and satisfaction for the whole damage, and the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.”</p>
    <p id="b543-8" data-blocks='[["BL_543.6",543,[182,2183,1120,43]]]'>This point was negatived, and that is the first error assigned.</p>

It is true that the injury complained of may have been caused in part by the operations of the Highland Coal Co., conducted contemporaneously with the operations of the defendants’ mines, and that it would be difficult, if not quite impossible, to separate and ascertain, definitely or certainly, the proportion of the whole damage done by each of these operations, respectively. But these several operations were entirely independent of each other. They ■were several miles apart, and the ownership, management, and control were wholly distinct and separate. There was no concert of action, or common purpose or design, which would support the theory of joint injury. The case, in this branch, is ruled by Little Schuylkill Co. v. Richards, <a href="/pa/57/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="57 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="1010428" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0142-01">57 Pa. 142</a>. In that case, the mill-dam was filled by deposits of coal dirt from different mines. The court below charged the jury that if, at the time the defendants were throwing dirt into the river, the same thing was being done by other collieries, and the defendants knew it, they were liable for the combined result. This instruction was held to be erroneous. The ground of action, it was there said, is not the deposit of the dirt in the dam, but the negligent act above. The defendants’ liability, therefore, began with the act on their own land, and they were responsible for the consequences; and, as the negligent act was separate and independent of the acts of the other miners, it was several when committed, and did .not become joint, because the general consequences were united. “ Without concert of action,” said this court in the case cited, “ no joint suit could be brought against the owners of all the collieries, and clearly this must be the test; for, if the defendants can be held liable for the. acts of all the others, so each and every other owner can be made liable for all the rest, and the action must be joint and several. But the moment we should find them jointly sued, then the want of concert and the several liability of each would be apparent. These principles are fully sustained by the following cases: Russell v. Tomlinson, <a href="/conn/2/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="2 Conn. 206" data-case-ids="6754351" data-case-paths="/conn/2/0206-01">2 Conn. 206</a>; Adams v.

It is a matter of no consequence whatever that the stream was not a public highway : that fact could not in any way affect the principle referred to; and, if the Highland Coal Co. was not a joint tortfeasor, it is immaterial in what form the release was effected, whether by deed or otherwise.</p>

He should, in a general way and to a reasonable extent, have in his mind the data from which the proper estimate of value ought to be made. If interrogated, he should be able to disclose sufficient actual knowledge of the subject to indicate that he is in a condition to know what he proposes to state, and to enable the jury to judge of the probable, approximate accuracy of his conclusions.” To this effect, also, is Curtin v.

Michael Campbell, a witness produced by the plaintiff, said that he was twenty-six years of age ; that he had lived in the neighborhood twelve or thirteen years, and was driving a milk wagon for his father; he was therefore but thirteen years of age when the defendants commenced operations. The plaintiff proposed to prove by this witness the market value of the land free from this deposit of coal dirt, and the market value as affected by it. This necessarily implied a knowledge, on the part of the witness, of the nature and condition of the land before the deposit was made ; but he testified to nothing which justified the admission of his testimony on this point. As to his knowledge of its previous condition, he testified, on cross-examination, as follows:</p>

You say that the stream has been bad longer than <em>you </em>can remember? A. Well, no; not so long that I can’t remember it. Good while ago, when I was a small boy. I never took any notice of it. Of course, I know cattle used to drink it at that time. Q. Did you ever see Gallagher’s land before it was covered <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>with coal dirt? A.
