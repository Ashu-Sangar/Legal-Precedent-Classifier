The case was tried in October, 1881, resulting in a verdict for the plaintiffs for $872. A new trial having been [granted, the cause was again tried in October, 1882, when a verdict was rendered for the defendant. This verdict was set aside by the award of a new trial. On February 15, 1883, the plaintiffs made a deed of voluntary assignment of their estate, for the benefit of their creditors, to Joel L. Lightner ; and, on June 80, 1883, the record was amended so as to make the action stand in the names of the original plaintiffs for the use of Joel L. Lightner, assignee, etc. Lightner thereafter carried on the case. On November 30,1883, the third trial was concluded by a verdict for the plaintiff for six cents damages. A new trial was again granted, and on December 2, 1885, a verdict was rendered in favor of the defendant. The suit was finally determined by the refusal of a motion for a new trial, and the entry of judgment on the verdict, in August, 1886. On August 17, 1887, the defendant filed his bill of costs for witness fees, etc., amounting to $556.45, and they were finally taxed by the prothonotary on January 25, 1891.</p>

Eshleman for $11,000, under and by virtue of an order of the Court of Common Pleas; and, the sale having been confirmed, on November 19, 1883, he executed and delivered to Eshleman a deed in fee-simple in pursuance thereof. On February 14,1884, the assignee filed his first account, wherein he charged himself inter alia with the purchase money of the mill-property sold as aforesaid, and appropriated the moneys embraced in the account to the payment of liens, the estate being insolvent. His final account, filed December 24,1885, exhibited a balance of $49.67. On November 19, 1886, A. L. Eshleman and wife conveyed said Brua mill-property to Joel L.

Eshleman testified that there might perhaps have been some talk between them “ to the effect that the interest on the note would overbalance the rent of the mill-property.”</p>

    <p id="b303-7" data-blocks='[["BL_303.7",303,[166,1047,1170,600]]]'>The appellant presented his petition in the court below, in which he claimed to be a creditor of the estate of Joel L. Lightner, deceased, and prayed for a citation upon the executrix of said estate to file an account. The citation, which is in substance a rule to show cause, was granted and duly served upon the executrix. She answered it, denying that the petitioner was a creditor of the estate, and for this reason he was not entitled to an account. The petitioner then filed a replication, and the issue raised was the single question of fact, viz., was' the petitioner a creditor ? The court below decided this question against him, and dismissed the petition and citation, at his costs.</p>
    <p id="b303-8" data-blocks='[["BL_303.8",303,[165,1658,1170,657]],["BL_304.1",304,[253,391,1162,246]]]'>The appellant contends that he has a right to have his claim adjudicated in the Orphans’ Court, and cites Phillips v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/107/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="107 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="8858214" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0465-01">107 Pa. 465</a>, and several other cases, in support of this position. No one doubts this right, nor the authority of the cases cited. The difficulty with the appellant is that his claim has been adjudicated in that court, and decided against him, to the extent that he has not even a prima-facie claim against the Lightner estate. It follows that he has no right to demand an account. No one but a creditor or party in interest has a right to do so. It would involve intolerable mischief if any intermeddler could compel an executor to file an account of his trust whenever demanded. Hence, the proper practice is, when a person who is not a creditor obtains a cita<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>tion, to answer it, denying that the petitioner is a creditor. This at once challenges his position as such, and, unless he can make out a prima-facie claim, it is the duty of the court to dismiss his petition. This is what was done in the court below, and we think correctly.</p>
