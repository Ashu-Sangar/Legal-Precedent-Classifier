It is well settled that a purchaser of land is unaffected by a secret trust or equity unknown to him, and that he may pass title, untrammeled by the trust, to a person who has notice of it.

The drafts for the money were indorsed and deposited in the Dillsburg bank, of which the plaintiff was then cashier. About 1877, Mrs. Eva loaned $600 of this money to her sister Eliza Berryman, who used it in the purchase of a farm.

In the spring of 1885, Mr. and Mrs. Eva sold the Berryman farm for $2,400. After paying off all their debts they had $1,200, which was left in the hands of Mrs. Eva. She then sent her husband to buy the property in dispute from the plaintiff, as assignee of Ross, gave him the $1,200 to pay on the purchase money, and directed him to have the deed made in her <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>name.

Keesey for a loan. He agreed to lend Eva $2,000 upon a mortgage, provided the plaintiff would become his surety in the accompanying bond; and such arrangement was carried out, and the entire transaction closed. Mr. Eva testified that he did not know, until after the completion of the transaction, that the deed was made in his own name, he having previously directed that it be made to his wife. He was contradicted by plaintiff upon each of these assertions. The plaintiff testified that he did not know that it was Mrs. Eva’s money that was paid on the property.

It is an equally familiar principle of law that when the wife establishes the fact that she has a separate estate, and that that separate estate, or the money belonging to her separate estate was used by her husband in the purchase of real estate, though the husband took the title in his own name, the law regards him as a trustee for her to the extent that her money is shown to have gone into the purchase, and that between a husbaird and wife such a resulting trust can be asserted; and that it can be asserted against a judgment creditor, or anybody but a purchaser for value, without notice of the trust.</p>

He is liable to Mr. Keesey, the obligee in the bond, and the mortgagee of the mortgage, for the amount of that debt. He stands in this case as the surety of Henry G. Eva to Mr. Keesey.

Prior to the sale of the Berryman property to Lehmer, the negotiations were undertaken between Mr. Eva and Mr. Logan for the purchase of the Lemuel Ross property. [Mr. Eva says, and Mrs. Eva says the same thing, that in these negotiations he was acting as her agent, and that she had instructed him to have the deed for the Ross property made in. her name ; and he says that he so informed Mr. Logan. About whether or not Mr. Logan was informed of this fact, if it be a fact, that the husband was acting as agent for the wife, and that the deed was to be made in her name, there is a precise contradiction of testimony between Henry G. Eva and John N. Logan.] 3 Henry G. Eva says that when he made the first payment of seven hundred and some dollars on the article of agreement, he informed Mr. Logan that the deed was to be made in his wife’s name; but Mr. Logan says that he never did inform him that the deed was to be made to Mrs. Eva.

For, if she has failed in that, or to the extent that she has failed in that, her claim must fail.

    <p class="summary" id="b344-6" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[262,500,1186,1722]]]'>But the plaintiff contends that as Mr. Keesey, the mortgagee of Henry Gr. Eva, was without notice of any secret trust in the land for Mrs. Eva, and as the plaintiff bought the land at a sheriff’s sale on Mr. Keesey’s mortgage, he is protected by Mr. Keesey’s want of notice even though he had notice himself. The doctrine that a purchaser for value without notice of a secret trust takes the property discharged thereof, and can convey it free of the trust to one who has notice, is too well established to require any citation of authority. Had the plaintiff been a stranger to the transaction of which Mr. Keesey’s mortgage formed a part, he would have been in a position to invoke successfully the protection of this principle. He was not a stranger to the transaction, but a most active participant in it. He was the vendor of the defendant Henry Gr. Eva. The delivery of his deed to Eva, and the execution of Eva’s mortgage to Mr. Keesey, were parts of the same transaction, occurring at the same time. The plaintiff negotiated the loan for Eva from Mr. Keesey, and procured Eva to execute the mortgage to Mr. Keesey, the loan being effected to enable Eva to pay plaintiff the balance of purchase money. Though not a party to the mortgage, he became Eva’s surety on the bond which it was given to secure. Thus, he stands in a position to be subrogated to the rights of Mr. Keesey, both in the bond and the mortgage. Though not a party to the mortgage itself, he was a party to the very transaction of which it formed a part, the promoter of it and the receiver of its proceeds. Had he taken the mortgage to himself, with notice that the wife’s money was being used in the purchase, he would of course have taken it subject to the trust, and I do not think he can protect himself by procuring the mortgage to be made to another without notice, whose title he subsequently acquires; and to all of whose rights he is entitled as surety to be subrogated. No case cited at the argument goes so far, and the doctrine would be a most dangerous one.</p>

    <p id="b346-7" data-blocks='[["BL_346.6",346,[278,596,1181,1669]]]'>The substantial questions raised by this appeal are whether the evidence is sufficient to establish a resulting trust, and whether the appellant is protected by the mortgagee’s want of notice of it. The instructions to the jury respecting the nature and kind of proof required to develop and successfully assert the trust, were unobjectionable and in harmony with our decisions on the subject. It is not with the principles announced in this connection that the appellant takes issue, but with the evidence, which he affirms is not full and clear enough, under the decisions, to support the appellees’ claim. This objection necessitates an examination of the testimony to determine its adequacy. It shows that Mrs. Eva received, during coverture, from the estate of a deceased uncle in England, $&gt;1,775 ,■ that this was an inheritance, and constituted her separate <em>estate; </em>that she loaned six hundred dollars of it to her sister, which was afterwards paid in the purchase of the Berryman property; that she and her husband testified, that one thousand two hundred dollars of it was used in that purchase ; that on the sale of this property she received one thousand two hundred dollars of its proceeds, which she gave to her husband, with directions 'to invest in the property in dispute, and upon an understanding between them that she should have the title, and that the money was used in the purchase of the property as directed; but that the husband, unknown to her, took the deed of it in his own name. It shows, further, that the appellant knew that she had a separate estate, a portion of which was paid upon the property. We think the evidence was sufficient to justify a finding of all the facts essential to establish a resulting trust. It was contradicted, but the credibility of the witnesses was for the jury. It was ascertained by their verdict that the appellee had six hundred dollars in the land, and it seems very clear to us from the evidence that at least that amount of her separate estate was used in its purchase.</p>

Fortner, <a href="/binn/2/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="2 Binn. 40" data-case-ids="1788946" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0040-01">2 Binn. 40</a> ; Cover v. Black, 1 Barr 498. Notice to a purchaser at the sheriff’s sale on the mortgage comes entirely too late, if the mortgagee had no notice when the mortgage was executed: ” Martin v. Jackson, <a href="/pa/27/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="27 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="979774" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0504-01">27 Pa. 504</a>. Y. K. Keesey was the mortgagee of the land in dispute, and it is conceded that he had no notice of the alleged trust in favor of Mrs. Eva. At a sheriff’s sale of the land on the Keesey mortgage, public notice of Mrs. Eva’s claim was given, and the appellant became the purchaser. It is admitted that his knowledge of the trust derived from the notice given at the sale does not impair his title, but it is claimed that, inasmuch as he was surety in the bond secured by the mortgage, and familiar with the transaction in consummation of which the mortgage was executed, he cannot find shelter under Keesey’s title. This claim was sustained in the court below, and we must give it our sanction or reverse the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[121,1308,1167,1115]],["BL_348.1",348,[274,398,1178,901]]]'>It will be seen at the outset that the claim of the appellees makes the source of the appellant’s knowledge of the trust, and the time he acquired it, factors in determining whether he has a title subject to the trust or independent of it. We cannot assent to this proposition. It must be borne in mind that the rule which protects a purchaser with notice, is not the outcome of a tender regard for him. It is the logical sequence of the doctrine that a bona-fide purchaser, without notice of a secret equity, ‘takes a title unaffected by it. If such a purchaser could pass his title only to persons ignorant of the trust, the market value of his property would be depreciated by the restriction, and his enjoyment of it would be very much impaired. Hence the law declares that the knowledge of his vendee is not in the way of the transmission of his title, untrammeled by the trust. Nor can we see how the fact that the appellant was a surety in the bond secured by the mortgage can affect the question under consideration. The'learned judge of the court below, in his opinion refusing a new trial, said, in substance, that the appellant’s position as surety entitled him to subrogation to all the rights of the mortgagee. If so, why could he not purchase the mortgagee’s title at the sheriff’s sale ? In Stewart v. Reed, <a href="/pa/91/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="91 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="487877" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0287-01">91 Pa. 287</a>, McClurkan bought the <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>property at sheriff’s sale. He then sold it to Stewart, who, by '■ agreement between them, received his deed for it directly from ■the sheriff. An attempt was made to impeach Stewart’s title, *0n the ground that he made false representations which deterred certain parties from bidding at the sale, in consequence of which the land was sold for less than it was worth. It was held that as McClurkan was the purchaser, and had no knowledge of the fraud, his equity protected his vendee, this court saying: “ In the absence of any collusion between McClurkan and Stewart, we are clearly of opinion that Stewart is entitled to take shelter behind McClurkan’s equitable title.” Certainly, if McClurkan’s equity was sufficient to protect Stewart, notwithstanding his participation in a fraud connected with the sale, Keesey’s title will sustain the appellant’s contention, although he may have been cognizant of the facts which raised the resulting trust. The fifth, sixth, and seventh specifications of error are sustained, and the remaining specifications are dismissed.</p>
