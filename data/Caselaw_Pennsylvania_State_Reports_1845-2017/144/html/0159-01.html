And granted, for the sake of the argument, that Charles Finke <em>&amp; </em>Co. had actually sampled the tobacco and warranted its quality to be equal to the sample, had been paid for doing so, and had thus made a contract of insurance with the party who paid them, could they even then be held responsible to some third party to whom their promisee sold the goods, without any privity of Charles Finke &amp; Co. to the new contract with the new party ? How could the sampler be held to answer to an entirely new party, introduced to the contract without his knowledge or consent; much less to every new purchaser of the tobacco, as it passes from hand to hand for six months ? But, in this case, not even such a state of facts exists. No prior holder, purchaser, or vendor of the tobacco, is ever brought into contractual relations with the defendants.</p>

Not a penny is shown to have been received by the defendants from the plaintiff, from its vendors, or from any .one of the many persons whom the court, jury and counsel were left to imagine might have had this tobacco and had it sampled. Without a consideration, a contract proved cannot be enforced. Not only was there no contract, but the figment of a contract, woven out of the voluminous testimony, is without the remotest reference to a consideration. No process can extract from the evidence, in this case, even a hint of any consideration ever paid to the defendants for the service in which they are alleged to have made the warranty.

No usage can be incorporated into a contract which is inconsistent with the terms of the contract: 2 Pars, on Cont., 546. Finally, there could have been no legal recovery in this case, had all the elements hereinbefore set forth as lacking been supplied, in the face of the plaintiff’s admission that it had as yet suffered no damage. The plaintiff had never paid its vendors for the tobacco. It has its remedy. If had tobacco was bought on samples purporting it to be good, payment can be refused its vendors. And nothing has ever been done here to transmit to subsequent purchasers the rights which any unnamed sufferer may have acquired against the defendants: Blackb. on Cont. of Sale, Text Book S., *334.

    <p id="b196-7" data-blocks='[["BL_196.7",196,[287,1457,1166,908]]]'>1. There is in the tobacco trade a class of persons who are known as samplers of leaf tobacco. It is their occupation and by it they make large sums of money. The leading firms in this business have a wide reputation for skilfully designating the quality of tobacco, and when they place their tag and seal upon a sample or samples drawn from a case, these designate the quality of the tobacco in the shape of a warranty. These warranties are called “ samples ” by the trade in that case. And it was proved by plaintiff that the trade had accepted this standard for twenty years, and that by the customs of the trade the warrantors of the samples have likewise recognized a liability to purchasers for the space of six months. Here, then, is an existing method of contracting, well defined and established by the customs of a particular <em>trade; </em>and, having all the sanctity of a long- and well-known usage, it has become the law of that trade as absolutely as if it were spread on the statute books. Do the parties to this suit come within the terms of this intent and established usage ?</p>
    <p id="b196-8" data-blocks='[["BL_196.8",196,[331,2372,1119,44]],["BL_197.1",197,[145,402,1169,914]]]'>2. By the appellants’ admission Finke &amp; Co. were a sampling <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>firm of New York city, with a branch office in Lancaster-city. On February 5, 1887, Finke &amp; Co. placed their sampling tag on the samples of tobacco in controversy, consisting of ten cases. This tobacco was sold by these samples, and passed from hand to hand, until it came into possession of the plaintiff within six months from the time of the sampling. If these tags of Finke &amp; Co. meant anything, they meant what the trade understood them to mean, and what the words “ stripped and sample warranted,” printed across its face, intended them to convey, namely, that it was of the degree of soundness and fineness thereon indicated. Otherwise, it was.a fraud and a cheat, and the thirty-five cents per case that had been paid for sampling was a deception, as the manual labor of sampling a case would not cost ten cents. Defendants claim that there was no subsisting contract between Finke &amp; Co. and the plaintiff. If that is so, then the entire trade misunderstands the purposes for which sampling has been instituted, as the testimony of a number of old and reliable tobacco dealers proves.</p>
    <p id="b197-5" data-blocks='[["BL_197.4",197,[148,1325,1174,1165]]]'>3. The custom of leaf tobacco inspection, by regular inspectors, is universal throughout the United States. The defendants are residents of New York city, and hold themselves out as inspectors of leaf tobacco all over the United States, for which they are paid a large premium for their guaranty or warranty. The actual labor of the work of the sampling of the tobacco is furnished by the owner of the tobacco at the time of the inspection. A custom must be certain, uniform and notorious, so as to be known to the parties to the trade: McMasters v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/69/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="69 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1026349" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0374-01">69 Pa. 374</a>; Carter v.

Such a custom has written the law into the contract of these samplers, and the defendants and the plaintiff have both recognized, and have contracted upon the faith and with knowledge actual or constructive of such usage and custom. Reed v. Garvin, 12 S. &amp; R. 103, holds “ that the guaranty ran with the bond, and into whomsoever’s hands it came, the beneficial interest in the bond carried with it the guaranty of payment.” Here the guaranty or warranty on the tag ran with the tohaeco into whomsoever’s hands it came, and the beneficial interest conveyed by the terms on the tag of Finke &amp; Co., the defendants, ran with the tobacco; and they guaranteed and warranted, by the' custom of the trade, over a period of six months, and previously acknowledged the validity of the custom by paying similar demands to the one in suit.</p>

It is whether a tag placed upon a bale of tobacco by. the inspector or sampler is a warranty of the quality of the tobacco, and whether it enures to the benefit of subsequent purchasers thereof.</p>
    <p id="b198-7" data-blocks='[["BL_198.7",198,[256,651,1166,552]]]'>The facts, briefly stated, are as follows: The Conestoga Cigar Co., plaintiff, is a corporation engaged in the manufacture of cigars in Lancaster, Pa. Charles Finke &amp; Co., defendants, are engaged in ~what is known as “sampling” of leaf tobacco, with their main office in the city of New York, and an agency or branch office in the city of Lancaster. In the regular course of business, the plaintiff purchased ten cases of tobacco from the firm of B. S. Kendig &amp; Co. These cases were purchased by sample, each sample having on it one of defendants’ tags, containing such an inscription as the following, the number, weight, and tare varying with the different cases :</p>
    <p id="b198-9" data-blocks='[["BL_198.8",198,[257,1210,1165,245]]]'>“Stripped and sample warranted: No. 408. Feb. 5th, 1887. 484 lbs. and 84 off.

    <p id="b198-10" data-blocks='[["BL_198.9",198,[257,1466,1168,451]]]'>Shortly after the purchase of the tobacco, a portion of it, 1973 lbs., was found to be injured. The plaintiff immediately notified Kendig &amp; Co., from whom it purchased it; and the latter notified the defendants, whose tag was on the samples. Shortly thereafter the agents of Finke &amp; Co. called upon the plaintiff, examined the defective tobacco, and promised to make it all right, and pay for it. The defendants subsequently failed to “ make it all right,” and this suit was brought to compel them to do so.</p>
    <p id="b198-11" data-blocks='[["BL_198.10",198,[261,1924,1169,450]]]'>The plaintiff was met at the very threshold of its case with the contention that there was no contract between the parties, nor was there any privity. It may be conceded that no contract with the plaintiff appears upon the face of the tag, nor was there any evidence to show that the defendants had sampled the tobacco at the request of the plaintiff, or that it had paid them for doing so. On the contrary, it was evident that it had been sampled for some previous owner, and had passed, thus sampled, to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b198-12" data-blocks='[["BL_198.11",198,[307,2383,1123,42]],["BL_199.1",199,[153,377,1174,1617]]]'>Had there been no ambiguity about the tag, its construe<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>tion would have been for the court. As, however, it was unintelligible in some respects without explanation, the learned judge below permitted the plaintiff to call a number of witnesses, inspectors, and persons in the tobacco trade, to testify to the meaning of certain words and figures on the tags, as understood and acted upon by those engaged in the business in this country. The uncontradicted evidence upofi this point was, in substance, that the tag or label on the sample means that the sampler guarantees the tobacco in the case to be identical with the tobacco in the sample, and, unless the tag bears marks to the contrary, that the tobacco in the case is sound; that it is the custom in sampling tobacco, when any damaged tobacco is found in the case to mark on the ticket the percentage of damage that the case contains ; that the absence of marks indicates that the tobacco is sound; that it is inspected for the convenience and safety of both buyer and seller; that the tobacco sold by these samples is frequently paid for long before it is delivered; that the label is not only a guaranty of the quality of the tobacco, at the time of inspection, but that the guaranty is good for six months, for the benefit of any person into whose possession the tobacco may come within that time; that, if the tobacco thus inspected proves defective, the sampler shall make it good by paying for so much as is injured or spoiled. There is no doubt, under the evidence, that this is the usage of the trade, so general as to be universal. Whether the usage has continued so long as to have grown into a custom such as the law would write into every such contract, is a very serious question which we are not called upon to rule in this case. As it is one of first impression, and at the same time of vast importance to this large industry, we prefer to decide only what is before us, and not anticipate cases which may arise in the future under other circumstances.</p>

It is in proof that defendants’ agents, when notified of the defect in the tobacco, called upon the plaintiff, examined it, admitted the defect, and promised to mate it good. There was also evidence that in other cases, when the same thing had"occurred, they had “made it good” by paying for the defective tobacco. It is no answer to this to say that there was no proof of their agency, or that the tags were placed on the samples by the defendants. It was not only shown that Irwin and Schroeder were acting as agents for the defendants, but there was direct proof of their agency by the admission of a member of defendants’ firm. There was also the recognition of the sample tags by the agents, accompanied by the promise to pay for the defective tobacco. We have, then, the construction of the contract by the. defendants themselves ; a construction in entire harmony with that of the plaintiff, and the usage of trade which was offered in explanation of it.
