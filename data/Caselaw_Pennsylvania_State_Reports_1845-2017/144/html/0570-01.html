In the course of those proceedings, Reuben Light came forward, in the right of his wife, as the records of the court show, and elected to take at the valuation a certain farm that was afterwards adjudged' to him, and he entered into a proper recognizance, as directed by the court, to pay to the pther heirs the price due to them upon the valuation. Sometime afterwards, during the next year, as I recollect, or perhaps after that, my recollection is 1877, the administrators filed their account in the estate, and, as I understand, there was a distribution of both the real and personal estate at the same time. It is in evidence that in the course of that distribution <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>her entire interest in her father’s estate was applied to the payment of the valuation money of the farm her husband had taken for her. She got no money for her interest in the rest of the property, but it went into this farm, the title to which, was in her husband. In 1877, the husband made an agreement with the administrator of Mrs. Moyer for the purchase of this lot of ground in Ebenezer. He paid one hundred and fifty dollars at one time, took a receipt in his own name, and afterwards, he says, thirty dollars was also paid in the way detailed in the evidence. A deed was directed to be made by authorized proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, and it was made to him in accordance with those proceedings. A house was put upon this lot, and paid for in April, 1878; I think that was the date when the last payment was made. The last payment [on the house erected] was made by the Reinoehl &amp; Meily note. Several years afterwards a judgment was obtained, upon which an execution was issued, and this property was sold to Daniel W. Zeller, the defendant in this case. A deed was made to him, and he subsequently went into possession.</p>

Zeller. If the legal title to this property was in Reuben Light, whatever interest he had in it passed to Daniel W. Zeller, and there could be no doubt as to what your verdict should be. The wife, however, says that she paid for the property, or that her money paid for it; that the equitable title is in her; that, notwithstanding the fact that Zeller bought it as the property of her husband, she is the real owner. If that be true, it can be set up in this case. Zeller is simply a judgment creditor; he has the right of a judgment creditor, and that right is no greater than the right of the debtor. Zeller’s right, in other words, is no greater in this case than the right of Reuben Light, as against his wife. That is, indeed, not denied upon either side of the case. [So we come at once to the real question in this case: W as this property paid for by the wife’s separate estate ? If so, she would have what the law calls a resulting trust in the property as against her husband. That is, a trust would result to her, arising <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>from the fact that she furnished the money to buy it; and, if her husband took the title in his own name, nevertheless he would simply hold the legal title for her benefit, and at any time she saw proper to enforce it, she could do so.] 3</p>

The burden of proof is upon her. She must show that the property which she claims was purchased with her own separate estate. She must show it by evidence which is clear, and so full and satisfactory that a jury can rely upon it with reasonable certainty. If she fails to show it by evidence having the qualities I have just spoken of, then she fails entirely, and it is the duty of the jury to find against her claim. She takes upon herself, I repeat, the burden of making out this case, this claim against her husband’s creditor <em>•, </em>she assumes the burden of proof, and she must prove it by evidence, which must be clear; it must be full, and must be so satisfactory that a jury can rely upon it with reasonable certainty.

It was paid part in cash and part by the giving of sheep—I don’t remember any other articles— but, at all events, sheep and money. You have heard all the evidence upon the subject, and you must determine whether the money that was applied was her separate money, and whether the sheep which were applied also belonged to her separate estate. [As far as the money that went into the house is concerned, I do not think you need trouble about that at all. This controversy will determine who ought to have the title to the lot. Therefore, I say you need not consider the question as to whose money went into the house. If her money paid for the lot, she would have a resulting trust in it as against her husband’s creditors, and that would carry with it the house.] 4</p>

Light, was loaned to him by the husband, and a bond for it taken in the name of the husband. You have heard the testimony upon that point, and you must determine whether that money was really the husband’s, or whether it was really the wife’s. If it was the husband’s money, then it was of course his money that went to the payment of this lot, and you will so find. On the other hand, if this bond which was taken for money loaned to Asaptí S. Light belonged to the wife, belonged to her separate estate, the jury would so determine. I do not recollect that money from any other source was paid upon this lot. The remainder of the purchase money, as my recollection goes, was made up by giving certain sheep. Whether or not these sheep came to this woman directly from home, or were the increase of sheep which she got in that way direct from her home, or whether they were purchased with the proceeds of this farm that has been spoken of, is a question for the jury to determine, If they came direct to her from her father’s home, or if they were the increase of such sheep as she got at the time she married and came to her husband—you recollect it was testified that she brought certain animals with her to the farm—in that case they would be her separate property. If they were purchased with the income of the farm which her husband took at the valuation, then of course whether they were or were not her separate property would depend upon what interest, if any, she had in the farm. If the farm was his, although she may have assisted him and paid a good deal of money upon it for him, still the products would be his, and the income of the farm would be his and not hers. That is a question bearing upon the dispute which you have noticed in the case about the ownership of this farm. That is one of the sources from which the plaintiff claims that she got part of the money to pay for this lot.</p>

The records show that the husband took the property in his own name, and that it was adjudged to him, and the legal title passed to him. [Therefore, whether or not she had any real interest or ownership in the property, depends, in my judgment, upon how you will determine the evidence with re<a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>gard to certain other matters. It is alleged that although he took the property in his own name, the agreement between himself and wife, before the partition proceedings came to that point, was that he should take it for her; that she supposed he was taking it for her, and that in pursuance of that agreement she afterwards furnished a considerable portion of the money that went to pay for it; and the conclusion is urged upon you that under that state of circumstances, although the legal title was in him, nevertheless he was holding it in trust for his wife. If you find the facts to be as we have outlined them to you, we think that conclusion is sound, and that she would have an interest in the property.] 5</p>

Zeller, post, 582. By reference to the opinion just filed in that case, it will be seen that the judgment of affirmance is confirmatory of Mrs. Light’s claim of title, to which the evidence referred to in the first and second specifications and that part of the charge recited in the fifth specification, respectively, relate ; and it will be quite apparent, also, that plaintiff in error was not prejudiced, either by the introduction of the evidence or by the charge com<a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>plained of. Independently of the affirmance of that judgment, we think there was no error in admitting the evidence referred to in the first and second specifications, or in charging the jury as recited in the fifth. The first, second, and fifth specifications are therefore not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b607-6" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[135,645,1169,905]]]'>The subjects of complaint in the third, fourth, and sixth specifications, inclusive, are portions of the learned judge’s charge recited therein, respectively. In the first of these, the controlling question in the case was very distinctly presented, as follows: “ So we come at once to the real question in this case: Was this propertj' paid for by the wife’s separate estate ? If so, she would have what the law calls a resulting trust in the property as against her husband. That is, a trust would result to her, arising from the fact that she furnished the money to buy it; and, if her husband took the title in his own name, nevertheless he would simply hold the legal title for her benefit, and at any time she saw proper to enforce it, she could do so.” In view of the evidence before the jury, that was clearly a question of fact for them. It was rightly submitted, under proper instructions contained in the general charge, including the portions thereof that are assigned for error; and their finding in favor of Mrs. Light was conclusive of her right to recover.</p>
    <p id="b607-7" data-blocks='[["BL_607.7",607,[136,1569,1170,500]]]'>The seventh to ninth specifications, inclusive, are to the affirmance of points submitted by the plaintiffs below. The remaining specifications are to the answers of the learned judge to points submitted by the defendant below. A careful examination of these specifications, in which the points referred to, as well as the answers of the court thereto, are respectively recited, has failed to convince us that there is any error in in either of them. On the contrary, we are satisfied that the case was ably and correctly tried; and there- was abundant evidence to warrant the jury in finding as they did.</p>
