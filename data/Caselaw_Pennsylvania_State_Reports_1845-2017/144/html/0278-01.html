Eberly, <a href="/pa/79/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="79 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="438428" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0141-01">79 Pa. 141</a>, nor enlarge a devisee’s estate into a fee when there is a clear intention to give a less estate: Burkart v.

But here, the power of disposal given to the widow, the life-tenant, is by no means an absolute power. On the contrary, it is limited both as to time and method. She is given discretionary power to direct a sale of the realty devised, but such sale is to be made by the executor; she is given the right to receive the proceeds, but has no power to expend them, only to dispose of them “ by bequeath, or as she shall direct,” which seems to contemplate a disposition of the proceeds by will. Her power is confined to the use of the realty for life, to directing its sale, and to appointing the proceeds by will. Such limited powers are entirely insufficient to enlarge an expressly defined life-estate into a fee under any of the decisions.</p>

Forsythe, <a href="/pa/108/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="108 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="539273" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0129-01">108 Pa. 129</a>, there was a devise for life, with an absolute power of disposal of the corpus, unlimited as to time or manner; and it was held that the devisee took only a life-estate, with power of disposal that was well executed by her devise of the premises in fee. Thus, the primary intent to give her only a life-estate prevailed, though she was clothed with all the powers of absolute ownership. And in Hinkle’s App., <a href="/pa/116/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="116 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="554353" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0490-01">116 Pa. 490</a>, it was held that where there was an express life-estate, a power “ to sell and dispose of the same as he may desire ” did not serve to enlarge the life-estate into a fee. It is true that, in the latter case, there was a devise over, but the ruling is not put upon that ground.</p>

Prima facie the first taker is the principal object of testator’s bounty, and in doubtful cases the construction leans in favor of making the gift to him as effectual as possible: R.ewalt v. Ulrich, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20388" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="28 Pa. 388">28 Pa. 388</a>. But these rules of construction are operative only in doubtful cases, assisting in the interpretation of obscure phraseology, and are never permitted to modify a clearly defined gift or defeat an unambiguously expressed intent. When there is no ambiguity in the language, there will be no construction against the plain meaning, is a cardinal rule of construction of wills; and the interpretation is always to be liberal in favor of the heirs at law and strict against devisees. An heir at law can be disinherited only by express devise, or necessary implication, which has been defined to be such a strong probability than an intention to the contrary cannot be supposed: 3 Jarman on Wills, 5th ed., 704.</p>

The particular intent to provide for his widow in that way, and by the power of sale and appointment of proceeds conferred on her, is not in conflict with any general intent to be drawn from the whole scope of the will, and the particular intent prevails. Especially is this so in favor of the heir at law, the plaintiff in this case, who is <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>not to be disinherited by doubtful construction or conjecture as to the testator’s intention: Rupp v.

We must believe that he intended to die intestate of this land, if his widow should fail to exercise the power he conferred upon her of compelling the sale of the land, and of appointment of its proceeds. She did not exercise these powers. She never directed the land to be sold, and consequently the time never arrived for her, to exercise the power of appointment of the proceeds. Her power was limited, not general, but expressly confined to the proceeds of sale. And a power of appointment of the proceeds of sale is not well exercised by a devise of the corpus: Woods’ Est., <a href="/pa/1/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="949826" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0368-01">1 Pa. 368</a>.

From the case stated it appears that the widow never did exercise these powers ; the real estate in controversy remained unsold at the time of her death. This contest is between the heir at law of the testator and the executor of his wife. The court below entered judgment upon the case stated in favor of the heir at law.</p>

The testator evidently intended to dispose of his entire estate. He was childless; his wife was the sole obj ect of his bounty; there is no other person named or referred to in the will. The first sentence of the will in the paragraph above quoted carried the fee. He says his wife “ shall have and hold the property in Bottstown, where I now reside.” While this language in a deed would not carry the fee, it is otherwise in a will. Having thus given the fee, what was there to cut it down to a life-estate? Admittedly nothing, except the next sentence, in which the testator says: “ Said Anna to have the sole control of the same during her lifetime,” etc. But this was mere surplusage. After giving a fee, it cannot be cut down to a life-estate by the unnecessary provision that she should have the control of it during her life. The testator may have thought that in some way, which he did not understand, his executor might interfere with his widow’s enjoyment of the property, and the clause in question may have been inserted to prevent this. In either view of the case, the language is without legal effect, and might well have been omitted. He then orders the executor to sell the property whenever the widow shall direct, and then' follows this significant sentence: “ And the moneys realized from the sale of my real estate, my executor shall pay over to my beloved wife, Anna, and she, the said Anna, shall <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>have the power to dispose of the same by bequeath, or as she directs.” The learned judge below construed this as merely a power of appointment of the proceeds of the sale, whereas it is an absolute gift of the money, and the superadded power of appointment is the merest surplusage. It detracts nothing from a fee for a testator to say that his devisee shall have the sole control of the property during her lifetime, and an absolute gift of money is not qualified by a superfluous authority to bequeath it. We have here a childless testator who gives the sole interest in the land to his wife. We think the case comes within the ninth section of the act of April 8,1833, which declares: “ All devises of real estate shall pass the whole estate of the testator in the premises devised, although there be no words of inheritance or of perpetuity, unless it appears by a devise over, or by words of limitation or otherwise in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate.” The will of Michael Shaffer contains no devise over, nor do</p>
