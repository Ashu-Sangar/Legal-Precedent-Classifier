It is alleged that the Orphans’ Court of York county, in the audit of the account of John H. Small, guardian of J. Etter Small, whose moneys were similarly loaned to the firm and corporation, has decided that the loans made by the said guardian to the firm and corporation were breaches of trust, and that the ward is entitled to be regarded as a partner thereof, and to receive his proportionate share of the profits of the said firm and corporation; and the plaintiff craves leave to refer to the refcord of the said last recited proceedings and audit, as if fully set forth as part of the bill.</p>

We may except from this rule that part of the bill which, by reference to the records of the Orphans’ Court of York county and the audit on the J.

Small made said loan to the firm and corporation because he knew it was perfectly safe, and for the purpose of making’six per cent on the fund for his brother’s children; that the borrowers frequently wanted Mr. Small to take it back, and only kept it at the guardian’s solicitation; that the firm and corporation did not lack capital at any time for their business ; that John H.</p>

In the firm, John H. Small received one third; in the corporation he received one hundred and seventy-one six hundredths ; this proportion remaining the same after the increase of the capital stock in 1886. That part of the ward’s profits received by the other partners or stockholders cannot be followed, nor can the guardian be made to account for them : Seguin’s App., supra. Of that portion of the ward’s profits received by the guardian, one third should be allowed to him for his labor and services; and the remaining two thirds are due to his ward.” See <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>opinion, in Small’s Est., 24 W. N. 96. It thus appears that all that was decided by the learned judge was, that the ward might receive from his guardian two thirds of the profits received by said guardian on his moneys loaned to the firm and corporation, instead of interest, if he should so elect. The opinion is clearly against the right of the ward to1 recover the profits made on his moneys by the other members of the firm and corporation, either from them or John H. Small, the guardian.</p>

Under the decisions we have cited, inasmuch as the ward has a complete and adequate remedy in the Orphans’ Court, where jurisdiction has legally attached, to compel discovery and account, and enforce payment of whatever may be legally decreed to be payable to him by the guardian, we feel constrained to sustain the demurrer of John H.

In the former case, the members of the firm, with the trustee, are liable to account for the profits ; in the latter case, that of a mere loan to the firm, they are not liable for the profits made on the trust funds. Elockton v. Bunning, 8 Ch. 323, note, cited by 2 Lindley on Part., 531, is a case of the former kind; and Yyse v. Foster, 8 Ch. 309, cited in the same text book on page 535, is the case of a loan where the partnership paid interest annually to all persons interested in the estate of a deceased partner, and all persons beneficially interested in his estate, except the plaintiff in the bill, acquiesced in this arrangement. In this latter case, the bill in equity against the executors was sustained by the court, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision, holding that the plaintiff was only entitled to interest on her share. “ Persons who borrow trust money from executors or trustees are only liable to repay it with interest; and, although the lenders may have no authority to lend the money, the borrowers are not liable to account for the profits which they may have realized from its employment: ” 1 Lindley on Part., 162.</p>

In this opinion the distinction is made between the misapplication of the assets of an estate, and a loan. The court, on page 169, uses this language : “ It was a misapplication to use the assets of the estate, to use the polite and moderate term in general use to express a breach of trust. In the language of the law and of common honesty, it was embezzlement. It was not the case of a loan of unemployed funds by an executor to his firm for the purpose of gaining interest for his cestui que trustent, but the loan of interest-bearing securities to enable the firm to carry on its operations.” “ That portion of the ward’s profits received by the other partners cannot be followed, nor can the guardian be made to account for them: Seguin’s Appeal, supra: ” Small’s Est., 24 W.
