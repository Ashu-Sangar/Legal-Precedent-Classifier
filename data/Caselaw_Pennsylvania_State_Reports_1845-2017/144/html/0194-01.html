Thereafter it was regularly forfeited and respited from term to term until January 4,1890, at which time the defendants and their bail were again respectively called, and, not answering, their recognizance was absolutely forfeited. Two weeks thereafter, on application of three of the sureties, a rule was granted “ to show cause why the forfeiture of the recognizance,” etc., “ should not be stricken off.” On August 16th following, the rule was discharged. The only complaint in the several specifications is the action of the court in thus discharging the rule to show cause, and refusing to strike off the forfeiture.</p>

We have no jurisdiction of the case except on certiorari, and that brings up for review nothing except the record proper.
