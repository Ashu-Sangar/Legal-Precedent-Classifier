The apparent exception which permits such moneys to be deposited with a reputable bank or banker grows out of the necessity of the case; for, while such a transaction is actually a loan, the moneys being at once blended with others of the debtor and forming a common fund: Morse on Banking, § 289 ; Bank of Northern Liberties v. Jones, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Pa.%205" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="42 Pa. 5">42 Pa. 5</a>.36, it is manifestly more prudent to thus place them for safe-keeping than to retain them in the custody of the trustee at the risk of being stolen. But the exception being one founded in necessity is not to be extended beyond the necessity which demands it. The loan to the bank or banker is purely for safe custody, and the moneys must at all times be subject to the demand of the depositor. The moment this control is parted with, no matter for how brief a period, the contract with the bank loses altogether its resemblance to a deposit, and assumes the character of an ordinary loan or investment.</p>

Thus, the question in this case is narrowed to this: Is the deposit of trust funds at interest, in every case to be forbidden, if the depositary requires that a reasonable notice is to be given before drawing; and this, whether the loss is attributable to the arrangement or not? It is admitted that a trustee should place uninvested trust funds on deposit in a bank of good reputation, while seeking an investment for them : Perry on Trusts, § 443. The guardian, in this case, had deposited these funds under a temporary arrangement while seeking an investment ; the arrangement was an ordinary measure of prudence on the part of the bank; the time stipulated for notice was a reasonable one, and one so short that, in view of the purpose of the guardian to find an investment, the money was practically on call; and it has never been pretended that the loss to the estate in any way grew out of the arrangement complained of.</p>

Scott, guardian of William W. Law, from the adjudication by the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia county, upon the account of said guardian. On January 29,1890, Scott received $3,839.12 of the money of his ward, and immediately deposited the same in the Bank of America. The accountant had kept his personal account, as a depositor, in the same institution for several years, and had been advised by an officer of the finance company, which latter company was surety on his bond as guardian, that the Bank of America was entirely solvent and safe. The deposit was in a separate account, in the name of the guardian as such. No certificate was issued; the whole transaction was evidenced only by an entry of credit upon the books of the bank in the usual form. The accountant was in search of an investment, and the deposit was to remain only until he could find one. The bank agreed to allow him three per cent interest, but he was to give two weeks’ notice before withdrawing it. The bank failed on the thirtieth day of April following. At the time of the deposit the bank was in good repute, and there is no allegation of bad faith, or want of due care or diligence. The only question for our consideration is whether or not, under such circumstances, the trustee is responsible for the amount of the deposit.</p>

So, also, executors, trustees, or guardians will not be liable if, in the ordinary discharge of their duty, they deposit the assets temporarily in a bank, although the bank may fail.

A trustee who would continuously keep for any considerable length of time a large sum of money about his person or in his house, rather than deposit it for safe-keeping in a solvent and reputable bank or trust company, where all the precautions may be exercised for its safety, might justly be regarded as derelict in duty. No one would be accredited with the exercise of common prudence who would keep his own money in this way; and a trustee, as we have said, is held generally for such care and diligence as an ordinarily prudent man would exercise in the conduct and management of his own business. “ A trustee will not be liable for the failure of a bank in which trust funds have been deposited, if he has suffered them to remain there only for a reasonable time; but if he allows them to lie there by way of investment, he will be liable to make good the loss. But he must <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>be careful to make tbe deposit in tbe name of tbe trust-estate, and not to his own credit, and not to mix the. trust funds with his own; otherwise, he will be liable: ” Bispham’s Eq., 139; Perry on Trusts, § 443. Of course, there is no duty to convert securities if, by the terms of the trust instrument, there is sufficient indication that the cestui que trust was intended to enjoy the interest, income, or dividends of the specific securities: Perry on Trusts, 450 ; Hill on Trustees, 582; Bispham’s Eq., 139.</p>

A deposit is where a sum of money is left with a banker for safe-keeping, subject to order, and payable, not in the specific money deposited, but in an equal sum. It may or may not bear interest, according to the agreement. Whilst the relation between the depositor and his banker is that of debtor or creditor simply, the transaction cannot in any proper sense be regarded as a loan, unless the money is left, not for safe-keeping but for a fixed period at interest, in which case the transaction assumes all the characteristics of a loan. The Orphans’ Court decided this case upon the rulings of this court in Frankenfield’s App., 11 W. N. 373, and Baer’s App., <a href="/pa/127/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="127 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="565733" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0360-01">127 Pa. 360</a>; but we think these cases are readily distinguishable from the case at bar. In Frankenfield’s Appeal, supra, there was a loan by the trustee of two thousand dollars of trust funds to the Franklin Savings Bank for three months, with interest at six per cent; thirty days’ notice to be given of the trustee’s intention to withdraw the deposit. The bank was in good repute, and there was no evidence of bad faith or want of care on the part of the trustee. Our Brother Green, in the opinion filed, said: “ If it had been an ordinary deposit, subject to the check of the depositor from the day it was made, the appellant would probably not have been liable; but it was not a deposit, it was a loan upon merely personal security for a fixed period, at interest; and during that period the money, because of the loan, was entirely beyond the trustee’s control. The twenty-fifth section of the act of June 12, 1836, expressly provides that such investments must be made under the direction of the Court of Common Pleas, and only exempts the trustee from liability when he pursues this course in good faith.” In Baer’s Appeal, supra, <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>the banker’s certificate of deposit was substantially in the same form as in Frankenfield’s Appeal, supra, .excepting that there was no stipulation for notice of the withdrawal of the deposit. The transaction possessed all the qualities of a loan of money for a year at four per cent interest. It is of no consequence that the borrower is a bank, for a bank may borrow money. Parties engaged in the banking business, whether as individuals or as members of a partnership or of a corporation, may take a loan of money for a fixed period of time at interest, with like effect as persons engaged in other pursuits. The transaction may be termed a time deposit, but it is none the less a loan, and subjects the lender to that degree of responsibility.</p>

This was the express understanding of both parties at the time. The transaction was entered upon the books of the bank as a deposit merely. It was treated as a temporary, provisional, or precautionary arrangement. No person would speak of this as an investment; an investment carries with it a greater or less degree of permanency, which does not characterize this transaction. It is true that two weeks’ notice was to be given of the withdrawal of the deposit, but this was a reasonable provision and not inconsistent with a bank deposit. Almost all savings institutions stipulate for notice of withdrawal with their depositors, and such a stipulation is for the benefit not only of the bank, but also of its depositors ; the reasonableness of the time is a question in each case to be determined by the court. It is said the trustee thereby loses control of the money; but that is not the true test. The depositor always, in a certain sense, loses control of the money when he places it in bank; for the bank may refuse payment of his checks, and, as he then has no claim upon the specific money, he stands upon the footing of a creditor merely. It is true, a trustee, as a general rule, is not allowed to part with the control of trust money: Salway v. Salway, 2 Russ. &amp; M. 215 ; but he may do so by way of precaution against loss, by a deposit in a solvent and reputable bank. A deposit, as we have said, is a temporary disposition of money for safekeeping ; and it is upon this ground alone that the trustee is <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>justified in depositing trust funds in bank, and it is upon tbe same ground that a deposit is distinguishable from an investment.</p>
