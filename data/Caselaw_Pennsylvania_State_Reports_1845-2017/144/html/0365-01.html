This defendant had the fight to take the property of the plaintiff against its will, bounded by the limitation that when it did so it would pay the full value of the property thus appropriated. Now, the Supreme Court has said, in a similar case, that in estimating the damages for property of this character, the property and franchises of a bridge company are represented by its stock, and the market value of the stock may be said to represent the market value of the property taken, as nearly as it can be ascertained. But, in the case on hand, we have no evidence of the market value of this stock. This stock was not listed on the stock exchanges of the commercial centres of the country, where it was sold daily, nor have we any evidence that it passed readily from hand to hand by sale and transfer in the borough of MifSintown, where the bridge was located. [It seems that this stock was held by a comparatively few, and there was no real market for it, not because it had no value, but because there were no purchasers, or no sellers; so, in the absence of evidence of the market value of the stock, the jury must get at the damages as best they can.] 9 I, therefore, charge you that, in estimating the damages, in this particular question, -you are to take into consideration the value of the physical structure at the time the county of Juniata appropriated it to its own use; and this value must be arrived at by taking into consideration the length and width of the structure, the number of the piers that supported the superstructure, the value of the masonry, the value of the fill and abutments, as well as the superstructure, and to that you are to add the value of the franchise.</p>

[Now, the value of a bridge structure, as well as the value of the franchise, depends to a very great extent upon the locality in which it is located. Let me illustrate: A company goes down into the narrows, between this borough and the borough of Mifflintown. Down in the centre, about nine miles from the face of man at either end of the’narrows, they erect a structure that would withstand flood and ice, and expend fifty thousand dollars for it. If the county would come and seize that, it would not be so valuable, being located in a sparsely settled country where there were no passengers to cross it, and no traffic to go over it, as it would be in the borough of Mifflintown, the county town of Juniata. So, in determining the value of it, you will have to consider the fact that it spans the river at the county town of Juniata, and take into consideration the nature of country around it, the number of the population, and the amount of travel that would naturally go over it, with the revenues that the traffic would bring to the coffers of the plaintiff company.] 10 Now, you have heard the character of this structure described by the witnesses on both sides.....</p>

Parker, who superintended the repair of the abutments and piers, possessed the knowledge requisite to give intelligent information as to the actual cost of those repairs, and such information would have been important to enable the jury to reach an intelligent conclusion in'the matter of damages. Our offers to prove the actual cost of the bridge, and what competent-builders would contract to erect a similar bridge for, were legitimate evidence upon the value of the bridge taken. Why should we not be permitted to show its actual cost? The company knew, when constructing it, that the county intended to take it, and it had no right to speculate upon the county. Questions as to the cost were proper: Kersey v. Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=133%20Pa.%20236" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="133 Pa. 236">133 Pa. 236</a>.</p>

Instead of saying that the liability of the bridge to destruction by flood and ice “ may be ” considered in estimating its value, the court should have said that this must be considered.</p>

    <p id="b400-5" data-blocks='[["BL_400.5",400,[271,439,1169,589]]]'>1. It is clear that the jury had nothing to do with the contract price of the bridge. As the court said, it was a matter of indifference whether the company got it for nothing, or at a nominal rate, or paid an excessive price; and the real question was one of market value. The returns made to the auditor general were not admissible. Section 2, act of June 7, 1879, P. L. 112, does not require a valuation of the stock when dividends of six per cent or more are paid. In such case, all that is required is a report of the par value of the stock. It is only when the dividends are nothing, or less than six per cent, that the treasurer and secretary are required to appraise the value of the stock in cash.</p>
    <p id="b400-6" data-blocks='[["BL_400.6",400,[266,1046,1171,754]]]'>2. The appraisements for 1885 to 1889 were therefore a work of supererogation. Had the returns been received, they would have necessitated a collateral inquiry as to the causes which reduced the stock in 1888,1884 and 1885. Besides, they were made for the old wooden bridge, and not for the new iron structure taken from the plaintiff. Again, they were made for purposes of taxation, and the stockholders could not be prejudiced by anything the treasurer and secretary might do. It was not the stock that was taken by the county, but the structure and the franchise. A corporation may own property worth five times the par value of its capital stock, and the stock was not an element in the controversy. The objection to the answer to the defendant’s point is hypercritical. “ May ” often means must, and it is the usual form employed by judges in instructing juries.</p>

Bridge Co., <a href="/pa/110/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="110 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="543724" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0054-01">110 Pa. 54</a>, that where a bridge is taken by a county for public use, under the act of May 8, 1876, P. L. 181, the measure of damages is the value of the property to the owners, not to the county taking it, and that such value is to be ascertained, not only by the cost of the structure, but also by the value of its franchises. The value of its franchises depends largely upon its earning capacity. A bridge, as was observed in the case cited, is a peculiar kind of property, and seldom has a market value. The value of its capital stock may, and generally does indicate, <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>with some accuracy, the value of its franchises. Hence, in an action against a county for taking a bridge, the cost or value of the structure, the amount of net tolls, and the market value of its capital stock are all elements to be considered in ascertaining the value of the bridge and its corporate franchises. No one of these elements, standing alone, would, in all cases, furnish a test; considered together, they will seldom fail to lead to a satisfactory result.</p>
    <p id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.5",401,[126,798,1168,506]]]'>The first three assignments may be considered together. The witness, L. G. Brown, was asked as to the value of the bridge, by which I understand to be meant the superstructure only. This was objected to, on the ground that Brown, having contracted for the erection of the bridge, should have been asked as to the contract price. We do not think this objection well taken. The true question was the value of the bridge, not what it cost. The contractor may have taken it at too low a figure, or the owner may have paid too much. The county is entitled to pay for it at its actual value at the time of taking.</p>
    <p id="b401-7" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[126,1311,1168,198]]]'>The fourth and fifth assignments allege that the court below erred in rejecting evidence in reference to the cost of certain repairs to the bridge. The evidence was clearly irrelevant, and properly rejected.</p>
    <p id="b401-8" data-blocks='[["BL_401.7",401,[126,1515,1168,909]],["BL_402.1",402,[272,386,1169,504]]]'>The sixth assignment is more serious. The defendant offered a certified copy of the return made by the bridge company of the value of its capital stock to the auditor general, under oath, from the year 1881 up to the present time. This was offered for the purpose of showing the value of the capital stock as made for the company under oath by its officers. The capital stock represents the property and franchises of the corporation, and, as before observed, is an element to ascertain the damages. The plaintiff had given in evidence, to show the value of the capital stock or franchises, the receipts from tolls for 1884-89. It was clearly competent, therefore, for the defendant to show the value placed by the company upon its own stock, a valuation made upon the oath of its officers. It is no answer to this to say that the return was made by the officers, and not by the stockholders. The officers were the duly constituted agents or representatives of the latter, and their act was the act of the corporation itself. The return was made in pursuance of the act of assembly, and was the official act of the corporation. <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>Hence we need not discuss the cases cited as to the power of an agent to bind his principal by his declarations. They are not relevant. While this return does not conclude the bridge company upon the question of value, it is nevertheless competent evidence for the consideration of the jury, and is moreover important. The difference between the verdict and the valuation placed upon its property by the company, under the oath of its officers, is so great as to justify the suggestion that the verdict was too large, or the company has undervalued its property to escape taxation.</p>
    <p id="b402-6" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[272,899,1167,287]]]'>What has been said covers the seventh assignment. The eighth assignment is not sustained. It was not relevant to show what the county could have erected a new bridge for, at this or some other point. The county might have erected a new bridge, but it preferred to take the bridge of the plaintiff, and must pay for it at its value to the latter.</p>
    <p id="b402-7" data-blocks='[["BL_402.6",402,[269,1204,1167,641]]]'>The remaining assignments refer to the charge of the court, and are not sustained. The learned judge said, in answer to the defendant’s first point: “ If the jury finds that the property was liable to destruction from flood or ice, this may be considered to the extent that this liability decreased the value of the property.” This was an affirmance of the point, but the defendant complains that it was not strong enough, and that the learned judge should have instructed the jury that they <em>must </em>consider the matters referred to, instead of that they <em>may </em>do so. This is somewhat of a refinement. The jury could not fail to have understood that, if the liability to destruction from flood and ice lessened the value of the property, their verdict should be reduced to that extent.</p>
