The second section provides that, upon application to the proper court, real estate may be sold, “ whenever real estate shall be entailed, or contingent remainders or executory <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>devises shall be limited thereon.”.

It is very evident that there is a remainder contingent upon Mary Ann dying without issue. Should she have issue, the remainder to William, Susan, Amanda, and Wilhelmina would be worthless. It was to bar this contingent remainder that the application was made to the Orphans’ Court; there could have been no other motive, as but for this contingent remainder, the <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>remainder-men named could have passed the fee without an order of the court.

We are unable to see what the executor of Samuel Westhafer has to do with this real estate. It may be that William Westhafer, executor, and William Westhafer, devisee, are one and the same person; but the petition does not say so, nor is there any averment in it that he, the petitioner, has any interest in the real estate. Such facts can only be found inferentially from the similarity of names. This is an irregularity, but perhaps not a very serious one, after final decree. There is another flaw in the proceedings, however, which is serious. It is at least doubtful whether there is anything upon the face of the petition to give the Orphans’ Court jurisdiction. Waiving that question, it is very clear that the decree of the court below cannot operate to bar the contingent remainder. The fifth section of the act of 1853 provides “ that the petition shall set forth an explanation of the title, and of the purpose to bar the entail, defeat the contingent remainder,” etc. As before stated, the only object of this application.to <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>the Orphans’ Court was to defeat this contingent remainder; yet no such purpose is stated in the petition, although expressly required to be set forth therein by the act of assembly: Smith v. Townsend, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20Pa.%20442" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="32 Pa. 442">32 Pa. 442</a>. We are of opinion that by reason of this defect the contingent remainder is not barred. It follows that the title is defective, and the defendant is not bound to accept it in this shape.</p>
    <p id="b60-5" data-blocks='[["BL_60.5",60,[273,742,1159,348]]]'>We have heretofore had occasion to condemn this loose and careless way of proceeding under the Price act. In a matter so serious as the title to real estate, too much care cannot be exercised in the preparation of the papers and the conduct of the proceedings. Above all, it is essential to see that the case comes clearly within the act of 1853, and therefore within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
    <p id="b60-6" data-blocks='[["BL_60.6",60,[533,1097,896,84]]]'>The judgment is reversed; and judgment is now entered for the defendant.</p>
