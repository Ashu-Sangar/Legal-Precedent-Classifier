      <em>(a) </em>In an action for the breach of a warranty of soundness on the sale of a horse, the defendant requested the court to charge that “if the jury believe that the alleged defect was a patent defect, apparent upon careless inspection, then the same is not covered by a general warranty : ”</p>

Hoover. The plaintiff filed a statement of claim averring that, on November 10,1887, he bought from the defendant a mare which the defendant at the time warranted to be sound; that the mare proved to be unsound and defective, in that she had a bad and unsound eye, which defect could not be seen when the plaintiff bought her; and that the plaintiff had sold the mare at a loss of sixty dollars, to recover which this suit was brought. The defendant pleaded non-assumpsit.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b247-12" data-blocks='[["BL_247.14",247,[147,2041,1173,401]],["BL_248.1",248,[281,403,1167,349]]]'>At the trial, on October 24, 1890, the plaintiff testified that at the time of the sale of the mare the defendant guaranteed her to be sound and all right, with the exception of “ one big teat.” In this he was corroborated. The defendant testified that he merely represented the mare to be sound as far as he knew. There was testimony submitted to the effect that a day or two after the purchase of the mare it was found that she had a defective eye, known as “ blue-eye,” discoverable by <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>examination in the light. One of defendant’s witnesses testified that he had worked with the mare, had led her out for examination at the time of the sale, and that he never noticed the defect in the eye. Another witness, called by the defendant, testified that he had worked with the mare, and saw her a few days before the sale, but did not see anything wrong with her eyes.</p>

If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the eye of the horse was defective and that this defect impaired its value, even if Hoover was utterly ignorant of the defect, if he warranted the horse to be sound, the verdict must be for the plaintiff for such an amount as will compensate him for the damage he has suffered.</p>

    <p id="b249-8" data-blocks='[["BL_249.7",249,[139,913,1176,610]]]'>We do not think it was error to deny the defendant’s second point, which asked the court to instruct the jury “ that, if the jury believe that the alleged defect was a patent defect, apparent upon careless inspection, then the same is not covered by a general warranty.” The jury have found the fact of a warranty, and the breach. Said breach related to a defect in the eye, known among horsemen as “ blue-eye.” Our attention has not been called to a word of testimony showing that this was “a patent defect, apparent upon careless inspection.” We are not called upon to consider the law as stated in the point, for the reason that it is of no importance, unless based upon the testimony in the case.</p>
