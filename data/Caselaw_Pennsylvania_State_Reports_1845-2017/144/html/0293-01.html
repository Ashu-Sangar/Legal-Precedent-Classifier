Huber, then discharged, and gave bond in the sum of $50,000 for each minor. He received from Mr. Huber, the former guardian, $24,679.43 for each minor, and gave his release for the same. This money was represented largely by notes of the consolidated firms, for money loaned them by Jacob H. Huber, as guardian, and by him transferred to John H. Small. These notes were renewed by Mr. Small, as guardian, and the loan increased. The notes taken therefor bore six per cent interest, and were renewed from time to time until 1881. They were, with but one exception which arose from a mistake of the secretary of the company in writing the note, made payable to Mr. Small as guardian. The amount thus loaned the firm b}*- Mr. Small, the guardian of both minors, varied from $35,000 to $40,000 ; that is, from $17,000 to $20,000 for each minor. The remainder of their shares was placed in bank to his own credit, and his wards, allowed six per cent interest upon it. This loan was made to the firm by Mr. Small, under the advice of a well-known and responsible lawyer, the late John L. Mayer, of York, Pa., and with the knowledge and acquiescence of the mother of the minors. On the twenty-third day of November, 1881, the Billmeyer &amp; Small Oo. paid <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>their note to the guardian, amounting to $40,000, which, upon the order of the court on the petition of the guardian, was invested in three and a half per cent United States bonds, $20,000 for each minor.

The H. Small’s Sons and the Billmeyer &amp; Small firms owned valuable real estate and a large amount of valuable stock in trade. Their credit during the time of the investment of this money with them was excellent. They were in the habit of borrowing money for the purposes of their business, and were able to obtain it at less rate of interest than they were paying for the loan of this money. This loan, like other money borrowed by them at home, was obtained by them without collateral security. It was loaned the firm by Mr. Small, not to oblige them, as they could readily borrow elsewhere. Mr. Small says in his testimony, “ they could have gotten all the money they wanted. It was a detriment to them.” They were always able to pay off the money loaned them by Mr. Small, the guardian, and several times offered to do so, but at his urgent request were induced to retain it, paying him six per cent interest for its use.</p>

The auditor decides that, inasmuch as they have ratified the action of their guardian, in the investment of their moneys in the business of the firm and corporation, by their effort to claim profits, they must also share proportionately in the losses.

By his claiming the profits in the firm and corporation to whom the money had been loaned, which the court by its decree previously allowed, the ward adopts the investment as his own, and thereby becomes bound to bear his proportion of the losses in his chosen business. He demands the payment to him of all profits made by his guardian on the moneys of the ward loaned to said firm and corporation. It is not just nor equitable for him to object to bearing all losses of the guardian on said fund in said business before the profits are reckoned. John H. Small had a one third interest in said business when the losses occurred, and, of course, suffered one third of said losses. With what grace can the ward say to his guardian: “You have reaped heavy profits in your firm, to which my money was loaned, which the law gives me, and which you must pay me. If you have lost largely for two of the years you were engaged in said business, with' the trust funds loaned to the firm, that is your business; that loss must all be borne by your individual interest. Your capital may be decreased to. the extent of your share of said loss, but my fund, including the accumulated profits, must remain intact to continue to yield heavy profits for me during the years ensuing. At most, I cannot be called upon to bear more than two ninths of the proportionate share of the loss on my fund ? ”</p>

His principal grievance was that the latter loaned a portion of the trust funds to a firm of which he, the guardian, was a member, and for this reason claimed to hold him to a share of the profits of the firm instead of interest. The court below sustained this contention, and an account was taken which is not satisfactory to the appellant. While the technical rule of law invoked is undoubtedly with the latter, it is at least doubtful whether this is a case in which it ought to have been applied. . The Orphans’ Court will punish a guardian for a breach of trust involving the loss of his ward’s money, but is slow to do so for a successful and profitable management of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[122,1157,1170,96]]]'>The circumstances of this case were altogether peculiar, and the learned judge below expressly finds :</p>
    <p id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.6",329,[122,1259,1174,658]]]'>“ The money of John H. Small’s wards, so used by the firm, excluded so much of his own capital from this profitable investment. He only loaned it to the firm for the benefit and advantage of his wards, and not for his own benefit and advantage. His conduct and management of this trust fund are entirely consistent with fair dealing, and show careful and prudent management under most competent counsel. He did not employ the wards’ money in his own firm and corporation, for the purpose of speculation and personal profit and advantage ; because the evidence conclusively shows that this investment of the money of the wards was entirely in their interest. The purpose and intent to obtain a selfish advantage to the guardian were entirely absent from his mind.”</p>
    <p id="b329-7" data-blocks='[["BL_329.7",329,[125,1922,1172,502]],["BL_330.1",330,[287,395,1173,803]]]'>This finding was fully warranted by the evidence. Jacob Small, the father of the appellant, was at the time of his death a member of the firm of H. Small’s Sons &amp; Co., of which firm the guardian was also a member. Among the assets of Jacob Small’s estate was a note of said firm, for money loaned by him, for $16,434.87. The firm was admittedly solvent and prosperous, and the guardian continued this loan, made by the decedent himself, and subsequently made some additional loans, for the sole purpose, as the court has found and the evidence shows, of getting a good rate of interest for his wards’ money. <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>While not a legal investment, it was a reasonably prudent one, and proved successful. The appellant might well have hesitated, under the circumstances, before entering upon the tedious and expensive process of charging his guardian with a share of the profits of the firm. The result of this investigation, as before observed, is not satisfactory to the appellant. He is willing to take a share of the profits, but not to share the losses of the firm, and the necessary charges and expenses incident to the conduct of the business. Numerous assignments of error have been filed to the findings of the auditor and the court below. They are in the main to the theory upon which the account is stated, and are without merit. To discuss them in detail would consume much time, and serve no good purpose. We think the principles adopted by the auditor are substantially correct, and if there are any errors in the details they have not been made to appear.</p>
