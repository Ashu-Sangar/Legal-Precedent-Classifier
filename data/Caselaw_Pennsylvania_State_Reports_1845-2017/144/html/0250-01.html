A proper system of practice under such rules greatly facilitates and expedites the trial of causes, and often relieves the jury from the consideration of a heterogeneous mass of testimony bearing upon facts which the defendant cannot deny, but which plaintiff would otherwise be required to establish by formal proof. The controversy is thus narrowed down to such items of claim and material matters of fact as are really disputed. In such cases, it is the province of the court to examine the respective affidavits, and thus ascertain what items of claim, and averments of fact in support thereof, are not denied by defendant, and then confine the testimony to such items of claim and material averments of fact as are denied. I have known cases in which the items of claim were as many as twenty or more, and the averments of fact in support of them <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>even more numerous. On examination of the verified statement of claim and affidavit of defence, it would perhaps be found that a very small percentage of these was denied. All that is necessary, in such cases, is to confine the testimony to such material averments of fact as are denied by defendant’s affidavit; and, in submitting the case to the jury, to call their attention to the items of claim and averments of fact that are not denied, and should therefore be accepted as established, and instruct them as to those that are denied, etc. The “ specific averment of facts ” contemplated by the rule need not be separate and distinct from the plaintiff’s statement of claim. If the latter is as full and as specific as it should be, it will answer all the purposes of a separate specific averment of facts, under the rule of court.</p>

The offer shows that the attention of the court was called to the fact that neither the sale, nor the price of the property sold and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant, as averred in the statement of claim, was denied, and that plaintiff proposed to rest upon the admission under the provisions of the rule. This was specially objected to because “the affidavit of defence, which is necessary in order that the court may determine what material points have been denied by the defendant,” etc., was not offéred in connection with plaintiff’s statement. The objection was met by an offer of the affidavit of defence in connection with plaintiff’s statement, “ for the purpose of showing that the defendant has not denied the sale or price of the goods sold.” Of course, this offer was to the court, and was doubtless so understood by the learned judge who presided at the trial. His reason for ruling against the plaintiff, as stated by himself, was “ that the material matters, set forth in the plaintiff’s statement, entitling him to recover in the case, are sufficiently denied to put the plaintiff upon proof.” In this he was clearly in error. Why put the plaintiff upon proof of the sale and delivery of the horse and other articles specified in plaintiff’s statement, when, as we have already seen, the fact of the sale, including price and delivery, as claimed by plaintiff, is not only undenied, <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>but distinctly admitted by the defendant. The averment of “ complete defence,” denial of liability, etc., are referable to the defence set up by way of avoidance. . As well might the plaintiff, in an issue on a formal plea in confession and avoidance, be required to make out a prima-facie case by calling witnesses to prove the very matters confessed. Suppose, in a suit on an ordinary promissory note, the defendant has filed a verified statement, averring the making and delivery of the note by the defendant, etc., and the latter, in his affidavit of defence, admits the making and delivery of the note as alleged, but avers that at the time it was so made and delivered it was expressly agreed that it should be paid in merchandise on or before its maturity, that payment in merchandise was duly tendered, etc., and that he is not indebted to the plaintiff, etc. What propriety would there be in requiring the plaintiff to make out his case by testimony showing the making and delivery of the note ? Such a construction of a wise and salutary rule would not only needlessly impair its usefulness, but it would have nothing, either in reason or authority, to sustain it. It follows from what has been said, that the plaintiff had a right to avail himself of the defendant’s admissions, under the rule, of the sale and delivery of the horse and other articles as averred, and rest upon the same until something, by way of defence, was shown by the defendant.</p>

The ruling of the court was not based on any such ground, and we express no opinion in regard to it. The plaintiff was improperly nonsuited, and of course, the refusal to take off the nonsuit was errbr. Both specifications are sustained..</p>
