        "text": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nJustice EAKIN.\nWalter Winklespecht, a state prisoner, petitions this Court for writ of habeas corpus. Winklespecht challenges the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole\u2019s decision to deny him parole, and claims this denial violated the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution. See U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 10.\nIn 1988, Winklespecht was sentenced to 7-20 years imprisonment for rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and to a consecutive term of five years probation for aggravated assault. He was denied parole October 19, 1994, October 17, 1995, October 25, 1999, and October 23, 2000. The Board listed the following reasons for denial of parole in 1994 and 1995:\nPOOR PRISON ADJUSTMENT.\nSUBSTANCE ABUSE.\nHABITUAL OFFENDER.\nASSAULTIVE INSTANT OFFENSE.\nVERY HIGH ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR POTENTIAL. VICTIM INJURY.\nYOUR NEED FOR .... COUNSELING AND TREATMENT.\nNotices Of Board Decision, 10/26/94 and 12/09/95.\nThe Board gave the following explanations for its denials in 1999 and 2000:\nFOLLOWING AN INTERVIEW AND REVIEW OF YOUR FILE, THE PENNSYLVANIA BOARD OF PROBATION AND PAROLE HAS DETERMINED THAT THE MANDATES TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC AND TO ASSIST IN THE FAIR ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE CANNOT BE ACHIEVED THROUGH YOUR RELEASE ON PAROLE. YOU ARE THEREFORE REFUSED PAROLE....\nNotice Of Board Decision, 10/25/99 (emphasis added).\nFOLLOWING AN INTERVIEW AND REVIEW OF YOUR FILE, THE PENNSYLVANIA BOARD OF PROBATION AND PAROLE HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE CANNOT BE ACHIEVED THROUGH YOUR RELEASE ON PAROLE.\nNotice of Board Decision, 10/23/00 (emphasis added).\nThe emphasized language in the 1999 and 2000 notices is found in \u00a7 331.1 of the Parole Act, as revised in 1996:\n\u00a7 331.1. Public Policy as to parole\nThe parole system provides several benefits to the criminal justice system, including the provision of adequate supervision of the offender while protecting the public, the opportunity for the offender to become a useful member of society and the diversion of appropriate offenders from prison.. In providing these benefits to the criminal justice system, the board shall first and foremost seek to protect the safety of the public. In addition to this goal, the board shall address input by crime victims and assist in the fair admin istrabion of justice by ensuring the custody, control and treatment of paroled offenders.\n61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1 (emphasis added).\nWith respect to policy, the prior version of the Act read: The value of parole as a disciplinary and corrective influence and process is hereby recognized, and it is declared to be the public policy of this Commonwealth that persons subject or sentenced to imprisonment for crime shall, on release therefrom, be subjected to a period of parole during which their rehabilitation, adjustment and restoration to social and economic life and activities shall be aided and facilitated by guidance and supervision under a competent and efficient parole administration, and to that end it is the intent of this act to create a uniform and exclusive system for the administration of parole in this Commonwealth.\nAct 1941, Aug. 6, P.L. 861, \u00a7 1.\nFollowing the most recent denial of parole, Winklespecht attempted to appeal to the Commonwealth Court by filing a petition for review. The court concluded he was seeking to appeal from an unappealable order, and dismissed the petition. Pursuant to this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 721(1), Winklespecht filed an application to file original process in this Court, and also filed his habeas corpus petition. We granted Winklespecht leave to file the petition, directed he receive appointed counsel, and ordered the parties to file briefs.\nWinklespecht argues the changes in the Parole Act between the time of his crimes and his 1999 and 2000 parole applications unconstitutionally subjected him to an ex post facto law. He asserts such claim is cognizable under Pennsylvania\u2019s habeas corpus statute, and that the proper venue for filing a habeas corpus petition is the court of common pleas in the county where the sentence was imposed.\nThis Court has not yet answered the question of whether habeas corpus is an available remedy for the denial of parole based on an ex post facto violation, nor have we determined the proper venue for seeking such relief. It is well settled, however, that a prisoner has no legitimate expectation of being paroled after serving the minimum sentence, Rogers v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, 555 Pa. 285, 724 A.2d 319 (1999), and, due to the discretionary nature of the decision to deny parole, no right to appeal is available under the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 101. See Rogers, at 321.\nRelying on the rationale in Rogers, this Court, in Coady v. Vaughn, 564 Pa. 604, 770 A.2d 287 (2001), held that where a challenge to the denial of parole is not based on the exercise of the board\u2019s discretion, but instead on the board\u2019s application of new statutory requirements, an ex post facto challenge may be raised in an action for mandamus brought in the Commonwealth Court. Id., at 290. The availability of habeas corpus as a remedy was not discussed by the majority, presumably because the parties did not argue its application. Justice Castille, concurring in Coady, criticized the decision in Weaver v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, 688 A.2d 766, 775 n. 17 (Pa.Cmwlth.1997) (constitutional challenge to denial of parole cannot properly be raised in habeas corpus proceeding), and noted, \u201cthere is a very strong argument that state habeas corpus review of the constitutional claim at issue here is not clearly foreclosed under this Court\u2019s jurisprudence ...,\u201d or by statute. Coady, at 294.\nAn ex post facto law is one which is \u201cadopted after the complaining party committed the criminal acts and \u2018inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\u2019 \u201d Coady, at 289 n. 2 (quoting California Dep\u2019t. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U.S. 499, 504-06, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995)).\nOne function of the Ex Post Facto Clause is to bar enactments which, by retroactive operation, increase the punishment for a crime after its commission. Retroactive changes in laws governing parole of prisoners, in some instances, may be violative of this precept. Whether retroactive application of a particular change in parole law respects the prohibition on ex post facto legislation is often a question of particular difficulty when the discretion vested in a parole board is taken into account.\nGamer v. Jones, 529 U.S. 244, 249-50, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000) (citations omitted).\nAlthough Winklespecht couches his underlying claim as an ex post facto violation, clearly his punishment has not been increased. The rewording of 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1 did not create a substantial risk that parole would be denied any more frequently than under the previous wording, nor did the addition of this language create a new offense or increase the penalty for an existing offense. See Morales, at 506 n. 3, 115 S.Ct. 1597 (\u201cthe focus of the ex post facto inquiry is not on whether a legislative change produces some ambiguous sort of \u2018disadvantage,\u2019 nor, ... on whether an amendment affects a prisoner\u2019s \u2018opportunity to take advantages of provisions for early release\u2019.... \u201d). Although the language concerning \u201cprotecting] the safety of the public\u201d and \u201cassisting] in the fair administration of justice\u201d was added to \u00a7 331.1 in 1996, these concepts are nothing new to the parole process and have always been underlying concerns. Both versions of \u00a7 331.1 leave the decision regarding the grant of parole within the discretion of the Board; the fact that some language was added in 1996, which clarified the policy underlying the parole process, does nothing that increases Winklespecht\u2019s punishment. See Prater v. U.S. Parole Com., 802 F.2d 948, 952 (7th Cir.1986) (\u201cIf ... the Parole Commission takes a more jaundiced view of applications for parole, the ex post facto prohibition is not violated, even though a criminal\u2019s punishment may end up being longer or harsher than he hoped when he committed the crime.\u201d). Reordering of considerations for necessary decisions within an unchanged penalty do not rise to an ex post facto violation.\nTherefore, Winklespecht\u2019s claims do not raise an ex post facto issue. As Winklespecht has failed to articulate a true constitutional claim, no relief is due, and we leave for another day the question of the propriety of habeas corpus as a remedy.\nThe petition for writ of habeas corpus is hereby denied.\nJustice CAPPY files a concurring opinion.\nJustice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion in which Justice Newman joins.\nChief Justice ZAPPALA and Justice NIGRO concur in the result.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\n. In his habeas petition, Winklespecht also argued that an intervening federal law, the Federal Violent Offenders Truth in Sentencing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13703, and changes in unspecified Parole Board guidelines violated the ex post facto clause. Winklespecht does not raise these issues in his brief, focusing instead on his claims involving state statutory law; therefore, we deem these other claims abandoned and will not address them.\n. An identical ex post facto challenge to the rewording of 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1 was raised by petition for writ of mandamus in Finnegan v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, 156 MAP 2001.\n. Winklespecht makes the same claim with respect to an addition in the October 23, 2000 Notice of Board Decision, which provides a sex offender evaluation be available at the time of Winklespecht\u2019s next review. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.4(g) (Board may request assessment of sexually violent predator be conducted and report be provided to Board prior to considering offender or sexually violent predator for parole). The essence of Winklespecht\u2019s claim, in the context of an ex post facto argument, is that permitting the Board to request a sex offender evaluation results in the imposition of greater punishment than at the time he was convicted. The issue of whether this unconstitutionally increases the penalties to which a defendant is exposed is currently before this Court in Commonwealth v. Williams, 61 WAP 2001 (argued April 8, 2002).",

Although this Court has nonexclusive original jurisdiction of all cases sounding in habeas corpus, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 721(1), I believe that the better practice is for such petitions to be filed with the sentencing court pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 108(A) (\u201cA petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging the legality of the petitioner\u2019s detention or confinement in a criminal matter shall be filed with the clerk of courts of the judicial district in which the order directing the petitioner\u2019s detention or confinement was entered.\u201d).\nI fully agree, however, with the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that the constitutional ex post facto claim raised here \u2014 a claim this Court has seen raised with increasing frequency on our allocatur and miscellaneous dockets \u2014 is entirely meritless.

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\nConcurring and Dissenting.\nIn this decision the Court, upon petition for a writ of habeas corpus, proceeds to review the Petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenge to the denial of his application for parole. After concluding that there is no merit to Petitioner\u2019s underlying claim, and correspondingly that no relief is due, the majority then states that \u201cwe leave for another day the question of the propriety of habeas corpus as a remedy.\u201d Majority Opinion, at 692. I believe that this approach may have unintended consequences.\nRecourse to the writ of habeas corpus, historically used to test the legality of custody, see Commonwealth ex rel. Paulinski v. Isaac, 488 Pa. 467, 471, 397 A.2d 760, 762 (1979), is more of a right than a \u201cremedy.\u201d See Commonwealth ex rel. Milewski v. Ashe, 362 Pa. 48, 50, 66 A.2d 281, 282 (1949); Commonwealth ex rel. Penland v. Ashe, 341 Pa. 337, 340, 19 A.2d 464, 466 (1941) (observing that habeas corpus is a \u201cwrit of right\u201d and not a \u201cwrit of error\u201d). Upon habeas petition allowed, the writ issues, directed to the authorities and ordering them to produce the prisoner and \u201ccertify!] the true cause of detention.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6504. Following review, if the issuing court finds merit to the allegations of wrongful detention, the ultimate remedy is a release from custody or confinement. See Commonwealth v. Hess, 489 Pa. 580, 586, 414 A.2d 1043, 1046 (1980). By passing upon the merits of Petitioner\u2019s constitutional claim, therefore, the court has, in effect, afforded habeas review, while simultaneously denying that it is deciding the question of whether such review may be had. This method suggests, moreover, that any prisoner incarcerated within the Commonwealth\u2019s penal system who is denied parole will be entitled, upon the filing of a habeas corpus petition, to Supreme Court merits review of any alleged constitutional deprivation. The more prudent course, in my view, would be to simply dismiss the petition, as Petitioner\u2019s underlying claim is not cognizable under a habeas corpus paradigm.\nHabeas corpus is an extraordinary measure, which \u201c \u2018involves a collateral attack on the process or judgment constituting the basis of the detention.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth ex rel. McGlinn v. Smith, 344 Pa. 41, 48, 24 A.2d 1, 5 (1942) (quoting Goto v. Lane, 265 U.S. 393, 401, 44 S.Ct. 525, 527, 68 L.Ed. 1070 (1924)). Thus, while the scope of the writ is broad, its purpose has traditionally been limited to reaching detention which is illegal in the first instance. See McGlinn, 344 Pa. at 48, 24 A.2d at 5. Although, in recent years, the writ has also been used as a vehicle to obtain prison transfer where the conditions of confinement violate fundamental freedoms, see Commonwealth ex rel. Bryant v. Hendrick, 444 Pa. 83, 88-89, 280 A.2d 110, 112-113 (1971) (habeas relief available where prison conditions constitute cruel and unusual punishment), the fact remains that the habeas petitioner\u2019s underlying contention is that he is entitled to be delivered from the custody of the authorities presently holding him. See Commonwealth ex rel. Smith v. Ashe, 364 Pa. 93, 101, 71 A.2d 107, 111 (1950) (observing that \u201c \u2018habeas corpus should only be allowed when the court or judge is satisfied that the party hath probable cause to be delivered\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 3 Blackstone 132); Commonwealth ex rel. Milewski v. Ashe, 362 Pa. 48, 50, 66 A.2d 281, 282-83 (1949) (habeas corpus may only issue where the petitioner\u2019s allegations, if true, would entitle him to release from confinement). See generally Commonwealth ex rel. Codispoti v. Rundle, 200 Pa.Super. 487, 489, 190 A.2d 153, 154 (1963) (the function of a court entertaining a habeas petition is limited to delivering from imprisonment those who are illegally confined).\nThis Petitioner\u2019s underlying claim, by contrast, constitutes a challenge only to the standards employed by the Parole Board when it exercised its discretion after the relevant statutory changes took effect. Thus, even assuming the validity of his interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, the only relief to which he would be entitled would be an order directing the Parole Board to re-consider his suitability for parole under the standards existing when he was sentenced. This is mandamus relief.\nThis Court, moreover, has already determined that, where the Parole Board exercises its discretion pursuant to changed statutory requirements, mandamus \u201cremains viable as a means for examining whether such requirements have been altered in a manner that violates the ex post facto clause,\u201d Coady v. Vaughn, 564 Pa. 604, 608-09, 770 A.2d 287, 290 (2001), the very claim that Petitioner advances here. Thus, I see no need for an additional avenue of review, particularly one that, as noted, does not traditionally encompass decisions regarding parole. See generally McGlinn, 344 Pa. at 48, 24 A.2d at 4-5 (observing that habeas corpus can only be successfully invoked where there is a \u201cpeculiar and pressing need for it\u201d); Paulinski 483 Pa. at 471, 397 A.2d at 762-63 (1979) (habeas corpus is only available when other remedies have been exhausted); Commonwealth ex rel. Johnson v. Bookbinder, 213 Pa.Super. 335, 339, 247 A.2d 644, 647 (1968) (habeas is not available when mandamus is employable). Accordingly, I would hold that habeas corpus does not lie to challenge the standards utilized by the Parole Board in denying parole, and would dismiss the petition on that basis without reaching the merits of the constitutional issue presented.\nWith regard to the majority\u2019s treatment of the underlying issue, I agree that Petitioner\u2019s substantive claim is not meritorious. One function of the Ex Post Facto Clause is to prevent states from enacting laws which increase the punishment for a crime after its commission. See U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1. While laws altering the standards for parole eligibility may fall within the scope of that proscription, see Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 445-46,117 S.Ct. 891, 898, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997) (citing Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 32, 101 S.Ct. 960, 966, 67 L.Ed.2d 17, 24-26 (1981)), it \u201cshould not be employed for \u2018the micromanagement of an endless array of legislative adjustments to parole and sentencing procedures.\u2019 \u201d Garner v. Jones, 529 U.S. 244, 252, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 1368, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000) (quoting California v. Morales, 514 U.S. 499, 508, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 1603, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995)). Instead, the states \u201cmust have due flexibility in formulating parole procedures and addressing problems associated with confinement and release.\u201d Id. Consequently, there is no per se rule precluding retroactive changes in parole procedures or guidelines, even where such measures may potentially alter a prisoner\u2019s actual term of confinement. See Morales, 514 U.S. at 506 n. 3, 115 5. Ct. at 1602 n. 3 (the mere fact that a legislative change may work \u201csome ambiguous sort of \u2018disadvantage\u2019 \u201d to the prospective parolee is insufficient to support a determination that an ex post facto violation has occurred). The controlling inquiry is whether the retroactively-applied rule \u201ccreates a significant risk of prolonging [Petitioner\u2019s] incarceration.\u201d Jones, 529 U.S. at 251, 120 S.Ct. at 1368 (citing Morales, 514 U.S. at 509, 115 S.Ct. at 1603).\nThe Supreme Court has not defined precisely what constitutes a sufficient risk of increased punishment, and indeed, has repeatedly eschewed use of any single formula for identifying those legislative parole adjustments which would survive an ex post facto challenge. See, e.g., Jones, 529 U.S. at 252, 120 S.Ct. at 1368. It has, however, noted that the question is a matter of degree, see id. at 250, 120 S.Ct. at 1367, and indicated further that the party asserting an ex post facto claim bears the burden of \u201cestablishing that the measure of punishment itself has changed.\u201d Morales, 514 U.S. at 510 n. 6, 115 S.Ct. at 1603 n. 6. In further defining this standard, the Supreme Court recently indicated that, \u201c[w]hen the rule does not by its own terms show a significant risk, the [challenger] must demonstrate, by evidence drawn from the rule\u2019s practical implementation ... that its retroactive application will result in a longer period of incarceration than under the earlier rule.\u201d Jones, 529 U.S. at 255, 120 S.Ct. at 1370. This creates a two-step inquiry, including a facial analysis of the rule\u2014 considered within the entire context of the state\u2019s parole system, see id. at 252,120 S.Ct. at 1368 \u2014 as well as a review of how the amendment is likely to be applied. In undertaking this analysis, the recent Supreme Court decisions in Morales, Jones, and Lynce provide guidance.\nMorales involved a facial challenge to a change in California\u2019s parole regulations whereby the parole board had discretion to wait up to three years to reconsider releasing individuals convicted of multiple murders, rather than holding annual suitability reviews as required under the prior law. The Court upheld the statute, noting that the affected inmates were those least likely to be deemed suitable for parole in any event, and hence, the amendment created only a speculative, attenuated risk of increasing their punishment. See Morales, 514 at 508-09, 115 S.Ct. at 1603. Likewise, in Jones the petitioner challenged a revision in Georgia\u2019s parole guidelines, which increased the maximum interval between parole suitability considerations from three to eight years. The Supreme Court determined that such change did not create a sufficient risk of prolonged incarceration because the parole board retained discretion to reconsider a prisoner for release well before the eight-year period expired, particularly where a change in circumstances warranted expedited review. Furthermore, the board\u2019s internal guidelines dictated that it would only wait the full eight years when the inmate was not expected to become suitable for parole in any event. This allowed the board to \u201cput its resources to better use, to ensure that those prisoners who should receive parole come to its attention.\u201d Jones, 529 U.S. at 254, 120 S.Ct. at 1370. In Lynce, on the other hand, the Court disallowed a Florida parole amendment which retroactively cancelled provisional early release credits, resulting in the petitioner\u2019s re-arrest and incarceration. In striking down the law, the Court noted that, unlike the California amendment at issue involved in Morales, the Florida statute \u201cdid more than simply remove a mechanism that created an opportunity for early release for a class of prisoners whose release was unlikely; rather, it made ineligible for early release a class of prisoners who were previously eligible \u2014 including some, like petitioner, who had actually been released.\u201d Lynce, 519 U.S. at 447, 117 S.Ct. at 898 (emphasis in original).\nBecause the amendment presently under review applies to all prisoners, it arguably creates a greater risk of increased punishment than the rule at issue in Morales, which, as noted, only pertained to inmates convicted of multiple murders. Additionally, it addresses the manner in which the Board must exercise its discretion, as indicated by the word \u201cshall.\u201d See 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1; Majority Opinion, at 690. In this respect, it is not subject to qualification by internal Board guidelines or policy, as was the change at issue in Jones. Consequently, I believe that this is a closer case than can be gleaned from the majority opinion. See Majority Opinion, at 691 (stating that Petitioner\u2019s punishment \u201cclearly\u201d has not been increased). Still, as noted, the change must not be analyzed in isolation, but within the context of Pennsylvania\u2019s parole system as a whole. See Jones, 529 U.S. at 252, 120 S.Ct. at 1368. In this regard, it is worth noting that, under Section 21 (a) of the Act, 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.21(a), release on parole has traditionally been deemed appropriate only when \u201cit does not appear that the interests of the Commonwealth will be injured thereby.\u201d Such interests manifestly subsume public safety, as well as the fair administration of justice. See generally Reynolds v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, 809 A.2d 426, (Pa.Cmwlth.2002) (undertaking a detailed review of the standards embodied in the Parole Act prior to, and after, the legislative amendment here at issue, and ultimately concluding that the changes to Section 1 of the Act, 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1, did not effect an overall revision in the standards for determining an inmate\u2019s suitability for release). Thus, under longstanding statutory guidelines, the Board, in exercising its discretion, has always been required to take public safety concerns into account. While the statutory changes may have placed particular emphasis on such considerations, any conclusion that there is a substantial risk of prolonging incarceration sufficient to offend ex post facto prohibitions would appear to be based upon mere conjecture. Accord In re Haynes, 100 Wash.App. 366, 996 P.2d 637, 644-45 (2000); cf Powell v. Ray, 30\u00cd F.3d 1200, 1203-04 (10th Cir.2002) (finding no ex post facto violation where the petitioner only offered speculation that elimination of pre-parole supervised release program would increase his term of incarceration). Accordingly, there is no facial violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nThe second portion of the analysis involves whether the change is likely to be applied so as to enhance inmates\u2019 punishment. In this regard, it is notable that the Board\u2019s articulation of its reasons for denying parole in 1999 and 2000 appear drawn from the text of the 1996 amendment. See Majority Opinion, at 690. While this may weigh in favor of a conclusion that the amendment has, in practical effect, disadvantaged Petitioner in his quest for early release, it is not, in my view, sufficient in itself to support such conclusion, or, more generally, a claim that the rule\u2019s overall application is likely to increase punishment. As already explained, the basis for denial recited in Petitioner\u2019s post-1996 dispositions reflects the Commonwealth\u2019s longstanding review policy as embodied in other portions of the statute. Therefore, absent some evidence of a systemic change in the rate at which the Board grants parole, or other proof regarding changes in parole frequency following the 1996 amendment, Petitioner cannot carry his burden of establishing that the Constitution has been violated. See Morales, 514 U.S. at 510 n. 6, 115 S.Ct. at 1603 n. 6; cf. Ganci v. Washington, 318 Ill.App.3d 1174, 253 Ill.Dec. 268, 745 N.E.2d 42, 52 (2001) (overruling a demurrer where the petitioners had placed into the record statistical evidence suggesting that the amended parole rules had resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of release for similarly-situated prisoners). As Petitioner has failed to adduce any such evidence, his claim must fail.\n. In granting Petitioner\u2019s application to file original process, this Court directed that the parties brief three separate issues: 1) whether a claim that a denial of parole violated ex post facto prohibitions, see U.S. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10, is cognizable under Pennsylvania's habeas corpus statute; 2) if so, in which court should the habeas petition initially be filed; and 3) whether the Parole Board violated such principles when it denied Petitioner parole.\n. Ordinarily, however, the writ may not issue unless the application contains allegations which, if true, would show illegal detention. See Milewski, 362 Pa. at 50, 66 A.2d at 282-83.\n. Even if Petitioner were seeking an order directing the Parole Board to order Petitioner\u2019s release on parole, it is not apparent that habeas corpus would be an appropriate avenue to such relief. This court has stated that parole\nis a penological measure for the disciplinary treatment of prisoners who seem capable of rehabilitation outside of prison walls; it does not set aside or affect the sentence and the convict remains in the legal custody of the state and under the control of its agents, subject at any time for breach of condition, to be returned to the penal institution.\nCommonwealth ex rel. Sparks v. Russell, 403 Pa. 320, 323, 169 A.2d 884, 885 (1961) (per curiam) (citing Commonwealth ex rel. Banks v. Cain, 345 Pa. 581, 585, 28 A.2d 897, 899 (1942)). Accordingly, although, once released, a parolee retains a liberty interest in his continued freedom from incarceration, see Rogers v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, 555 Pa. 285, 291, 724 A.2d 319, 322 (1999), he nonetheless remains in the legal custody of the state. See Commonwealth ex rel. Ensor v. Cummings, 420 Pa. 23, 26, 215 A.2d 651, 652 (1966). Consequently, a decision to grant parole neither extinguishes such custody nor impugns the validity of the prior detention. Cf. id. (concluding that release on parole did not render prior habeas petition moot because petitioner\u2019s freedom was still restricted by conditions of parole).\n. In Reynolds, the Commonwealth Court opined that\nthe former and current versions of Section 1 of the Parole Act are general statements of public policy and philosophy and do not affect an offender's eligibility or opportunity to be paroled. Rather they are a legislative emphasis and reminder to the Board to make paroling decisions in accordance with the factors set forth in 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.19. Section 1 does not change the parole review process so that it no longer begins with the best interest of the convict because 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.21 also states that parole be appropriate when \"it does not appear that the interests of the Commonwealth will be injured thereby.\u201d Therefore, Section 1 only reemphasizes that there is a preexisting consideration of public safety as already indicated in 16 P.S. \u00a7 331.21[.]\nId. at 432.\n. Petitioner\u2019s claim premised upon the Board\u2019s requesting a sexually violent predator assessment is also meritless. Such request, standing alone, does not shed any light upon the basis for the 1999 and 2000 parole denials, nor is it sufficient to indicate that the Board\u2019s future actions will violate ex post facto principles.",
