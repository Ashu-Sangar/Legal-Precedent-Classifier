        "text": "OPINION\nJustice CAPPY.\nIn this case, the appellee, Beverly Powell, received tenant-based housing assistance of the certificate type under Section 8 (\u201cSection 8\u201d) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (\u201cHousing Act\u201d), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f. Pursuant to regulations (\u201cRegulations\u201d) promulgated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), the appellant, the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (\u201cAuthority\u201d), terminated Appellee\u2019s assistance when two members of her family engaged in violent criminal activity. Concluding that the Regulations as written are excessive in scope, the Commonwealth Court held that a public housing agency (\u201cPHA\u201d) may terminate Section 8 benefits only for that violent criminal activity which threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or which threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the Section 8 dwelling. For all the following reasons, we conclude that the Commonwealth Court erred. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\nIn the Housing Act, Congress declared that it is this Nation\u2019s policy to employ its funds to \u201cremedy the unsafe housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe and affordable dwellings for low income families\u201d, and to vest responsibility, flexibility and accountability in the PHAs, the entities that administer the programs which provide federal housing assistance. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437(a)(l)(A)-(C), \u00a7 1437a(b)(6). There are several forms of assistance, each with its own features. For example, while public housing assistance is provided to those who lease a unit in a dwelling that a PHA owns and operates, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(Z), Section 8 assistance is provided to those who lease a dwelling in the private sector. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(b),(o).\nThe PHAs admit applicants into the Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs they administer. See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.4(b). In such a program, applicants select a suitable unit to lease. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.1(a)(2). If the PHA approves the tenancy, the PHA and the owner enter into a housing assistance payment contract (\u201cHAP contract\u201d) under which the PHA makes rental payments to subsidize occupancy. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.4(b). In turn, the owner and the now-Section 8 participant enter into a lease for the subsidized unit. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 982.4, 982.308. Unlike public housing assistance, which attaches to the rented unit, Section 8 tenant-based assistance attaches to the tenant. This means that a participant in a Section 8 tenant-based program may move to another dwelling with continued assistance when his assisted lease ends. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.314.\nUnder a final rule (\u201cRule\u201d) issued in 1990, HUD authorized the PHAs \u201cto deny or terminate [Section 8 tenant-based] assistance to applicants and participants in [Section 8] programs if family members engage in drag-related criminal activities or in violent criminal activities.\u201d 55 Fed. Reg. 28538 (July 11, 1990). In doing so, HUD sought to further the purpose of the Housing Act to provide eligible persons with decent, safe, and sanitary housing by encouraging applicants for and recipients of Section 8 benefits to refrain from such activities. Id. at 28538-39.\nIn the late 1990\u2019s, the Authority, the PHA for the City of Pittsburgh, admitted Appellee into its Section 8 tenant-based assistance program (\u201cSection 8 Program\u201d). Accordingly, Appellee made arrangements to lease an apartment in the Brighton Heights area of Pittsburgh, which the Authority approved. Appellee and the apartment\u2019s owner executed a lease agreement for an initial term of twelve and one-half months. In January 1998, Appellee and her three sons began to reside in the assisted unit.\nAs a Section 8 Program participant, Appellee signed a Notice of Obligations, which set forth the obligations HUD imposed by regulation upon Appellee and her family members (\u201cFamily Obligations\u201d). 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551 (1998). The Family Obligations provided that \u201c[t]he members of the family may not engage in drug-related criminal activity, or violent criminal activity.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551\u00a9 (1998). Under one of the Regulations, the Authority was empowered to terminate assistance for violations of any of the Family Obligations. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(b)(1) (1998). In addition, at the time of Appellee\u2019s termination from the Section 8 Program, one of the Regulations stated that the Authority could terminate assistance if any family member engaged in violent criminal activity. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.553(a)(2) (1998).\nOn August 25, 1998, Appellee\u2019s two teenage sons carjacked a vehicle in the parking lot of a supermarket located just under a mile from Appellee\u2019s apartment. During its commission, Appellee\u2019s sons used pepper spray on the car\u2019s elderly occupant and physically removed her from the car. After driving the car from the lot, Appellee\u2019s sons left the vehicle on the street some four blocks from Appellee\u2019s residence.\nAs a result, on September 15, 1998, the Authority sent Appellee a notice that her assistance was terminated for violation of the Family Obligations. Appellee filed a grievance. A Hearing Officer in the Authority\u2019s Section 8 Department held an administrative grievance hearing and issued a decision on November 30, 1998. The Hearing Officer upheld the termination of Appellee\u2019s assistance, finding that Appellee\u2019s sons were involved in a carjacking; that Appellee was given notice of the Family Obligations; and that Appellee was in violation of the Family Obligations for criminal activity.\nOn December 16, 1998, Appellee filed a statutory appeal in the court of common pleas, contending, inter alia, that the Regulations are invalid under Section 8 and may not be used to terminate her assistance. It was Appellee\u2019s position that while Section 8 authorizes landlords to terminate a tenancy in the event a family member commits certain crimes, it does not allow the PHAs to terminate Section 8 assistance on such a basis. In addition, Appellee asserted that the Regulations exceeded the scope of the legislation which HUD cited to support them.\nThe common pleas court applied the test the United States Supreme Court set forth in Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), for analyzing the lawfulness of a federal agency\u2019s regulations to Appellee\u2019s claim that the Regulations were invalid. While the court rejected Appellee\u2019s contention that Congress never intended to permit HUD to interfere with the landlord-tenant relationship by terminating a tenant\u2019s Section 8 benefits based on the criminal activities of family members, the court agreed with Appellee that the scope of the Regulations was excessive.\nIn its Chevron analysis, the common pleas court first determined whether there was a gap in Section 8 for HUD to fill. In doing so, the court set forth the terms of three provisions which concern a landlord\u2019s ability to end an assisted tenancy: \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii) of Section 8; a HUD regulation relating to Section 8, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.310; and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(l)(6), a subsection in the public housing statute. Section 8 in \u00a7 1437(d)(l)(B)(iii) stated (and continues to state) that \u201cany criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants [or] any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the [Section 8] premises\u201d engaged in by, inter alia, a tenant or a member of his household shall be cause for termination of the assisted tenancy. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii). HUD\u2019s regulation at 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.310 tracked 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s language. The public housing statute in \u00a7 1437d(i)(6) required (and continues to require) that a PHA use leases which state, inter alia, that \u201cany criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants\u201d engaged in by a tenant or a member of his household shall be cause for termination of the public housing tenancy. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(i)(6).\nNext, the court noted that \u201c[t]here is no legislation which expressly authorizes a[PHA] to terminate assistance to a Section 8 tenant based on criminal activity.\u201d Court of Common Pleas Opinion of May 25, 1999 at 8. The court reasoned that the source of this omission was Congress\u2019 belief that \u201cthe problem ... it [Congress] was' addressing (protection of other Section 8 tenants and persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the Section 8 housing) had been solved through the enactment of the legislation authorizing the owner to terminate the lease [at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)].\u201d Id. The court concluded, however, that the \u201cproblem\u201d of protecting other Section 8 tenants and persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the Section 8 unit had not been solved by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s passage in all cases because an owner who does not live where the assisted dwelling is located may not evict a tenant for fear of not finding a replacement. Thus, the court concluded that there was a gap in Section 8 for HUD to fill with regulations which would authorize a PHA to terminate benefits for criminal behavior. Id.\nThe court then determined whether the Regulations filled Section 8\u2019s gap in a permissible fashion. The court concluded that they did not. The court held that any regulations which permit a PHA to terminate Section 8 assistance for violent criminal activity and which do not reflect the crime-based standards for terminating a lease set out in \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii) of Section 8 and in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(Z )(6) of the public housing statute conflict with Congressional intent. Id. at 10-11.\nAccordingly, the court \u201cconstrued\u201d the Regulations to mirror the terms of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii) and the regulation at 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.310, and held that the Regulations authorizing a PHA to terminate Section 8 assistance for violent criminal activity apply only to that violent criminal activity which threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or which threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises of their residences of persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the Section 8 premises. Id. at 11. Pursuant to 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 754(a), the court remanded the case to the Authority \u201cfor the purpose of making a full and complete record, including detailed information concerning the location of the alleged criminal activity.\u201d Court of Common Pleas Order of May 25,1999.\nOn June 24, 1999, the Authority held the remand hearing. On July 9, 1999, the Hearing Officer denied Appellee\u2019s grievance. Based on the testimony and exhibits he received into evidence, the Hearing Officer found that the carjacking occurred at the local supermarket, which is approximately a straight line distance of 3500 feet from Appellee\u2019s residence and approximately 0.8 miles from her residence by car; that the total amount of time necessary for Appellee\u2019s sons to walk to the market, overpower the victim, take possession of the car, drive the car to another location and walk from that point back home was no more than twenty minutes; and that the victim\u2019s residence and Appellee\u2019s apartment are in the same community, and approximately 1100 straight line feet and 0.2 to 0.3 miles by car travel apart. The Hearing Officer concluded that \u201c[g]iven the short period of time, less than twenty minutes and the short distances, less than one mile, over which these events occurred, it is not possible to give practical effect to the HUD regulations and yet consider these activities to not be within the vicinity of the Section 8 unit.\u201d Decision of the Hearing Officer of July 9,1999 at 12.\nAgain, Appellee filed a statutory appeal with the court of common pleas. Focusing on where the criminal activity occurred, not on the location of the victim\u2019s residence, finding that the words \u201cimmediate vicinity of the premises\u201d refer to premises that are located in the \u201cimmediate neighborhood\u201d, and rejecting the Authority\u2019s argument that violent criminal activity, regardless of its location, threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of those living in the immediate vicinity, the court concluded that, as a matter of law, the findings set forth in the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision \u201cestablish that the criminal activity of [Appellee\u2019s] children may not be characterized as threatening the health, safety, and right of peaceful enjoyment of the premises of persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises.\u201d Common Pleas Court Opinion of November 23, 1999 at 1-2. Thus, by order dated November 23, 1999, the court sustained Appellee\u2019s appeal from the Authority\u2019s July 9, 1999 decision terminating her Section 8 benefits, and granted her grievance seeking their reinstatement.\nThe Authority filed an appeal in the Commonwealth Court. The Commonwealth Court panel affirmed, endorsing and tracking the reasoning of the court of common pleas. Powell v. Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, 760 A.2d 473 (Pa.Cmwlth.2000). The Commonwealth Court agreed with the common pleas court that \u201cCongress did not specifically, by statute, authorize a housing authority to terminate Section 8 assistance if one of the tenants engages in violent criminal activity! ]\u201d, and that the Regulations exceed the scope of Section 8 because they allow for termination of assistance for any violent criminal behavior, even though \u201cthe statute [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(B)(iii)] permit\u00eds] an owner of a Section 8 housing unit to terminate the lease if a recipient engage[s] in criminal activity which threaten[s] the health safety or right to peaceful enjoyment by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises.\u201d Id. at 481 (alteration in original). The Commonwealth Court also approved of the common pleas court\u2019s decision to construe the Regulations to incorporate \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard, and to apply the Regulations as construed to Appellee\u2019s grievance. Id. at 481-82. Lastly, after agreeing with the common pleas court that \u201cin the immediate vicinity\u201d means \u201con the premises\u201d or \u201cnext door\u201d, the Commonwealth Court concluded that because the \u201cquestion of what constitutes the immediate vicinity and whether the carjacking fell within the definition of immediate vicinity is a question of law\u201d, not a question of fact, the common pleas court did not erroneously disregard the Hearing Officer\u2019s factual findings in this matter. Id. at 482-83.\nThe present appeal followed. The Authority raises several issues. First, the Authority contends that contrary to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision, the Regulations pass the Chevron test without \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard. Second, it argues that even if violent criminal activity must threaten those in the immediate vicinity of the Section 8 premises before assistance can be terminated, that phrase refers to the location of the homes of those who might be threatened by the criminal activity, not to the locus of the crime itself relative to the Section 8 unit. And third, it asserts that the Commonwealth Court should have upheld the Hearing Officer\u2019s finding of fact that the carjacking occurred in and threatened those living in the immediate vicinity of Appellee\u2019s Section 8 residence inasmuch as the finding was not arbitrary or capricious.\nAppellee counters that the Regulations are entitled to no deference under Chevron because they do not contain \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard; that the Regulations violate the federal Constitution; and that the Authority failed to show that the carjacking impacted upon Appellee\u2019s next door neighbors.\nWe turn now to the important question this appeal raises\u2014 whether the Regulations are lawful. We begin our discussion by observing that Congress empowered HUD to promulgate rules and regulations consistent with and aimed at advancing the aims of the Housing Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3535(d). Thus, this case involves an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it administers. Accordingly, the test the United States Supreme Court set forth in Chevron for determining whether regulations fall within an agency\u2019s lawful interpretative authority is the test we must follow. FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 132, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000); see HUD v. Rucker, 535 U.S. 125, 122 S.Ct. 1230, 1233, 152 L.Ed.2d 258 (2002).\nUnder Chevron, a reviewing court is confronted with two questions. \u201cFirst, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. But if the court determines that Congress has not specifically addressed the question, the court \u201cdoes not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Where the legislative delegation to an agency to fill a gap is implicit, rather than explicit, a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for the agency\u2019s \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d. Id. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If a regulation is reasonable, it should not be disturbed, unless it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the agency\u2019s construction of the statute is not one that Congress would sanction. Id. at 844-45 & n. 14, 104 S.Ct. 2778.\nWith these principles in mind, we begin with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision. The test the United States Supreme Court articulated in Chevron is straightforward: under the first prong, a court must determine whether Congress has addressed the precise question at issue by examining Congress\u2019 intent on the matter. Id. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth Court did not do so. Nowhere in its opinion does the court substantiate the observation, meant apparently to answer Chevron\u2019s first question, that Congress has not specifically authorized a PHA to terminate a tenant\u2019s Section 8 assistance for violent criminal behavior, with evidence of Congress\u2019 intent. Powell, 760 A.2d at 481. Under Chevron\u2019s second prong, a court must determine whether an agency\u2019s regulation represents a \u201cpermissible construction of the statute.\u201d Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Here too, the court\u2019s opinion is lacking. The sum and substance of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s analysis was its conclusion that the Regulations exceed the scope of Section 8 by not incorporating the terms of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii). Powell, 760 A.2d at 477, 481. We are of the view that the Chevron test requires more from a court than the Commonwealth Court provided. It is, therefore, enough for us to say that the Commonwealth Court did not apply Chevron correctly.\nBefore we apply the Chevron framework, however, due to the nature of Commonwealth Court\u2019s ultimate determination and judgment, we must clarify the question we are deciding. Ordinarily, the \u201cprecise question at issue\u201d under the Chevron test is cast in terms of the regulation that has come under challenge. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 840,104 S.Ct. 2778. This is because the agency\u2019s construction of a statute, which has been put at issue as unlawful, is reflected in the agency\u2019s regulation. See e.g., HUD v. Rucker, 535 U.S. 125, 122 S.Ct. at 1232-33, 152 L.Ed.2d 258; FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. at 125, 120 S.Ct. 1291.\nIn this case, the Commonwealth Court did not hold that the Regulations are unlawful or hold that a PHA may not terminate Section 8 benefits for violent criminal behavior and preclude the application of those Regulations. Rather, the court held that the Regulations as written are inconsistent with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii), and affirmed the common pleas court\u2019s decision to rewrite the Regulations to incorporate \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard, as well as the common pleas court\u2019s decision to apply the re-written Regulations to Appellee\u2019s grievance. Therefore, the question the Authority\u2019s appeal raises is not whether a PHA may terminate Section 8 assistance when a family member engages in violent criminal activity. It is instead, whether a PHA may terminate Section 8 assistance when a family member engages in violent criminal activity without having to satisfy \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard and establish that the violent criminal activity threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences of persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the Section 8 premises. If we were to assess the lawfulness of the Regulations as they were promulgated, and without the Commonwealth Court\u2019s addition, we would in effect be issuing an advisory opinion on a question that is not before us and one which is unnecessary to the adjudication of the parties\u2019 dispute. This is a practice we have consistently eschewed. See Commonwealth v. Klobuchir, 486 Pa. 241, 405 A.2d 881, 884 n. 5 (1979).\nWe now turn to applying Chevron\u2019s teaching. With respect to Chevron\u2019s first inquiry, which asks whether Congress has expressed a clear intent on the precise question at issue, the Supreme Court has instructed a reviewing court to use the traditional tools of statutory construction to ascertain whether Congress has done so. Id. at 842-43 & n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778. The Court has also instructed that a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining any statutory provision in isolation, but should interpret the statute as a \u201csymmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme.\u201d FDA v. Brown, 529 U.S. at 132-33, 120 S.Ct. 1291 (quotation omitted). Moreover, because subsequent acts can shape or focus the range of plausible meanings that a statute may have had-at the time it was enacted, a reviewing court should consult later legislation, particularly where Congress has spoken more specifically to the topic at hand. Id. at 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291.\nBoth the Authority and Appellee contend that Chevron\u2019s first prong is satisfied. While the Authority claims that Congress has clearly shown that a PHA may end the benefits of a Section 8 Program participant whose family member engages in violent criminal activity without having to satisfy \u00a7 1437f(l)(d)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard, Appellee asserts that Congress has clearly demonstrated that a PHA may not terminate benefits unless it makes such a showing.\nWe turn first to Appellee\u2019s position. Appellee begins by stating that in public housing, where benefits are not \u201cmobile\u201d, a tenant\u2019s eviction for breach of the lease also amounts to a loss of benefits. (Appellee\u2019s Brief at 16.) Appellee then states that HUD has seen to it that Section 8 assistance likewise terminates upon breaches of an assisted lease agreement. Based on these statements, Appellee concludes that \u201cCongress and HUD [have recognized] that terminations of housing assistance are effected through lease enforcement.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Brief at 16) (emphasis in original). Thus, Appellee asserts, Congress intends for the crime-based standards in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437(d)(l)(B)(iii) to govern not only the termination of a Section 8 lease, but also, the termination of Section 8 subsidies. Further, Appellee asserts, these crime-based reasons for lease termination in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437(d)(1)(B)(iii) are exclusive and reflect two of Congress\u2019 objectives: first, to divide criminal activity into \u201cnon-drug\u201d and \u201cdrug-related\u201d for purposes of terminating Section 8 assistance; and second, to erect a limited \u201czone of protection\u201d around each assisted unit with respect to all non-drug crime, so that only those non-drug crimes which \u201cimpact\u201d upon persons in the immediate vicinity of the assisted unit may lead to benefits termination by a PHA. (Appellee\u2019s Brief at 23-25).\nAt first glance, Appellee\u2019s position has a certain logical appeal. Upon closer scrutiny, however, it remains unsupported. The process of ascertaining Congress\u2019 intent, of course, begins with the language of the statute. Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980). In this regard, Appellee does not point to any language in Section 8 or in another federal housing statute which shows that Congress intends for the termination of an assisted lease to represent the sole means of terminating Section 8 assistance or that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii) reflects the totality of Congress\u2019 intent with regard to the authority that a PHA may be given to terminate Section 8 benefits for criminal activity. Nor have we located any such language. Likewise, the legislative history to which Appellee directs us is unpersuasive. While all of that history demonstrates that Congress has elected not to alter the crime-based standards for terminating leases in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii) or in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d\u00a9(6), none of it reveals that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii) is the exclusive repository of Congress\u2019 intent as to either the benefit termination authority a PHA may be given or the crime-based reasons that a PHA may use to terminate Section 8 assistance. See, e.g., 142 Cong. Rec. H4662-01, 104 Congress, 2nd Sess. (May 9, 1996); H.Rep. No. 102-760, 102nd Congress, 2nd Sess. 7 (1992), reprinted in U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News pp. 3281, 3288.\nSignificantly, Appellee\u2019s basic premise, that Congress intends for the termination of Section 8 benefits by a PHA to amount to no more than \u201clease enforcement\u201d, is belied by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13662, a statutory provision in which Congress deals only with the authority of the PHAs to end the Section 8 assistance of illegal drug users. See infra note 14. Accordingly, we reject Appellee\u2019s position.\nAs to the Authority\u2019s assertion that the statutes governing Section 8 housing plainly evidence Congress\u2019 intent to permit a PHA to terminate the assistance of violent criminal offenders without meeting \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard, we start again with the words of the statute, and again, we find no evidence of Congress\u2019 intent on the matter. There is no provision or language in Section 8 or related statutes which expressly refers to a PHA\u2019s ability to terminate assistance for violent criminal behavior. See HUD v. Rucker, 535 U.S. 125, 122 S.Ct. at 1233-34, 152 L.Ed.2d 258 (because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(Z )(6)\u2019s plain language unambiguously requires lease terms that give PHAs the discretion to terminate the lease of a public housing tenant when a member of the household or a guest engages in drug-related activity, regardless of whether the tenant knew, or should have known, of the drug-related activity, Congress has directly spoken to whether a HUD regulation may allow for the eviction of so-called \u201cinnocent\u201d tenants for the drug-related activity of a guest or household member).\nLooking to the history of Section 8 and related legislation for guidance, we observe that when HUD issued the Rule in 1990, Congress had not referred to violent criminal activity as a category of crime nor had it addressed a PHA\u2019s authority to deny or terminate Section 8 benefits. Then, in 1998, Congress spoke to these matters, enacting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13661 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13662, provisions that cover safety and security in public and other assisted housing programs, including those administering Section 8 benefits, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13664, and rewriting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o), the subsection in Section 8 that covers voucher programs. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13661, a PHA may deny admission into its Section 8 program if an applicant or his family member has engaged in violent criminal behavior during a reasonable time preceding the date when he would otherwise be admitted; under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13662, a PHA may terminate an illegal drug user\u2019s Section 8 benefits and the Section 8 benefits of those whose illegal drug or alcohol use intrudes upon others; under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o)(6)(C), a PHA may elect not to enter into a HAP contract for voucher assistance with an owner who refuses to take action to terminate the leases of violent criminal actors; and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o)(7)(D), the HAP contract for voucher assistance is to provide, inter alia, that during the term of the lease, any violent criminal activity on or near the Section 8 premises shall be cause for tenancy termination.\nThe Authority contends that since Congress permits a PHA to condition the receipt of Section 8 benefits on an applicant\u2019s showing that he and his family members have not engaged in violent criminal activity, encourages owners to end the voucher assisted tenancies of violent criminal offenders without qualification, and advises a PHA to consider not doing business with owners who countenance such persons as tenants, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13661(c), and 1437f(o)(6)(C), Congress has shown that it intends for a PHA to end Section 8 assistance when family members engage in violent criminal activity without 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard.\nWe cannot accept the Authority\u2019s position. The first prong of Chevron asks whether Congress \u201chas directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. We are simply unable, as the Authority urges, to conclude that Congress\u2019 clear and unambiguous intent regarding a PHA\u2019s ability to terminate the Section 8 assistance of violent criminal actors is revealed through a series of inferences. Further, we find it telling that although Congress has confirmed one aspect of HUD\u2019s Rule \u2014 a PHA\u2019s ability to deny admission into a Section 8 program on the basis of violent criminal activity, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13661(c), Congress has not confirmed the Rule\u2019s other significant topic \u2014 a PHA\u2019s ability to terminate the assistance provided to Section 8 program participants for violent criminal behavior. In addition, while Congress has addressed the termination of Section 8 assistance and the .category of violent crime in legislation, Congress has not chosen to tie them together in any of its enactments. Finally, Congress\u2019 view of violent criminal activity is not as clear-cut as the Authority describes it. Although Congress speaks in unlimited terms in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437(o)(6)(C) about owners who fail to end the voucher-assisted tenancies of violent criminal offenders, Congress qualifies its reference to the termination of those tenancies for violent criminal activity with \u201con or near the premises\u201d in the subsection which follows, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437(o)(7)(D).\n' Thus, we conclude that under Chevron, Congress has not plainly and unambiguously expressed its intent as to whether a PHA may terminate Section 8 assistance based on a family member\u2019s violent criminal activity without having to meet \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard.\nAccordingly, we turn to the second prong of the Chevron test: are the Regulations, insofar as they do not burden a PHA with having to make such a showing before it may terminate assistance, a \u201cpermissible construction of the statute.\u201d Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. As to the second prong, the United States Supreme Court has instructed that a reviewing court \u201cneed not conclude that the agency\u2019s construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction, or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding\u201d\u2019 Id. at 843 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 2778. The Court has made it clear that \u201c[w]hen a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision really centers on the wisdom of the agency\u2019s policy, rather than on whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by Congress, the challenge must fail.\u201d Id. at 866, 104 S.Ct. 2778. In the Court\u2019s view, \u201c[s]uch deference is justified because \u2018[t]he responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices and resolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial ones,\u2019 and because of the agency\u2019s greater familiarity with the ever-changing facts and circumstances surrounding the subjects regulated.\u201d FDA v. Brown, 529 U.S. at 132, 120 S.Ct. 1291 (quotation and citation omitted).\nWe begin with Appellee\u2019s argument on Chevron\u2019s second prong. Appellee first contends that HUD\u2019s interpretation of Section 8 is entitled to no deference because HUD\u2019s rationale for the Rule is inadequate. In this regard, Appellee challenges a response HUD made when issuing the Rule in 1990 to one particular public comment. That comment asked why the Rule did not reflect the policies in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(Z)(5) (current version at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(Z)(6)) of the public housing statute, which at the time stated that each PHA was to use leases that provided that \u201ccriminal activity, including drug-related criminal activity, on or near the premises\u201d shall be cause for termination of tenancy. 55 Fed.Reg. at 28539-40.\nIn its response, HUD pointed out that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1487d(Z)(5) did not apply to or affect its authority to promulgate policies for Section 8 programs, and went on to explain that:\nThe Department has not limited the proscribed activities under this rule to activities carried out on or near the premises. Section 8 certificates and housing vouchers are very mobile forms of housing assistance. The holder can lease suitable housing with federal assistance anywhere in the PHA\u2019s jurisdiction, in the metropolitan area, or in a contiguous metropolitan area. If a PHA were [only] permitted to terminate assistance for activities on or near the assisted premises, the deterrent effect of this policy would be substantially diminished because the family could lease housing outside the area where the family member engages in the proscribed activities.\nId. at 28539-40. Appellee roundly criticizes HUD for \u201cinvok[ing] the mobility concept\u201d of Section 8 assistance in this passage and then \u201ccommitting] a logical sleight of hand, as it switches to a different, wholly irrelevant definition of mobility ... that of a tenant who lives in one community, and commits crimes in another.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Brief at 35).\nWhile we would agree that the adequacy of an agency\u2019s reasoning when engaged in rule-making bears upon a court\u2019s evaluation of the agency\u2019s statutory interpretation, see Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U.S. 27, 37, 102 S.Ct. 38, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981), we find no merit in Appellee\u2019s argument. In our view, HUD\u2019s rationale makes sense, when considered in context. In the Rule, HUD granted a PHA the authority to deny Section 8 benefits to violent criminal actors. If HUD had burdened a PHA\u2019s authority to terminate such benefits with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(i)(5)\u2019s standard, HUD would have required a PHA to continue in its Section 8 program some of the very same persons it had authorized the PHA to exclude. Moreover, because a participant may move from unit to unit with his Section 8 assistance, HUD was concerned that if a PHA could only terminate benefits when a participant engaged in violent criminal activity \u201con or near the premises\u201d, a participant whose violent criminal activity occurred elsewhere would not only continue to receive Section 8 subsidies when his lease ended, but would also be able to move to a subsidized unit in another locality. For HUD, such a result was understandably unacceptable. We, therefore, reject Appellee\u2019s contention that the Rule reflects a fatal lapse in HUD\u2019s reasoning.\nAppellee also asserts that the Regulations are flawed because it gives a PHA broader powers in connection with Section 8 housing, where a PHA is a mere administrator, than it does in connection -with the public housing statute, where a PHA is both administrator and landlord. Here too, Appellee misses the mark. As HUD observed when issuing the Rule, private owners who do not live on the premises or who face high vacancy rates may not be motivated to avoid or cease renting to undesirable tenants. See 55 Fed.Reg. at 28538. We, therefore, can see how HUD believes that a PHA\u2019s role as administrator of Section 8 benefits takes on added significance precisely because it is not the landlord of Section 8 units.\nIn essence, this and Appellee\u2019s other argument against the Regulations really focus on the wisdom of HUD\u2019s judgment. As Chevron teaches, however, such challenges are insufficient to deny deference to an agency\u2019s administrative interpretation of a statute. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 866, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Rather, the deference this court owes to the Regulations HUD has promulgated depends on \u201cwhether [HUD\u2019s policy] is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by Congress....\u201d Id. As we noted, it is this Nation\u2019s policy in the Housing Act to use public resources to alleviate the shortage of decent, safe and affordable dwellings for low income families, and to aid the PHAs in the execution of their duties. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437(a)(l)(A)-(C). As we also noted, when HUD issued the Rule, it believed that the Rule\u2019s policies would further the Housing Act\u2019s objectives because those who wish to participate and remain in Section 8 programs would be encouraged to refrain from violent criminal activity. 55 Fed. Reg. at 28538-39. We find HUD\u2019s views in this regard to be reasonable. Because under the Regulations, PHAs are given relatively wide latitude to exclude violent criminal actors from Section 8 programs, where benefits attach to tenants, it is reasonable for HUD to expect that the distribution oi' benefits, the pool of owners in the private sector who are willing to consider renting to Section 8 participants, and the quality and safety of Section 8 housing are all greatly enhanced.\nThis brings us to whether the Rule and the Regulations would be acceptable to Congress. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844-45 & n. 14, 104 S.Ct. 2778. In this vein, we find it significant that Congress, \u201c \u2018presumed to be aware\u2019 \u201d of HUD\u2019s interpretation of Section 8 in the Rule and Regulations, has done nothing to change the statute, even though it has amended Section 8 several times in other ways since HUD issued them. See HUD v. Rucker, 585 U.S. 125, 122 S.Ct. at 1234 n. 4, 152 L.Ed.2d 258 (quoting Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978)); Explanatory notes to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f, describing amendments in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. Moreover, it only stands to reason that Congress would accept a PHA\u2019s ability to terminate benefits without \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard, inasmuch as it has given a PHA the power to deny Section 8 assistance to violent criminal offenders without that burden in the first place. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13661(c). Thus, we conclude that the Regulations, insofar as they do not contain \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)\u2019s standard, are a \u201cpermissible construction\u201d of Section 8, and entitled to our deference. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44,104 S.Ct. 2778.\nAccordingly, we hold that a PHA may terminate Section 8 benefits for the violent criminal activity of a family member without having to prove that the violent criminal activity threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences of persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the Section 8 premises.\nThe judgment of the Commonwealth Court is reversed, and this case is remanded to the court of common pleas for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including a determination of any unresolved issues that have been properly raised and preserved.\nChief Justice ZAPPALA did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustice NIGRO and Justice SAYLOR file concurring opinions.\n. In addition to \"tenant-based\u201d assistance, Seclion 8 provides for \"project-based\u201d assistance, in which case, rent is paid for families who live in specific housing developments or units. Project-based assistance attaches to the unit, not to the tenant. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(f)(6); 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.1(b)(1). The Regulations at issue do not apply to project-based assistance.\n. At all relevant times, \"violent criminal activity\u201d was defined as \u201c[a]ny illegal criminal activity that has as one of its elements the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.4 (1998). At all relevant times, a \"family\u201d was, inter alia, a \"group of persons\u201d that included children. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.201(c)(1),(2) (1998).\n. Section 8 assistance has been of two types: certificate and voucher. With a certificate, the rental subsidy is generally based on the actual rent of the assisted unit; with a voucher, the rental subsidy is determined by formula. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.1(a)(3),(4). Up until October 1998, tenant-based assistance was administered in separate certificate and voucher programs. In October 1998, the separate certificate and voucher programs were merged. Quality Housing & Work Responsibility Act of 1998, Pub.L. 105-276, \u00a7 545, 112 Stat. 2461. HUD implemented the merger in October 1999, establishing the Housing Choice Voucher Program. 64 Fed.Reg. 56894. Certif\u00edcate assistance continues, but PHAs are no longer allowed to enter into contracts for such assistance. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.1(a)(1). In Section 8, \u00a7 1437f(o) presently covers voucher assistance. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o).\nAppellee indicates, and the Authority does not disagree, that she receives certificate assistance. (Appellee\u2019s Brief at 14 n. 21). Unless indicated otherwise, the words \"assistance\u201d, \"benefits\u201d and \"subsidies\u201d as used in this opinion refer to Section 8 tenant-based assistance of the certificate type.\n. In her December 1998 appeal before the common pleas court, Appellee also contended that the Authority failed to meet its burden of production and burden of proof on several issues at the November 13, 1998 hearing, and that the Regulations violate the federal Constitution. Finding in Appellee\u2019s favor on statutory grounds, the common pleas court expressly declined to reach the issue of whether there are any constitutional prohibitions against the Regulations. Common Pleas Opinion of May 25, 1999 at 4. ;\n. In its opinion, the common pleas court described the Chevron test as follows:\nA federal agency which administers a Congressionally created program is permitted to make regulations to fill gaps left by Congress. If the regulation is simply filling a gap, the regulation shall be upheld unless it is clearly outside the scope of what Congress would have intended. If on the other hand, Congress directly addressed the issue, the court shall strike down any regulation that conflicts with Congress\u2019 specific intent.\nCommon Pleas Court Opinion of May 25, 1999 at 5.\n. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d) sets forth the terms that were to appear in the HAP contract between the Authority and Appellee's landlord. In \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii), Section 8 states:\n1437f. Low-income housing assistance\n(d) Required provisions and duration of contracts for assistance payments; waiver of limitation. (1) Contracts to make assistance payments entered into by a public housing agency with an owner of existing housing units shall provide (with respect to any unit) that\u2014\nsk * t;:\n(B)(iii) during the term of the lease, any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants, any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises, or any drug related criminal activity on or near such premises, engaged in by a tenant of any unit, any member of the tenant's household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, shall be cause for termination of the tenancy....\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l )(B)(iii). This subsection also requires a HAP contract to provide that the lease between tenant and owner shall endure for at least one year or for the term of the HAP contract, whichever is shorter; shall contain other terms and conditions the Secretary of HUD specifies; and shall not be terminated except for serious or repeated violations of the lease, applicable Federal, State or local law or for other good cause. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(1)(B)(i) \u2014 (ii).\n. HUD's regulation relating to an owner\u2019s termination of a Section 8 tenancy stated in pertinent part:\n\u00a7 982.310. Owner termination of tenancy.\n(c) Criminal activity. Any of the following types of criminal activity by the tenant, any member of the household, a guest or another person under the tenant\u2019s control shall be cause for termination of tenancy:\n(1) Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents;\n(2) Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises; or\n(3) Any drug-related criminal activity on or near the premises.\n24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.310(c)(l)-(3) (1998).\n. In the interests of clarity of expression, in this opinion, the terms from 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii) that the common pleas court added to the Regulations are at times referred to as \"\u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(B)(iii)'s standard\u201d.\n. Where, as here, a complete record was developed before the local agency, the court reviewing the matter on appeal must affirm the local agency unless it is determined that constitutional rights were violated, that an error of law was committed, that the procedure before the agency was contrary to the statute or that necessary findings of fact were unsupported by substantial evidence. 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 754(b); Public Advocate v. Philadelphia Gas C\u2019mm, 544 Pa. 129, 674 A.2d 1056, 1060 (1996). When deciding a question of law, this court's review is de novo and its scope of review is plenary. See Phillips v. A-Best Products Co., 542 Pa. 124, 665 A.2d 1167, 1170 (1995).\n. At times, the Authority argues more expansively, contending that under Chevron, the Regulations as written are lawful. While the lawfulness of the Regulations was challenged broadly speaking, our discussion and ruling are necessarily confined by sound jurisprudential principles to the narrow question we have defined.\n. In view of our holding on the Chevron issue, we do not address the issue of whether a court may rewrite a federal agency's regulations.\n. According to Appellee, since Section 8 assistance attaches to the tenant and continues upon eviction, HUD promulgated regulations allowing the PHAs to terminate Section 8 assistance for lease violations so that benefits terminate in such circumstances. In 1998, one of the Family Obligations provided that a family may not commit any serious or repeated violations of the lease. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551(e) (1998). Under one of the Regulations, the Authority was empowered to terminate Appellee\u2019s assistance for violations of any of these Family Obligations. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(b)(1) (1998). Presently, one of the Regulations states that \"[t]he PHA must terminate program assistance for a family evicted from housing assisted under the program for serious violations of the lease.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(b)(2) (2002).\nWe set forth Appellee\u2019s position for argument's sake. We do not consider the merits of Appellee's assertions concerning HUD's motivation for these regulations.\n. Section 576 of the statute that governs \"Residency and Service Requirements in Federally Assisted Housing\u2019\u2019 provides:\n\u00a7 13661. Screening of applicants for federally assisted housing\n(c) Authority to deny admission to criminal offenders. Except as provided in subsection (a) [Ineligibility because of eviction for drug crimes] and (b) [Ineligibility of illegal users and alcohol abusers] and in addition to any other authority to screen applicants, in selecting among applicants for admission to the program or to federally assisted housing, if the public housing agency or owner of such housing (as applicable) determines that an applicant or any member of the applicant\u2019s household is or was, during a reasonable time preceding the date when the applicant household would otherwise be selected for admission, engaged in any drug-related or violent criminal activity or other criminal activity which would adversely affect the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents, the owner, or the public agency employees, the public housing agency or the owner may\u2014\n(1) deny such applicant admission to the program or to federally assisted housing....\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13661(c).\n. Section 577 of the statute that governs \"Residency and Service Requirements in Federally Assisted Housing\u201d provides in pertinent part:\n\u00a7 13662. Termination of tenancy or assistance for illegal drug users and alcohol abusers in federally assisted housing.\n(a) In general. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a public housing agency or an owner of federally assisted housing (as applicable) shall establish standards or lease provisions for continued assistance or occupancy in federally assisted housing that allow the agency or owner (as applicable) to terminate the tenancy or assistance for any household with a member\u2014\n(1) who the public housing agency or owner determines is illegally using a controlled substance;\nor\n(2) whose illegal use (or pattern of illegal use) of a controlled substance, or whose abuse (or pattern of abuse) of alcohol, is determined by the public housing agency or owner to interfere with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13662.\n. In \u00a7 1437f(o)(6)(C) and (7)(D), Section 8 provides:\n\u00a7 1437f. Low-income housing assistance\n(o) Voucher program.\n(6) Selection of families and disapproval of owners.\n(C) PHA disapproval of owners. In addition to other grounds authorized by the Secretary, a public housing agency may elect not to enter into a housing assistance payments contract under this subsection with an owner who refuses, or has a history of refusing to take action to terminate tenancy for activity engaged in by the tenant, any member of the tenant's household, any guest, or any person under the control of any member of the household that\u2014\n(i) threatens the health, safety of, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by, other tenants or employees of the public housing agency, owner, or other manager of the housing;\n(ii) threatens the health, or safety of, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the residences by, persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises; or\n(iii) is drug-related or violent criminal activity.\n(7) Leases and tenancy. Each housing assistance payment contract entered into by the public housing agency and the owner of a dwelling unit\u2014\n(D) shall provide that during the terms of the lease, any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants, any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises, or any violent or drug-related criminal activity on or near such premises, engaged in by a tenant of any unit, any member of the tenant\u2019s household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, shall be cause for termination of tenancy....\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(o)(6)(C),(7)(D).\n. We are certainly in accord with the concern that Justice Saylor expresses in his concurring opinion that the term \"reasonable\u201d, when used by a reviewing court in this context, can suggest that the court is substituting its judgment for that of the agency which has been delegated the authority to make a policy choice within a gap left open by Congress. In discussing Chevron\u2019s second step, we have chosen to use the language the United States Supreme Court used in its opinion, see Chevron, 467 U.S. at 865-66, 104 S.Ct. 2778, and in applying that step, we have been careful to follow the Court's admonition to focus on HUD\u2019s exercise of the policy making responsibilities that Congress has given it. See id.\n. We decline to address the other issues the Authority raised in this appeal which are rendered moot by our holding. We also decline to address any of the issues Appellee raised in her December 1998 statutory appeal in the court of common pleas which the court did not address.",

        "text": "Justice NIGRO,\nconcurring.\nI join in the holding and analysis of the majority, and write separately solely to emphasize that although HUD regulations authorize a PHA to terminate Section 8 benefits for violent criminal activity of a family member, they by no means require PHAs to do so. Compare 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.553(b)(l)(ii)(PHA \u201cmust immediately\u201d terminate assistance when a household member has been convicted of drug-related criminal activity on the premises of federally assisted housing) with 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.553(b)(2)(PHA need only establish standards that \u201callow\u201d the PHA to terminate assistance if a household member has engaged in violent criminal activity). In fact, the regulations make clear that in exercising its discretion to determine whether to terminate assistance, the PHA:\nmay consider all relevant circumstances such as the seriousness of the case, the extent of participation or culpability of individual family members, mitigating circumstances related to the disability of a family member, and the effects of denial or termination of assistance on other family members who were not involved in the action or failure.\n24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)\u00ae. Moreover, when only certain family members are culpable for the criminal activity giving rise to the threat of termination, the PHA is specifically authorized to:\nimpose, as a condition of continued assistance for other family members, a requirement that other family members who participated in or were culpable for the action or failure will not reside in the unit. The PHA may permit other members of a participant family to continue receiving assistance.\n24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552(c)(2)(ii).\nGiven these additional regulations, I believe that it is incumbent on PHAs to consider \u201call relevant circumstances\u201d before terminating a family\u2019s assistance based on the errant conduct of less than all of its members.",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\nconcurring.\nI join the majority opinion generally, subject to the following:\nFirst, I read the majority\u2019s issue-narrowing logic, see Majority Opinion, at 1209-10, as merely an indication that the Court is limiting its review to the correctness of the reasoning of the Commonwealth Court and common pleas court, leaving open other questions concerning the validity of the HUD regulations at issue and the underlying administrative action of the PHA in terminating Appellee\u2019s Section 8 benefits.\nSecond, although I acknowledge that, like the majority, the United States Supreme Court has employed the yardstick of \u201creasonableness\u201d in delimiting the class of substantive regulations that are due the greatest judicial deference, I believe that, given the broader context, it would be preferable to employ the term \u201creasoned.\u201d In this regard, where, as here, there is an express Congressional delegation of lawmaking authority to an administrative agency, see Majority Opinion, at 1208 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 8535(d)), the Supreme Court has maintained that resultant legislative regulations must be accorded controlling weight \u201cunless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); accord 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Notably, this Court has distinguished similar conceptions from reasonableness review in our own administrative jurisprudence. See Fraternal Order of Police v. PLRB, 557 Pa. 586, 592-93, 735 A.2d 96, 99-100 (1999). See generally Ronald M. Levin, The Anatomy of Chevron: Step Two Reconsidered, 72 Chi.-Kent L.Rev. 1253, 1263 (1997) (\u201cin effect, the [Supreme C]ourt has transformed the Chevron step two question of whether the agency action was \u2018reasonable\u2019 into a question of whether it was \u2018reasoned.\u2019 \u201d). While superficially this may seem a modest point, the employment of the elastic reasonableness rubric in the administrative arena has in the past led to divergent results and carries the potential for fostering the appearance that courts may be substituting their judgments for those of agencies, rather than limiting review to a determination whether the agency has acted within the boundaries of its lawful mandate. Cf Fraternal Order of Police, 557 Pa. at 592-93, 735 A.2d at 99-100.\nPhrased as such, I agree with the majority that HUD\u2019s legislative regulations in this area are reasoned, a permissible application of delegated authority under the Housing Act, and not arbitrary, capricious, or ultra vires on their face, where: national housing policy is intended to remedy unsafe housing conditions, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437(a)(1)(A); tenancy of households whose members have engaged in violent criminal activity, regardless of its proximity, may reasonably be viewed as contrary to such policy; and, as Mr. Justice Nigro emphasizes, the regulations do not require termination, but rather, on their terms implicate the sound discretion of the local housing authority.\n. Significantly, in its analysis, Chewon ultimately found and relied on an implicit delegation of legislative authority to support broad deference in favor of an administrative regulation. Chevron 467 U.S. at 865-66, 104 S.Ct. at 2792-93. The Court treated the case for broad deference in the face of an express delegation as settled, see id. at 843-44, 104 S.Cl. at 2782, and, obviously, the strongest justification for deference is presented in such circumstances, as here.",
