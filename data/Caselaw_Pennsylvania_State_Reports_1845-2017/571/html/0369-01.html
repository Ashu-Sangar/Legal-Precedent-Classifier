Appellant, Independence Blue Cross, a Pennsylvania nonprofit hospital plan corporation,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> paid medical benefits totaling $47,947 on behalf of the minor plaintiff for the treatment of his injuries, affording it a subrogation interest in recoveries against the defendants. All defendants except Bruce J. Rosen, M.D., were eventually dismissed from the proceedings. Dr. Rosen was insured by Physicians Insurance Company (“PIC”) for $200,000 of primary insurance coverage and the Pennsylvania Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Fund (the “CAT Fund”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> for $1,000,000 in excess coverage. In January of 1998, however, the Commonwealth Court entered an order placing PIC in liquidation in accordance with the liquidation provisions of the Insurance Department Act, 40 P.S. §§ 221.1-221.63; such order triggered certain statutory obligations on the part of Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (“PPCIGA” or “the Association”), pursuant to the Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Of particular relevance <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>here, PPCIGA became obligated pursuant to its enabling statute to pay “covered claims” against Dr. Rosen, subject to a $300,000 cap. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 991.1808.</p>
    <p id="b456-4" data-blocks='[["BL_456.5",456,[278,479,1160,717]]]'>After a pretrial conference in October of 1998, the Chows filed a petition to compromise, asserting that they had agreed to release Dr. Rosen in exchange for $1.1 million, which amount included, in addition to a substantial payment from the CAT Fund, the primary coverage limits attributable to Dr. Rosen’s insurance policy with PIC. The settlement, however, expressly contemplated an offset against the settlement proceeds of the medical benefits paid by Independence Blue Cross ($47,947.32). Such adjustment was ostensibly made available under the non-duplication of recovery provision of the PPCIGA Act, 40 P.S. § 991.1817, which prescribes that “[a]ny amount payable on a covered claim under this act shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under other insurance.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The common pleas court granted PPCIGA’s petition to intervene, denied Independence Blue Cross’s petition, and approved the proposed settlement. A panel of the Superior Court affirmed in a memorandum opinion, concluding that, although Independence Blue Cross would ordinarily have had a right to intervene, the non-duplication of recovery provision of the PPCIGA Act <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>barred it from any recovery against the Chows and supported the disallowance of intervention.

Specifically, we concluded that PPCIGA is obligated to pay covered claims of such third-party beneficiaries unless the Act provides for a set-off by way of the non-duplication of recovery provision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Moreover, in <em>Bell, </em>we agreed with the Superior Court’s observation that this conclusion necessarily extinguishes the subrogation interest of the third-party beneficiary’s carrier, which paid the other source of insurance to which the offset was applied.

    <blockquote id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[324,428,1122,889]]]'>The Act clearly attempts to protect both policyholders and those with claims against policyholders from the consequences of the insolvency of the insurer by establishing an association, the sole purpose of which is to compensate those who have claims which have not been paid because the insurance company is insolvent. The association is funded by assessing a fee against all member insurers, and every insurer is required to be a member as a condition of its authority to write property and casualty policies. 40 P.S. §§ 991.1803(a), (b)(3), and 991.1808. In this manner, the risk of loss due to the insolvency of any one insurer is spread out over all member insurance companies and their policyholders. <em>Id. </em>at § 991.1810. In effect, every time PPCIGA pays a claim, every member insurance company is paying part of the claim. The Act therefore seeks to lessen the financial burden on the insurance industry by preventing duplication of recovery.</blockquote>
