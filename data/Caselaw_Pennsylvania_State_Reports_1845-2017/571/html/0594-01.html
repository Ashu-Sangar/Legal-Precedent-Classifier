Amerisure sought to join SWIF as a defendant in Clawson’s action, on the ground that SWIF, as risk insurer for Smith Glass on April 6, 1992, was solely liable for any benefits awarded to Clawson for the 1992 occurrence, which Amerisure categorized as either an aggravation of the 1989 injury or a new injury.

The WCJ found that Clawson was totally disabled by the 1991 injury and that the 1991 injury and the 1992 recurrence were each, by itself, sufficient to cause Claw-son’s total disability. The WCJ concluded, as a matter of law, that Clawson could not receive benefits for the two injuries at the same time. The WCJ determined that the 1989 injury was the primary cause of Clawson’s current disability and that, therefore, Amerisure was solely liable for benefits at the rate of $324.69 per week from the date of the recurrence. This reinstated the 1989 injury benefits and suspended benefits for the 1991 injury until such time as Clawson no longer qualified for total disability benefits from the 1989 injury.</p>

In 1991, the statutory maximum was $436.00 per week. 77 P.S. § 25.2. The WCJ apportioned liability based on Clawson’s average weekly wage at the time of each injury; the WCJ determined that Amerisure was responsible for $248.24 per <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>week and SWIF was responsible for $187.75 per week after April 6, 1992.

In <em>Franklin Steel, </em>the claimant suffered a left shoulder injury on June 22, 1989, after which he underwent surgery and became totally disabled. Pursuant to a Notice of Compensation Payable dated January 21, 1990, PMA, Franklin Steel’s risk insurer at the time, paid the claimant total disabili<a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>ty payments of $399.00 per week, which was equal to the 1989 statutory maximum allowable benefit level. The claimant returned to work on October 1, 1990, and signed a final receipt. On December 20, 1990, while still working for the same employer, the claimant suffered a right shoulder injury, rendering him totally disabled effective January 13, 1991. He received total disability benefits in the amount of $305.15 per week from Liberty Mutual, Franklin Steel’s subsequent workers’ compensation insurer. The claimant executed a final receipt on May 23, 1991. However, he did not return to work due to residuals from his 1989 left shoulder injury.</p>
    <p id="b684-4" data-blocks='[["BL_684.4",684,[278,930,1161,1003]]]'>On June 28, 1991, PMA began paying total disability benefits, nullifying the October 1, 1990 final receipt. On August 12, 1991, the claimant returned to light-duty work and, pursuant to a supplemental agreement executed on September 5, 1991, the parties modified his total disability benefits to partial disability benefits. The claimant underwent another surgical procedure on his left shoulder on October 25, 1991, and PMA reinstated total disability benefits of $399.00 per week effective October 24, 1991. On December 20, 1991, the claimant had right shoulder arthroscopy and Liberty Mutual paid the medical expenses related to that procedure. A doctor examined the claimant on June 3, 1992, and determined that the residuals from both work injuries were substantial factors contributing to the claimant’s overall total disability. The Commonwealth Court determined that the two injuries were both substantial contributing factors to the claimant’s total disability and, therefore, ordered that PMA and Liberty Mutual should each pay a <em>pro rata </em>share of the claimant’s total disability benefits.</p>

      <em>Franklin Steel </em>is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Franklin Steel, </em>the Commonwealth Court found that the two injuries in combination were responsible for the claimant’s total disability; in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the 1991 injury and the 1992 recurrence of the 1989 injury were each independently totally disabling. Where it is impossible to determine which injury caused a claimant’s total disability, it is reasonable to make both insurers contribute to the claimant’s benefits pack<a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>age. Moreover, it is important to note that the Commonwealth Court in <em>Franklin Steel </em>did not permit the claimant to aggregate the awards he received from PMA and Liberty Mutual, bounded only by the statutory maximum. The statutory maximum at the time of his second injury was $436.00, but the Commonwealth Court determined that the claimant was only entitled to total disability benefits of $399.00 per week. Thus, <em>Franklin Steel </em>does not support concurrent total disability awards; rather it stands for the proposition that two insurers should share the liability for one award where two injuries combine to cause total disability.</p>
    <p id="b685-4" data-blocks='[["BL_685.4",685,[155,923,1158,1211]]]'>The Commonwealth Court also relied upon a similar line of cases starting with <em>Tomlinson v.

In May of 1985, Tomlinson suffered a work-related lower back injury, for which she received total disability benefits. In September of 1988, Tomlinson entered into a Supplement Agreement, whereby she acknowledged that her disability had changed from total to partial; the Agreement modified her benefits accordingly. Tomlinson returned to work, but in December of 1989, she suffered an additional injury in the course of her employment, which rendered her temporarily totally disabled. Tomlinson, who continued to receive $70.00 per week partial disability benefits from her original 1985 injury, sought to add $133.00 per week to that award, representing two-thirds of her average weekly wage at the time of the 1989 injury. The WCAB offset the $70.00 partial disability award, so that Tomlinson only received a total of $133.00 per week ($70.00 for the 1985 injury and $63.00 for the 1989 injury). The Commonwealth Court reversed and awarded Tomlinson $203.00 per week in benefits, reasoning that Tomlinson, “who was not working at her full earning capacity for [her employer] in 1989, [was] not limited to the loss of earnings for that job alone.” <em><a href="/pa-commw/167/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="648 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="1466749,7861796" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/167/0329-01,/a2d/648/0096-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa-commw/167/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="648 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="1466749,7861796" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/167/0329-01,/a2d/648/0096-01">at 98</a>.</p>

The Commonwealth Court majority noted that the claimant in <em>Reliable Foods </em>received more in workers’ compensation benefits through the aggregation of his partial disability award with his total disability award than he would have received based on his pre-injury average weekly wage. It is important to observe that it is always possible for a claimant who is partially disabled and then totally disabled to receive benefits in excess of what he would have received based on his average weekly wage before either injury. The claimant could receive pay increases or promotions, while employed in the lighter duty position, that would increase the sum of his average weekly wage in that position and the amount of weekly wages foregone by taking the lighter duty position originally to an amount greater than his average weekly wage before either injury. The relevant inquiry is not whether the amount of benefits due to the claimant exceeds two-thirds of the claimant’s pre-injury average weekly wage; <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>rather, the inquiry is whether the amount of benefits is reflective of the claimant’s loss in earning power.</p>
    <p id="b687-4" data-blocks='[["BL_687.4",687,[165,448,1160,1071]]]'>Soon after releasing its decision in the present case, the Commonwealth Court handed down <em>Westmoreland, Regional Hospital v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Stopa), </em><a href="/a2d/789/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="789 A.2d 413" data-case-ids="9399869" data-case-paths="/a2d/789/0413-01">789 A.2d 413</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2001), involving a similar factual scenario. In January of 1995, Stopa suffered a rotator cuff injury, which rendered her totally disabled. In April of 1996, Stopa returned to modified duty work, so she received partial disability benefits to properly supplement her light-duty pay. In May of 1996, while performing her modified duty position, she sustained an injury to her right knee and, while undergoing physical therapy on her right knee in October of 1996, suffered a left knee injury. In November of 1997, Stopa filed a Reinstatement Petition alleging entitlement to reinstatement of her total disability benefits from the 1995 injury and a Claim Petition seeking total disability benefits for the 1996 left knee injury. The WCJ and WCAB permitted Stopa to recover both awards up to the statutory maximum in effect at the time. The Commonwealth Court reversed, concluding that to allow Stopa to collect two total disability awards would be equal to compensating her twice for losing the same position.</p>
    <p id="b687-5" data-blocks='[["BL_687.5",687,[161,1567,1157,798]]]'>We agree with the reasoning employed by the Commonwealth Court in <em>Stopa. </em>At no time did Clawson possess earning power greater than $487.03 per week. He received total disability benefits based on the loss of that earning power from October 23, 1989 until September 10, 1990, when he returned to his previous position without restrictions, and where he remained until his August 8, 1991 injury. At the time of the 1991 injury, Clawson was not suffering from any impairment resulting in wage loss. At the time of the 1992 recurrence, Clawson was already receiving total disability benefits for the 1991 injury and suffered no additional wage loss due to this recurrence. Clawson had earning power and lost that earning power as a result of the 1991 injury; at the time of the 1992 recurrence, however, Clawson had no earning power.</p>

      <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>As Judge Smith-Ribner stated in her cogent and well-reasoned dissent to the decision of the Commonwealth Court in the case <em>sub judice:</em>
    </p>
    <blockquote id="b688-4" data-blocks='[["BL_688.4",688,[329,487,1121,679]]]'>[T]he [Commonwealth] Court has approved concurrent awards only in circumstances where the original injury resulted in partial disability or where one of the awards was for specific loss. The [Commonwealth] Court has expressly disapproved the result endorsed by the majority [of the Commonwealth Court] here, namely, concurrent awards for wage loss benefits where the first award was for total disability. As the cases repeatedly state, disability is loss of earning power. Where a claimant is totally disabled already when he or she suffers another injury (in this case recurrence of Clawson’s 1989 injury) there is no loss of earning power at that time. For this reason the courts have not approved such an award.</blockquote>

As the WCJ determined that the 1992 recurrence by itself would be totally disabling, it properly granted the Reinstatement Petition and set aside the Final Receipt for the 1989 injury. To ensure that Clawson will be properly compensated for his injuries, both of which are, by themselves, totally disabling, we remand the matter to the Commonwealth Court with the direction to shepherd an ultimate remand to the WCJ to: (1) grant the Reinstatement Petition and set aside the Final Receipt for the 1989 injury and; (2) suspend benefits for that injury until such time as Clawson’s entitlement to benefits for the 1991 injury changes. Until then, SWIF should remain solely liable to Clawson for total disability benefits in the amount of $264.20 per week.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

We recognize that the Commonwealth Court has consistently held that a recurrence of an injury relates back to the date of the original injury (in this case, the 1992 recurrence would date back to 1989). <em>See Lackawanna Refuse v.
