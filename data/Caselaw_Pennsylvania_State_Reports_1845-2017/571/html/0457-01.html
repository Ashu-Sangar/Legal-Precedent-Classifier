The factual and procedural history underlying this matter is lengthy and complex. However, it must be addressed fully in order to provide a proper context in which to understand the basis for the present appeal.</p>

He served in that capacity for a full ten year term and was <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>retained for a second term in 1987. The Pennsylvania Judicial Inquiry Review Board (the JIRB) informed Appellant in May of the following year that it had received complaints of misconduct against him and that formal proceedings had been initiated. On July' 17, 1991, upon completion of a series of investigations, the JIRB reported to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that Appellant had created the appearance of impropriety by engaging in ex parte communications with a trial judge in a pending case. A three justice panel of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania adopted the JIRB’s recommendation and issued an order on October 14, 1992 publicly reprimanding Appellant. <em>In re Larsen, </em><a href="/pa/532/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="532 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="1835912" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0326-01">532 Pa. 326</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="532 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="1835912" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0326-01">616 A.2d 529</a> (1992). Appellant then filed a petition before the full Supreme Court alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that several Justices had engaged in various forms of judicial misconduct. In response to this petition, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania launched a grand jury investigation. Ultimately, the grand jury issued a presentment finding that no credible evidence supported Appellant’s allegations against the other justices. However, the grand jury announced that it had discovered evidence of misconduct by Appellant in addition to the incidents reported by the JIRB.</p>

Six days later, on October 28,1993, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania filed criminal charges against Appellant related to his unlawful acquisition of prescription medications. As a result, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania relieved Appellant of all judicial and administrative duties as an Associate Justice. Appellant was not suspended from office at this time nor did the Supreme Court suspend his pay. The Judiciary Committee of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives thereupon launched its own investigation of Appellant.</p>

During a week-long jury trial, evidence was adduced indicating that Appellant had been in therapy since the 1960’s to treat chronic dysthymia (clinical depression) and concomitant anxiety. Once Appellant entered judicial office, he became the subject of media scrutiny which caused him to fear that the public would learn of his mental illness and that he would be stigmatized as a result. Appellant convinced his attending physician that it was extremely important to prevent the media from discovering the truth about his mental illness. The physician therefore issued prescriptions in the names of third parties for the medications intended for Appellant’s use. Furthermore, Appellant’s perceived need for secrecy was so intense that his physician kept no written records concerning Appellant’s therapy. For a period of twelve years, Appellant’s physician prescribed various medically necessary psychotropic drugs, including Valium® (diazepam) and Prozac® (fluoxetine), to members of Appellant’s staff so that Appellant could follow his treatment regimen in relative secrecy. On April 9, 1994, the jury acquitted Appellant on multiple counts of unlawfully procuring a controlled substance, but found him guilty on two counts of criminal conspiracy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The Board then filed a Complaint in the Court of Judicial Discipline requesting that action be taken against Appellant based upon his convictions in the Court of Common Pleas. The complaint was docketed at Number 4 JD 94. On May 24, 1994, while this matter was pending before the Court of Judicial Discipline, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives adopted seven Articles of Impeachment against Appellant accusing him of misbehavior in office. The Senate of Pennsylvania incorporated these Articles of Impeachment as part of its Writ of Impeachment Summons.</p>

Among other things, Appellant asserted that the Court lacked jurisdiction because he no longer was a judicial officer after being removed from office by virtue of the trial court’s sentencing order. The Court of Judicial Discipline granted the motion in part, denied it in part, and ordered the parties to file briefs on certain points. Before the motions were resolved by the Court of Judicial' Discipline, the Pennsylvania Senate took up the matter of Appellant’s impeachment.</p>

The Senate then adopted Senate Resolution No. 163, which removed Appellant from office on different grounds than those relied upon by the court of common pleas and declared him ineligible to hold any office of trust or profit in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania at any time in the future.</p>

This order also disbarred Appellant from the practice of law in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This was the third time Appellant was removed from office, but the first time he was disbarred.

      <em>Gmerek, </em>the dissent and both opinions filed in support of affirmance indicate that all of the Justices agree the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is the sole authority for the regulation of the conduct of attorneys who are acting in the capacity of legal counsel.

However, nothing in either <em>Jepsen </em>or <em>Gmerek </em>indicates that the Supreme Court considers their authority to regulate the practice of law as less than “exclusive.” We find that the views expressed in <em>Jepsen </em>and <em>Gmerek </em>comport with our own conclusion that disbarring Appellant was not a sanction available to the Court of Judicial Discipline.</p>

Const, art. 5, § 18(c)(1). I find support for my view that the Court of Judicial Discipline has the ability to disbar a justice based on the fact that disbarment is specifically referenced within article 5 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides that, “[A] justice ... disbarred as a member of the bar of the Supreme Court or removed under this section shall forfeit automatically his judicial office and thereafter be ineligible for judicial office.” Pa. Const, art. 5, § 18(d)(3).

A justice or, as in this case, a former justice, should not be judged by members of the court with whom he served; indeed, in my opinion this tribunal was established and endowed with the power to review sanctions imposed against a justice of the Supreme Court for this very reason. The citizens of this commonwealth, in voting to amend the Constitution and create a special tribunal, clearly sought to provide an independent and impartial venue for the review of discipline imposed upon a fallen justice. Without such a tribunal, it is easily foreseeable that the specter of recusal could result in the inability of the Supreme Court to <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>act. Although the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the practice of law pursuant to the Pennsylvania Constitution, the role of the special tribunal with regard to reviewing sanctions upon a justice is also founded upon express constitutional mandate and must be read and interpreted in a common sense fashion. To have one’s colleagues sit in judgment is exactly what the amendment sought to avoid, and the above-cited provisions of article 5 support such a conclusion.</p>

He observed, “It makes better sense for judicial officers who are members of the bar and who are charged with violations of both the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Rules of Professional Conduct to face only a single proceeding before [the Court of Judicial Discipline] and to have all sanctions imposed at once, instead of proceedings both before this Court and the Disciplinary Board, with separate appellate review in the Supreme Court subject to different standards.” <em><a href="/a2d/717/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="717 A.2d 39" data-case-ids="11687102" data-case-paths="/a2d/717/0039-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/717/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="717 A.2d 39" data-case-ids="11687102" data-case-paths="/a2d/717/0039-01">at 51-53</a> (Byer, J. concurring).</p>
