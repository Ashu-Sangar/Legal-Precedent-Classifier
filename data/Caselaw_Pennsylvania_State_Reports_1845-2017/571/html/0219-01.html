      <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>Appellant argues that <em>Tyler </em>should not be followed in this case, since it involved federal habeas corpus review, rather than state collateral review. Further, he asserts that <em>Tyler </em>is distinct from this case, because the instant case involves the sentence of death rather than a sentence of life in prison. However, Appellant overlooks that in <em>Tyler </em>the Court was merely construing the language of the statute and did not rely on any rationale that was unique to the AEDPA. Indeed, in <em>Tyler, </em>the Court implied that had Congress used the word “held” instead of “made,” the intent of the statute would be clear. Thus, the analysis employed by the Court in <em>Tyler </em>supports our use of a similar analysis in this case. Additionally, we are mindful that the instant case involves a capital petitioner; however, in interpreting the exception in subsection (iii) to the jurisdictional time requirement, we are not at liberty to disregard the plain language of the statute.</p>

In this case, as Appellant acknowledges, the United States Supreme Court has not made a determination regarding the availability of <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Ring </em>to cases pending on collateral review. Thus, Appellant has not met the PCRA’s jurisdictional time requirement for review of his constitutional claim. This claim therefore does not entitle Appellant to a stay of execution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Specifically, Appellant questions the integrity of this court by insinuating that we intentionally sidestepped reviewing this issue in order to avoid ruling on the propriety of one of our own colleague’s behavior. Appellant also argues that he is entitled to relief because according to Appellant, we retroactively applied a new set of rules in reviewing his case, i.e., the abolition of relaxed waiver in collateral matters and strict adherence to the pleading and proof requirements of the PCRA, in violation of his due process rights.</p>
    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.4",313,[166,866,1154,1219]]]'>As to Appellant’s first argument, which essentially questions the integrity of our court, we only note that this court reviews every matter with fairness and thoroughness.

We denied his Application for Reconsideration on September 20, 2002 and thus, the issue has been previously reviewed. Additionally, we have held that following <em>Commonwealth v.

Bracey, </em><a href="/pa/568/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="568 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="163716" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0264-01">568 Pa. 264</a>, <a href="/pa/568/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="795 A.2d 935" data-case-ids="163716,9427271" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0264-01,/a2d/795/0935-01">795 A.2d 935</a>, 941 (2001). We explained that this court did not announce a new rule of law in <em>Albrecht; </em>rather, <em>Albrecht </em>was a mere clarification of existing law. <em>Id.; Commonwealth v. Pursell, </em><a href="/pa/555/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="555 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="1701998" data-case-paths="/pa/555/0233-01">555 Pa. 233</a>, <a href="/a2d/724/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="724 A.2d 293" data-case-ids="11635848,1701998" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0293-01,/pa/555/0233-01">724 A.2d 293</a> (1999).

This court is generally reluctant to grant an evidentiary hearing to merely act as a fishing expedition for any possible evidence that may support some speculative claim. <em>Commonwealth v. Scott, </em><a href="/pa/561/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="561 Pa. 617" data-case-ids="93826" data-case-paths="/pa/561/0617-01">561 Pa. 617</a>, <a href="/a2d/752/0871-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="752 A.2d 871" data-case-ids="11511906,93826" data-case-paths="/a2d/752/0871-01,/pa/561/0617-01">752 A.2d 871</a>, 877 n. 8 (2000).
