In the decision whether or not there is a duty, many factors interplay: The hand of history, our ideas of morals and justice, the convenience of administration of the rule, and our social ideas as to where the loss should fall.

Although the Superior Court’s observation <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>that the EMS Act and its regulations do not specifically refer to the use of AEDs by untrained individuals is correct, we do not agree with the court’s conclusion that the EMS Act and its regulations are irrelevant to the issue of whether Gulph Mills had a duty to use an AED on its premises. Rather, they are relevant to demonstrate that the acquisition, maintenance, and use of an AED, along with AED training requirements, are highly regulated. Indeed, the implication of the Legislature’s exclusion of untrained laypersons from the EMS Act and its regulations is to preclude unqualified and untrained individuals from administering emergency medical services using an AED. We must infer that, under the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>the inclusion of a specific matter in a statute implies the exclusion of other matters. <em>Pane v. Commonwealth, Dep’t of Highways, </em><a href="/pa/422/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="422 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="1901688" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0489-01">422 Pa. 489</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=222%20A.2d%20913" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="222 A.2d 913">222 A.2d 913</a>, 915 (1966) (citing <em>Cali v.

The AED Good Samaritan Act, which was adopted two years after Atcovitz sustained his injuries, provides civil immunity for <em>trained </em>users of AEDs and requires that “expected users shall complete training in the use of an AED....” 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8331.2(a), (c). As an <em>exception </em>to that general rule, the AED Good Samaritan Act also provides civil immunity to untrained individuals who, <em>in good faith, </em>use an AED in an emergency as an ordinary, reasonably prudent individual would do under the same or similar circumstances. <em><a href="/citations/?q=177%20A.2d%20824" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="177 A.2d 824">Id.</a> </em>at § 8331.2(e).

Indeed, the exception expresses that personnel under the EMS Act are the preferred users of AEDs: it applies only to instances where emergency medical services personnel are unavailable. In addition, it does not indicate that the Legislature aimed to dispense with the regulations governing the training and use of AEDs. Simply, the existence of a civil immunity provision for Good Samaritans who use an AED in an emergency situation cannot impose a duty on a business establishment to acquire, maintain, and use such a device on its premises.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Appellees do not cite any other case, statute, or regulation that would have imposed such a duty on Gulph Mills at the time of Atcovitz’s injuries in January 1996. Because Gulph Mills did not owe a duty to carry an AED, Appellees could not have established a <em>prima facie </em>claim of negligence. <em>See Omer, </em><a href="/pa/515/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="515 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="1806087" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0132-01">515 Pa. 132</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="515 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="1806087" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0132-01">527 A.2d 521</a>.
