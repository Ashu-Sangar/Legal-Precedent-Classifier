While Appellant is correct that the text of Rule 121(c) includes the statement that “the judge must ascertain on the record whether there is a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of counsel,” we do not interpret that phrase as requiring the judge himself to conduct the colloquy. Rather, Rule 121(c) merely requires the judge to <em>ascertain </em>whether there has been a valid waiver, which he can certainly do by considering the defendant’s answers to questions that someone else poses to the defendant in the judge’s presence. In essence, Rule 121(c) makes the trial judge the one ultimately responsible for ensuring that the defendant is questioned about the six areas discussed above and for determining whether the defendant is indeed making an informed and independent decision to waive counsel. The Rule simply does not, contrary to Appellant’s assertions, require the judge to be the one to literally pose the questions to the defendant.

While we clearly agree with Appellant that the trial judge has a duty to protect a defendant’s constitutional right to counsel, we do not agree that a judge somehow shirks this duty by allowing someone other than the court to pose the actual questions required by <em>Starr. </em>Rather, we believe that the defendant’s interests are sufficiently protected as long as the judge is present and attentive during the colloquy and conscientiously evaluates the defendant’s responses to the questions posed to him before granting the defendant’s petition to waive his right to counsel.

In the first instance, the trial judge engaged in a lengthy discussion with Appellant regarding Appellant’s decision to proceed without counsel. During this conversation, the trial judge questioned Appellant in detail about his reasons for electing to proceed without counsel, explained to Appellant that Appellant would still be permitted to make decisions regarding his defense if he proceeded to trial with counsel, informed Appellant of the disadvantages of proceeding without counsel, appointed Appellant standby counsel, answered questions posed by Appellant, discussed with Appellant the method in which Appellant would testify at trial if he indeed proceeded without counsel, and agreed to arrange for Appellant to receive additional access to the law library inside the prison. Immediately following this conversation, and while the trial judge was present, the prosecutor then conducted a more formal colloquy which, as noted above, explicitly covered the six areas required by <em>Starr. </em>It was only after the court’s detailed discussion and the prosecutor’s comprehensive colloquy with the defendant that the trial judge granted Appellant’s petition to waive his right to counsel. Given these circumstances, we agree with the lower courts that Appellant’s waiver of counsel was valid, despite the fact that it was the prosecutor who conducted Appellant’s colloquy.
