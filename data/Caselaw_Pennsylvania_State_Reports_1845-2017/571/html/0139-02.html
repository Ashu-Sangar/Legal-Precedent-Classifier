In conformance with federal constitutional requirements, the tax is ostensibly designed to reach only value attributable to the conduct of instate business activity. Nevertheless, the initial tax base is quite broad in that it subsumes measures of value generated by the taxpayer and its subsidiary corporations, both in and out of state. In attempting to adjust this broad tax base to <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>isolate in-state value prior to application of the tax rate, the taxing statute incorporates principles of formulary apportionment. Unlike the methodology utilized to determine the tax base, however, the apportionment formula prescribed by the taxing statute, as interpreted by the Department, does not take into account factors representing in- and out-of-state value generated by taxpayer subsidiaries. Unisys’s present challenges are centered upon the absence of factor representation in single-entity, franchise value apportionment.</p>

Despite such ownership (and plain requirements of the taxing statute), in its franchise tax returns, Unisys calculated its tax base without reference to value attributable to its subsidiaries. In settling Unisys’s franchise tax for the applicable years, however, the Department increased the tax base to include certain measures of out-of-state value. Nevertheless, in adjusting the tax base to arrive at a taxable value, the Department did not incorporate into the apportionment formula any indices of value pertaining to the out-of-state subsidiaries, which, according to Unisys, had the effect of distorting its tax liability (or, more specifically, increasing the taxable value by some forty-five percent). Unisys filed resettlement petitions with the Department, which were denied, then with the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue (the Board). The Board also denied Unisys’s petitions, and the company lodged appeals in the Commonwealth Court sitting effectively as a trial court, <em>see </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1571, with the present appeals concerning the tax years ending March 31, 1985, and 1986 (Sperry Corporation returns), and December 31, 1986 (Unisys returns).

The majority opened its opinion with a detailed overview of the mechanics of the taxing statute applicable to foreign corporations doing business in Pennsylvania. Under Section 601 of the Tax Code, 72 P.S. § 7601, the tax base, termed the capital stock value of the corporation, is first determined by a statutory formula based upon the corporation’s net worth (the sum of the entity’s issued and outstanding capital stock, surplus and undivided profits as per books ..., 72 P.S. § 7601(a)), and average net income ([t]he sum of the net income or loss for each of the current and immediately preceding four years, divided by five, 72 P.S. § 7601(a)). For such purposes, the taxpayer’s net worth includes net worth of subsidiaries, <em>see </em>72 P.S. § 7601(a) (In the case of any entity which has investments in other corporations, the net worth shall be the consolidated net worth of such entity[.] ).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Net income, however, is assessed on a separate-company, unconsolidated basis (exclusive of the net income or loss of subsidiary <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>corporations), although it includes dividends received from subsidiaries. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 7601(a); 61 Pa.Code § 155.26(a), (b); <em>see also Philadelphia Suburban Corp. v.

Unisys does not dispute its status as a unitary business enterprise, or contest Pennsylvania’s ability to measure the value of its franchise as <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>such in the first instance. Rather, it rejects the apportionment of an asserted unitary tax base according to factors attributable to the parent corporation only. In this regard, Unisys emphasizes that the justification provided in <em>Container Corp. </em>and its progeny for permitting states to aggregate interstate value for purposes of taxation depends integrally upon the out-of-state portion being reasonably “apportioned away” prior to arriving at a taxable value, such that the taxing state can ultimately be said to be fairly reaching only value reasonably attributable to business activities within its borders. Where a tax base is determined on a unitary basis, in Unisys’s estimation, constitutional fairness principles require that the apportionment fraction must be unitary as well, and therefore, rationally related to, and consistent with, the tax base that it seeks to divide. According to Unisys, a structural “mismatch” between valuation and apportionment methodologies is not only irrational but also produces an inherent and impermissible distortion in segregating value. Unisys asserts that the methodology resulted in an overstatement of the value attributable to its Pennsylvania business activities on the order of some forty-five percent and maintains that the distortion is inimical to the salient constitutional fairness principles regardless of the degree of numerical disparity in tax liability produced. In support of its primary argument, Unisys cites to decisions of the appellate courts in Maine, Wisconsin, and New York. <em>See Du Pont, </em>675 A.2d at 89 (citing <em>Tambrands, Inc. v.

In this regard, the Board emphasizes that the average net income component of the tax base assessment is calculated on an unconsolidated basis, with dividends from subsidiaries included only as an appropriate item of income to the taxpayer. Thus, in the first instance, the Board advances its view that factor representation in apportionment is not required in the Pennsylvania scheme even assuming the correctness of Unisys’s core argument that consolidated valuation would require it in theory. The Board emphasizes its position that the Department’s settlements concerning Unisys’s franchise tax liability are consistent with application of the internal and external consistency tests fashioned by the United States Supreme Court, and that Unisys has failed to meet its burden of establishing that the apportionment fractions ascribed do not fairly reflect the extent of Unisys’s business activities in the Commonwealth. The Board also posits that the availability of an alternate, elective method for calculating franchise tax liability ameliorates any unfairness that might otherwise be attributed to apportionment via the three-factor method. Finally, the Board maintains that statutory relief is not warranted because the only evidence of unfairness in the record stems from Unisys’s alternative apportionment formula, which is neither mandated by the statute nor grounded in sound theory. According to the Board, the statutory fair apportionment provision is to be used only in extraordinary circumstances and to avoid constitutional infractions, neither of which is present here.</p>

In the complex field of constitutional restraints on state taxation of multijurisdictional commerce, the dollar figures presented by the parties for comparison have not been predicated upon any uniform set of parameters from which percentage-based comparisons can be easily drawn across cases. The large discrepancies at issue in <em>Hans Rees’ Sons </em>and <em>Norfolk &amp; W.

In this regard, we are merely following the U.S. Supreme Court's lead in requiring, as a practical measure, that the taxpayer present the court with a valid and meaningful set of reference calculations against which to measure the alleged distortionate effects of the challenged taxing statute, once it is determined that the apportionment formula passes the internal consistency test. <em>Compare Container Corp., </em>.<a href="/us/463/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="230" data-cite="463 U.S. 159" data-case-ids="6192779" data-case-paths="/us/463/0159-01">463 U.S. at 181</a>, <a href="/us/463/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="231" data-cite="463 U.S. 159" data-case-ids="6192779" data-case-paths="/us/463/0159-01">103 S.Ct. at 2948</a> (rejecting a claim of alleged unconstitutional distortion where the taxpayer’s baseline figures were founded upon an accounting method suffering from basic theoretical weaknesses) <em>and Moonnan, </em><a href="/us/437/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="232" data-cite="437 U.S. 267" data-case-ids="6178910" data-case-paths="/us/437/0267-01">437 U.S. at 272, 276</a>, <a href="/us/437/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="233" data-cite="437 U.S. 267" data-case-ids="6178910" data-case-paths="/us/437/0267-01">98 S.Ct. at 2344, 2346</a> (denying relief in part because taxpayer failed to proffer figures representing the actual profitability of in-state sales subject to the challenged tax) <em>with Hans Rees', </em><a href="/us/283/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="234" data-cite="283 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="434465" data-case-paths="/us/283/0123-01">283 U.S. at 134-36</a>, <a href="/us/283/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="235" data-cite="283 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="434465" data-case-paths="/us/283/0123-01">51 S.Ct. at 389</a> (providing relief where, although the apportioning methodology was facially sound, the taxpayer adduced convincing reference figures indicating that its income attributable to in-state activities was well below that yielded by the taxing formula) <em>and Norfolk &amp; W.

Where out-of-state income paid to the parent company in the form of dividends increases, the result is an increase in the capital stock value subject to taxation by Pennsylvania, whether or not the unitary enterprise’s in-state activities increase. In other words, although the tax base increases, there is no corresponding increase in the denominator of the apportionment formula to account for the out-of-state production of the value.

See </em>72 P.S. §§ 7601-7605. A corporation’s capital stock value, i.e., the tax base, is determined by a fixed formula based on: (1) the corporation's net worth, (2) the net worth of any subsidiary of the reporting corporation, and (3) the corporation’s average net income, which includes dividends received from its subsidiaries. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 7601(a); 61 Pa.Code § 155.26(a). The apportionment factor is computed by means of a statutory apportionment formula that averages three ratios: (1) the corporation’s property within Pennsylvania to total property everywhere, (2) the corporation's payroll incurred in Pennsylvania to total payroll incurred everywhere, and (3) the corporation's sales within Pennsylvania to total sales everywhere. <em>See </em>72 P.S. §§ 7602(b), 7401(3)2.(a)(9)(B), 7603.

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has the constitutional prerogative to tax Unisys for its income fairly attributable to its in-state activities. This extends to income derived from subsidiaries. However, when determining the percentage of business that the taxpayer corporation conducts in Pennsylvania, fairness and external consistency mandate that the same entities used to determine Actual Value are used to calculate apportionment. Assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Actual Value of Unisys is $100 and the actual combined value of Unisys’ subsidiaries attributable to the Actual Value of Unisys pursuant to the taxing scheme is $400.

Pursuant to the Pennsylvania taxing scheme, the Actual Value of the taxable corporation would be $500 and the apportionment factor would be 80% (percentage of business Unisys itself conducts in-state). Thus, Unisys would be liable for tax on $400, even though only $120 of its business is attributable to Pennsylvania (80% of $100 + 10% of $400).

Thus, the taxing scheme is constitutionally infirm as applied to multi-jurisdictional businesses with subsidiaries. The inclusion of aspects of the earnings of the subsidiaries in the actual value of the parent taxpayer corporation without an attendant inclusion of aspects of the property, payroll, and sales of the subsidiaries in the calculation of the apportionment factor renders the relationship between the tax base and the parent taxpayer corporation’s business activities conducted within the state unreasonable.</p>
