As the Superior Court cogently observed, PCRA petitions fail to serve that purpose. Here, the claims in Appellant’s amended PCRA petition were identical to the issues that Appellant ultimately argued before the Superior Court. While the PCRA court was well acquainted with the claims raised in the amended PCRA petition, Appellant’s failure to comply with the court’s order to file a Rule 1925(b) statement compelled the court to speculate which of those claims Appellant would maintain on appeal. Bearing in mind the purpose of Rule 1925, this result is unsupportable. Therefore, as PCRA petitions do not fully inform PCRA courts of what issues an appellant will raise on appeal, a PCRA petition cannot serve as a substitute for a Rule 1925(b) statement.</p>

Moreover, if we were to accept Appellant’s position, courts would be constrained to selectively enforce the Rule based upon the arguments of parties, which would subvert the purpose and effectiveness of Rule 1925.</p>

Rather, the unverified Rule 1925(b) statement is addressed directly to the PCRA court judge.

As the majority also aptly notes, <em>Lord </em>“eliminated any aspect of discretion” in treating a failure to comply with an Appellate Rule 1925(b) directive.

The dissent objects to what it views as the majority’s “expansion” of the holding in <em>Lord, </em>which it deems “unwarranted and unfair.” In my view, the dissent’s quarrel is with <em>Lord </em>and not with the majority’s proper application of that unequivocal decision.</p>

The Rules of Appellate Procedure govern all appeals, not just criminal appeals, and not just direct criminal appeals. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 103 (“Scope of Rules”) (“These rules govern practice and procedure in the Supreme Court, the Superior Court and the Commonwealth Court, including procedure in appeals to such courts from lower courts.... ”).

The question, in essence, was whether direct criminal appeals were excepted from the general appellate waiver rule set forth in Appellate Rule 1925.</p>

Accordingly, we held that direct criminal appeals were not excepted from Appellate Rule 1925 and, in so holding, we announced the prospective interpretation of the appellate waiver standard set forth in Appellate Rule 1925(b). Nothing in <em>Lord </em>remotely suggested that the Appellate Rule 1925 holding was limited to direct criminal appeals, as if the unitary language and purpose of the Rule means one thing for some appeals, and something entirely different for others.</p>

But the strictness of our prospective interpretation had nothing to do with the fact that <em>Lord </em>involved a direct criminal appeal, rather than a civil appeal, or a PCRA appeal, or any other appeal; it had to do with the necessary and salutary function of Appellate Rule 1925 as a rule of appellate procedure. As such, it is an interpretation that necessarily must apply to all cases on appeal. Notably, both the Superior Court and the Commonwealth Court have applied the teaching of <em>Lord </em>to civil cases no less than to criminal cases. <em>Lobaugh v.

Indeed, in my view, an exception for PCRA appeals would be perverse. First, it is difficult to understand why notions of fairness would require favoring a collateral appeal in a criminal case over the direct appeal. Indeed, the equities work in the opposite direction. The right of direct appeal is constitutional while the right of PCRA review exists only by statute, with the right of PCRA appeal being secondarily triggered. Moreover, the claims available upon PCRA review are far more restricted than are available upon direct appeal; although PCRA review may be a “safety valve” to permit review of some issues not previously or properly raised, it is by no means a substitute for a direct appeal.</p>
    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[166,970,1158,684]]]'>More importantly, the PCRA affords criminal defendants something which is afforded to no other litigant: a second bite at the review apple. Application of <em>Lord </em>on a direct civil appeal puts that appellant out of court forever with respect to the waived claims. Those civil appellants who have their claims deemed waived under <em>Lord </em>(or under any waiver doctrine) have no “safety valve” whatsoever. I would not place a greater value upon an appeal of a collateral attack upon a final judgment, an attack not available to all, than I would place upon the right of appeal, which is available to all. Thus, in my mind, if <em>Lord </em>sufficiently balances the equities in the direct appeal context, it necessarily is fair in the context of collateral appellate review of final criminal judgments.</p>

Over one year later, on May 11, 1999, Appellant’s amended petition was dismissed without a hearing, the PCRA court having determined that a decision could be made from the existing record. Appellant filed a notice of appeal to the Superior Court, and on June 25, 1999, the PCRA court ordered him to file a statement of matters complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.1925(b). Appellant’s counsel did not file a Rule 1925(b) statement on his behalf and, as a result, in its Rule 1925(a) opinion the PCRA court addressed only the issues Appellant raised in his amended PCRA petition.</p>

Lord, </em>this Court considered whether Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 720 (formerly Rule 1410(B)(1)(c)) precludes an appellate court from deeming an issue waived when an Appellant fails to raise that issue in his Rule 1925(b) statement. <a href="/a2d/719/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="719 A.2d 306" data-case-ids="11673876,11673960,356262,356264" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0306-01,/a2d/719/0306-02,/pa/553/0415-01,/pa/553/0414-01">719 A.2d at 307</a>.

The majority essentially agrees with this conclusion, but then expands the strict waiver rule to PCRA appeals, explaining that because the purpose of Rule 1925 is to aid trial judges in identifying the issues a party plans to raise on appeal, the need for a 1925(b) statement still exists at the PCRA level. As a result, the majority finds that Appellant’s PCRA petition cannot serve as a substitute for a 1925(b) statement, and instead concludes that the strict waiver rule from <em>Lord </em>applies to Appellant’s appeal from the denial of his PCRA petition. In my view, this expansion of <em>Lord </em>is not only unwarranted, but simply unfair.</p>
