Sharon Stecher was driving her 1983 Ford LTD westbound on a snow and ice covered road when her vehicle spun as she approached a curve. The LTD crossed the centerline and its front end struck an embankment on the opposite side of the road. The vehicle then spun back onto the roadway, still proceeding in a westerly direction, with the driver’s side of the vehicle leading the way. Stecher’s LTD then collided with a 1992 GMC pickup that was traveling eastbound. The point of impact was approximately at the “B pillar,” which is the post that runs vertically from the floor to the roof of the car, directly behind the driver’s left shoulder. Stecher suffered severe brain damage and a pelvic fracture as a result of the collision.</p>

Thus, regardless of which approach the Court may adopt, Ford Motor Company would prevail as the jury found that the product defect was not a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs’ injuries. Stated differently, the difference between the <em>Huddell /Caiazzo </em>and <em>Fox /Mitchell </em>theories goes primarily to the apportionment of an indivisible harm, <em>i.e., </em>a permanent brain injury allegedly arising from both a car collision and a defect in the vehicle.

The jury’s question had nothing to do with the extent of the enhanced injury. The jury asked the court whether it had to find that the defect was the sole cause of Plaintiffs’ injury or whether it was sufficient that the defect made the injury worse.
