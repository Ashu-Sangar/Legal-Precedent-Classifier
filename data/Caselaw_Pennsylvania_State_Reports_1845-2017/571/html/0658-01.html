On September 26, 2000, Appellant waived his right to a jury trial and the case proceeded before Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, Senior Judge Raymond A. Novak. The first witness to testify at trial was Joshua Fosnight (hereinafter, Josh), who, at all times relevant to the charges against Appellant, was sixteen years of age. Josh explained that he first met Appellant in late September to early November 1999, at the Econo Lodge Bar at the Gaslight Steak House located in Hampton Township (hereinafter, the Bar). Josh <a id="p663" href="#p663" data-label="663" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*663</a>stated that a friend from work introduced him to Appellant and told Appellant to take care of him. Josh testified that at no time, including during the initial meeting, did Appellant ask him for identification and Josh denied ever showing him any. Nevertheless, Josh said that from time to time Appellant sold him alcohol, which Josh claimed he always took out of the Bar.</p>

Josh further testified that he then got into his girlfriend’s truck (she had been waiting for him), drove to a gas station to purchase cups and orange juice and, together, they proceeded to finish the entire bottle of vodka. The two then went to dinner and on the way home they stopped back at the Bar where Josh purchased another bottle of vodka, which he said his girlfriend wanted for the weekend. Josh went home at approximately 11:00 P.M.</p>

Josh admitted to his father that he purchased alcohol from Appellant. Mr. Fosnight called police and arranged for Josh to return to the bar the very same night to purchase a case of beer from Appellant. Close to the Bar, police made sure that Josh had no identification and Mr. Fosnight provided him with $50.00 to purchase alcohol from Appellant. Police allowed Josh to drive his car to the Bar. Josh entered the Bar and Mr. Fosnight and his wife watched in close proximity where they soon witnessed Appellant placing a case of beer into the car that his son had been driving.

Counsel argued that the charges against Appellant should be dismissed because the statute the Commonwealth chose to prosecute him under, Section 6310.1(a) of the Crimes Code, required that the Commonwealth prove that Appellant knowingly provided the beverage to a minor and that the Commonwealth had failed to prove such knowledge.

According to Appellant, the identification indicated that Josh was twenty-two years old. Appellant admitted that at approximately midnight on February 18, 2000, Josh had come into the bar and asked to purchase a case of beer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Appellant explained that when Josh gave him money, he sold Josh a case of beer and placed it into the trunk of Josh’s car.

    <p id="b754-6" data-blocks='[["BL_754.6",754,[277,969,1163,1163]]]'>I agree with the trial court’s position, however, that Section 6310.1(a) is not structured to articulate a degree of culpability requisite to the overall offense. On the contrary, the intentionally and knowingly terms appear to apply to the clauses that immediately follow them, namely, those which describe the acts of selling, furnishing, or purchasing with intent to sell or furnish alcoholic beverages. This is reinforced by the reiteration of the salient intent requirement in proximity to each of these alternative actions identified. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 6310.1(a) (proscribing “intentionally and knowingly selling],” “intentionally and knowingly fumish[ing]” and “purchases "with intent to sell or furnish”).
