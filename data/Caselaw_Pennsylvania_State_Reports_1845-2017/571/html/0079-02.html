Pascal, a member of the Leechburg Area School District, and Joseph H. Wiedemer, a taxpayer and resident of the Thirtieth Senatorial District, filed a Petition for Review in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Constitution (1) Appellee may not continue to hold and maintain the office of a Pennsylvania State Senator and President Pro Tempore of the Senate; (2) the Senate seat for Pennsylvania’s Thirtieth Senatorial District is vacant as a matter of law; and (3) there is a need for a special election to fill the Senate seat from the Thirtieth Senatorial District. On October 22, 2001, Appellee filed Preliminary Objections to Appellants’ Petition for Review, contending that (1) Appellants lacked standing; (2) only the Senate can declare a Senate seat vacant; (3) Appellants failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the Pennsylvania Constitution does not require that Appellee resign his Senate seat; and (4) separation of powers concerns do not require that Appellee resign his Senate seat. Both parties requested expedited consideration given the public importance of the issues involved, which the Commonwealth Court granted.</p>

The Commonwealth Court concluded that Appellants had standing to bring the action because (1) there was a high probability that no other persons would bring the challenge; (2) the case presented a unique constitutional issue that required judicial review; and (3) Appellants Lawless and Pascal had taken oaths to defend the Pennsylvania Constitution, which conferred standing pursuant <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>to <em>Bergdoll v.

This sec<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>tion also explains that when the governorship is vacant and there is no Lieutenant Governor to succeed to that office, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate becomes Governor. In a situation where the President Pro Tempore of the Senate becomes Lieutenant Governor, however, Article IV, Section 14 makes no express provision for the vacancy of the President Pro Tempore’s Senate seat.

      <em> </em>the Commonwealth Court agreed with Appellee that if the Constitution requires that a President Pro Tempore vacate his Senate seat upon becoming Lieutenant Governor, it would provide for this expressly. As further support for this interpretation, the court quoted from the debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1873, where the original draft of the predecessor to Article IV, Section 14 provided: “[President Pro Tempore’s] Office of Senator shall become vacant when he becomes Lieutenant Governor, and shall be filled by election as any other vacancy in the Senate.” <em>Lawless, </em><a href="/a2d/789/0820-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="789 A.2d 820" data-case-ids="9401758" data-case-paths="/a2d/789/0820-01">789 A.2d at </a>829 (citing VII <em>Debates of the Constitutional Convention </em>(1873) at 445 (Singerly, 1873)). Based on the history of the pre-enactment revisions to the predecessor of Article IV, Section 14, as well as the language of that provision, the court held that the Pennsylvania Constitution “compels the President <em>pro tempore </em>to resign his senatorial seat only if he becomes Governor.” <em><a href="/a2d/789/0820-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="789 A.2d 820" data-case-ids="9401758" data-case-paths="/a2d/789/0820-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/789/0820-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="789 A.2d 820" data-case-ids="9401758" data-case-paths="/a2d/789/0820-01">at 829</a> (emphasis in original).</p>

To hold that the position of Senator is an “office” of the Commonwealth would, according to the Commonwealth Court, place Article II, Section 6 and Article IV, Section 6 in conflict with Article II, Section 9 (requiring the President Pro Tempore to perform duties of Lieutenant <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>Governor in the Senate when Lieutenant Governor is absent), and Article IV, Section 14. Additionally, the Commonwealth Court noted that other provisions in the Constitution distinguish between members of the General Assembly and “officers” of the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Article II, Section 7 (“[n]o person hereafter convicted of embezzlement of public moneys, bribery, perjury or other infamous crime, shall be eligible to the General Assembly, or capable of holding any office of trust or profit in this Commonwealth”); <em>see also </em>Article VI, Section 3 (“Senators, Representatives and all judicial, State and county officers shall, before entering on the duties of their respective offices, take and subscribe the following oath.... ”). Finally, the Commonwealth Court noted that only the Senate has the power to judge the qualifications of its members, <em>see </em>Article II, Section 9, and to expel one of its members, <em>see </em>Article II, Section 11. <em>Lawless, </em><a href="/a2d/789/0820-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="789 A.2d 820" data-case-ids="9401758" data-case-paths="/a2d/789/0820-01">789 A.2d at 831</a>.</p>
