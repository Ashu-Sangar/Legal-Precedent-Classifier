Bell, commenced a civil action asserting claims against Appellees, Joseph A. Slezak, M.D. and his professional corporation (collectively, “Dr. Slezak”), and others. The central averments of the complaint alleged medical malpractice on the part of Appellees during the course of Mrs. Bell’s treatment for abdominal conditions. In settlement negotiations supervised by the common pleas court, the parties consummated an agreement pursuant to which the Bells would receive $500,000 in exchange for a joint tortfeasor release. Of this amount, $200,000 represented the limits of a policy of malpractice insurance which Dr. Slezak maintained with PIC Insurance Group (“PIC”), and $300,000 was to be the responsibility of the Pennsylvania Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>Fund (the “CAT Fund”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Although PIC was not a party to the agreement, Dr. Slezak’s agreement was made with the clear understanding that the policy limits would be furnished by the carrier. Prior, to the disbursement of settlement funds, however, the Commonwealth Court issued an order placing PIC in liquidation in accordance with the liquidation provisions of the Insurance Department Act, 40 P.S. §§ 221.1-221.63. Such order triggered certain statutory obligations on the part of Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (“PPCIGA” or “the Association”), pursuant to the Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which are a primary subject of this appeal.</p>

Although PPCIGA’s statutory obligations include payment of certain covered claims arising out of the insolvency of property and casualty insurers, <em>see </em>40 P.S. § 991.1803(b)(1), it, too, refused to provide the $200,000; it claimed that under the non-duplication of recovery provision of the PPCIGA Act, 40 P.S. § 991.1817(a), which prescribes that “[a]ny amount payable on a covered claim under this act shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under other insurance,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> it was entitled to offset medical expenses paid by <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>the Bells’ health insurer, Capital Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Further, since such payments exceeded $200,000 and thus also the limits of the underlying PIC policy, PPCIGA took the position that any obligation on its part to make payment was extinguished.</p>
    <p id="b421-5" data-blocks='[["BL_421.6",421,[164,587,1153,739]]]'>The Bells filed a petition to enforce the settlement, seeking the $200,000 payment and contending that Dr. Slezak was responsible in the event that PPCIGA did not contribute the funds. Dr. Slezak opposed the petition, emphasizing PIC’s contemplated role in terms of funding the settlement, which he contended was assumed by PPCIGA per its enabling statute. He contended that PPCIGA’s entitlement to invoke the non-duplication of recovery provision in the present circumstances was an open issue pending before the Commonwealth Court, and that enforcement of the settlement agreement against him would be inequitable since, <em>inter alia, </em>he had tendered all required premiums to PIC and the CAT Fund and was an “innocent victim” of the circumstances resulting in PIC’s liquidation.</p>
    <p id="b421-6" data-blocks='[["BL_421.7",421,[163,1352,1152,847]]]'>In granting relief on the Bells’ petition, the common pleas court noted, preliminarily, that PIC was neither a named party to the Bells’ civil action nor referenced in the correspondence reflecting the parties’ settlement. The court then applied conventional contract principles to conclude that the agreement was a valid one and remained fully enforceable after PIC’s insolvency. Thus, although acknowledging the parties’ awareness of PIC’s involvement as Dr. Slezak’s insurer, the common pleas court simply did not deem this awareness to be material to its disposition of the petition, particularly where the parties had not memorialized an intention that Dr. Slezak should be relieved of his obligation to present the settlement funds in the event that his insurer became insolvent. In effectively weighing the circumstances of the case in view of the express policy of the PPCIGA statute, the court explained as follows:</p>

However, in a situation where either an innocent claimant or an innocent policyholder stands to suffer a financial loss as a result of the insolvency of an insurer, it is the policyholder that should bear the loss. The plaintiff had no relationship with the now insolvent insurer and had no reason in the preparation of the settlement agreement, to attempt to protect themselves from the insolvency of the insurer. The result referred to must occur in order to protect at least one member of the protected class (claimants and policyholders) from suffering any financial loss. In this way the public policy expressed in the statute of attempting to protect claimants from financial loss as a result of the insolvency of an insurer will be carried out.</blockquote>

Additionally, since the Bells were non-parties with respect to the contractual relationship between Dr. Slezak and PIC, the common pleas court expressed doubt as to whether the Bells were “claimants” for purposes of PPCIGA, such that the non-duplication of recovery provision was even implicated by virtue of their health insurance recovery. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 991.1817(a).</p>

The majority examined and rejected the Bells’ argument (and the common pleas court’s conclusion) that, as between an innocent injured and a tortfeasor, any loss should reside with the tortfeasor, concluding that there simply was no loss in the present circumstances, since, by definition, the non-duplication of recovery provision applies only in instances in which the claimant has already received a recovery. <em>See <a href="/a2d/773/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="773 A.2d 782" data-case-ids="11092133" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0782-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/773/0782-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="773 A.2d 782" data-case-ids="11092133" data-case-paths="/a2d/773/0782-01">at 791</a> (“In fact it is not the plaintiffs who bear the loss, rather, if any loss can be said to have occurred, it is the solvent insurers who paid plaintiffs’ claims under the other source of insurance, which the Act requires to be exhausted first.”).

Jurisdictions are divided concerning this question. <em>See supra. </em>Having surveyed the approaches, however, we are persuaded by the assessment of the New Hampshire Supreme Court in <em>Piteo, </em><a href="/citations/?q=705%20A.2d%201190" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="705 A.2d 1190">705 A.2d at 1190</a>, in which the court determined that the term “covered claim” refers to both the first- and third-party claims. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=705%20A.2d%201190" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="705 A.2d 1190">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=705%20A.2d%201190" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="705 A.2d 1190">at 1193</a>.

For example, the PPCIGA Act includes within the definition of “covered claim” claims for unearned premiums, <em>see </em>40 P.S. § 991.1802, which obviously are reposited in insureds.

My position is opposite the majority’s, however, as concerns the obligations of settling defendants in a tort action and PPCIGA’s surrogate responsibilities in relation to such settlements. Centrally, I believe that, in furtherance of the aim of ameliorating hardship to claimants and policyholders attributable to insurer insolvencies, the statutory scheme devised by the General Assembly expressly requires PPCIGA to fund settlements of the kind presently before the Court, thus effectively restoring the parties to the tort litigation to the position that they would have occupied but for the insurer insolvency, while maintaining the integrity of (and preserving incentives to enter) settlements. My reasoning follows.</p>

Presumably, it is also intended that the defendants should nonetheless enjoy the benefit of the under-funded settlement, namely, release from any underlying liability in tort. The majority does not ground such conclusions in any substantive provision of the PPCIGA Act, but rather, references as support only the enactment’s guiding policy. Although I recognize that it is necessary to bear in mind the policies giving rise to legislation, I believe that it is equally essential for the judiciary to respect the manner by which the General Assembly has sought to effectuate its stated purposes by implementing the policies via application of the substantive terms of the statute. Courts should therefore take care to evaluate the mechanics of a statute before reaching broad conclusions concerning what must be done to implement the salient policy aims.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> While I return to <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>the policy perspective below, at this juncture I merely note that the majority’s decision to reorder the relationship of the parties to the underlying tort litigation and settlement at the outset of its opinion has a profound effect on its analysis of the PPCIGA Act’s provisions which ultimately follows.</p>

Notably, the legislation contains no reference to, and no attempt to govern, the outcome of litigation among prospective claimants outside the administrative setting — in particular, it is solely in the context of the distinct, administrative claims process that the non-duplication of recovery provision at issue here has relevance on its terms. <em>See generally Panea v.

Facially, as noted, the PPCIGA Act administers third-party claims primarily by affording PPCIGA defenses that would have been available to the insolvent insurer, not by extension of the non-duplication of recovery provision to disturb consensual or adversarial resolution of controversies outside the scope of the statutory claims process. Moreover, the overall objectives of the statute (protection of the interests of both claimants and policyholders) are furthered by applying the express terms of the statute to require PPCIGA to fund settlements in the same manner as was expected of the insurer prior to its insolvency in circumstances in which the policyholder (who is the only party asserting a claim against PPCIGA) has no duplicate source of recovery.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a> Implementa<a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>tion of the majority’s paradigm gives rise to claims for rescission of settlements and substantially diminishes incentives on the part of plaintiffs to compromise their claims in instances in which the insurer insolvency pre-dates settlement by eliminating an essential source of funding.</p>

Nevertheless, here I conclude that the controlling terms of the statute are adequately clear, and PPCIGA’s course' of action sufficiently far beyond the bounds of its mandate, to warrant the contrary interpretation.</p>

In this regard, the allusion of <em>amicus, </em>The Pennsylvania Medical Society, to a windfall on the part of the Bells is inapt.

The non-duplication of recovery provision plainly operates to relieve PPCIGA of responsibility for payment of claims possessed by those with a direct claim or right of action against the insolvent insured who also possess a collateral source of recovery; in this regard, the provision also serves the salutary purposes of the statute. Therefore, and in light of the General Assembly's decision to afford PPCIGA all defenses available to the insolvent insured in relation to covered claims, I do not find the arguments relative to <em>Burke </em>controlling.</p>
