The Commonwealth maintains that the Act’s extraterritorial term should be given the same effect as that of the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8953, which permits municipal officers to make extraterritorial arrests, <em>inter alia, </em>for offenses involving breach of peace, when on “official business.” <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8953(a)(5). The Commonwealth also argues that, if this Court were to find a requirement to establish some nexus to transportation system business or its ridership as a condition to the lawful exercise of a Port Authority police officer’s extraterritorial jurisdiction, such requirement is satisfied in the present circumstances, because Firman nearly struck a Port Authority vehicle, thus creating an imminent threat to authority personnel and property.</p>

Consistent with the dissent’s reasoning, we find this interpretation to be supported by: the plain terms of the Act; reference to the specialized meaning of transportation system business determined by reference to the Second Class County Port Authority Act, <em>see </em>55 P.S. § 552(13); and the policy underlying the Act, namely, the maintenance of security of the transportation system and its charges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

We acknowledge the Commonwealth’s argument analogizing the Act's provisions to municipal police jurisdiction; however, as noted above, the extraterritorial jurisdiction of municipal police officers is also of a limited variety, constrained according to prescribed circumstances. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8953. This also supports reading the Act’s extraterritorial provision as more particularly directed to specialized function <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>than is the "official business” requirement contained within one subset of the circumstances enabling extraterritorial powers of municipal police. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8953(a)(5).</p>
      <p id="b702-7" data-blocks='[["BL_702.2",702,[306,1133,1134,919]]]'>We do not dispute the concurring opinion’s position that a Port Authority policeman can fairly be considered to be acting within the scope of transportation system business while he is affirmatively in the act of traveling between duty locations. The question presented on review of the Superior Court's opinion, however, is whether this status is maintained when the officer diverts from his assigned task of traveling to the new duty location because he has observed a violation or offense potentially unrelated to transportation system business and removed from Port Authority property. Under the express provisions of the statute, the officer’s general police powers simply are not implicated in such circumstances, since the extraterritorial encounter must itself be within the scope of the officer’s duties in pursuit of transportation system business. <em>See 22 </em>Pa.C.S. § 3303(a) (authorizing the exercise of police powers solely "while engaged in the discharge of their duties in pursuit of railroad, street railway or transportation system business”). Transportation system business has not been defined so broadly by the General Assembly as to encompass broad, general enforcement of the Motor Vehicle and/or Criminal Codes extraterritorially by an on-duty transportation system officer enroute to a patrol assignment, as the concurrence suggests. The specific "in pursuit of transportation system business” limitation on the officers’ extraterritorial powers thus confirms that the Legislature did not intend for authority resources to be directed to such ends absent the requisite connection to authority interests.</p>

This is not to say that the Act authorizes statewide hot pursuit by transportation system police. Significantly, the provision enabling municipal police power to engage in hot pursuit is limited to offenses committed within the officer's primary jurisdiction, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8953(a)(2), and it is evident that the Legislature did not intend for <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>Port Authority police to have greater authority than municipal police. Here, however, it appears that the transportation system officer reasonably committed to break off the encounter due to Firman's excessive rate of speed, but was nonetheless able to overtake Firman because of delaying traffic conditions. <em>See </em>N.T., Feb. 16, 2000, at 4, R.R. at 14a.</p>

Moreover, insofar as Officer Porter was performing a function of his position, I view him as having been on “transportation system business”, and, therefore, I disagree with the majority’s reference to Officer Porter’s “mere ‘on-duty5 status” and the role that the majority envisions this phrase to play when the courts construe Section 3303(a)’s extraterritorial jurisdiction standard hereafter.
