Epps’s children, nine-year-old Philip and seven-year-old Desiree, were standing with Epps at the time and witnessed the shooting. Both Philip and Desiree told police that the shooter was a man they knew as “Mr. Steve,” who had been living with their family for over a month. Both children identified Appellant from a photograph as “Mr. Steve.” On January 1, 1998, Appellant was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, and charged with the murder and related offenses.</p>
    <p id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[165,943,1153,792]]]'>At trial, Philip testified that on the day of the shooting, Epps and Appellant met Philip and Desiree at their after-school center. Philip witnessed his mother and Appellant arguing. Philip testified that when Epps and the children left the center in Epps’s car, Appellant followed them in his black Lexus. During the ride, Epps gave Philip a quarter to call his aunt to tell her that Appellant was following them. After both cars arrived at Epps’s apartment building, Philip again saw his mother and Appellant arguing. He testified that after the argument ended, Appellant followed his mother, his sister, and him into the building. Philip testified that, once inside the building, Appellant shot at his mother four or five times as they were waiting for the elevator. According to the medical examiner, two of those bullets struck Epps, one in the head and one in the abdomen.</p>

Green testified that he had seen Appellant driving a black Lexus in the past. After observing the car leaving, Green saw Philip and Desiree running toward him, calling for help because their mother had been shot. Green helped the children call the police from a convenience store. One of the responding officers, who brought the children’s father to the scene of the crime, testified that when the children saw their father, they ran up <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>to him, and Desiree told him that “Mr. Steve” shot her mother.</p>

Pugh stated that Epps had called her on Friday, September 12, 1997, sounding upset. That same day, Epps went over to Pugh’s house and told Pugh that Appellant had slapped her and that she was so upset she did not want to speak to him. During their conversation, Appellant paged Epps and when she called him back, she told him that her sister was going to help with a party scheduled for Desiree and that he need not attend. Pugh further testified that later that night, she and Epps went to their parents’ home, where Epps told her parents what happened. While they were there, Appellant arrived. Even though Appellant was told that Epps wasn’t there, he nonetheless attempted, unsuccessfully, to enter the residence. After Appellant finally left, Epps went to a hotel to spend the night. According to Pugh, Epps went to secure a protection from abuse order the next day but did not complete the application because she was concerned about the effect it would have on her pending divorce and custody case. Pugh testified that at some point during the weekend, Epps vowed not to be physically abused by Appellant or anyone else. Finally, Pugh testified that Epps told her that when Appellant came to pick up his clothes the day before the shooting, he tried to “force himself on” her.</p>

Fischer also testified that Tucker said she had a protection from abuse order against Appellant and was concerned that Appellant was going to “come and get” her.</p>

Following a penalty phase hearing, the jury found one aggravating circumstance, i.e., creation of a grave risk of death to another person in the course of the crime,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and no mitigating circumstances, and returned a verdict of death for the murder conviction.

Again, as detailed above, both Philip and Desiree Epps testified that Appellant, after arguing with their mother, followed them into their apartment building and repeatedly shot their mother while they were standing with her waiting for the elevator. The children immediately identified the shooter as “Mr. Steve,” to both the police and their father, and both children identified Appellant as the shooter from a photograph. The children were clearly familiar with Appellant, as he had been dating their mother for almost a year and, in fact, had been living with them for more than a month. The Commonwealth also presented the testimony of Eugene Green, who had previously seen Appellant driving a black Lexus which looked like the Lexus Green saw pulling out of the parking lot of Epps’s apartment building immediately before Philip and Desiree came running up to him, calling for help because their mother had just been shot. In addition to the overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt, we also note that Pugh’s testimony that Epps told her that Appellant hit her was substantially similar to the untainted testimony from Captain Keaveney that Epps had sought a protection from abuse order against a man named Steven Marshall, which is the name several witnesses testified that Appellant used. Given the overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt, and that the challenged testimony was merely cumulative of other evidence properly admitted at trial, any error in admitting Pugh’s testimony regarding Epps’s statement that Appellant hit her was harmless.</p>

The evidence showed that, the weekend after the argument during which appellant struck Epps, she attempted to sever all ties with appellant by hiding from appellant, changing the locks at her apartment, and considering filing a petition for a protection from abuse order. Epps also rejected unwanted sexual advances made by appellant while he was retrieving his belongings from her apartment on September 15, 1997, the day before he shot her. Epps’s statements to her sister, including the statement which appellant now challenges, were relevant to explain the progression of events leading up to her murder, as well as to suggest motive, malice, and ill will. I continue to agree with cases such as <em>Chandler, </em>the case relied upon by the trial judge, that statements such as these are admissible under the state of mind exception because they are probative of “the presence of ill will, malice, or motive for the killing.” 721 A.2d at 1045.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Since the trial court’s ruling unquestionably was correct under our governing precedent concerning the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, the Court should expressly so hold.</p>

Here, evidence independent of the statements made by Stephanie Epps to her sister shortly before the murder made clear that appellant elected to “confront” his former paramour with a .45 caliber gun in the lobby of her apartment building. This out-of-court confrontation ended when appellant shot at Stephanie Epps no less than four times in front of her very young children, hitting her twice — once in the head and once in the abdomen — and killing her. Having caused Epps’s unavailability by murdering her, I would hold that appellant has received all of the confrontation to which he is entitled, and has waived any objection to the introduction of his victim’s relevant out-of-court statements.</p>
