Miller and Harry I. Shreiner (Taxpayers) appeal from the order of the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed the decision of the State Charter School Appeal Board (CAB). The CAB had granted a charter to Collegium Charter School (Collegium) and reversed the contrary decision of the West Chester Area School District Board of School Directors (District Board). The CAB further denied the Taxpayers’ petition to intervene. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court in all respects.</p>
    <p id="b591-6" data-blocks='[["BL_591.6",591,[165,1168,1160,957]]]'>On November 13, 1998, Collegium, a nonprofit Pennsylvania corporation, submitted a charter school application to the District Board. A charter school is defined under the CSL as an independent, nonprofit, public school established and operated under a charter from the local board of school directors and in which students are enrolled or attend. 24 P.S. § 17-1703-A. Collegium’s application requested a five-year charter pursuant to the CSL. It indicated that Collegium intended to enter into a management agreement with Mosaica Education, Inc. (Mosaica), a for-profit corporation, under which Mosaica would provide the school with educational and administrative services. It further stated that Mosaica would provide the initial funding to acquire and renovate an existing high school building and then lease it back to Collegium. Consistent with the CSL, Collegium proposed to be governed by a board of trustees, consisting of parents and community members that will have the authority to decide matters relating to the operation of the school. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 17-1716-A.(a).</p>

The Paragon Curriculum uses an interdisciplinary approach that combines history, social studies, anthropology, science, literature, the arts, character education and music. The program differed from that provided by the School District in that Collegium proposed a full day kindergarten, a longer school year (200 instead of 180 days), one hour per day more instructional time and foreign language instruction for all students beginning in kindergarten. The program also provided for student accountability measured by a national standardized test administered twice a year and individualized personal learning plans for each child.</p>

It rejected the evidence in support of increased pupil learning as speculative. The District Board noted that although Collegium may provide some parents a “choice,” it would be at the expense of either an increased tax burden on the School District taxpayers or a reduction in services to the existing public school systems.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> It further found that since Collegium anticipates enrolling students from surrounding school districts, it should have applied for a regional charter. The District Board also opposed the relationship between Collegium and Mosaica, finding that the nonprofit prohibition in the CSL should not be circumvented by the organizational structure proposed by Collegium.</p>
    <p id="b593-4" data-blocks='[["BL_593.5",593,[168,1171,1154,422]]]'>Based on these findings, the District Board denied the application, concluding that “[bjecause the Collegium proposal will not improve pupil learning, increase learning opportunities for all pupils and encourage the use of different innovative teaching methods which will be an improvement over that which already exists in the School District, the legislative intent of the Act has not been fulfilled.” District Board Opinion at 15.</p>

      <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>Collegium then sought to appeal the District Board’s denial. To be eligible to do so, the CSL requires the charter school applicant to file a petition containing the requisite number of resident signatures in the court of common pleas of the county in which the charter school would be located. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 17-1717-A.(i)(2). In accordance with this provision, Collegium filed its “Petition to Appeal” in the Chester County Common Pleas Court. Taxpayers subsequently filed a petition to intervene in the proceedings as taxpaying residents of adjacent school districts likely to be affected by Collegium’s student recruitment. The trial court granted the petition to intervene. A hearing was held to determine the sufficiency of Collegium’s petition to appeal pursuant to Section 17-1717-A.(i)(5) of the CSL.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> On June 4, 1999, the trial court deemed the petition sufficient and certified that it conformed to the requirements of the CSL.</p>
    <p id="b594-4" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[281,1200,1163,581]]]'>On July 1, 1999, Collegium then filed its appeal with the CAB. On that same date, the CAB held its first public meeting and appointed a hearing officer. Taxpayers thereafter filed a petition to intervene, which the CAB denied in a pre-hearing order. The parties submitted briefs and oral argument was conducted. On August 27,1999, the CAB voted to reverse the District Board’s decision to deny Collegium’s charter school application and direct the District Board to grant the application and sign Collegium’s charter pursuant to Section 17-1720-A.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The CAB further reaffirmed its decision to deny Taxpayers’ petition to intervene.</p>

Initially, the CAB rejected the School District’s <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>contention that Collegium’s petition to appeal should be quashed as premature or dismissed as waived. It also rejected the School District’s contention that the CAB’s standard of review was that of an appellate court. The CAB concluded that Section 17-1716-A.(6) requires it to give “due consideration” to the District Board’s findings and articulate its reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with those findings.</p>
    <p id="b595-4" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[165,696,1157,722]]]'>On the merits of the appeal, the CAB found that Collegium demonstrated sustainable support for the charter school from parents, community members and students, notwithstanding the fact that the district teachers opposed the application. The CAB concluded that the contents of the application conformed to the legislative intent outlined in the CSL and that Collegium will serve as a model school because of its innovative curriculum and school schedule. It found that the fact that a charter school intends to enroll students from other districts does not require the applicant to apply for a regional charter. Rather, it stated that applicants for charter schools may select whether they are seeking a regional or a single district charter, depending on where the facility will be located.</p>
    <p id="b595-5" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[163,1451,1157,626]]]'>Regarding the proposed contractual relationship between Collegium and Mosaica, the CAB found that the CSL does not prohibit a charter school from contracting with a for-profit entity to provide services to the charter school as long as the trustees of the charter school maintain ultimate control of the school. It found no evidence establishing that the contract with Mosaica, if implemented, would deprive the trustees of ultimate control of Collegium. It further addressed the Taxpayers’ petition to intervene. It concluded that as taxpayers from an adjacent school district, they possessed no statutory right and had no other interest that would confer upon them a right to intervene in the proceeding.</p>

That same day, the School District moved for a stay of the decision, which the CAB denied.

On August 30, 1999, the School District filed a petition for review in Commonwealth Court, noting its uncertainty as to whether the ten-day triggering event was the CAB vote to reverse the District Board or the CAB’s written decision. Nevertheless, the District Board did not sign the charter by September 7, 1999, which was ten days after the CAB vote.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[281,855,1160,466]]]'>As a result, Collegium requested that CAB Chairman, Eugene W. Hickock, sign the charter. In response, the District Board forwarded Chairman Hickock a “conditional charter” signed by the District Board that differed significantly from the provisions of the charter application. On September 29, 1999, Chairman Hickock signed Collegium’s charter. The charter stated that the board of trustees must operate the school in accordance with the CSL and in conformity with the application submitted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

As to the appropriate standard of review, the Commonwealth Court found that Section 17-1717-A.(i)(6) of the CSL provides for <em>de novo </em>review by the CAB. It held that by giving the CAB the right to disagree with the District Board and requiring it to specifically articulate its reasons for doing so, the General Assembly has unquestionably granted the CAB the authority to substitute its own <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>findings and independent judgment for that of the local school board.</p>
    <p id="b597-4" data-blocks='[["BL_597.4",597,[163,424,1154,725]]]'>The Commonwealth Court also agreed with the CAB that the CSL does not require Collegium to seek a regional charter merely because it intended to recruit students who do not reside in the district. It relied on provisions of the CSL that allow the charter school to enroll non-resident students on a space-available basis, 24 P.S. § 17-1723-A.(c), and permit all resident children in this Commonwealth to attend a charter school. 24 P.S. § 17-1723-A.(a). Regarding the Taxpayer’s Petition to Intervene, the court held that the CSL does not afford the Taxpayers the right to participate in the appeal process. It found that the Taxpayer’s claimed harm, <em>i.e., </em>increased taxes or decreased educational services, is based solely on speculation and that Taxpayer’s interests are too remote and indirect to warrant intervention.</p>
    <p id="b597-5" data-blocks='[["BL_597.5",597,[162,1181,1153,618]]]'>The Commonwealth Court also rejected the School District’s claim that Collegium is a mere shell for Mosaica, a for-profit entity, rather than a nonprofit corporation. It noted that the CSL grants charter schools all powers necessary for carrying out its charter, including the express power to acquire real property by purchase or lease and the power to make contracts and leases for the procurement of services, equipment and supplies. 24 P.S. §§ 17-1714-A.(a)(3) and 17-1714-A.(a)(5). It agreed with the CAB that there is no evidence to indicate that the proposed agreement between Collegium and Mosaica would deprive Collegium’s trustees of the ultimate control of the school.</p>

Initially, it held that the ten day period for the District Board to grant the charter pursuant to Section 17 — 1717—A.(i)(9) began to run on August 27, 1999, when the CAB voted to reverse the District Board’s decision and the School District received actual notice of that decision, as opposed to September 8, 1999, when the District Board received the CAB’s written opinion and reversal order. The court concluded that the District Board did not <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>sign the charter within ten days of August 27, 1999, and therefore Chairman Hickock was statutorily required to do so. Alternatively, it held that the charter that the District Board eventually submitted to Chairman Hickock was invalid as it contained conditions that were inconsistent with the CSL.</p>

Appellants argue that the Commonwealth Court erroneously interpreted Section 17-1717 — A.(i)(6) of the CSL as authorizing the CAB to create new findings of fact while conducting a <em>de novo </em>review<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> of the District Board’s record.

They contend that <em>de novo </em>review would result in the CAB giving <em>no consideration </em>to the District Board’s findings, a result inconsistent with the statutory discretion granted to local school boards. According to Appellants, the CAB only retains “original jurisdiction” over a charter school application when the District Board fails to act. It relies on Section 17-1717-A.(g), which provides that a local board’s failure to act on an application allows the applicant to file its charter school application as an appeal to the CAB, with the CAB evaluating the application based on the same statutory criteria utilized by the local board. Thus, Appellants maintain that although Section 17-1717-A.(g) gives the CAB “original jurisdiction,” Section 17-1717-A.(i)(6) does not.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

      <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>Appellants’ claims are not persuasive. The plain language of the CSL directs the CAB to specifically articulate its reasons for “agreeing or disagreeing” with the District Board’s findings. Simply stated, substantial evidence review does not involve agreement or disagreement with findings. <em>See, e.g. Bullock v. Building Maintenance, Inc., </em>6 Pa.Cmwlth. 539, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20520" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="297 A.2d 520">297 A.2d 520</a>, 522 (1972) (stating that whether the appellate court agrees or disagrees with the board’s finding of fact, the court has no power to set aside the board’s findings if there is substantial evidence to support them). Further, Section 17-1717-A.(i)(6) grants the CAB discretion to permit the parties to supplement the record with previously unavailable information. Such directive is inconsistent with traditional appellate review. Moreover, the CSL specifically articulates that “[a]ll decisions of the appeal board shall be subject to appellate review <em>by the Commonwealth Court.” </em>24 P.S. § 17-1717-A.(i)(10) (emphasis added). Had the Legislature intended the CAB to also utilize an appellate standard of review, it could have similarly provided. Finally, we note that the composition of the CAB supports a finding of <em>de novo </em>review. The CAB is not comprised of attorneys capable of conducting a legal examination of the evidence, but rather consists of persons who have a perspective on public education. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 17-1721-A.(a) (stating composition of CAB as: a parent, a school board member, a certified teacher, a faculty or administrative employee, a business person, and a member of State Board of Education).</p>

In fact, the order to grant Collegium’s charter binds only the School District; it does not require students from Taxpayers’ school districts to attend Collegium. Although Collegium intends to recruit students from Taxpayers’ school districts, there is no assurance that any <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>particular number of students will actually choose to attend Collegium. Moreover, even if students from outside the School District do attend Collegium, there is no proof that the loss of students will have an adverse financial impact on Taxpayers’ districts. Finally, even assuming that Taxpayers’ school districts suffer such financial consequences, there is no way of determining whether the added costs would be extensive enough to require the local school boards in Taxpayers’ districts to either raise taxes or reduce services. In short, ordering a school district to grant a charter to a charter school will not directly affect Taxpayers. The students in Taxpayers’ school districts still decide for themselves if they wish to enroll at Collegium, and the local board of directors in each school district determines whether taxes will be raised, whether there will be a reduction in services or both. These decisions are not made by the CAB.</blockquote>

The Commonwealth Court has aptly noted that there is not one procedure that constitutes <em>de novo </em>review. Rather, particular statutes set forth procedures that run the gamut from excluding all previous testimony to permitting the adjudicator, in his or her discretion, to receive no additional testimony. <em>Cordorus Stone &amp; Supply Co., Inc., v.

Furthermore, I note that it is only with the participation of all of the school districts from which the charter school intends to actively recruit students that there can be a meaningful assessment as to whether the charter school will advance the CSL’s purpose to, among other things, “improve pupil learning,” “increase learning opportunities,” and “encourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods” in each of the specifically targeted districts. 24 P.S. § 17-1702-A; <em>see also </em>24 P.S. § 1717-A.(e)(2)(iii) (requiring school boards to “evaluate the extent to which the charter application ... conforms to the legislative intent outlined in section 1702-A”).</p>

I fail to see the significance of either of these findings to the majority’s holding. First, that a regional charter school is only required to physically file its charter application in the district in which it will be located in no way impacts on the rights of certain other school districts to consider and vote on the application pursuant to section 17 — 1718—A.(b). In addition, with respect to the majority’s comments regarding accountability, I note that the issue currently before the court is not whether the school districts served by a regional charter school have the right to monitor the school’s performance after the charter has been granted, but rather whether such school districts have the right to initially consider and <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>vole on the charter application.

Under the majority's interpretation, a charter school could locate immediately within the border of a school district from which it expects very little community resistance. After obtaining a charter from that district, it could focus its recruiting efforts in a neighboring district, and, in fact, enroll the majority of its students from that neighboring district. As the local charter school application process does not require that the effects on neighboring districts be considered, there is nothing to guard against this arrangement having a devastating effect on the neighboring district. In essence, the majority permits charter school applicants to forum shop for the most charter school-friendly school board, without regard for those communities that the school will actually affect. I simply do not believe that the General Assembly intended such a result.</p>
