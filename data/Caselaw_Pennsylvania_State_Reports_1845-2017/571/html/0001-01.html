However, Appellant’s claim fails because as even Appellant himself concedes, his consent given to Trooper Sheppard during the afternoon of December 27 was not causally linked to Appellant’s detention that morning by Trooper Volchako. <em>See </em>App’t Br., at 14. Shortly after Trooper Volchako stopped Appellant, Trooper Sheppard released him, told him about the deaths of his estranged wife and stepdaughter, arranged to meet him at the Barracks at 2:00 p.m., and allowed him to freely leave the scene. Nonetheless, Appellant proceeded to the crime scene, where the presence of the police was apparent, and exited his truck.

We disagree. There is no indication in the record that the troopers used any physical force or otherwise coerced Appellant at the crime scene or at the Barracks. Upon seeing Appellant at the crime scene, the troopers simply approached him and asked him whether he wanted to go to the Barracks with them rather than meet them there later that afternoon, as previously scheduled. On the way to the Barracks and again once they arrived at the Barracks, Trooper Sheppard informed <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>Appellant that he did not have to speak with them and that he would be taken back to his truck whenever he wanted.

According to the Commonwealth, such evidence was relevant to establish Appellant’s motive for killing Carla and Deidra because it showed that a pattern existed in Carla’s relationship with Appellant whereby criminal charges were filed against Appellant based on his conduct towards Carla and Carla would subsequently seek to have the charges dropped because she was persuaded by Appellant to do so. Thus, the Commonwealth claimed that such evidence tended to establish that Appellant killed Carla and Deidra because they would not force the indecent assault charges pending against Appellant to be dropped, as Carla had done previously with the other criminal charges filed against Appellant. The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth that evidence of the fact that criminal charges were previously filed against Appellant and later dropped due to Carla's request was relevant to support the Commonwealth’s theory of Appellant’s motive.

The evidence sufficiently established that both Deidra and Carla would be testifying during the criminal trial in which Appellant was charged with the felony of aggravated indecent assault, <em>see </em>N.T., 10/6/98, at 187-88, 226, N.T., 10/12/98, at 842, and Appellant killed them in order to prevent them from testifying during that trial, <em>see </em>N.T., 10/6/98, at 197-98. <em>See </em>42 Pa. § 9711(d)(5). Further, we conclude that the evidence showed that Appellant killed both Carla and Deidra during the course of the felony of burglary, in that he unlawfully entered Carla’s home with the intent of killing Carla and Deidra. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3502; 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6). Finally, the evidence showed that Appellant was convicted of the first-degree murder of Deidra, which was committed at the time of the murder of Carla and for which a sentence of death is imposable. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10). Likewise, the evidence established that Appellant was convicted of the first-degree murder of Carla, which was committed at the time of the murder of Deidra, for which a sentence of <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>death is imposable. <em>See id. </em>We therefore affirm Appellant’s convictions and judgment of sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_44" id="ref_footnote_1_44">44</a>

Appellant, however, refused to waive his attorney client privilege to allow Mr. Trambley to testify and therefore, the trial court prohibited him from testifying. <em><a href="/a2d/718/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="148" data-cite="718 A.2d 788" data-case-ids="11687988" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0788-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/718/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="148" data-cite="718 A.2d 788" data-case-ids="11687988" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0788-01">at 909</a>. Appellant's trial counsel then attempted to call Abrahm Martin Hostetter and Neil Blumberg, two psychiatrists who had examined Appellant and testified during the competency proceedings, in order to establish that Appellant suffered from a mental illness. <em><a href="/a2d/718/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="149" data-cite="718 A.2d 788" data-case-ids="11687988" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0788-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/718/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="149" data-cite="718 A.2d 788" data-case-ids="11687988" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0788-01">at 910</a>. Nonetheless, because Appellant notified the trial court that he did not want the psychiatrists to testify, the trial court precluded them from doing so. <em><a href="/a2d/718/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="718 A.2d 788" data-case-ids="11687988" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0788-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/718/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="718 A.2d 788" data-case-ids="11687988" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0788-01">at 915-17</a>. At that point in the hearing, Appellant informed trial counsel that he did not want him to present any more evidence or argue during his closing argument that he suffered from a mental illness. <em><a href="/a2d/718/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="718 A.2d 788" data-case-ids="11687988" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0788-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/718/0788-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="718 A.2d 788" data-case-ids="11687988" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0788-01">at 917</a>.

We point out that the jury did find one mitigating circumstance presented by trial counsel on behalf of Appellant, that Appellant did not have a prior criminal history. We further note that while the evidence presented by trial counsel meant to show that Appellant suffered from a mental illness may have portrayed Appellant in a bad light, trial counsel had a reasonable basis for presenting such evidence. Trial counsel intended to present the testimony from Appellant’s friends and former co-workers along with the testimony of the two psychiatrists who examined Appellant to show that Appellant’s actions were indicative of a mental illness for the catch-all mitigating factor. <em>See </em>N.T., 10/12/98, at 895-96, 917. However, because Appellant decided in the middle of the penalty phase that he did not want the psychiatrists to testify or trial counsel to argue during closing arguments that Appellant suffered from a mental illness, trial counsel was precluded from effectively making such a presentation. Therefore, because Appellant himself decided to <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>slop trial counsel in the middle of his presentation, trial counsel did not act unreasonably by only presenting hall of the evidence he intended to admit in order to show that Appellant suffered from a mental illness. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Szuchon, </em><a href="/pa/506/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="153" data-cite="506 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1790932" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0228-01">506 Pa. 228</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="506 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1790932" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0228-01">484 A.2d 1365</a>, 1377 (1984) (as counsel’s lack of preparation was result of defendant's actions, counsel not ineffective).</p>
