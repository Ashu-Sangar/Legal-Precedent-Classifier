Approximately one year after separation, on May 12, 1994, Mother filed a Complaint in Divorce in the Court of Common Pleas of Clarion County (trial court) seeking spousal and child support, equitable distribution and custody. In October of 1994, Mother indicated her desire to move to North Carolina with the three children. The parties entered into a stipulation in which, <em>inter alia, </em>Father agreed to the move and to pay directly to Wife $6,000 per month in child support. The stipulation became an Order of Court on October 26,1994. Mother and the children moved to North Carolina shortly thereafter, and Father remained in Clarion County.</p>

One week before the scheduled conciliation, Mother filed a Complaint for Custody in Orange County, North Carolina. On June 13, 1997, she also filed preliminary objections in Clarion County, asserting that Pennsylvania lacked jurisdiction regarding custody. However, on July 10, 1997, the parties reached an interim agreement regarding physical custody of the children that they entered with the Pennsylvania and North Carolina courts. The agreement provided that it did not constitute a wavier of either party’s right to challenge jurisdiction in the Pennsylvania or North Carolina custody proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> On May 13, 1998, Father filed a Petition for Special Relief with the trial court in which he sought partial physical custody of the children. Mother then requested briefing and argument on the preliminary objections that she filed in June of 1997. On June 5, 1998, the trial judge held a telephone conference <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>with the North Carolina judge. They agreed that the Pennsylvania hearing on Father’s request for custody would go forward that day without deciding the issue of jurisdiction. The trial court entered a partial custody order at the June 5, 1998 hearing, and then entertained argument on jurisdiction. By Opinion and Order filed June 12, 1998, the trial court determined that Pennsylvania retained jurisdiction. The court noted that pursuant to the Pennsylvania Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5341-5366 (UCCJA), North Carolina is the home state of the children. However, it held that “it is in the best interest of the children that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania retain continuing jurisdiction in this custody action because father and the children have significant contacts with Pennsylvania, and more significantly, Clarion County provides the optimum access to the relevant evidence concerning the issue at [sic] father’s partial custody.” Trial Court Opinion dated June 12,1998 at 2.</p>

On July 20, 1998, the North Carolina District Court (trial court) issued an Order refusing to consider the motion because it determined that the Pennsylvania Order of June 5, 1998 was entitled to full faith and credit. Mother appealed this decision to the North Carolina Court of Appeals (an intermediate appellate court). While the appeal was pending, Father filed a Motion for Custody Hearing in Pennsylvania, and the matter was scheduled for June 29, 1999. On June 1, 1999, the North Carolina Court of Appeals vacated the July 20, 1998 Order and remanded the matter to the District Court in light of its decision in <em>Potter v.

Mother then sought an immediate continuance of the June 29, 1999 Pennsylvania hearing. Four days before that hearing, on June 25, 1999, the North Carolina District Court entered an Order confirming that it had “jurisdiction over all questions of child custody and visitation in this matter.” Counsel for Mother appeared at the June 29, 1999 hearing in Pennsylvania to argue Mother’s Motion for Continuance. Following argu<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>ment, the trial court determined that Pennsylvania continued to have jurisdiction. Once the court made this decision, counsel for Mother excused herself from the courtroom. The trial court then issued an Order consistent with the parties’ previous custody agreement.</p>

On appeal to this Court, the sole issue raised by Father is whether the PKPA is the controlling authority in determining whether Pennsylvania retains jurisdiction.</p>

First, the Pennsylvania court must decide whether the matter before it acts as a modification to a custody or visitation order of another State that was rendered “consistently with the provisions” of the PKPA. 28 U.S.C.A. § 1783A(a). Assuming these conditions are met, the PKPA requires that then the Pennsylvania court must look to whether it could, absent the out-of-state proceeding assert appropriate jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C.A. § 1783A(f)(l). If, as is the case before us, Pennsylvania is the “home state” of the child, the PKPA allows Pennsylvania to modify the other State’s decree only if that other State “no longer has <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>jurisdiction” or has declined jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C.A. § 1783A(f)(2), (h).

The PKPA provides that the other State would have “continuing jurisdiction” if the initial decree complied with the PKPA at the time the decree was rendered; if under that other State’s law, the State maintains jurisdiction over the decree; and, the other State remained the residency of any of the parties at the time of the Pennsylvania proceeding. 28 U.S.C.A. §§ 1738A(d), 1738A(c)(l).</blockquote>

Gouse, </em><a href="/ga/263/0887-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="263 Ga. 887" data-case-ids="1236836" data-case-paths="/ga/263/0887-01">263 Ga. 887</a>, <a href="/ga/263/0887-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="263 Ga. 887" data-case-ids="1236836" data-case-paths="/ga/263/0887-01">441 S.E.2d 57</a> (1994), the Georgia Supreme Court analyzed the Ohio version of the UCCJA and determined that Ohio did not retain continuing jurisdiction of a custody order, thereby allowing Georgia to modify the Ohio order under the PKPA; in <em>Schwartz v. Schwartz, </em><a href="/sc/311/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="311 S.C. 303" data-case-ids="824711" data-case-paths="/sc/311/0303-01">311 S.C. 303</a>, <a href="/sc/311/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="311 S.C. 303" data-case-ids="824711" data-case-paths="/sc/311/0303-01">428 S.E.2d 748</a> (Ct.App. 1993) the South Carolina Court of Appeals performed a PKPA analysis and held that the California version of the UCCJA did not permit California to retain jurisdiction of a custody matter where the child no longer had significant contacts with that state; and in <em>Quenzer v. Quenzer, </em><a href="/p2d/653/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="653 P.2d 295" data-case-ids="10431186" data-case-paths="/p2d/653/0295-01">653 P.2d 295</a> (Wyo. 1982), when determining whether it could exercise jurisdiction pursuant to the PKPA to modify a Texas custody order, the Wyoming Supreme Court looked to the Wyoming version of the UCCJA.</p>

      <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>Having determined that the PKPA requires the courts of this Commonwealth to engage in a jurisdictional analysis pursuant to Section 5344 of the UCCJA, we must now consider whether the Superior Court erred in reversing the order of the trial court. The trial court held that it was in the best interests of the children for Pennsylvania to retain jurisdiction because Father and the children had significant contacts with this Commonwealth, and “Clarion County provides optimum access to the relevant evidence concerning the issue at [sic] Father’s partial custody.” Memorandum Opinion and Order dated June 12, 1998 at 2. The trial court further stated, “in support of judicial economy, we also adopt as our own, as fully and to the same extent as if set forth verbatim herein, all of defendant’s brief in opposition to plaintiffs preliminary objection.” <em>Id. </em>at 3. In the brief adopted by the trial court, Father notes that he and his new wife reside in Clarion County, as do the paternal grandparents and numerous paternal relatives. Father’s family gas and oil well business is in Clarion County, and Father has significant community ties to the area. Both Mother and the children have friends in Clarion County with whom they have contact. Upon careful review of the record in this case, however, we agree with the Superior Court that there are insufficient facts to support the conclusion of the trial court that the children have significant contacts with Pennsylvania. The children have lived in North Carolina since 1994 and have attended school there since that time. They participate in extra-curricular activities and team sports in North Carolina, and receive all their medical and psychological care there as well. Accordingly, Father did not establish that the children have “a significant connection with this Commonwealth,” as required by Section 5344(a)(2)(i). Furthermore, Father did not establish that “substantial evidence concerning the present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships of the child[ren],” as required by Section 5344(a)(2)(ii), can be found in Clarion County.</p>

In my view, Pennsylvania has continuing jurisdiction; accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>
    <p id="b451-7" data-blocks='[["BL_451.8",451,[161,1420,1157,944]]]'>As the majority aptly notes, jurisdiction in this case hinges on which state has jurisdiction pursuant to the UCCJA. The UCCJA would confer jurisdiction where, <em>inter alia, </em>Pennsylvania is the home state of the child at the time of the commencement of the proceeding. 23 Pa.C.S. § 5344(a)(1)®. However, the UCCJA is silent as to what constitutes “commencement” of a custody action. I am aware that the Superi- or Court has held that, for purposes of determining jurisdiction under the UCCJA, the commencement date is the date of the proceeding then before the court, and not the initiation date of any previous action between the parties. <em>See Favacchia v.

      <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>In my view, Mother commenced the relevant custody action in this case as part of her initial divorce complaint filed in Pennsylvania in 1994. The immediate result of that action was a custody order entered by a Pennsylvania judge that same year. That order derived from a stipulation in which Father agreed to Mother’s moving to North Carolina with the children and also agreed to pay $6,000 per month in child support. During the period between 1994 and 1997, custody of the parties’ children was governed by the 1994 Pennsylvania custody order. In 1997, when the 1994 order was still in force, Father filed a motion for a conciliation conference, clearly seeking conciliation concerning the 1994 Pennsylvania order entered on the custody count in Mother’s divorce complaint.</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[275,1074,1161,684]]]'>I do not view Father’s 1997 motion as commencing some new custody action, but rather as being exactly what it purported to be: an attempt at conciliation given complications arising from the 1994 order then in force. It was Mother who instituted a new custody action, in a new jurisdiction, notwithstanding the existence and pendency of her original Pennsylvania action. There is no dispute that the children, like Mother and Father, resided in Pennsylvania at the time Mother commenced the original custody action in 1994. A fair reading of the UCCJA thus vests jurisdiction in Pennsylvania in this case because the children resided in Pennsylvania at the time of the commencement of the relevant proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[275,1783,1159,574]],["BL_453.1",453,[162,316,1157,396]]]'>I am troubled' by the chaos that may result from the majority opinion permitting a parent to uproot children and then, six months later, haul the other parent into a court in a distant jurisdiction which is now the children’s “home state,” perhaps even multiple times and in multiple jurisdictions during a child’s minority. Here, in response to Mother’s 1994 Pennsylvania complaint, Father agreed to Mother’s relocation to North Carolina with the children. Under the majority’s holding, Father, who has continuously resided in Pennsylvania — a jurisdiction in which, the record shows, the children have maintained significant contacts — is now rewarded for his <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>accommodation by being forced to litigate succeeding issues arising out of a Pennsylvania custody order secured by Mother in a state hundreds of miles away. One result of the majority’s decision will be to encourage those in Father’s position not to be so accommodating in the future, but instead to vigorously oppose any relocation of the children to another jurisdiction — a result that may not be in the best interests of the children.</p>
    <p id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[163,743,1153,458]]]'>I believe that the language of the UCCJA is flexible enough to encompass a wide range of factual scenarios that arise in the context of child custody. I would hold that where, as here, the custody action was originally commenced in Pennsylvania and a custody order was properly entered, and the later filing merely sought court assistance with enforcing that order, the plain language of the UCCJA permits a Pennsylvania court to continue to exercise jurisdiction over custody disputes. Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>
