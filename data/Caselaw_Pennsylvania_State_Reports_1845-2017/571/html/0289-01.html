C.S § 9543(a)(3) (PCRA petitioner must plead and prove that his allegations of error have not been previously litigated in order to be eligible for relief). Appellant claims in his brief to this Court that the PCRA court erred by refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence that Appellant’s mental impairments, in conjunction with the conduct of the police, rendered his confession involuntary. On direct appeal to this Court, Appellant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his confession, because the police psychologically coerced him into making the confession by showing him photos of his victims. <em>Commonwealth v.

In so arguing, Appellant ignores the fact that his prior counsel presented testimony at his penalty phase hearings from his sister and maternal aunt concerning Appellant’s troubled childhood, including the murder of Appellant’s mother by his father when he was a young boy, and Appellant’s subsequent upbringing in the home of his maternal grandparents and several foster homes in support of the existence of the catchall mitigating circumstance set forth at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). More importantly, Appellant ignores the fact that based on the testimony presented by counsel from Appellant’s sister and maternal aunt, both of the juries considering his fate actually found the existence of the catchall mitigating circumstance enumerated at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). Since the juries at both penalty phase hearings actually found the existence of the catchall mitigating circumstance based on the testimony pre<a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>sented concerning Appellant’s troubled childhood and upbringing, Appellant’s instant ineffectiveness claim necessarily fails for lack of prejudice. <em>See Commonwealth v.

At the time that he committed the murders of Sharon Saunders, Myndi McKoy, and Karima Saunders, Appellant was 20 years old.

However, by removing Dr. Aronson’s statement from the context in which it was made, it is actually Appellant’s argument that is misleading. Dr. Aronson’s response to counsel’s request for clarification, taken as a whole, indicates that although he could not exclude drowning as a contributing factor to the deaths of Myndi McKoy and Karima Saunders, he was certain that ligature strangulation was the actual cause of their deaths. His testimony is therefore entirely consistent with his prior testimony at Appellant’s trial that ligature strangulation was the cause of Myndi McKoy’s and Karima Saunder’s deaths, but that drowning could not be excluded as a contributing cause of their deaths.

Appellant's trial counsel informed the court that he asked for leave to hire a psychiatrist in order to pursue the possibility of a guilty but mentally ill defense, but Appellant refused to be examined by the psychiatrist, because he steadfastly maintained his innocence and did not want anything entered into the record suggesting that he committed the murders in any way. We cannot discern, and Appellant fails to explain why he would absolutely refuse to be examined by a psychiatrist for the purpose of determining whether a guilty but mentally insane defense should be pursued, but would nevertheless agree to be evaluated by a mental health expert for the purpose of investigating potential mental health mitigation.</p>

In fact, Appellant makes no showing that his trial counsel either was, or should have been aware of most of the alleged "red flags” prior to the morning of his penalty phase hearing in 1984. Most notably, Appellant fails to offer any indication that he told his trial counsel about <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>his troubled childhood and/or his alleged drug abuse. As we have noted before, in this context, the reasonableness of counsel’s actions or omissions depends in critical part upon the information supplied by the defendant. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s instant claim for relief is fashioned both as a prosecutorial misconduct claim and an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. To the extent that Appellant claims that the Commonwealth’s presentation of Dr. Aronson’s testimony constituted prosecutorial misconduct, said claim is waived, since Appellant could have but did not raise the claim in his direct appeal to this Court. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b). Assuming arguendo that Appellant did not waive his prosecutorial misconduct claim for purposes of the PCRA by failing to raise it in his direct appeal, we would nevertheless find the claim to be without merit, since it too would be based on the false premise that Dr. Aronson’s trial testimony was misleading and/or deceptive.</p>

With regard to Appellant’s allegation that the transcript of a voir dire session that took place on the afternoon of July 23, 1990 has somehow become missing, we note that the record suggests that there was no voir dire session on that afternoon, since the last juror selected to serve on the jury during the voir dire proceedings taking place on the morning of July 23, 1990 was juror number 10, and the first juror selected to serve on the jury during the voir dire proceedings that took place on July 24, 1990 was juror number 11.

In addition, we note that nothing in the record indicates that the trial court prohibited Appellant's trial counsel from placing any argument, objections, or reasons for his objections that were raised in the untranscribed sidebar discussions on the record.
