By passing upon the merits of Petitioner’s constitutional claim, therefore, the court has, in effect, afforded habeas review, while simultaneously denying that it is deciding the question of whether such review may be had. This method suggests, moreover, that any prisoner incarcerated within the Commonwealth’s penal system who is denied parole will be entitled, upon the filing of a habeas corpus petition, to Supreme Court merits review of any alleged constitutional deprivation. The more prudent course, in my view, would be to simply dismiss the petition, as Petitioner’s underlying claim is not cognizable under a habeas corpus paradigm.</p>

      <em>Morales </em>involved a facial challenge to a change in California’s parole regulations whereby the parole board had discretion to wait up to three years to reconsider releasing individuals convicted of multiple murders, rather than holding annual suitability reviews as required under the prior law. The Court upheld the statute, noting that the affected inmates were those least likely to be deemed suitable for parole in any event, and hence, the amendment created only a speculative, attenuated risk of increasing their punishment. <em>See Morales, </em>514 at 508-09, <a href="/us/514/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="514 U.S. 499" data-case-ids="1339457" data-case-paths="/us/514/0499-01">115 S.Ct. at 1603</a>. Likewise, in <em>Jones </em>the petitioner challenged a revision in Georgia’s parole guidelines, which increased the maximum interval between parole suitability considerations from three to eight years. The Supreme Court determined that such change did not create a sufficient risk of prolonged incarceration because the parole board retained discretion to reconsider a prisoner for release well before the eight-year period expired, particularly where a change in circumstances warranted expedited review. Furthermore, the board’s internal guidelines dictated that it would only wait the full eight years when the inmate was not expected to become suitable for parole in any event. This allowed the board to “put its resources to better use, to ensure that those prisoners who should receive parole come to its attention.” <em>Jones, </em><a href="/us/529/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="529 U.S. 244" data-case-ids="9508391" data-case-paths="/us/529/0244-01">529 U.S. at 254</a>, <a href="/us/529/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="529 U.S. 244" data-case-ids="9508391" data-case-paths="/us/529/0244-01">120 S.Ct. at 1370</a>. In <em>Lynce, </em>on the other hand, the Court disallowed a Florida parole amendment which retroactively cancelled provisional early release credits, resulting in the petitioner’s re-arrest and incarceration. In striking down the law, the Court noted that, unlike the California amendment at issue involved in <em>Morales, </em>the Florida statute “did more than simply remove a mechanism that created an <em>opportunity </em>for early release for a class of prisoners whose release was unlikely; rather, it made <a id="p699" href="#p699" data-label="699" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*699</a>ineligible for early release a class of prisoners who were previously eligible — including some, like petitioner, who had actually been released.” <em>Lynce, </em><a href="/us/519/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="519 U.S. 433" data-case-ids="11595864" data-case-paths="/us/519/0433-01">519 U.S. at 447</a>, <a href="/us/519/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="519 U.S. 433" data-case-ids="11595864" data-case-paths="/us/519/0433-01">117 S.Ct. at 898</a> (emphasis in original).</p>

Additionally, it addresses the manner in which the Board must exercise its discretion, as indicated by the word “shall.” <em>See </em>61 P.S. § 331.1; Majority Opinion, at 690. In this respect, it is not subject to qualification by internal Board guidelines or policy, as was the change at issue in <em>Jones. </em>Consequently, I believe that this is a closer case than can be gleaned from the majority opinion. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 691 (stating that Petitioner’s punishment “clearly” has not been increased). Still, as noted, the change must not be analyzed in isolation, but within the context of Pennsylvania’s parole system as a whole. <em>See Jones, </em><a href="/us/529/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="529 U.S. 244" data-case-ids="9508391" data-case-paths="/us/529/0244-01">529 U.S. at 252</a>, <a href="/us/529/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="529 U.S. 244" data-case-ids="9508391" data-case-paths="/us/529/0244-01">120 S.Ct. at 1368</a>. In this regard, it is worth noting that, under Section 21 (a) of the Act, 61 P.S. § 331.21(a), release on parole has traditionally been deemed appropriate only when “it does not appear that the interests of the Commonwealth will be injured thereby.” Such interests manifestly subsume public safety, as well as the fair administration of justice. <em>See generally Reynolds v. Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, </em><a href="/a2d/809/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="809 A.2d 426" data-case-ids="11424946" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0426-01">809 A.2d 426</a>, (Pa.Cmwlth.2002) (undertaking a detailed review of the standards embodied in the Parole Act prior to, and after, the legislative amendment here at issue, and ultimately concluding that the changes to Section 1 of the Act, 61 P.S. § 331.1, did not effect an overall revision in the standards for determining an inmate’s suitability for release).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_4" id="ref_footnote_4_4">4</a> Thus, under longstanding <a id="p700" href="#p700" data-label="700" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*700</a>statutory guidelines, the Board, in exercising its discretion, has always been required to take public safety concerns into account. While the statutory changes may have placed particular emphasis on such considerations, any conclusion that there is a substantial risk of prolonging incarceration sufficient to offend <em>ex post facto </em>prohibitions would appear to be based upon mere conjecture. <em>Accord In re Haynes, </em><a href="/wash-app/100/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="100 Wash.

In this regard, it is notable that the Board’s articulation of its reasons for denying parole in 1999 and 2000 appear drawn from the text of the 1996 amendment. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 690. While this may weigh in favor of a conclusion that the amendment has, in practical effect, disadvantaged Petitioner in his quest for early release, it is not, in my view, sufficient in itself to support such conclusion, or, more generally, a claim that the rule’s overall application is likely to increase punishment. As already explained, the basis for denial recited in Petitioner’s post-1996 dispositions reflects the Commonwealth’s longstanding review policy as embodied in other portions of the statute. Therefore, absent some evidence of a systemic change in the rate at which the Board grants parole, or other proof regarding changes in parole frequency following the 1996 amendment, Petitioner cannot carry his burden of establishing that the Constitution has been violated. <em>See Morales, </em><a href="/us/514/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="514 U.S. 499" data-case-ids="1339457" data-case-paths="/us/514/0499-01">514 U.S. at </a>510 n. 6, <a href="/us/514/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="514 U.S. 499" data-case-ids="1339457" data-case-paths="/us/514/0499-01">115 S.Ct. at </a>1603 n. 6; <em>cf.
