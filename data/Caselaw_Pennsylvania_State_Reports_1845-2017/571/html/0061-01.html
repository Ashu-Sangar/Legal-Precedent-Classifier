The parties dated for over two years, during which time Louis provided Susan with an apartment, an automobile, insurance, a weekly allowance, access to one of his credit cards as a secondary card holder, and a gas charge account at his car dealership’s fueling station.</p>

The parties dispute whether Susan knew at the time Louis gave her the ring that it was not a genuine diamond but, instead, a cubic zirconium. The trial court credited Susan’s testimony that she believed the engagement ring contained a real diamond and did not discover that it was fake until the parties separated many years later. <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>However, prior to giving her the engagement ring, Louis had given Susan other rings that contained genuine stones.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b149-5" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[169,437,1152,775]]]'>In July of 1984, Louis presented Susan with the first draft of a prenuptial agreement. Louis did not discuss the agreement with Susan, other than to say that it was a standard agreement with the provisions left blank, and that Susan should seek legal counsel. This first draft of the agreement made no provision for Susan, other than that she was to retain her separate property in the event of a divorce. Louis later presented Susan with a second version of the agreement, which provided that, in the event of divorce, Susan was to receive $3,500.00 for each year of marriage in lieu of alimony, alimony <em>pendente lite, </em>and spousal support. Also pursuant to this agreement, Louis would provide Susan with an automobile and health insurance for one year. In all other respects, the agreement provided that the parties would retain their separate property, including all increase in value thereof.</p>

Included in this list was an entry for the engagement ring, with the value listed at $21,000.00. Although the financial statement described the ring as an engagement ring, it did not state that the ring <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>contained a diamond, or any other kind of stone. The final version of the agreement contained a typed personal financial statement of Susan’s assets, which also stated a value of $21,000.00 for the engagement ring. Based on this financial statement, the net worth of Susan’s assets appeared to be $46,592.00.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Louis’ personal financial statement — the accuracy of which is not in dispute — listed his net worth at $3,317,666.00. Susan testified that she understood that, as a consequence of signing the prenuptial agreement, she would only receive, in the event of a divorce, the lump sum payment of $3,500.00 per year of marriage, an automobile, insurance, and whatever individual assets she possessed. An attorney reviewed the agreement on Susan’s behalf, although he conducted no negotiations for her.</p>
    <p id="b150-5" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[268,1069,1166,616]]]'>When the parties separated more than ten years later, Susan took the ring to a jeweler in South Carolina, who informed her that it was not a diamond. Subsequently in the divorce proceedings, Susan filed a Petition for Special Relief to set aside the prenuptial agreement. Susan alleged three grounds for invalidation of the prenuptial agreement: (1) that Louis fraudulently induced her to enter the prenuptial agreement by misrepresenting the value of the ring; (2) that Louis breached a confidential relationship with her; and, (3) that Louis violated his duty, pursuant to our decision in <em>Simeone v. Simeone, </em><a href="/pa/525/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="525 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1823712" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0392-01">525 Pa. 392</a>, <a href="/pa/525/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="525 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1823712" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0392-01">581 A.2d 162</a> (1990), of a full and fair disclosure.</p>

The court concluded that a confidential relationship existed between Louis and Susan, due to the difference in the parties’ age, sophistication, wealth and status, and Susan’s dependence on Louis for her material and social well-being. Louis breached this confidential relationship, according to the trial court, by having a prenuptial agreement drafted that was lopsided in his favor. Additionally, the court found that Louis misrepre<a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>sented the nature and value of the ring in order to induce Susan to sign the prenuptial agreement, which she signed in reliance on Louis’ representation as to the ring’s value, and that this misrepresentation was material to her decision to sign the agreement. The court found credible Susan’s testimony that if she knew that Louis had given her a fake ring and lied about it, she would not have signed the prenuptial agreement and “would not have married the man.” Finally, the court declined to address Susan’s claim that Louis violated his duty to provide her with a full and fair disclosure, pursuant to <em>Simeone.</em>

    <p id="b151-5" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[175,921,1158,745]]]'>The Superior Court affirmed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> in a 2-1 unpublished decision. The majority determined that Susan had proven, by dear and convincing evidence, that Louis fraudulently induced her to enter the prenuptial agreement by misrepresenting the value of the ring. Because the majority agreed with the trial court that the prenuptial agreement was voidable due to Louis’ fraud, they did not address the merits of the determination by the trial court that Louis breached a confidential relationship with Susan. Judge Kelly dissented. In Judge Kelly’s view, the remedy of invalidating the entire prenuptial agreement was too harsh. Instead, Judge Kelly would have required Louis to pay Susan $21,000.00 to compensate her for the value of the ring as stated in the prenuptial agreement, but would otherwise have enforced the agreement.</p>

Thus, despite the prevailing theme in <em>Simeone </em>that the provisions of prenuptial agreements should be subject to no greater scrutiny than ordinary business contracts, we nevertheless continued the principle from our previous decisions that these agreements will only be enforced where the parties make a “full and fair” disclosure.

Because the trial court accepted as credible the testimony of Susan that had she known that Louis misrepresented the value of the ring, she would not have entered the prenuptial agreement and "would not have married the man,” we are bound by the trial court's findings that this misrepresentation was material to Susan’s participation in the agreement and that she relied on it. We note, however, that Susan undermined her supposed reliance on anything listed in her schedule of assets when she testified as follows: "Q: In your mind, you had agreed that you were going to sign this document no matter what it said? A: Yes.” R.R. at 165a. Susan later retreated from this statement and asserted that she would not have signed an agreement that "included lies.” Although this inconsistency in her testimony casts some doubt on Susan’s assertions as to the importance of the schedule of assets to her decision to enter the prenuptial agreement, nevertheless we need not examine this question in detail because of our holding that her reliance was not reasonable.</p>

The rationale for such rule stems, in part, from the fact that a recipient's comparative or contributory fault is less relevant where, as here, the fraudulent representation was intentional as opposed to negligent. <em>See generally </em>Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts § 474, at 1359-60 (2001). At the same time, however, an individual is not generally permitted to rely upon statements of opinion or expressions of intention. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 169, 171. In this regard, certain statements between buyers and sellers of goods are treated as opinion, for example, general statements of quality and value, provided that such declarations are "not so far removed from the truth as to be incompatible with the facts known to the maker.” <em>See <a href="/us/516/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="116 S.
