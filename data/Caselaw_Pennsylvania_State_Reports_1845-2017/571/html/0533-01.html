      <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>Here, the evidence adduced at trial established the following: On January 10, 1998, thirteen-year-old Charity Wilkins was in her home with her younger siblings, Sadee and Tiara, when her twenty-two-year-old brother Shawn Wilkins, and her cousin, the sixteen-year-old Appellant, entered the house and immediately went upstairs. Approximately thirty minutes later, Charity heard gunshots. She then walked halfway upstairs and brought Sadee, who had been sitting on the stairs, back to the living room. Subsequently, Appellant appeared downstairs and, with a gun in each hand, ordered Charity upstairs to Shawn’s bedroom. As Charity entered the room, she saw Shawn standing immobile in the comer near the door. Charity sat on the bed and watched Appellant go into Shawn’s dresser and remove a box. After Appellant ordered Charity to lie on the bed, and she complied, he proceeded to shoot her three times, once each in the temple, the cheek, and the neck. Charity passed out and later awoke to find that Appellant had left the bedroom. After hearing someone knocking on the front door, Charity made her way downstairs where she met her cousin Joseph. She was later rushed in an ambulance to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where she remained for over two weeks. As a result of the shooting, Charity is blind in her left eye.</p>
    <p id="b625-4" data-blocks='[["BL_625.4",625,[168,1568,1155,796]]]'>At trial, the parties stipulated that when the police arrived at the scene at approximately 4:30 p.m. on January 10, 1998, they discovered Shawn dead in the bedroom, surrounded by four fired .40-caliber cartridge cases and two fired .22-caliber cartridge cases. An autopsy of Shawn’s body showed that Shawn had been shot six times, including three times in the head. The report concluded that, based on the lack of gunpowder stippling around Shawn’s wounds, all six shots had been fired from a distance greater than three feet. A firearms expert’s report showed that Shawn’s wounds were caused by a .22-caliber gun and a .40-caliber gun, which was the same .40-caliber gun that had caused Charity’s wounds. Although the police found a plastic bag containing nine packets of cocaine near the bed, they did not find any guns or money in or around the house.</p>

Detective Bamberski subsequently read Appellant’s statement verbatim into the record. In his statement, Appellant described accompanying Shawn into Shawn’s bedroom “so [that they] could take care of some business.” N.T., 10/27/98, at 39. Appellant stated that after he gave Shawn $125 in exchange for drugs, Shawn counted the money, put it in his pocket, and then allegedly hit Appellant because the amount was “a little off.” <em><a href="/a2d/756/1130-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="756 A.2d 1130" data-case-ids="11244835,225979" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/1130-01,/pa/562/0481-01">Id.</a> </em>According to Appellant’s statement, Shawn then took out his gun, placed it on the bed, and started walking toward Appellant. Appellant claimed that he then grabbed a different gun from the dresser, aimed it at Shawn, and told him to back up. Appellant maintained in his statement that he thought Shawn was going to reach for the gun on the bed and shoot him, so in self-defense he shot Shawn three times in the head. Appellant also claimed that Charity came running up the stairs after he had shot Shawn, so he shot her once in the face and then laid her down on the bed. Appellant maintained that, when he left Shawn’s house after the shooting, he only took with him the drugs that Shawn had given him, choosing to leave the $125 that he had exchanged for the drugs undisturbed in Shawn’s pocket,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and that he threw the gun he had used in the shootings into an alley on his way to a friend’s house.</p>

As stated above, ‘"Charity testified that she witnessed Shawn and Appellant walk upstairs, that there was no one else in the house besides her, Shawn, Appellant, and the two young children, and that she heard gunshots. She <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>also testified that after Appellant ordered her upstairs to Shawn’s bedroom at gunpoint, she noticed Shawn standing slumped over in the comer of the bedroom. The autopsy report later showed that Shawn had been shot three times in the head. This evidence clearly supports the inference that Appellant deliberately shot Shawn on a vital part of the body and was, therefore, sufficient to sustain Appellant’s first-degree murder conviction. <em>See Ockenhouse, </em><a href="/a2d/756/1130-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="756 A.2d 1130" data-case-ids="11244835,225979" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/1130-01,/pa/562/0481-01">756 A.2d at 1135</a> (specific intent to kill may be inferred by use of deadly weapon on vital part of body).</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.4",627,[161,889,1158,961]]]'>The evidence was also sufficient to support the trial court’s finding that Appellant did not act in self-defense, as Appellant alleged. In his own statement to the police, Appellant admitted that he shot Shawn while Shawn was unarmed. Moreover, even if Shawn in fact threatened Appellant with deadly force before Appellant shot him, as Appellant argued, the autopsy report revealed that Shawn had been shot a total of six times, which was simply more force than would have been necessary for Appellant to use in order to protect himself. <em>See Commonwealth v. Washington, </em><a href="/pa/547/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="547 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="468699" data-case-paths="/pa/547/0563-01">547 Pa. 563</a>, <a href="/a2d/692/1024-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="692 A.2d 1024" data-case-ids="11919347,468699" data-case-paths="/a2d/692/1024-01,/pa/547/0563-01">692 A.2d 1024</a>, 1029 (1997) (based on number and severity of victim’s wounds, defendant used more force than reasonably necessary to protect self from serious bodily injury and shooting was therefore not in self-defense). These circumstances clearly disprove Appellant’s claim that his use of deadly force was justified, and thus, we agree with the trial court that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to disprove Appellant’s self-defense claim beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

In making his argument, however, Appellant would have us ignore the fact that the gun at issue was found outside of the home in Shawn’s car, not inside the house where Shawn was killed.

However, at trial, substantial evidence was presented regarding the guns and the ammunition Shawn possessed at his residence and his activities as a drug dealer. Thus, the fact that an additional gun was found in Shawn’s car would only have been cumulative evidence regarding his violent propensities, and accordingly, counsel’s decision not- to introduce this evidence did not prejudice Appellant. <em>See Commonwealth v.
