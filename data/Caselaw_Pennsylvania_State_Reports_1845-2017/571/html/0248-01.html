Upon viewing a news report of the burglary, a citizen advised police that he had witnessed at least two men carrying items to a white van parked in front of the shop during the probable time of the incident. Police then made inquiries at local car rental agencies concerning the use of vehicles matching the van’s description. From an interview with an employee of the local Rent-A-Wreck franchise, officers learned that Appellant, John Wayne Robins, had recently rented such a van on two separate occasions. Five days prior to the burglary, Appellant first rented a large white van, but quickly returned it to <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>the rental agency, expressing dissatisfaction because the vehicle had too many windows. Three days later (and two days prior to the burglary), Appellant rented a white van without side windows, returning it on the day after the burglary. On both occasions Appellant presented a valid driver’s license and paid with a credit card. Police subsequently obtained a search warrant for Appellant’s home, where they discovered various locksmithing tools and manuals, as well as a police scanner, all of which were legally in Appellant’s possession. Upon questioning, Appellant denied any involvement in the Coins and Computers burglary, but admitted renting the vans, claiming he had done so as a favor to his friend, Barry Auman, who did not possess a valid driver’s license and needed the van to transport personal belongings.</p>
    <p id="b336-5" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[277,1075,1161,1008]]]'>After the search of Appellant’s residence, the police investigation into the burglary languished for nearly a year until Joseph Downey, a police informant who claimed that he could identify the perpetrators, contacted the investigators. Downey had been incarcerated in the Allegheny County jail in May of 1996, when Auman, Appellant’s self-described friend, was arrested for driving under the influence and confined in the same cellblock. Over the next two weeks, Downey and Au-man discussed various criminal ventures in which each had participated. Auman confided to Downey that he was responsible for the Coins and Computers burglary the previous year and related various details of the crime, including the involvement of one or more others and their use of a white Rent-A-Wreck van. While not naming his accomplice or accomplices, Auman apparently disclosed details which would implicate Appellant, including references to a partner who was a locksmith, rented the van, lived in South Side, and had a pool in his backyard.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Auman also said that he remained in possession of stamps valued at nearly $250,000.</p>

The government acceded to Downey’s terms in exchange for his participation in a sting operation targeting Auman. Pursuant to this arrangement, Downey informed Auman that an acquaintance, described as a stamp collector, would be willing to purchase the stamps in Auman’s possession. Downey offered to arrange a meeting with this potential buyer at such time as he and Auman were no longer incarcerated, and Auman expressed a willingness to pursue this plan.</p>

Prior to the meeting, Downey was equipped with a hidden microphone, and additional sound equipment was installed in the hotel room. Downey traveled to the hotel with Auman, and, in their conversation, Auman indicated that he had recently injected himself with a narcotic. Inside the hotel room, Downey introduced the detective to Auman under a false name, and Auman soon offered an account of the burglary apparently to demonstrate how he came to be in possession of the stamps. When both Downey and the detective expressed astonishment at the brazenness of the burglary and repeatedly requested details, Auman acquiesced, periodically indicating concern regarding the degree to which he would be incriminating himself by proceeding further with the discussions and transaction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Although Au-man did not mention Appellant by name, he referred to a partner and stated that a friend obtained a white van from Rent A Wreck for use in the burglary. At the conclusion of the meeting, Auman promised to produce the stamps for the <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>detective’s inspection before consummating the sale. Subsequently, however, Auman contacted the detective to inform him that he could no longer locate the stamps and that they were not available for sale. Thereafter, police arrested Au-man, and, subsequently, Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[276,592,1162,581]]]'>Appellant and Auman were scheduled for a joint trial; however, shortly before the trial date, Auman and the Commonwealth entered into a plea agreement, and Auman was convicted and sentenced for burglary and related offenses. The Commonwealth then proceeded with trial against Appellant on the sole charge of conspiracy to commit burglary. The Commonwealth planned to use Auman’s statements as evidence against Appellant. Appellant filed an omnibus pre-trial motion, seeking to exclude from evidence, <em>inter alia, </em>both Auman’s statements to Downey while incarcerated and the tape-recorded conversation of the hotel meeting.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b338-6" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[276,1197,1162,636]]]'>Appellant contended that the statements were inadmissible hearsay and challenged any assertion by the Commonwealth that they qualified for admission pursuant to the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule. The Commonwealth initially maintained that the coconspirator exception was indeed implicated, since at least a portion of the statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy, or, more specifically, in an attempt to market the stolen merchandise. The trial court rejected this argument, however, on the ground that the Commonwealth’s proffer was insufficient to establish an ongoing conspiracy at the time of Auman’s statement, due to the lapse of a year’s time since the burglary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

      <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>The Commonwealth then asserted its alternative position that the statements were in the nature of declarations against Auman’s penal interest, and, as such, were admissible over and against Appellant’s objections on both hearsay and Confrontation Clause grounds. The trial court endorsed this argument in part, but concluded that only those portions of the statements that directly incriminated Auman would be admitted. The court determined that other portions, such as those that would directly or by implication disclose Appellant’s involvement in the burglary, were not sufficiently adverse to Auman’s interest to qualify for admission under the exception. The trial court referenced <em>Bruton v. United States, </em><a href="/us/391/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="391 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1767670" data-case-paths="/us/391/0123-01">391 U.S. 123</a>, <a href="/us/391/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="391 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1767670" data-case-paths="/us/391/0123-01">88 S.Ct. 1620</a>, <a href="/us/391/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="391 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1767670" data-case-paths="/us/391/0123-01">20 L.Ed.2d 476</a> (1968), in its various rulings on the subject. Thus, the court permitted Downey to testify regarding the jailhouse confession, but prohibited him from mentioning any of Auman’s comments implicating Appellant directly or by contextual implication. Similarly, it allowed the Commonwealth to air before the jurors an edited version of the taped conversation, which eliminated various portions of the discussion referencing Appellant by implication.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[158,1382,1155,295]]]'>The Commonwealth’s strategy was to establish Auman’s guilt, and to connect Appellant through his admitted association with Auman and, in particular, in connection with the rental of the vehicle used in the crime.

The court emphasized the United States Supreme Court’s efforts in Confrontation Clause jurisprudence to balance the government’s need for evidence of extrajudicial statements against a criminal defendant’s interest in cross-examination as a means of truth finding. The Superior Court recognized that, as a result of such balancing, the Supreme Court had determined that out-of-court statements which can be said to fit a “firmly rooted” exception to the hearsay rule generally may be admitted as against a Confrontation Clause challenge, although such statements are untested by cross-examination of the declarant. The Superior Court accepted Appellant’s argument that Auman’s statements, while certainly against his own penal interest, did not fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception when offered against <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>Appellant. Nevertheless, the Superior Court distinguished <em>Lilly </em>on the basis of the trial court’s decision to exclude references that would implicate Appellant directly or by implication. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Appellant also asserts that the circumstances under which Auman’s statements were made do not evince the sort of reliability that would render adversarial testing unnecessary. Specifically, Appellant describes the jailhouse confession as “unreliable chats and bragging between two criminals,” and the taped conversation as untrustworthy, since the situation was engineered by the Commonwealth and the circumstances encouraged the most expedient version of events rather than the most truthful. Additionally, Appellant emphasizes Auman’s exposure to narcotics prior to the hotel conversation.</p>

      <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>In contrast, the Commonwealth views this case as analytically distinct from <em>Lilly </em>in several respects. First, the trial court redacted statements implicating Appellant, permitting the jury to learn of only those portions that internally inculpated only the declarant (Auman), and removing portions that might be deemed unreliable because they tended to shift or spread blame to others. The Commonwealth also argues that the declarations in this case were different in kind from those at issue in <em>Lilly, </em>since Auman’s statements were not knowingly made to law enforcement officials, but rather, were made in a non-custodial setting to persons whom Auman believed he could trust. According to the Commonwealth, the non-custodial aspect should ameliorate any concern that the statements were fabricated to lessen criminal culpability. Although the Commonwealth appears to acknowledge that non-self-inculpatory, custodial statements are not within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, it asserts that self-inculpatory, non-custodial ones may be deemed to fit within a firmly rooted exception. In the event that this Court would find to the contrary, the Commonwealth takes the position that the circumstances surrounding Auman’s statements manifest particularized guarantees of trustworthiness and, for that reason also, should be deemed to meet Confrontation Clause requirements. With regard to the involvement of illicit drugs, the Commonwealth relies upon a factual determination by the trial court that Auman did not suffer from impairment sufficient to undermine the reliability of his statements.</p>

    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[279,1312,1160,581]]]'>Confrontation Clause analysis starts with the proposition that in-court testimony from a witness who is subject to cross-examination evinces the degree of reliability against which untested statements should, as a general rule, be measured. This then is the backdrop for our assessment of the indicia of reliability surrounding Auman’s out of court statements. While there is no required list of factors for conducting this evaluation, we note the commonly referenced ones listed supra, and thus begin with a consideration of the basic components, of when and where the statements were made, to whom they were made and what was said.</p>

Distance from the critical event supports a conclusion that the speaker had time to reflect, rather than a finding that the statements were spontaneous or excited utterances tending to enhance reliability. The initial conversations occurred in a jail cell where Auman was incarcerated on charges unrelated to the burglary. Auman’s confidant was his cellmate, Downey. Auman and Downey had no previ<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>ous relationship, a factor that would militate against a conclusion that they shared a bond inspiring mutual trust. While the statements do inculpate Auman in criminality, his motive in doing so may have been to enhance his standing in the eyes of his cellmate, rather than to speak truthfully of his role in a serious crime. This interpretation of the conversations between Auman and Downey is reinforced by the fact that Downey, for his own purposes, was an attentive listener who encouraged Auman to reveal incriminating details of the burglary. Conversations between cellmates do not carry any special indicia of reliability. In that setting, Auman’s statements giving him a pivotal role in a sensational, and still unsolved burglary do not carry sufficient indicia of reliability.</p>
    <p id="b353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[171,1032,1155,1221]]]'>The other setting for the statements was the hotel room, where Auman believed he was meeting a buyer for the stolen stamps. The prelude to that encounter is important in viewing the whole picture. Auman, now out of jail with the aid of his cellmate Downey, had to continue the picture of the notorious burglar who still has stolen stamps to unload he had painted of himself in the jail cell. Once in the hotel room, Auman continued to discuss his exploits but failed to produce proof that he possessed the merchandise. Auman displayed awareness that his conversation about the burglary exposed him to criminal liability, and he limited his references to his cohorts rather than shift and spread the blame. While in a custodial interrogation a coconspirator confession that shifts the blame is suspicious because it is probably motivated by an effort on part of the speaker to limit his own liability, in a noncustodial setting, where the speaker may be trying to enhance his image before other criminals, the opposite conclusion is just as likely. Given that the inculpatory statements followed upon the likely braggadocio of the jail cell conversations, the fact that the “buyer” was the one who arranged the meeting, not Auman, and that Downey, who was acting on his own personal motivations, orchestrated the entire encounter, a finding of trustworthiness is highly suspect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a>

Nevertheless, as the lead opinion observes, the Commonwealth’s theory of proof was to demonstrate that Auman committed the burglary, then to connect Appellant to Auman primarily in terms of the rental of the van used in the crime. Auman’s confessions therefore constituted a central and critical aspect of the Commonwealth’s case against Appellant.

I recognize that unavailability does not function as a threshold requirement of the category of reliable hearsay defined by "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.” Nevertheless, the core values underlying Sixth Amendment jurisprudence firmly establish that it is not an irrelevancy. As indicated by the lead opinion, the primary interest protected by the Confrontation Clause is the right of cross-examination, which, the lead also notes, Professor Wigmore described as “the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of the truth.” 5 Wigmore, Evidence § 1367, at 32. 5 Wigmore, Evidence § 1367, at 32 (Chadbourne Rev.1974); <em>accord </em>4 Weinstein’s Evidence ¶ 804(b)(l)[02], at 804-57 (1981)(noting that ”[t]he prime guaranty of reliability in the case of prior testimony or depositions resides in their having been subjected to cross-examination prior to the present trial”). Confrontation Clause analysis, therefore, starts with the proposition that in-court testimony from a witness who is subject to cross-examination evinces the degree of reliability against which untested statements should, as a general rule, be measured. Unavailability, which, by definition, eliminates the opportunity for cross-examination before the factfinder, is thus an indicator of a lesser degree of reliability, which must then, as a general rule, be counterbalanced by some other trustworthiness indicator or indicators to pass Sixth Amendment scrutiny (as noted below, an exception to this general rule persists for hearsay statements admissible pursuant to the coconspirator exception). By its nature, therefore, unavailability is an integral component of any examination for particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. I place particular emphasis on it <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>here due to the importance of Auman's statements to the prosecution, the Commonwealth's involvement in the production of those statements, its physical control oí the witness at the time of trial, and the absence of a record concerning the basis for the witness’s unavailability and the Commonwealth’s good faith in this regard.

A case such as this one presents a far stronger argument in favor of firm rooting than did the statements at issue in either <em>Dutton </em>or <em>Lilly. </em>This is so because the inherently suspect circumstance of blame-shifting is not present; rather, the accomplice statements here merely proved the speaker’s own role in the conspiracy. Furthermore, the very fluidity that has characterized the law of evidence cautions against assuming that all declarations against penal interest will fail the firm rooting test. Unless we are doomed to have evidentiary principles deemed cryogenically frozen in time, the more familiar and frequent such uses of self-inculpatory statements become under the second alternative, the more “firm” the rooting of the exception must necessarily become.

The statements were not ambiguous or subtle; rather, they directly and unequivocally implicated Auman in criminal conduct. That conduct, moreover, did not involve some completed, historical criminal conquest; rather, it involved a burglary in which Auman was still trying to peddle some of the stolen goods. The statements also did not involve custodial confessions to police, such that Auman might be seen as seeking to curry favor with those in a position to prosecute him for the (ongoing) crime; indeed, they were not made in circumstances where Auman “stood to gain” by his self-incrimination at all. <em>Lilly, </em><a href="/us/527/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="198" data-cite="527 U.S. 116" data-case-ids="1248251" data-case-paths="/us/527/0116-01">527 U.S. at 132</a>, <a href="/us/527/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="199" data-cite="527 U.S. 116" data-case-ids="1248251" data-case-paths="/us/527/0116-01">119 S.Ct. 1887</a>, <em>quoting Lee, </em><a href="/us/476/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="200" data-cite="476 U.S. 530" data-case-ids="12807" data-case-paths="/us/476/0530-01">476 U.S. at 541</a>, <a href="/us/476/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="201" data-cite="476 U.S. 530" data-case-ids="12807" data-case-paths="/us/476/0530-01">106 S.Ct. 2056</a>. By the same token, the statements were not made in response to coercive police tactics, much less tactics that involved suggesting the incriminating facts to Auman. ■ Police, in other words, did not feed Auman the facts that incriminated him and secure his assent to that scenario; Auman volunteered them, in a fashion that was internally consistent and which suggested a familiarity with the crime that necessarily bespoke reliability.

    <p id="b367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[166,747,1160,844]]]'>The time that lapsed between Auman’s statements is also significant. Auman did not merely admit responsibility for a crime in front of another inmate while in jail; rather, he put his money where his mouth was. Once Auman and his cellmate, Joseph Downey, were released from prison, they undertook to sell the stamps. This follow-up conduct tended to corroborate Auman’s earlier admissions. For good measure, when Auman made additional inculpatory statements in front of an undercover detective while pursuing the sale of the goods, he specifically indicated his awareness and concern with the fact that he was incriminating himself. Auman’s consciousness of the import of what he was disclosing suggests the trustworthiness of the admissions. In my view, taken as a whole, these circumstances overwhelmingly demonstrated the reliability of the statements, making them admissible under the second part of the <em>Lilly ¡Roberts </em>test.</p>

The primary factor in the lead opinion’s conclusion that Auman’s confessions were unreliable as a matter of law is that the admissions began with a confession made to his cellmate, Joseph Downey. The lead opinion apparently would hold that such confessions are inherently unreliable. The lead opinion postulates that Auman “may have” admitted to the crime to Downey not because he actually committed the crime, but because he was trying to “enhance his standing in the eyes of his cellmate” and thought falsely taking credit for an unsolved, allegedly “notorious” crime would do that. The lead opinion follows this bald assumption about the universal motivations of those peopling <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>our prisons not with a citation to legal authority, but with the tautological declaration that, “[c]onversations between cellmates do not carry any special indicia of reliability.” The rest of the lead opinion’s analysis is infected by its universal predicate assumption. As the analysis progresses, it is no longer a mere “possibility’ that Auman was a lying braggart seeking to impress his cellmate, but a given fact. Op. at 527 (“Given that the inculpatory statements [in the hotel room] followed upon the likely braggadocio of the jail cell conversations”) (emphasis supplied). According to the lead opinion, once out of jail, Auman “had to continue the picture of the notorious burglar ... he had painted of himself in the jail cell.” <em><a href="/us/476/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="476 U.S. 530" data-case-ids="12807" data-case-paths="/us/476/0530-01">Id.</a> </em>The crime has now been transformed into Auman’s “exploits.” <em><a href="/us/476/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="207" data-cite="476 U.S. 530" data-case-ids="12807" data-case-paths="/us/476/0530-01">Id.</a></em>

It also might be persuasive if the question arose in the literary realm. But the lead opinion’s assumption of this particular universally imputed motive for cellmate confessions is not at all persuasive in the legal realm. Such speculation about why inmates may falsely confess to open crimes, at best, may be fodder for argument as to the weight a jury should accord a declaration against penal interest once admitted. But I fail to see how that utter speculation should be deemed to destroy, as a matter of law, the reliability of an otherwise-reliable declaration against penal interest. Certainly, criminal defendants hoping to employ such jailhouse confessions to assist their own cause will be disappointed to learn of todays “braggadocio” reasoning.</p>

I do not for a moment dispute that cellmate conversations are not uniquely reliable, but neither are they uniquely unreliable. However, the point is that it requires an Olympian leap in logic, a leap contradicted by experience, to conclude, as the lead opinion would, that conversations with strangers in jail which include confessions to unsolved crimes must be deemed, as a matter of law, to be lies motivated by “braggadocio.” If human nature is to be accorded any role at all in our analysis, we must continue to recognize that it is highly unusual to falsely confess to an unsolved crime. It is more unusual to falsely confess that crime to a stranger, since that circumstance is fraught with unknown peril.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> It is even more unusual still to falsely confess the open crime to a cellmate, because the peril is even greater, given the obvious potential interest the cellmate has in arranging his own “deal” by gathering evidence against others.</p>

People lie to friends, to spouses, to co-workers, to priests, to the IRS. People lie under oath. People occasionally even lie in excited utterances, or when seeking medical treatment, or when making dying declarations; and yet, those statements are routinely admitted based upon the assumption, rooted in our human experience, that such statements generally are reliable. If the mere prospect that a lie was at work were deemed sufficient to make an out-of-court statement unreliable, there would be very few hearsay exceptions. In this regard, the lead opinion’s assumption is less an attack on these particular confessions than it is an attack on all out-of-court statements. The fact that it is theoretically possible that Auman was lying when he confessed — just as it is always <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>possible that a hearsay statement covered by a firmly rooted exception is a lie in a particular case — cannot control the inquiry.

As the concurrence notes, Pennsylvania’s version of the declaration against penal interest exception has traditionally been deemed applicable in this Commonwealth only where, among other requirements, the witness is unavailable. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pa.R.E. 804(b)(3). Thus, even apart from appellant’s constitutional claim, appellant always had available to him a narrower and clearer state evidentiary objection if he believed Auman was actually available. But such an objection had obvious tactical perils, at least under the unique facts of this case. Auman’s statements, as redacted, were offered for an extremely narrow purpose; <em>i.e., </em>to prove Auman’s own guilt in the conspiracy. As redacted, Auman’s statements did not implicate appellant; instead, they “incriminated” appellant <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>only because of independent evidence which linked him to the conspiracy that Auman had confessed to.</p>

In that circumstance, Auman, if produced, would have been in a position to directly implicate appellant with first-hand testimony as to appellant’s role in the conspiracy. To be sure, Auman, if produced, would have been subject to possibly effective cross-examination and impeachment on numerous grounds. But, on balance, it is not unreasonable to see why appellant might have determined that it was a better course to keep Auman off the stand entirely and, thus, made a strategic decision not to press a state law evidentiary objection based upon an argument that Auman was no longer unavailable. Such a course minimized the damage that Auman could do to appellant, while still preserving a neatly-framed constitutional objection to the very limited evidence that was produced.</p>
