After holding a sanction hearing in which the parties argued about what the appropriate discipline should be, the Court of Judicial Discipline ordered that Appellant be removed from office, declared that he was ineligi<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>ble to hold judicial office in the future, and disbarred him from the Bar of this Commonwealth.</p>

Our analysis of this issue is aided by our recent decision in <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel v.

In that matter, the question was whether this court or the Court of Judicial Discipline was the proper tribunal to disbar Jepsen, a district justice, from the practice of law. Jepsen argued that we did not have jurisdiction to disbar her, but rather the Court of Judicial Discipline had exclusive jurisdiction to sanction judicial officers. We rejected the Jepsen’s characterization of her claim. We found that although this issue was “phrased in terms of jurisdiction, the real issue is whether our Court had the authority to impose the sanction of disbarment under the circumstances of this case.” <em><a href="/pa/567/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="787 A.2d 420" data-case-ids="404506,404529,9454636,9454647" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0459-01,/pa/567/0458-01,/a2d/787/0420-01,/a2d/787/0420-02">Id.</a> </em>at 422 (citing <em>Riedel).</em>

It is beyond cavil that the Court of Judicial Discipline has jurisdiction over the general subject matter presented here, namely, determining whether an individual engaged in judicial misconduct. In fact, that is the tribunal’s constitutional <em>raison d’etre. </em>The question Appellant raises — whether that body may discipline a judicial officer following his resignation from office— <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>challenges the tribunal’s power.

    <p id="b580-5" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[279,456,1159,689]]]'>Appellant next contends that the Court of Judicial Discipline improperly ordered that he be removed from office and banned from holding judicial office in the future. He suggests that the facts of this case render each of these sanctions meaningless. He reasons that he cannot be removed from office as he has already removed himself. Furthermore, as Article 2, § 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution forbids him from holding office following his conviction for an “infamous crime”, he is effectively barred from running for office by virtue of his felony conviction. Thus, Appellant deduces, if his actions effectively impose self-punishment, there is nothing left for the Court of Judicial Discipline to accomplish via sanctions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellant misapprehends the role of the Court of Judicial Discipline. The Court of Judicial Discipline exists not only to chasten the misbehaving judge; <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>rather, it serves an equally — if not more — important function as protector of the integrity of the judiciary and the public’s confidence in that branch of government. In disciplining a judicial officer for his misconduct, that tribunal not only punishes the wrongdoer, but also repairs the damaged public trust and provides guidance to other members of the judiciary regarding their conduct. Appellant’s conviction and resignation do not accomplish these goals. Therefore, we cannot equate the voluntary relinquishment of office and the presumption that Appellant’s felony conviction would bar him from running for public office with the discipline imposed by the Court of Judicial Discipline. One simply is not a substitute for the other. We thus hold that Appellant’s resignation from judicial office and conviction of a felony crime did not divest the Court of Judicial Discipline of its authority to impose sanctions on Appellant.</p>

He raises two arguments in support of his position. First, he argues that the Court of Judicial Discipline could not impose such a sanction because “there was no factual basis before the Court of Judicial Discipline relating to [Appellant’s] status as an attorney.” Appellant’s Brief at 16.</p>
    <p id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[157,1595,1154,581]]]'>Contrary to Appellant’s contention, there was such evidence before the Court of Judicial Discipline, and it came in the form of an admission from Appellant himself. At the outset of the sanction hearing, a question was posed as to whether Appellant was an attorney in good standing with the Bar of Pennsylvania. Sanction Hearing, 9/27/2000, N.T. at 4. During the course of the hearing, Appellant admitted that he was an attorney and that his license to practice law was still active at that point. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9.

The Office of Disciplinary Counsel argued that only this court had the power to disbar an attorney, regardless of whether the attorney also happened to be a judicial officer. Jepsen, on the other hand, contended that any discipline of a judicial officer — including disbarment from the practice of law — must be meted out by the Court of Judicial Discipline and that no other tribunal had the authority to sanction a judicial officer. In resolving the issue before the court, we rejected both of these views, and stated that both the Court of Judicial Discipline and this court concurrently held the power to discipline a judicial officer. <em>Jepsen, </em><a href="/pa/567/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="787 A.2d 420" data-case-ids="404506,404529,9454636,9454647" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0459-01,/pa/567/0458-01,/a2d/787/0420-01,/a2d/787/0420-02">787 A.2d at 423-24</a>.</p>

More careful analysis, however, reveals that this is not the case. While there is language in the <em>Jepsen </em>opinion that intimates that the Court of Judicial Discipline would have the power to disbar a judicial officer, that was not the issue presented to this court. The sole issue in <em>Jepsen </em>was whether <em>this </em>court had the authority to disbar a judicial officer. Thus, any language in <em>Jepsen </em>regarding the power of the Court of Judicial Discipline was <em>obiter dicta; </em>the decision has no precedential value as to the issue of whether the Court of Judicial Discipline has the power to disbar a jurist.</p>

Were we to adopt Appellant’s view of that court’s power, the Court of Judicial Discipline would not be able to hear a complaint brought against a judicial officer who left office due to voluntary retirement, superannuation, or even impeachment; such an overly restrictive definition of that court’s authority would be in opposition to, rather than consistent with, the Court of Judicial Discipline’s role. Thus, we would reject Appellant’s argument and hold that the Court of Judicial Discipline has the power to sanction misbehaving judicial officers, regardless of whether they are in office during the pendency of disciplinary proceedings.</p>

The majority opinion aptly notes that <em>Jepsen </em>is distinguishable because the issue there was whether our Court has the authority to disbar a judicial officer, and not whether the Court of Judicial Discipline <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>possessed such power. Another fundamental distinction, however, exists. The Judicial Conduct Board sought Jepsen’s removal from office pursuant to a constitutional mandate applicable to disbarred members of the bar, rather than pursuant to any inherent authority possessed by that constitutionally created entity. Thus, <em>Jepsen </em>is not controlling here, where the disbarment was imposed by the Court of Judicial Discipline for judicial misconduct.</p>
    <p id="b584-4" data-blocks='[["BL_584.4",584,[283,753,1159,572]]]'>To illustrate this point, the procedural posture of the two cases must be examined. In this case, the Judicial Conduct Board filed a complaint against the judicial officer. The Court of Judicial Discipline proceeded to examine the misconduct engaged in by the judicial officer and concluded that the appropriate sanction included disbarment. That did not occur in <em>Jepsen. </em>The Judicial Conduct Board did not file a complaint against Jepsen. Instead, the Judicial Conduct Board filed in our Court an application to implement automatic forfeiture of the judicial office pursuant to Article V, Section 18(d)(3) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which states</p>
    <blockquote id="A4QE" data-blocks='[["BL_584.5",584,[322,1342,1119,254]]]'>A justice of the peace convicted of misbehavior in office by a court, <em>disbarred as a member of the bar of the Supreme Court </em>or removed under this section shall forfeit automatically his judicial office and thereafter be ineligible for judicial office.</blockquote>

    <p id="b584-6" data-blocks='[["BL_584.7",584,[281,1679,1161,679]]]'>It is evident that the Judicial Conduct Board in <em>Jepsen </em>did not examine the alleged misconduct of the judicial officer. It was proceeding <em>solely </em>on the ground that she had been disbarred on consent by this Court and therefore was required to automatically forfeit her judicial office. Thus, the factual paradigm did not include the present scenario where the Court of Judicial Discipline examined misconduct of the judicial officer pursuant to its constitutionally conferred authority and determined that the judicial officer should be disbarred. Under these circumstances, <em>Jepsen </em>can not be interpreted as authorizing the Court of Judicial Discipline to remove a judicial officer’s license to practice. As the majority opinion recognizes, that authority is exclusively vested in this Court.</p>

Rather, this case concerns the scope of the jurisdiction conferred upon the Court of Judicial Discipline in the first instance. Despite the facial import of Article V, Section 18, the majority determines that jurisdiction over former judicial officers is necessary to effectuate the policy aims of Article V, Section 18. While the majority’s articulation of policy is sound, I cannot agree that it requires the departure sanctioned. Rather, in my view, it would be preferable to respect the express means of effectuating policy that have been selected by the General Assembly and approved by the voting public, including the discemable, incorporated limitations. Accordingly, as Appellant had resigned from his judicial office prior to the initiation of charges against him in the Court of Judicial Discipline, I would hold that jurisdiction was not present.</p>
