(“Employer”), and its insurer, American General Group, pursuant to the Workers’ Compensation Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Claimant alleged that, in March of 1993, she sustained an injury— bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (“CTS”) — in the course and scope of her employment primarily as a bookkeeper. On the same day, Claimant also asserted a claim against her previous employer, Lome G. Seifert, Inc. (“Seifert”), alleging that her clerical duties at that company contributed to her injury. Employer filed a joinder petition against Seifert for the same reason and, subsequently, filed a second joinder petition, contending that any injury occurred while Claimant worked for another company, H <em>&amp; </em>R Block, as a tax preparer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The parties stipulated that Claimant’s work with Employer spanned the fall of 1991 through mid-1993; her job with Seifert from 1987 through 1990; and her seasonal employment with H <em>&amp; </em>R Block several months in 1991 (full time), as well as in 1992 through 1993 (part time). Claimant testified that her duties for all employers included substantial periods of repetitive hand motion, particularly typing and computer keyboarding; she experienced tingling and numbness in her fingers and right arm in December of 1989, while employed by Seifert; she was treated by a chiropractor in 1990 and ultimately referred to a physician, who diagnosed CTS; while working for Employer, she spent seventy percent of her time typing at a computer <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>keyboard; working full time for Employer, her symptoms increased; she came under the care of James A. Yates, M.D., in February of 1992; and it was at such time that she learned that her CTS was work related.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[268,552,1160,739]]]'>Claimant also presented Dr. Yates’ testimony via deposition transcript. His description concerning onset and treatment of the CTS was consistent with Claimant’s; further, he explained that he performed several surgical procedures in 1992 and 1993 to alleviate the symptoms. According to Dr. Yates, Claimant’s injury caused permanent nerve damage, and her condition was related to her employment and caused by repetitive motion, including typing, keyboarding, and writing. On cross-examination, Dr. Yates indicated that his opinion concerning work-relatedness was predicated upon the work and medical history provided by Claimant, and that such history was generalized in nature.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Dr. Yates also identified a series of other causes for CTS, although he emphasized that repetitive motion activities were the most common source.</p>

The supervisor testified that the majority of Claimant’s work involved working with invoices and other documents, and that she did not spend a great deal of time at a computer terminal. The clerical worker stated that, in performing Claimant’s duties, she spent no more than two hours per day on data entry; the remainder of the workday involved non-repetitive tasks; and many days she did <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>not spend any time at a keyboard. Employer did not present an expert medical witness, nor did Seifert present evidence.</p>
    <p id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[161,448,1154,896]]]'>In her findings, the WCJ emphasized inconsistencies, conflicts, and vagaries in Claimant’s evidence. For example, she contrasted the extensive evidence to the effect that Claimant’s difficulties with CTS were longstanding and clearly evident in June of 1990, with a disability claim form submitted to Employer by Claimant indicating that her CTS first appeared in August of 1992; credited the testimony of Employer’s witnesses over Claimant’s concerning the extent of repetitive motion activity she performed; and emphasized that Dr. Yates was unable to specify any particular event leading to or time of an onset or aggravation of Claimant’s injury. The WCJ specifically stated that the testimony of Claimant and Dr. Yates was not credible. Therefore, the WCJ concluded that Claimant failed to sustain her burden of proving that her injury was work related and entered an order dismissing the claim petitions against Employer and Seifert, as well as Employer’s joinder petition.</p>
    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[161,1370,1154,1004]],["BL_278.1",278,[267,325,1161,625]]]'>The Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (“WCAB”), however, reversed. Preliminarily, it acknowledged that its review was in an appellate capacity, and it was therefore not its function to weigh the evidence and resolve conflicts, but rather, such role was assigned to the WCJ. Further, the WCAB noted that it was within the WCJ’s discretion to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony of any witness, including an expert. Nevertheless, the WCAB indicated that, in instances in which only the party bearing the burden of proof presents evidence and relief is denied, it is appropriate for an appellate tribunal to review an administrative adjudication to ensure that it is free from any capricious disregard of competent evidence. Although acknowledging that Employer presented fact witnesses in rebuttal to Claimant’s testimony, the WCAB emphasized that Employer had not presented expert evidence to challenge Dr. Yates’ testimony. The WCAB invoked a traditional definition of capricious disregard as “a willful, deliberate disbelief of an apparently trustworthy witness, whose testimony one has no basis to challenge.” The <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>WCAB then quoted extensively from Dr. Yates’ testimony concerning Claimant’s injury and his conclusion as to its work relatedness; characterized such testimony as unequivocal; and concluded that the WCJ erred in rejecting it, at least to the extent that it supported an aggravation of a pre-existing condition and/or a repetitive trauma injury. The WCAB therefore remanded the matter to the WCJ, requiring a determination of the date of injury and identification of the liable employer. On remand, the WCJ granted the claim petition for the work period from June 21, 1993, through June 1, 1994, and identified Employer as the liable party. The WCAB subsequently extended this period by fifteen months.</p>
    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[266,975,1164,519]]]'>Before a panel of the Commonwealth Court, Employer argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that in its initial opinion, the WCAB improperly applied the capricious disregard standard of appellate review, thereby usurping the WCJ’s determinations of credibility and evidentiary weight. Like the WCAB, the Commonwealth Court majority emphasized that Employer had not presented medical evidence and, accordingly, also invoked what it termed a capricious disregard standard of review. On such basis, the Commonwealth Court rejected Employer’s argument, reasoning:</p>

Such a review required the Board’s assessment of the <em>competency </em>of the evidence, <em>not </em>its <em>credibility. </em>Thus, Employer is mistaken in its assertion that the [WCAB’s] assessment of the <em>competency </em>of the medical evidence of record was an evaluation of its credibility and evidentiary weight,</blockquote>
    <p id="AE-" data-blocks='[["BL_278.6",278,[263,1944,1163,199]]]'>(emphasis in original). After resolving additional questions raised by Employer, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the WCAB’s order in a memorandum opinion, remanding the matter for reasons unrelated to the present appeal.</p>

She rea<a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>soned that the court’s precedent clearly established that review for capricious disregard applied in the limited circumstance in which the burdened party does not prevail and was the sole presenter of evidence. Judge Friedman noted a conflict in authority concerning the application of the review standard in cases in which only the burdened party presents medical evidence but both parties present lay testimony or other non-medical evidence. <em>Compare Iacono v.

Citing to <em>Iacono, </em>Judge Friedman concluded that the controlling position is that, when both parties present evidence before the factfinder, however limited (there being no requirement that such proof include medical evidence), an appellate court must apply the substantial evidence standard to the exclusion of review for capricious disregard. <em>See Iacono, </em>155 Pa.Cmwlth. at 240, <a href="/pa-commw/155/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="624 A.2d 814" data-case-ids="1445856" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/155/0234-01">624 A.2d at 816-17</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> According to Judge Friedman, Employer’s presentation of factual testimony concerning the nature of Claimant’s job duties removed the matter from the purview of capricious disregard review. Judge Friedman also chastised the majority for taking a position that unnecessarily confused what she viewed as a “clear-cut legal determination,” and adopting an analysis that was both unnecessary and impractical. In this regard, Judge Friedman explained:</p>
    <blockquote id="b279-4" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[209,1708,1116,309]],["BL_280.1",280,[322,321,1117,714]]]'>The effect of the majority’s opinion is that the standard of review must be decided separately for each issue raised within a single case. Former President Judge Craig pointed out the burdensome nature of this approach in <em>Herbert v. [UCBR], </em>131 Pa.

Because testimony on one issue can, and often does, impact to some extent on a different issue, or issues, in the same case, the parties could end up battling over pieces of evidence and their relevance to individual issues. This could require us to perform an extensive analysis of the evidence and to decide the question of the appropriate standard several times in a single case before we could address the issues raised in the-case. There is no need for this court to invite such difficulties, and I would hope that we could avoid such inquiries in the future.</blockquote>

Bauman, <em>Standards of Review and Scopes of Review in Pennsylvania </em>— A <em>Primer and Proposal, </em><a href="/citations/?q=39%20Duq.%20L.%20Rev.%20513" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="39 Duq. L. Rev. 513">39 Duq. L. Rev. 513</a> (Spring 2001). Nevertheless, in the area of administrative agency review, judges have sometimes described fundamentally different and irreconcilable concepts, as illustrated by the division of the Commonwealth Court panel in the present case. Indeed, in a few instances in this arena, unfortunately, form has overcome substance, causing confusion. We emphasize, at the outset, that the intermediate appellate courts cannot be greatly faulted in this regard, since several of this Court’s own decisions reflect such fundamental inconsistencies. While recently, Madame Justice Newman, writing for a unanimous Court, articulated the essential concepts, <em>see Fraternal Order of Police v. PLRB, </em><a href="/pa/557/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="557 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="56880" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0586-01">557 Pa. 586</a>, 593-94, <a href="/a2d/735/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="735 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="11533716,56880" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0096-01,/pa/557/0586-01">735 A.2d 96</a>, 99-100 (1999), it is apparent that vestiges of prior difficulties remain.

Although <em>Russell </em>is not explicit in this regard, it also appears that the Commonwealth Court believed that the interpretation also had to be applied generally to cases in which an adjudication was against the burdened party, since that was McGovern’s fact paradigm. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth Court was concerned that strict application of <em>McGovern </em>to the discrete situation where a burdened party is the only party to present evidence and does not prevail before the agency would leave a substantial void in the review process. In such matters, <em>Russell </em>noted <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>that application of the substantial evidence component of Section 704 was inapt:</p>

There are many instances in which agencies predicate negative conclusions (for example, that a party failed to meet his burden of proof) upon affirmative facts adduced from the claimant’s testimony and evidence, to include cross-examination. In such cases, Section 704 review for substantial evidence applies to all affirmative findings that are necessary to support the adjudication. <em>See </em>2 Pa.C.S. § 704 (“the court shall affirm the adjudication unless it shall find that ... any finding of fact made by the agency and necessary to support its adjudication is not supported by substantial evidence”). Conversely, it is troubling to suggest that the General Assembly intended for judicial review to be simply unavailable in an instance in which substantial evidence supported the agency’s factual findings, but where it was clear beyond doubt that its conclusions were based upon capricious disregard of other evidence. Such a situation would occur, for example, if the <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>agency expressly refused to resolve conflicts in the evidence and make essential credibility determinations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Additionally, given the inadequate foundation upon which the exception allowing for review for capricious disregard was crafted, fractured opinions have developed concerning the appropriate manner of its application, as again illustrated by this case.</p>

There, the Commonwealth Court erroneously discerned a capricious disregard of the evidence in an adjudication in which, not only was the central finding a negative one in the sense that the claimant had failed to sustain his burden of proof, but also, there appears to have been substantial evidence of record offered by the opposing party to support the contrary agency determination. <em>See McGovern, </em><a href="/pa/512/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="512 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="1800407,1800416" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0377-01,/pa/512/0377-02">512 Pa. at 383-84</a>, <a href="/pa/512/0377-02" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="517 A.2d 523" data-case-ids="1800416" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0377-02">517 A.2d at 525-26</a> (detailing such evidence).

Rather, it is a review of the agency’s legal conclusions to determine whether in making those legal conclusions, the agency capri<a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>ciously disregarded evidence of record that would have clearly and beyond doubt commanded a different result.

It is for this reason that I cannot agree with Madame Justice Newman’s contention that review for a capricious disregard of evidence is not the application of a standard of review, but a legal conclusion. I believe that it can be conceptualized as both. Specifically, while not all standards of review describe a standard and a legal conclusion (see the <em>de novo </em>standard of review applicable to pure questions of law), other standards do have a dual meaning. The standard of review described as an “abuse of discretion’’ sharpens the point. An appellate court may review a trial court’s admission of evidence to determine if the trial court committed an abuse of discretion. The standard of review is the "abuse of discretion” standard. If the appellate court determines the trial court erred, the legal conclusion is that the trial court "abused its discretion.”</p>

Use of the "substantial evidence” verbiage to describe both review of an agency’s affirmative findings of fact <em>and </em>review of an agency’s legal conclusions unnecessarily confuses matters. I believe it far more desirable to keep the inquiry regarding findings of fact distinct from the inquiry regarding conclusions of law and to use distinct terms with respect to each area. To keep the inquiries separate, and to create a common lexicon, I would suggest using the terminology "substantial evidence” only with respect to the deferential review of an agency’s findings of fact. This position is of course, grounded in section 704. 2 Pa.C.S. § 704 (whether findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence). For review of an agency's legal conclusions, i.e., whether the conclusions are in accordance with law, I would advocate use of the terms articulated in <em>FOP. </em>That is review, where appropriate, to determine if the agency’s legal conclusions are adequately supported by competent factual findings, are arbitrary and capricious, or constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>FOP, </em><a href="/a2d/735/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="735 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="11533716,56880" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0096-01,/pa/557/0586-01">735 A.2d at 99</a>.</p>

    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.4",300,[276,880,1159,1112]]]'>A review of the origins of a capricious disregard analysis sheds light, I believe, on the context and manner of its application. In the late 1800s, at least as far as published opinions of that era reveal, cases that were improperly submitted to a jury or in which the jury rendered a judgment that resulted in a judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>(JNOV), were often reversed by a finding that the jury capriciously disregarded the evidence or lack of evidence in their determinations. This gave rise to the adage that widows and orphans make bad law. <em>See, i.e., Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Beale, </em><a href="/pa/73/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="73 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1032299" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0504-01">73 Pa. 504</a> (1873) (reversing jury award in favor of widow and children of deceased where jury capriciously disregarded the fact that decedent’s failure to stop immediately before crossing a railroad track was negligence <em>per </em>se); <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v.

The operative word in this analysis is “capricious.” The clear meaning of capricious disregard that is gleaned from these early cases is that the fact finder intentionally and willfully overlooked overwhelming controlling law or evidence to the contrary to arrive at its intended result. This is not an application of a standard of review, but a legal conclusion. Moreover, there is no evidence in the matter <em>sub judice </em>that the WCJ intentionally overlooked controlling law, or evidence to the contrary, to achieve a desired outcome.</p>

In the instant matter, the WCJ determined that the testimony of Claimant was less than credible. Claimant went to work for Wintermyer in 1991 after she was aware that she had CTS. In fact, she informed Wintermyer that she had CTS when she was hired. The determination of the WCJ to deny benefits was a direct result of the testimony of Employer’s witnesses as to the repetitive task requirements of Claimant’s job and went directly to the work-relatedness of the injury. The WCJ is not bound to believe every story that a witness or witnesses willingly swears to, simply because no other witness contradicts it. Having discredited Claimant’s testimony concerning the causation of her underlying CTS and its direct relationship to her job, as well as other important aspects of her testimony, the WCJ discredited the testimony of Dr. Yates because Dr. Yates’ opinion that Claimant’s CTS was a work-related injury was based entirely upon the discredited testimony of Claimant. The WCJ did not discredit the testimony of Dr. Yates because it was equivocal. The sole issue here was credibility, not unequivocality</p>

      <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>I would reiterate that this Court has rejected the “capricious disregard” standard as applied by the Commonwealth Court beginning with <em>McGovern </em>and continuing to the present, even where only one party produced evidence. Moreover, it must be remembered that the defendant is not required to produce any evidence, including medical evidence, because it bears no burden of proof. Our workers’ compensation jurisprudence has not held that, irrespective of the credibility determinations of the lay witnesses and of the claimant, if a physician testifies that the claimant was injured at work, then, despite a lack of factual foundation for that testimony, the testimony of the physician must be accepted and the claim granted. In the instant matter, the decision of the Commonwealth Court and the Board would set an untenable precedent of requiring the production of medical testimony by the defense or face the imposition of liability. Regardless of how many parties present evidence, the WCJ must issue findings of fact. It is these findings of fact that must be supported by substantial evidence, whether or not the evidence is controverted. If the findings of fact that are necessary to support an adjudication are supported by substantial evidence in the record, then the adjudication will be supported by substantial evidence, even if that evidence demonstrates that the party with the burden of proof has failed to carry its burden.</p>
    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[261,1626,1165,740]],["BL_303.1",303,[167,319,1155,797]]]'>Substantial evidence can support a negative finding by a tribunal charged with deciding the outcome of a particular cause of action. Insufficient evidence presented by the burdened party is ascertainable and provides substantial evidence to support a finding that the plaintiff failed to carry his or her burden of production and the plaintiffs case has failed. Sufficient evidence presented by the burdened party that is not credited by the fact finder is also ascertainable and provides substantial evidence that the burdened party has failed to sustain his or her burden of persuasion. When the Commonwealth Court opined that, where “no evidence was presented to support the prevailing party, there is no evidence upon which to apply the ‘substantial evidence’ test,” <em>Russell, <a href="/pa-commw/121/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="550 A.2d 1364" data-case-ids="1379684" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/121/0436-01">550 </a></em><a href="/pa-commw/121/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="550 A.2d 1364" data-case-ids="1379684" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/121/0436-01">A.2d at 1865</a>, the focus of the court’s review was misdirected. <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>That is because a capricious disregard analysis shifts the focus to the actions of the fact finder, rather than remain attentive to the sufficiency or credibility of the evidence presented. As the majority discerns, a capricious disregard analysis is an “appropriate component” of appellate consideration when undertaking a review pursuant to the substantial evidence standard of review. But it is only a mechanism to facilitate review. Because the capricious disregard analysis is applied to the findings of fact, credibility determinations and evidentiary weight of the proceedings at issue, it is not a standard of review but a tool to be utilized in determining that substantial evidence supports the ultimate determination. The substantial evidence standard is set forth in Section 5 of the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. § 704 and that is the standard we must apply.</p>
