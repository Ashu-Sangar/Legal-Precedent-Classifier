Counsel for James Strickler, Jr., (“James Jr.”) the baby allegedly injured by the medical malpractice of Appellee, Bharati Desai, M.D. (“Dr. Desai”) argues that the medical expenses of James Jr. were <em>not </em>caused by the malpractice of the doctor. The Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (the “Association”), the statutory guarantor of Physicians Insurance Company (“PIC”), Dr. Desai’s insurer, also makes an unusual argument. The insurer asserts that James Jr. and his parents (“Plaintiff-Appellants”) should be held to their claim that the doctor caused James Jr. to incur $459,728.24 in medical expenses. What could cause the planets to become so misaligned? The short answer is Section 991.1817(a), the non-duplication of recovery provision of the Pennsylvania Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association Act (the “Act”), 40 P.S. §§ 991.1801-1820.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

We, therefore, review the facts of the underlying medical malpractice action before proceeding with a discussion of the non-duplication of recovery provision of the Act.</p>

Specifically, at birth, his head was thirty-six point eight centimeters in circumference, a size that Appellants claimed was far in excess of normal. Appellants asserted that Dr. Desai should, have been concerned about this and the continued growth of James Jr.’s head over the ensuing eighteen months, and should have determined its cause. Appellants contend that Dr. Desai at the very least should have realized that James Jr. was having neurological problems when, at fourteen months of age, he started to experience trembling in his legs and would not crawl or pull himself up as he had been doing. Appellants claim that Dr. Desai wrongly focused on ear infections as the cause of the child’s problems and it was not until doctors at the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh examined James Jr. on February 27, 1996, that it was determined that he was suffering from hydrocephalus<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and a malignant brain <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>tumor, which had spread to the brain stem. Appellants claimed that, as a result of Dr. Desai’s malpractice, James Jr. suffered, among other things, severe neurological damage, hydrocephalus, malignant tumor growth, physical and mental pain, and (most importantly to this case) medical expenses, which, at the time of the filing of the pretrial statement in March of 1999, were purported to be $459,728.24.</p>
    <p id="b709-4" data-blocks='[["BL_709.5",709,[156,694,1157,1048]]]'>Dr. Desai saw things quite differently. Her experts were prepared to refute the allegations that she was negligent. Dr. Desai asserted that although James Jr.’s head was large, it was in proportion with his body. Furthermore, Dr. Desai claimed that the Appellants’ experts did not rely on the most accurate growth chart to evaluate the head size of James Jr. Dr. Desai’s experts referred to a chart developed by the federal government, which showed that James Jr.’s head was in the seventy-fifth percentile and not the ninety-eighth percentile as the experts for Appellants had asserted. Dr. Desai also contended that at the age of one year, a physical examination did not disclose any neurological problems and that on November 30, 1995, Dr. Desai noted her concern about the child and recorded that the child needed “close following.” However, notwithstanding her request to see the child again in two weeks, James Jr. was not brought in to see Dr. Desai again until January 26, 1996, at which time she correctly started the process necessary for the February, 1996 admission of James Jr. to the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, where his problems were diagnosed.</p>

    <p id="b710-5" data-blocks='[["BL_710.5",710,[265,928,1164,421]]]'>The settlement was complicated, however, by the fact that PIC had become insolvent during the pendency of the action.

(R. 93a-99a). On February 2, 2000, the Association petitioned for, and the trial court granted it, leave to intervene. (R. 117a-121a, 131a). The Association refused to pay because it claimed that it was entitled to reduce the amount of its obligation by the amount Appellants received from Aetna. The Association explained that Appellants already received payment of medical expenses in excess of the amount that the Association was obligated to pay. (R. 127a). The Association reasoned that because Aetna had already reimbursed Appellants for the medical expenses they sought in the medical malpractice action, requiring the Association to make the $200,000.00 settlement payment would <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>result in duplicate payments to Appellants for the same expense, a result specifically prohibited by the non-duplication of recovery provisions of 40 P.S. § 991.1817(a). Tracking the words of the statute, the Association argued that any amount payable on a covered claim, including the current claim against the Association, must be reduced by the amount of the recovery from other insurance, which it argued should include the Aetna policy. (R. 127a). Because Aetna paid Appellants an amount greater than the amount the Association was required to pay pursuant to its statutory obligation to PIC, the Association claimed no additional payment was required. Specifically, the Association argued that the amount it would have had to pay was properly reduced to zero by the amount Aetna paid on behalf of Appellants.</p>
    <p id="b711-4" data-blocks='[["BL_711.4",711,[164,1068,1157,309]]]'>Appellants disagreed. They argued that the amount of medical expenses would have been the same regardless of the medical malpractice because the treatment for the underlying condition and the malpractice injury were the same. (R. 98a, ¶ 13). In their petition for approval of the settlement agreement, Appellants summarized their position as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b711-5" data-blocks='[["BL_711.5",711,[206,1393,1115,251]]]'>[the Association] is not entitled to the offset because none of the medical expenses are recoverable in this action due to the fact that all of the medical treatment provided to minor plaintiff would have been required irrespective of the negligence of the defendant.</blockquote>

To the contrary, I believe that Appellants’ claim may be defined by the record that existed at the time this case settled, and as such, does not include those medical expenditures. Thus, I would conclude that pursuant to 40 P.S. § 991.1817(a), the Association is not entitled to offset the amount that Appellants received from Aetna, their health care insurer, to pay for the medical treatment James Strickler, Jr. (“James Jr.”) received when his condition was diagnosed.</p>

On January 31, 1997, Appellants filed a complaint against Dr. Bharati Desai for medical malpractice. In their Complaint, Appellants alleged that Dr. Desai negligently failed to recognize that James Jr. suffered from a malignant brain tumor, and that Dr. Desai’s negligence caused James Jr. to suffer severe neurological damage, developmental delay, hydrocephalus, malignant tumor growth, and the increased likelihood of metastatic cancer. Appellants further alleged that the results of Dr. Desai’s negligence included and will include expenses for James Jr.’s medical treatment, physical and mental pain, inconvenience, humiliation, impairment of earning powers, and loss of the pleasures of life.</p>
