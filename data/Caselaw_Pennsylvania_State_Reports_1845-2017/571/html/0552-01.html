Pursuant to regulations (“Regulations”) promulgated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), the appellant, the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (“Authority”), terminated Appellee’s assistance when two members of her family engaged in violent criminal activity. Concluding that the Regulations as written are excessive in scope, the Commonwealth Court held that a public housing agency (“PHA”) may terminate Section 8 benefits only for that violent criminal activity which threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or which threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the Section 8 dwelling.

Nevertheless, the Commonwealth Court did not do so.

If HUD had burdened a PHA’s authority to terminate such benefits with 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(i)(5)’s standard, HUD would have required a PHA to continue in its Section 8 program some of the very same persons it had authorized the PHA to exclude. Moreover, because a participant may move from unit to unit with his Section 8 assistance, HUD was concerned that if a PHA could only terminate benefits when a participant engaged in violent criminal activity “on or near the premises”, a participant whose violent criminal activity occurred elsewhere would not only continue to receive Section 8 subsidies when his lease ended, but would also be able to move to a subsidized unit in another locality. For HUD, such a result was understandably unacceptable. We, therefore, reject Appellee’s contention that the Rule reflects a fatal lapse in HUD’s reasoning.</p>

As we also noted, when HUD issued the Rule, it believed that the Rule’s policies would further the Housing Act’s objectives because those who wish to participate and remain in Section 8 programs would be encouraged to refrain from violent criminal activity. <a href="/citations/?q=55%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028538" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="55 Fed. Reg. 28538">55 Fed. Reg. at 28538-39</a>. We find HUD’s views in this regard to be reasonable. Because under the Regulations, PHAs are given relatively wide latitude to exclude violent criminal actors from Section 8 programs, where benefits attach to tenants, it is reasonable for HUD to expect that the distribution oi' benefits, the pool of owners in the private sector who are willing to consider renting to Section 8 participants, and the quality and safety of Section 8 housing are all greatly enhanced.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>
