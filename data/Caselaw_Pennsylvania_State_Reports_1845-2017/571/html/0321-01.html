The surveyor therefore concluded that the Gahagens’ property extended over such visible line, and this was confirmed in a subsequent survey commissioned by the Zeglins. The Gahagens notified the Zeglins that a portion of their driveway encroached on their land, removed the bushes, and constructed a retaining wall adjacent to the surveyed boundary. The Zeglins responded by filing a complaint against the Gahagens sounding in ejectment and trespass and claiming ownership up to the line previously demarcated by the bushes, utility pole, and fence. In furtherance of this position, the Zeglins relied, <em>inter alia, </em>on the doctrine of acquiescence in a boundary, alleging that their occupancy and possession, together with that of their predecessors in title, for a period of more than twenty-one years established the visible line as the legal boundary. The Gahagens filed an answer and counterclaim.</p>

      <em>Zeglin v. Gahagen, </em>No. 869 Civ.1999, <em>slip op. </em>at 4 (C.P. Somerset Feb. 10, 2000) (Gibson, J.) (“Common Pleas Court Opinion”) (quoting <em>Berzonski v. Holsopple, </em>28 Som. Leg. J. 842, 358 (1973) (Coffroth, P.J.)). The court identified as the basis for the principle public policy favoring peace and the repose of titles. It reasoned that, for a period of more than twenty-one years, the Zeglins, the Gahagens, and their predecessors in interest had recognized and acquiesced in a boundary line demarcated by the hedgerow (and also highlighted by the fence maintained by the Zeglins through a portion of that time period). Although the Zeglins had occupied the property for only eighteen years prior to the Gahagens’ actions, the court permitted them to tack the period of ownership by the Murphys, despite the fact that Cora Murphy had not specifically and formally conveyed her purported interest in the disputed tract to the Zeglins in the written deed. As pertains to tacking under the doctrine of adverse possession, the court recognized the requirement in Pennsylvania of privity of estate, namely, a higher degree of relation than that of mere grantor and grantee of a main parcel, generally comprised of specific and formal conveyance of the predecessor’s interest in the disputed tract where the transfer is between unrelated parties. <em>See </em>Common Pleas Court Opinion, <em>slip op. </em>at 15 (quoting <em>Baylor v. Soska, </em><a href="/pa/540/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="540 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="472208" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0435-01">540 Pa. 435</a>, 438-39, <a href="/pa/540/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="658 A.2d 743" data-case-ids="472208,7872043" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0435-01,/a2d/658/0743-01">658 A.2d 743</a>, 744-45 (1995)). The common pleas court found, however, that Pennsylvania courts had distinguished acquiescence in a boundary by applying the less rigorous requirement of privity of possession to claims predicated on such theory. <em>See id. </em>at 5 <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>(“Pennsylvania courts have adopted the view that succeeding owners of property are bound by the fences that were accepted and recognized by former owners even without any other privity or formal transfer of the area possessed adversely.” (citing <em>Berzonski, </em>28 Som.

The Zeglins distinguish <em>Plott v. Cole, </em>cited by the Superior Court, as allowing for creation of privity by “other acts,” and not solely by references culled from a deed. The Gahagens concede that the privity of estate requirement has not expressly been attached by Pennsylvania courts in acquiescence cases, but contend that such a requirement would alleviate confusion among landowners.</p>
