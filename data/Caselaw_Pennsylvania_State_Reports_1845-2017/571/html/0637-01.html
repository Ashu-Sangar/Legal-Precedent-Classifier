The Commonwealth Court affirmed the trial court’s order. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the lower courts’ grant of the permanent injunction in favor of Buffalo Township.</p>

Shortly thereafter, certain property owners along the right-of-way, Appellants herein, erected barriers to prevent passage on the newly developed trails asserting that Conrail had abandoned the right-of-way and thus, the right-of-way reverted to them. Buffalo Township then filed a complaint in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County and simultaneously filed a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin Appellants from erecting barriers on its land.</p>

On July 31, 2000, the <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>trial court entered a final or permanent injunction<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> preventing Appellants from denying access to the trail in any manner. The trial court filed an opinion in support of its order. The court explained that Appellees demonstrated a clear right to relief, since Conrail did not abandon the railway. Further, under the National Act, a conversion of property from a railroad to trail use did not constitute abandonment. Accordingly, Buffalo Township properly acquired Conrail’s interest in the property.</p>

The court deferred to the trial court’s determination that Conrail had not abandoned the right-of-way, concluding that Appellants could not meet their burden of demonstrating that the lower court abused its discretion. Additionally, the court held that Buffalo Township was not required to obtain ICC approval for the interim trail use so long as it in fact complied with the requirements of the National Act. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court determined that the trial court’s order granting “injunctive relief enjoining Property Owners from interfering with the public’s use of the trail was appropriate.” <em><a href="/a2d/778/1269-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="778 A.2d 1269" data-case-ids="9498251" data-case-paths="/a2d/778/1269-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/778/1269-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="778 A.2d 1269" data-case-ids="9498251" data-case-paths="/a2d/778/1269-01">at 1277</a>.</p>

According to Appellants, Conrail abandoned the property either when it filed a certificate of abandonment with the ICC or when it authorized salvage of the railroad tracks. Thus, Conrail had abandoned its interest in the property prior to the time it transferred its “interest”. Alternatively, upon transfer of the property, Conrail abandoned the property since its interest in the property was limited solely to railroad purposes. Further, Appellants maintain that the lower courts improperly relied upon the National Act in <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>determining that the property was not abandoned, since Conrail and Buffalo Township did not comply with the requirements of the National Act, and thus, that Act cannot preserve the transfer of the property to Buffalo Township. Accordingly, Appellants conclude that the property reverted to them under common law and the lower courts erred in granting the injunction in favor of Buffalo Township. Finally, Appellants assert that even if the property was not abandoned, the lower courts improperly granted the injunction, since Buffalo Township did not establish either a need for immediate relief or irreparable harm. Additionally, Appellants conclude that the trial court erred in failing to refer the abandonment issue to a jury-</p>

Further, the National Act and the State Act allows the transfer of the property. Alternatively, Buffalo Township offers that case law from Pennsylvania allows a railroad company to transfer the land to further a public use or purpose. In this case, the transfer served such purpose and thus, the property did not revert to the underlying landowners.</p>

The inescapable effect of these Acts is to allow a railroad company to transfer its possessory interest in the land, i.e., the right-of-way, to a third party for the limited purpose of interim recreational trail use. The interim trail user essentially holds the railroad company’s land in trust until the railroad needs to reactivate service on the rail line.

' However, the regulations have no effect on the substance of the trail use agreement, rather the substance of the agreement is governed by the requirements of <a href="/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201247" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="16 U.S.C. § 1247">16 U.S.C. § 1247</a>(d). In other words, the ICC’s action with regard to trail conversions amounts to no more than a “rubber stamp” authorizing trail conversions so long as the proposed trail user complies with the requirements of <a href="/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201247" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="16 U.S.C. § 1247">16 U.S.C. § 1247</a>(d). Section 1247(d) does not require that the proposed trail user file an application with the ICC. Rather, under section 1247(d), the right-of-way can be preserved so long as the interim use is subject to restoration or reconstruction by the railroad company and the trail user is willing to assume full managerial, financial and legal responsibility for the management of such rights-of-way and for any liability arising out of such transfer or use. Therefore, a railroad right-of-way can be converted to a recreational trail where there is a failure to file an application with the ICC, so long as the proposed trail user complies with the requirements of section 1247(d).</p>

Thus, the transfer complied with the requirements of section 1247(d). Additionally, the Butler <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>Branch is an established railroad right-of-way. <em>Southern Pacific, supra. </em>As such, the right-of-way can be preserved under the National Act. We refuse to nullify the trail conversion in this instance due to the Township’s failure to file an application with the ICC, especially where the ICC’s actions in this area amount to no more than a rubber stamp of the application filed by Buffalo Township. We appreciate that if Buffalo Township had not made the inexplicable decision to withdraw its application with the ICC, then the legal action in this case would have been unnecessary. Nevertheless, this lapse does not affect our legal determination that the transfer of the right-of-way to Buffalo Township was effective even in the absence of filing an application for interim trail use with the ICC. Our decision today furthers the legislative purpose to promote interim trail use in order to preserve the railroad company’s interest in the property, since Buffalo Township will preserve the right-of-way for the railroad company’s future use. Thus, contrary to Appellants’ argument, the land did not revert to them and the trial court properly enjoined Appellants from interfering with Buffalo Township’s property interest.</p>

However, as noted above, the test for the issuance of the two types of injunctions is not the same. While we do not question the standard as it relates to preliminary injunctions, we do not agree that this standard is appropriate for permanent injunctions. Ultimately, the grant or denial of a permanent injunction will turn on whether the lower court properly found that the party seeking the injunction established a clear right to relief as a matter of law.

If a clear legal right to the property exists then an action in equity is proper. <em><a href="/citations/?q=136%20A.2d%20832" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="136 A.2d 832">Id.</a> </em>As the dissent acknowledges, the trial court concluded that the facts were clear and there was no room for doubt and thus, Appellee properly invoked the equitable jurisdiction of the trial court. Dissenting slip opinion at 2. Our appellate review confirms the trial court’s decision and we likewise conclude that Appellee had a clear legal right to the possessory property interest in this case.</p>

The question in that case was whether the court must rule upon possession before determining whether an Action in Ejectment lies in a particular case. We are not entertaining a similar issue in this case.</p>

Indeed, in the present case, the common pleas court recognized the salient restrictions on its equitable jurisdiction, but merely circumvented them by indicating that the facts were clear and there was no room for doubt. <em>See Buffalo Twp. v.

However, the question whether title reverted to Appellants by virtue of an abandonment of Conrail’s right-of-way appears to have been keenly disputed, is treated as a fact-laden issue by the majority, and is itself within the range of issues in a land title controversy that must be determined by a jury. <em>See generally Quarry Office Park Assoc. v.

However, the common pleas court made no specific finding in this respect, and, although the record is somewhat vague on the point, there appears to be evidence that one or more of Appellants may have held actual possession for a substantial time period, including in the relevant time frame. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., May 24, 2000, at 21, 26, 64, 68; N.T., July 5, 2000, at 131, 154, 171-72; <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>N.T., Jul. 24, 2000, at 11, 15, 24, 29.
