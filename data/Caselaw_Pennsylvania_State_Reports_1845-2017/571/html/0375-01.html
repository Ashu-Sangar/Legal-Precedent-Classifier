In its independent analysis of the question, the Majority explicitly relied upon the reasoning in the <em>Barnes </em>dissent, which it quoted. <em><a href="/a2d/719/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="719 A.2d 273" data-case-ids="11673504,11673597,356219,356270" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0273-01,/a2d/719/0273-02,/pa/553/0347-01,/pa/553/0348-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/719/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="719 A.2d 273" data-case-ids="11673504,11673597,356219,356270" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0273-01,/a2d/719/0273-02,/pa/553/0347-01,/pa/553/0348-01">at 279</a>.

The Majority then proceeded to an “independent analysis” of the strict scrutiny issue, again invoking Justice White’s dissent in <em>Barnes </em>as persuasive authority, and concluded that the statute was not narrowly drawn to accomplish a compelling governmental interest. In this regard, the Majority noted that there were several narrower methods available to combat the feared secondary effects that would not involve barring the expressive activity of nude dancing. <a href="/a2d/719/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="719 A.2d 273" data-case-ids="11673504,11673597,356219,356270" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0273-01,/a2d/719/0273-02,/pa/553/0347-01,/pa/553/0348-01">719 A.2d at 280</a>.

It is only because nude dancing performances may generate emotions and feelings of eroticism and sensuality among the spectators that the State seeks to regulate such expressive activity, apparently on the assumption that creating or emphasizing such thoughts and ideas in the minds of the spectators may lead to increased prostitution and the degradation of women.

As such, expressive conduct, in Erie’s view, should be subject to reasonable regulation without that regulation being deemed to have an impermissible impact on the communicative nature of the conduct.

Such unexplained decisions following the <em>Barnes </em>plurality are not persuasive reasons to adopt a similar approach under Article I, § 7. <em>See Edmunds, </em><a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="203" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">586 A.2d at 900</a>. This is particularly so given the very, factors which led to the complication in <em>Pap’s I, i.e., </em>the inability of the U.S. Supreme Court to arrive at a majority approach to the question. In addition, the considerations already detailed above, including Pennsylvania’s strong tradition of independent interpretation of its Declaration of Rights in general, and Article I, § 7, in particular, make these cases unpersuasive. This <em>Edmunds </em>factor is, at best, equivocal.</p>

Tate, </em><a href="/pa/495/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="204" data-cite="495 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1770779" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0158-01">495 Pa. 158</a>, 168-171, <a href="/pa/495/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="205" data-cite="495 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1770779" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0158-01">432 A.2d 1382</a>, 1387-88 (1981). I am thus reluctant to accord the prior cases controlling significance where, as here, the regulation at issue facially applies to conduct. Moreover, I would give some weight to the stated purpose of the ordinance, namely, to combat the negative secondary effects of crime caused by the presence of adult entertainment establishments, and evaluate the ordinance under the intermediate scrutiny test articulated in <em>United States v. O’Brien, </em><a href="/us/391/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="391 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="1767540" data-case-paths="/us/391/0367-01">391 U.S. 367</a>, 377, <a href="/us/391/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="207" data-cite="391 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="1767540" data-case-paths="/us/391/0367-01">88 S.Ct. 1673</a>, 1679, <a href="/us/391/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="208" data-cite="391 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="1767540" data-case-paths="/us/391/0367-01">20 L.Ed.2d 672</a> (1968).</p>
    <p id="b496-6" data-blocks='[["BL_496.6",496,[280,1290,1167,1065]]]'>Nevertheless, as the majority notes, there are legitimate concerns with “unmentioned purposes” of regulations such as the one at issue here and the extent to which protected expression may be impacted. Rather than extending the strict scrutiny test to this area, however, I would adopt as a matter of our constitutional jurisprudence under Article I, Section 7, the more stringent application of the <em>O’Brien </em>test proposed by Mr. Justice Souter in his concurring opinion in <em>City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., </em><a href="/us/529/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="209" data-cite="529 U.S. 277" data-case-ids="9508427" data-case-paths="/us/529/0277-01">529 U.S. 277</a>, 310-13, <a href="/us/529/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="210" data-cite="529 U.S. 277" data-case-ids="9508427" data-case-paths="/us/529/0277-01">120 S.Ct. 1382</a>, 1402-04, <a href="/us/529/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="211" data-cite="529 U.S. 277" data-case-ids="9508427" data-case-paths="/us/529/0277-01">146 L.Ed.2d 265</a> (2000) (Souter, J., concurring), and require an evidentiary basis for the alleged secondary effects and the remedial effect of the proposed regulation. Such requirement, in my view, adequately accommodates the historic concerns of Article I, Section 7, and appropriately balances legitimate governmental interests with the points articulated by the majority. As the record in this case is insufficiently developed under this standard, I would remand to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Accord City of Erie v.
