On direct appeal, this Court affirmed appellant’s convictions but vacated the sentences of death and remanded for a new sentencing hearing. The Court did so because the trial court’s penalty phase jury instruction pertaining to one of the three aggravating circumstances unanimously found by the jury— specifically, that the offense was committed by means of torture — was found to be “prejudicially deficient.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant (who has made no proffer as to what trial counsel would say in response to his averment of counsel’s incompetence in this regard) has not demonstrated that trial counsel lacked an objectively reasonable basis for failing to produce this evidence. As the PCRA court noted in its opinion, appellant’s adjustment to prison life was not nearly so “sterling” as appellant alleges. Appellant belatedly submitted voluminous prison records to the PCRA court on June 20, 1997, after the court had announced its intention to dismiss his petition. While, certain aspects of these records indicated a <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>positive adjustment to prison life, other aspects were indeed not nearly so positive. For example, the records revealed that appellant had been cited for misconduct on several occasions, at least some of which were deemed “very serious misconducts;” he had been subject to “disciplinary time” for approximately five months in 1989; on one occasion, he was “less than truthful with [the Program Review Committee] and denied having anything to do with [a] confiscated weapon or handcuff key;” he was denied television and radio privileges due to “past misconducts for abusing/modiiying his antennas;” and, on another occasion, “refused to even discuss why he had pieces of aerial and two lengths of antenna” indicating that he “did the time” and therefore did not have to discuss the infraction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Given that the evidence respecting appellant’s adjustment to prison life cut both ways, counsel can hardly be deemed constitutionally incompetent for failing to produce it.</p>

In this regard, it is notable that the equivocal prison record evidence, had it been introduced, would have sounded under the catch-all mitigating circumstance, which the jury in fact found in appellant’s second penalty phase hearing.

Moreover, both the court’s docket and various stenographic attestations on the transcripts themselves indicate that these notes were part of the record that was forwarded to this Court on direct appeal. Thus, appellant’s bald accusation that prior counsel ineffectively failed to secure the notes, and thus rendered himself unable even to consider raising claims relating to the <em>voir dire </em>he had conducted — an accusation that, once again, was not accompanied by any proffer as to what counsel would have said in response to the accusation — unquestionably is meritless.</p>

Moreover, even if appellant had proved that counsel knew of Mason’s changed story and failed to present it, appellant has failed to show how that decision was objectively unreasonable. Given Mason’s status as a. convicted co-conspirator, the fact that he had nothing to lose at that point by attempting to help his cohort, and the rather transparent unreliability of this sort of recantation evidence, appellant cannot prove counsel was obliged to present such evidence or that he was prejudiced by its absence.</p>
