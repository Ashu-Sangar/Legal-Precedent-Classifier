In brief, the trial evidence showed that appellant was the leader of the “Junior Black Mafia” (JBM), an organization which distributed drugs within Philadelphia. Appellant orchestrated the murder of Brian Kennedy in order to avenge the death of Leroy Davis, another high-ranking member of the JBM, who was believed by the organization to have been murdered by Brian Thornton. However, Thornton was incarcerated when appellant planned his revenge. Thus, appellant and his co-defendants decided to “hit” Thornton’s cousin, Kennedy, in order to <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>avenge Davis’ death and to send a message to Thornton that killing a fellow JBM member would not go unpunished.

Appellant faults counsel for failing to argue that the evidence did not support the § (d)(10) aggravator because the scope of the provision is ambiguous. Specifically, appel<a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>lant argues that § (d)(10) is unclear because it requires that the defendant be convicted of another offense where a sentence of “life imprisonment or death” was imposable. Appellant notes that his federal offense exposed him only to a sentence of life imprisonment, and not death; therefore, he claims, the statutory aggravating circumstance was not implicated. However, the disjunctive language in § (d)(10) is clear and unambiguous. Previous convictions qualify if they exposed the defendant to <em>either </em>life imprisonment or death. The statute does not require that <em>both </em>life imprisonment and death be sentencing options for any particular offense to qualify. Moreover, even if appellant’s construction of the statute were someday accepted, his claim of counsel ineffectiveness would fail because counsel’s performance must be measured by the legal landscape in existence at the time counsel had to act. Appellant cites no cases, and our research has uncovered none, that command his strained construction of the statute even now, much less in 1995 when counsel filed the brief on direct appeal. Counsel cannot be faulted for failing to advance a novel legal theory which has never been accepted by the pertinent courts. <em>See Commonwealth v.
