        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County which dismissed preliminary objections to a \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d filed by the Redevelopment Authority of the City of Lancaster [Authority].\nOn April 9, 1965, the Authority filed a \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d of certain properties in the second block of North Queen Street in the City of Lancaster [City].' The reason underlying such condemnation was' to accomplish the alleged public purpose of carrying into effect a duly approved proposal and plan for the redevelopment of an area which had been certified as a blighted area by the Planning Commission of the City. One of the properties affected by the Commission\u2019s plan was property located at 170-172 North Queen Street owned by one Tony Faranda, a property improved with a three story brick granite building utilized by Faranda as a taproom with family living quarters on the second and third floors.\nOn May 7, 1965 \u2014 29 days after service of notice upon him \u2014 Faranda filed preliminary objections to the \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d. The court below then granted the Authority leave to file an amended \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d to change one of the averments complained of by Faranda in his original objections. An amended \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d was filed on May 19, 1965, to which Faranda again filed preliminary objections, wherein one of the prior objections was again raised, and three new objections were interposed. The court en banc dismissed the preliminary objections.\nInitially, it must be noted that we have recently held that preliminary objections constitute the exclusive method of challenging condemnation proceedings under the new Eminent Domain Code, infra; Mahan v. Lower Merion Township, 418 Pa. 558, 212 A. 2d 217.\nFaranda\u2019s first preliminary objection is directed to the adequacy of the description of the purpose of the condemnation contained in the \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d. Faranda urges that, since the \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d fails to state eo nomine that the purpose of the condemnation is the elimination of a blighted area, the \u201cdeclaration\u201d is defective under the statutory mandate set forth in the Eminent Domain Code (Act of June 22, 1964, P. L. 84, 26 P.S. \u00a71-402(b) (4)), which provides that the \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d shall contain \u201ca brief description of the purpose :\u00f3f.the condemnation and the-need therefor.\u201d The lower court, in dismissing this-objection, held that an examination of the language of the \u201cdeclaration\u201d indicated that there was a sufficient statement of the purpose of the condemnation'to satisfy the statutory requirement. With such conclusion we agree.\n' In compliance with the statute, the Authority prepared it's \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d to read as follows: \u201c4. That the condemnation by the Redevelopment Authority was in order to accomplish the public purpose of carrying into effect the duly approved proposal and plan for the redevelopment of the North Queen Street Project known as Project No. R-178, located in the First Ward of the City of Lancaster, County of Lancaster and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [Emphasis supplied]. 5. The purpose of the condemnation is to acquire the properties located within the area certified as blighted by the Planning Commission of the City of Lancaster in order that said areas may be replanned and redeveloped to promote the public health, safety, convenience and' welfare. [Emphasis supplied]. 6. The property of the owner as shown in the caption is located within the said blighted area and is needed by the\" Redevelopment Authority in order to properly carry out the duly approved plan for the redevelopment of the said area and project.\u201d ' (Emphasis supplied).\nWhile the \u201cdeclaration\u201d does not employ the word \u201celimination\u201d, it does aver that the purpose of the \u201ctaking\u201d is to-effectuate'the approved proposal and plan of redeveloping North Queen Street, a certified blighted area. The end result would be the elimination of the alleged blighted area.\n\\This view of the sufficiency of language of the \u201cdeclaration of -taking\u201d is reinforced by the statutory definition of \u201credevelopment\u201d, a term repeatedly used, as we have noted, in the \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d. The definition, of \u201credevelopment\u201d in the Urban Redevelopment-Law\"'(Act Of May 24, 1945, P. L;' 991, \u00a73, 35 P'.S. \u00a717.03,(m)) remove's any doubt that the effect of the-proposed redevelopment of the area would be the elimination of the blighted structures located therein. Th\u00e9' statute states: \u201c(m) \u2018Redevelopment\u2019 \u2014 Undertakings and activities for the elimination of blighted areas. Such undertakings and activities may include the planing, replanning, acquisition, rehabilitation, improvement, clearance, sale, lease or other disposition of land, buildings or other improvements in blighted areas, or portions thereof . . . [Emphasis supplied].\u201d This statutory \u2019 definition lends support to the conclusion that the Authority was using the -term \u201credevelopment\u201d: in its \u201cdeclaration of taking\u201d in the statutory sense and that the averment is sufficient to meet the statutory requirements. For the'- above reasons ' Faranda\u2019s preliminary objection in-this respect is without merit and was properly dismissed.\n'The second objection.' urged by Faranda is that the Authority lacked the power to \u2022 take his property b\u00e9cause, at the time of taking, the Authority had-neither selected a redeveloper nor had entered into-a redevelopment contract. In this connection, it must 'be noted that, by stipulation, the parties agreed that, subsequent to the taking, a redeveloper had- been selected, but -the lack of a redevelopment contract -is still urged by Faranda as fatal to the power of taking.\n.The. Authority is given the power of eminent domain under the Urban Redevelopment Law, supra. There is no requirement in this statute that a -redeveloper must be chosen or that a contract be entered into with a redeveloper for the re-use of the- land as prerequisites before the Authority can condemn\u2019 property. Similarly, the Eminent, Domain Code of 1984, supra, which neither enlarges nor diminishes the power of condemnation given by law to'the condemnor (\u00a7402); is\u2019.-eqjially: silent as-to -th\u00e9 st\u00e9ps- that Faranda- urges' ar\u00e9 prerequisites to..taking. \u2019 Both -of these\u2018Statutes' find their bases in the\u2019\u2018provisions of the-Constitution of Pennsylvania Article\u201d I, \u00a710' Which requires- that private-property be taken only, for public -use.\u201d This constitutionally mandated requirement' sets no order' of activity in the condemnation of property so long as the purpose of the condemnation satisfies the.constitutional and statutory requirements.\nThus, it seems painfully clear that there is neither decisional nor statutory authority to sustain Faranda\u2019s contention. In sustaining the lower court\u2019s dismissal of this objection, we are mindful of.the words of this court in Blumenschein v. Pittsburgh Housing Authority, 379 Pa. 566, 572, 573, 109 A. 2d 331: \u201c By a host of authorities in our own and other jurisdictions (citing cases) it has been established, as an elementary principle of law that courts will not review the actions of governmental bodies or administrative tribunals involving acts of discretion, in the absence of bad faith, fraud, capricious action or abuse of power; they will not inquire into the wisdom of such actions or into the details of the manner adopted to carry them into execution . . (Emphasis supplied). In the absence of a showing of any fraud, abuse of discretion or bad faith, Faranda\u2019s .objection must be dismissed.\nFaranda\u2019s final objection raises a more difficult and novel question. By his preliminary objections, Faranda has challenged the Authority\u2019s power and right to condemn the property in .question by his assertion that the said property is not, in fact, blighted. Since the condemnation of property is limited by our Constitution, supra, to a taking for a public use and since the only basis for the Authority\u2019s present taking is that the' elimination of a blighted area is such a public use (Belovsky v. Redevelopment Authority of Philadelphia) 357 Pa. 329, 54 A. 2d 277), Faranda seeks to show that the area is not blighted thereby' negativing the power or right of the Authority to condemn. The Authority counters by saying that an action in equity rather than a preliminary objection is the proper procedural method to follow in challenging the Authority\u2019s taking. In the Authority\u2019s view, a preliminary objection should be limited to attacking the wisdom, rather than the lawfulness, of the condemnation.\n\" An examination of the language of \u00a7406(a) of the Eminent Domain Code, supra, clearly substantiates the soundness of the view urged upon this court by Faranda: That section provides: \u201c. . . -Preliminary objections shall be limited to and-shall be the exclusive method of challenging (1) the paver or right of the condemnor t\u00f3 appropriate the condemned property unless the same has been\u2018.previously adjudicated . . (Emphasis supplied). See also: Snitzer, Pennsylvania Eminent Domain, \u00a7406.1 Wherein the- author says-: \u201cSection 406 specifically provides that-the filing of preliminary objections shall be the sole and exclusive, remedy available to condemnees to challenge the condemnation. (As the comment .notes indicate, the intent of this section is.to provide the.\u2018exclusive method of challenging the-power to-condemn, the sufficiency of the security, the declaration of taking and procedure . . Thus it-.is clear;-that 'the' new Eminent Domain Code, sets forth a complet\u00e9 and exclusive method of challenging' the taking; -The Authority\u2019s argument suffers from the inherent fallacy, of. urging that Earand\u00e1- is questioning not the power of the Authority to condemn but rather the wisdom -of the action it has taken. As we have said, supra, the..taking is constitutional only if it is for a public, use if the purpose is not for a public, use, the taking is unconstitutional. Herein, the Authority bottoms its public use in declaring- the area involved to be blighted; a determination challenged by Fararida, thereby making the thrust of Faranda\u2019s attack directly to the Authority\u2019s power, not to its wisdom. McSorley v. Fitzgerald, 359 Pa. 264, 59 A. 2d 142; Belovsky, supra; Ormsby Land Co. v. Pittsburgh, 276 Pa. 68, 119 A. 730.\nThe Authority urges that Earanda\u2019s remedy is by a suit in equity. However, we have recently held - that a court of equity has no jurisdiction to determine whether a municipal, authority has the right of eminent domain or whether it has properly exercised any right of eminent domain; Cunfer v. Carbon Airport Authority, 414 Pa. 408, 200 A. 2d 768. See also Balazick v. Dunkard-Bobtown Municipal Authority, 414 Pa. 182, 199 A. 2d 430. Similarly, the many cases cited by the Authority in its brief for the proposition that equity is the proper forum are not controlling in that such cases were decided prior to the passage of the present Eminent Domain Code.\nBy the clear language of the statute, the legislature has mandated that preliminary objections constitute the exclusive method of challenging the power of the condemnor to take private property. Faranda has challenged the Authority\u2019s right to condemn and has raised this challenge properly through the medium of preliminary objections. \u201cIt is a commonplace that where the legislature has provided a remedy or procedure, that remedy or procedure is exclusive and alone must be' pursued.\u201d Schwab v. Pottstown Borough, 407 Pa. 531, 534, 180 A. 2d 921, 923; Cunfer v. Carbon Airport Authority, supra; Jacobs v. Fetzer, 381 Pa. 262, 112 A. 2d 356.\nThe lower court erred in dismissing this objection of Faranda and the case must be remanded with directions to the lower court to take testimony, by deposition or otherwise, on the question of whether the area herein involved is in fact blighted.\nOrder vacated.

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell :\nI concur in the remand, but deem it desirable to express the reasons for my views.\nIt is important to recognize at the very outset that the Urban Redevelopment Law and the enormous powers ostensibly granted therein must be carefully examined in the light of the Constitution of the United States and of Pennsylvania which ordain and guarantee the right of private property. Article I, \u00a71, of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides: \u201cAll men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness.\u201d Nevertheless the Authority contends that the Act gives the sovereign power of eminent domain to these few appointed persons to condemn not only every property which they believe is dilapidated, but also every area or region which they believe contains some dilapidated properties. For these reasons as well as several others which will be discussed, the Act and its claimed wide powers must be strictly construed.\nOne of the most highly prized Constitutional rights of every American citizen is the right to own and possess his own home! It may be large, medium or small, it may be one or two or three stories; it may be a ranch house or a row house, or a hut; or, in the eyes of some, it may be attractive or ugly, but it is yours and if you like it or love it, why should anyone or any political body have a right to take it from you in order to make it or the area in which it is situate more economically prosperous?\nStripped of its attractive tinsel and pretty trappings, this blighted area Act, supra, as frequently interpreted by some non-elected non-sovereign Redevelopment Authorities, is one of the most unjust and unwise Acts ever passed. This Act does not cover or even pertain to the elimination of slums as in the Slum Clearance Act, i.e., Housing Authorities Law of 1937. The Act is so broad that it does not limit' 'the'. Authority\u2019s power to condemn and take, suck-properties : as- are dilapidated, but, we repeat, permits the.taking of a..large area in which only a few properties .\u2019\u00e1re dilapidated, Moreover, realistically-speaking,., it has: nothing., to:-.do with-the public safety, or health,-or morals:; Its areal and- practical purpose\u2019 and.intent,, although.-cloaked in the-spurious guise-of public welfare,' is to-make a,nyandevery community it chooses to..denominate \u201cdilapidated\u201d more economically' prosperous'' no matter .what heartbreaks it brings to home-o.wners.or losses to bush nessmen. For example, a husband and wife,-or a widow, may love their home and like their neighborhood,-but now because of the theories of well-meaning: or stargazing planners, they have to move to a. distant.place and start life all over again among- strangers: And what happens to a little neighborhood business\u2019.man Who loses his home and his business and Ms customers? What will recompense a liquor -licensee- (whose business is subject to a quota system)-, when he cannot get.. a license\u2019 in the new location to which,-because-of- the Redevelopment Authority, he is compelled to move?-' And what about churches? Even churches and-other houses of worship are not exempt from. the ceaseless craving of many for material prosperity and for /constantly -expanding political power. \u2019 Too often,' the planners consider themselves \u201cSolomons,\u201d with unbounded,\u2019 unfet-, tered and limitless discretionary pow\u00e9r \u2018.to appropriate and condemn as dilapidated (1) any and every property they believe is dilapidated,- and (2) as-large an area as they believe can be made economically more prosperous, In their desire for. greater economic prosperity, \u2019 these planners do not hesitate to tear. down and destroy churches in.any area which they -may deem \u201cblighted/\u2019See, for example, St. Peter\u2019s Roman Catholic Parish v. Urban Redevelopment Authority, 394 Pa. 194, 146 A. 2d 724. In that case, the Urban Redevelopment Authority condemned and destroyed, in the name of \u201ceconomic convenience and progress,\u201d St. Peter\u2019s Church in Pittsburgh, which was considered by many to be the most beautiful Catholic Church in America.\nAs this Court aptly said in Schwartz v. Urban Redevelopment Authority, 411 Pa. 530, 192 A. 2d 371 (page 536) : \u201cThis Court has held that the mushrooming of authorities at all levels of government and the frequent complaints that the agencies arbitrarily or capriciously and unintentionally ignore or violate rights which are ordained or guaranteed by the Federal and State Constitutions and established law make it imperative that a check rein be kept upon them. Keystone Raceway Corp. v. State Harness Racing Commission, 405 Pa. 1, 173 A. 2d 97 (1961).\u201d\nThese are some of the reasons why this \u201cblighted area\u201d Act and the powers granted therein must, in the light of the Constitutional guarantee of private property and the American heritage of individual Freedom, be searchingly scrutinized and strictly construed. This, the lower Court failed to do.\nI concur in the remand.\nAct of May 24, 1945, P. L. 991, 35 P.S. \u00a71701 et seq.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nAct of May 28, 1937, P.
