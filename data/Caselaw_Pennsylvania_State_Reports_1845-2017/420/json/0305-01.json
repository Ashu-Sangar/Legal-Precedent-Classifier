        "text": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,-\nOur previous opinion in this case sets forth the nature, issues, and background of the litigation and obviates the need for extended discussion in the present sequel. That opinion embodied the conclusion of this Court that certain acts of the \u2022 Legislature, providing for the apportionment of both houses of the General Assembly of this Commonwealth, resulted in ah impairment of the right to. vote in conflict with the Federal Constitution and controlling decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. We therefore held such acts invalid and void.\nHaving so concluded, this Court was thus confronted with the task of fashioning appropriate relief. We determined, however, that the imminence of the 1964 general election required the utilization of the apportionment plans contained in those acts, notwithstanding their invalidity, in order to prevent serious disruption of election processes and essential governmental functions. Moreover, we considered it appropriate that the Legislature, the organ of government with the primary responsibility for the task of reapportionment, be afforded an additional opportunity to enact a constitutional reapportionment plan.\nAccordingly, while retaining jurisdiction, we deferred further judicial action in order to afford an opportunity .for appropriate and timely legislation on the part of the General Assembly. To assist in that task, we set forth guidelines for constitutional reapportionment as mandated by the Federal Constitution and decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States.\nThus, our previous opinion invited and urged legislative action. And while we acknowledged the practical difficulties to be confronted, we expressed the hope that further judicial intervention would be rendered unnecessary by prompt constitutional legislation. At the same time, we sought to make clear that our reluctance to intrude into an area of primarily legislative responsibility would not deter this Court from proceeding with the task of reapportionment in the event that the Legislature failed to do so. We concluded, therefore, that should the Legislature fail to enact a constitutionally valid reapportionment \u201cnot later than September 1, 1965,\u201d this Court would take appropriate steps to ensure that the individual voters of this Commonwealth are afforded their constitutional right to cast an equally weighted vote.\nThe deadline set forth in our earlier opinion passed without enactment of the required legislation. Accordingly, pursuant to our retained jurisdiction, this Court issued an order on September 29, 1965 notifying the parties of our intention to proceed with the task of fashioning such affirmative relief as would be necessary to ensure a constitutionally valid legislative apportionment for the forthcoming primary and general elections.\nIn order to secure assistance in fashioning such relief, our order permitted the parties and all others in interest to submit proposals for the statewide reapportionment of both houses of the General Assembly. Thereafter, numerous and widely divergent plans were filed with this Court. Each proposal was carefully considered and evaluated in the course of our deliberation.\nIn the formulation of the reapportionment plans herein adopted, we have been guided by the dictates of the Federal Constitution and the controlling decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. Our primary concern has been to provide for substantial equality of population among legislative districts.. At the same time, we have sought to maintain the integrity of political subdivisions and to create compact districts of contiguous territory, insofar as these goals could'be realized under the circumstances of the population distribution Of this Commonwealth. We believe such plans to be constitutionally valid and sound. \u2022\nAccordingly, pursuant to' the mandate and principles set forth in our prior opinion, we hereby order that the attached Appendix A shall be the reapportionment plan for the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of - the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the forthcoming 1966 primary and general elections. We further order-that the attached Appendix B shall be the districting plan for the Senate of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the forthcoming 1966 primary and - general elections. The- districting plan contained in Appendix B is subject. to th\u00e9 following qualification and direction: the 50 senatorial\u2019 districts therein contained are hereby divided. into two classes, those districts designated by even numbers shall constitute one class and those districts designated by odd numbers' shall constitute the other class. All 50 senatorial seats shall be filled in the forthcoming election, but senators representing odd numbered senatorial\u2019 districts shall be elected to serve a; two year term and' senators representing even numbered -senatorial districts shall be elected to serve for a constitutional four year term.\nIt is further ordered that the plans set forth in Appendices A and'B and hereby adopted shall remain in force and effect until constitutionally altered.\nAPPENDIX A\nHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n, The House of Representatives shall be apportioned as follows:\n(1) The First Representative District shall consist of the first and second wards and the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth districts of the fifth ward of the City, of Erie, in the County of Erie.

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell:\nThe necessity for reapportioning and redistricting the Legislative and Senatorial Districts of Pennsylvania and also the House of Representatives in Congress was mandated by the Supreme Court of the United States in a series of cases commencing with Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186; Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 621; Lucas v. Colorado Gen. Assembly, 377 U.S. 713; WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 377 U.S. 633; Maryland Committee v. Tawes, 377 U.S. 656; Davis v. Mann, 377 U.S. 678; Roman v. Sincock, 377 U.S. 695; also Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1; Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, re. congressional districts.\nThese decisions, in effect, declared Unconstitutional not merely the insupportable Constitution of Georgia and a number of obviously gerrymandered districts in some States, but also (1) the Constitution of Pennsylvania (see Butcher v. Bloom, 415 Pa. 438, 203 A. 2d 556) and of nearly every State in our Country, as wen as (2) the composition of the House of Representatives in Congress.\nWhat is the New Law and What , are the New Standards?\nThe aforesaid decisions of the Supreme Court held: \u201c. . . that the Equal Protection Clause requires that a State make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts, in both houses of. its legislature, as nearly of equal population as is practicable. We realize that it is a. practical impossibility to arrange legislative districts so that each one has an identical number of residents, or citizens, or voters. Mathematical exactness or precision is hardly a workable constitutional requirement.\n\u201cIn Wesberry v. Sanders, supra, [376 U.S. 1, 7-8] the Court stated that congressional representation must be based on population as nearly as ..is practicable,\n\u201cA State may legitimately desire to maintain the integrity of various political subdivisions, insofar, as possible, and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory in designing a legislative apportionment scheme. Yalid considerations may underlie such aims....\n\u201c. . . Whatever the means of accomplishment, the overriding objective must be substantial equality of population among the various districts,...\n\u201c. . . So long as the divergences from a strict population standard are based on legitimate considerations incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy, some deviations from the equal-population principle are constitutionally permissible with respect to the apportionment of seats in either or both of the two houses of a bicameral state legislature.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (pages 577, 578, 579).\nFurthermore, there must be no invidious discrimination. Cf. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S., supra, pp. 566, 578; cf. also, Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 355; Baker v. Carr (Concurring Opinion by Douglas, J.), 369 U.S. 186, 244; Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17; Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541.\nIn other words, the Supreme Court held that each House of a State Legislature (a) must have substantial equality of population among the various districts, or districts of as nearly equal population as is practicable and (b) that \u00e1 State \u201cmay provide tor .compact districts of contiguous territory\u201d and (c) that there must be no invidious discrimination. These are the only standards specifically promulgated by the Supreme Court. Furthermore, the Court itself stated in Reynolds v. Sims (page 578) that these four standards were \u201conly a few rather general considerations which appear to us to be relevant.\u201d I am convinced (a) that these four standards are entirely insufficient -guideposts for a fair, just and clearly defined Constitutional plan of districting, and (b) that as nearly equal in-population as is practicable should be more definitely and precisely defined, and (c) that additional clear and necessary- guideposts must be erected. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S., supra, Dissenting Opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter (page 267); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S., supra, Dissenting Opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan (page 621). Moreover, the aforesaid four standards erected by the Supreme Court did not expressly preclude or prohibit a consideration of many other very important factors and the criteria some of which will be hereinafter discussed.\nThis Court, carrying out and implementing the aforesaid decisions, relevantly said in Butcher v. Bloom, 415 Pa., supra (page 463) : \u201cWe hold, therefore, that Article II, \u00a716 of the Pennsylvania Constitution requires that senatorial reapportionment legislation must maintain the integrity of counties and other political subdivisions, insofar as possible., and must provide for compact districts of contiguous territory., subject always to the overriding objective and mandate that such districts shall be \u2018as- nearly equal in population as may be.\u2019 We must emphasize that, if necessary, any political subdivision or subdivisions may be divided or combined in the formation of districts where the population principle cannot otherwise be satisfied. . .\u201d\nThe aforesaid new and novel interpretation of the Constitution of the United States by a majority of the Supreme Court is an abrupt and massive break with the past decisions of that Court, and, I am convinced, is contrary to the history and traditions of our Country and of nearly every State, and with due respect, finds no support in the language of the Constitution. The Court in effect completely changes the long and well established elective system of nearly all of our State Governments and of the House of Representatives, as well as the basic structure, doctrine and philosophy of our Republican form of Government.\nFurthermore, it can be fairly said that no decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the last hundred years has ever disturbed, dismayed and confused Congressmen, Legislators, Governors, Judges, lawyers and ordinary citizens as has the novel and revolutionary decision in the Reynolds group of cases. It seems to have been forgotten that the form and scheme of Government of the United States which at various times has been the admiration of the civilized world, was created and based upon the foundation rock of three separate, independent, yet intertwined, coordinate co-equal branches of Government, with its inherent fundamental concept and philosophy of checks and balances.\nMy views are not groundless and my fears are not imaginary. They are supported by public expressions in Congress, in State Legislatures, in the press, magazines and news media throughout our Country, and most importantly by a number of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.\nA few examples will suffice:\nIn Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S., supra, Mr. Justice Hablan, dissenting, said (pp. 20, 21, 42) : \u201cI had not expected to witness the day when the Supreme Court of the United States would render a decision which casts grave doubt on the constitutionality of the composition of the House of Representatives. It is not an exaggeration to say that such is the effect of today\u2019s decision. The Court\u2019s holding that the Constitution requires States to select Representatives either by elections at large or by elections in districts composed \u2018as nearly as is practicable\u2019 of equal population places in jeopardy the seats of almost all the members of the present House of Representatives.\n\u201c. . . Thus, today\u2019s decision impugns the validity of the election of 398 Representatives from 37 States, leaving a \u2018constitutional\u2019 House of 37 members now sitting.\nThe constitutional right which the Court-creates is manufactured out of whole cloth.\u201d\nIn his dissenting Opinion in Lucas v. Colorado Gen. Assembly, 377 U.S., supra, Mr. Justice Stewart (with whom Mr. Justice Clark joined) termed the Court\u2019s decision \u201cwoefully wrong\u201d and said (pp. 745-748, 750-751) : \u201c. . . It has been unanswerably demonstrated before now that this \u2018was not the colonial system, it.was not the system chosen for the national government ~by the Constitution, it was not the system exclusively or even predominantly practiced by the States at the' time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is not predominantly practiced by the States today.\u2019 Secondly, says the Court, unless legislative districts are equal in population, voters in the more populous districts will suffer a \u2018debasement\u2019 amounting to a constitutional injury. As the Court explains it, \u2018To the extent that a citizen\u2019s right to vote is debased, he is that- much-less a citizen.\u2019 . We are not told how or why the vote of a person in a more populated legislative district is \u2018debased,\u2019 or how or why he is less a citizen, nor is the proposition self-evident. I find it impossible to understand how or why a voter in California, for instance, either feels or is less a citizen than a voter in Nevada, simply because, despite their population disparities, each of those States is represented by two United States Senators.\n\u201cTo put the matter plainly, there is nothing in all the history of this Court\u2019s decisions which supports this constitutional rule. The Court\u2019s draconian pronouncement, which malees unconstitutional the legislatures of most' of the 50 States, finds no support in the words of the Constitution, in any prior decision of. this Court, or in the .115-year political history of our Federal Union. . . . The rule announced today is at odds with long-established principles of constitutional adjudication under the Equal Protection Clause, and it stifles values of local individuality and initiative vital to the character of the Federal Union which it was the genius of our Constitution to create.\n\u201cWhat the Court has done is to convert a particular political philosophy into a constitutional rule, binding upon each of the 50 States, from Maine to Hawaii, from Alaska to Texas, without regard and without respect for-. the many individualized and differentiated characteristics of .each State, characteristics, stemming from-each State\u2019s distinct history, distinct geography, distinct distribution of population, and distinct political heritage. .....\n- \u201cThe Court today .declines to give any recognition to these considerations and countless others, tangible and intangible, in holding unconstitutional the particula.r systems; of legislative apportionment which these States have chosen. Instead, the Court says that the requirements of the Equal Protection. Clause can be met in any State only by the uncritical, simplistic, and heavy-handed application of sixth-grade arithmetic.\n\u201c. .. . And the further fact is that throughout < ur history the apportionments of State Legislatures have reflected, the strongly felt American tradition that the public interest is composed of many diverse interests, and that in the long run it can better be expressed by a medley of component voices than by the majority\u2019s monolithic command. What constitutes a rational plan reasonably designed to achieve this objective [he., the important goal of ensuring a fair, effective, and balanced representation of the regional, social, and economic- interests within a State] will vary from State to State, since each State is unique, in terms of topography, geography, demography, history, heterogeneity and concentration of population, variety of social and economic interests, and in the operation and interrelation of its political institutions.-. . .\u201d\nIn Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S., supra, Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting, said (pp. 602-603, 607, 614-615); . Of the 23 loyal States which ratified the Amendment before 1870, five had constitutional provisions for apportionment of at least one house of their respective, legislatures which wholly disregarded the spread of population. Ten more liad constitutional provisions which gave primary emphasis to population, but which applied also other principles, such as partial ratios and recognition of political subdivisions, which were intended to favor sparsely settled areas. Gan it be seriously contended that the legislatures of these States, almost two-thirds of those concerned, would have ratified an amendment which might render their own States\u2019 constitutions unconstitutional?\u201d\n\u201cIt is incredible that' Congress would have exacted ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment as the price of readmission, would have studied the-State Constitutions for compliance with the-Amendment, and would then have disregarded- violations of it.\u201d\n\u201c. . . In my judgment, today\u2019s decisions are refuted by the language of the Amendment which they construe and by the inference fairly to be drawn from subsequently enacted Amendments. They are unequivocally refuted by history' and by consistent theory and practice from the time of the' adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment until today.\u201d\nNotwithstanding my aforesaid views and convictions, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is Constitutionally bound to obey and, whenever necessary, carry out or implement the decisions of the Supreme Court of the -United States. Accordingly, we mandated the Legislature of Pennsylvania to reapportion or redistrict (within a year)' the Legislative and Senatorial Districts of our State, in accordance with the standards promulgated by the \"Supreme Court of the United States. See Butcher v. Bloom, 415 Pa., supra. Districting and redistricti\u00f1g ar\u00e9 primarily the duty, obligation and responsibility-of the Legislature. Nevertheless; in over a-year\u2019s ti-niethe Legislature failed to carry out -this Court\u2019s reapportionmenf mandate, although, if its members h\u00e1d been able to put aside partisan politics and personal \u00e1mbitions, they would have been especially qualified for this task. They had a composite knowledge and the particular and essentially important qualifications, because of their widespread representation (209 Representatives and 50 Senators), and their personal knowledge of the various and varied and the common or diverse interests of virtually every community in every part of the State. The result of this failure was that the very unpleasant duty, of reapportioning the Legislative and Senatorial Districts of Pennsylvania fell upon the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.\nThis was an exceptionally difficult task for our Court because it involved not merely the solution of Constitutional and legal questions \u2014 a field .with which we are familiar \u2014 but the delineating of 200 or more different political Representative districts and 50 Senatorial districts, with only the four above mentioned Constitutional standards to guide us. The political subdivisions or districts of our State, are inextricably intermixed with political, social, economic, traditional, homogenous, county and regional factors, plus, many other important varied and diverse interests with the. details of which a Court is not and. cannot be familiar. Moreover, although 30 different redistricting plans were submitted to this Court, they did not furnish. adequate facts or information which would enable us to wisely redistrict the entire State if we take into consideration not merely population, compactness and contiguity, but also the many important additional factors, hereinbefore and hereinafter mentioned.\nIt would be relatively easy to take a paper and pen and, applying \u201conly the uncritical, simplistic and heavy-handed application of sixth grade arithmetic,\u201d draw a'dozen-different and Constitutionally valid-plans dividing the State into Senatorial and Legislative Districts which would be (a) contiguous, (b) compact and (c).\u201cas nearly equal in population as is practicable,\u201d and (d) with no invidious discrimination. However, I am convinced that in addition to these four basic Constitutional standards prescribed by' the Supreme Court of the. United States, every fair and wise districting or redis'tricting plan would have to include a consideration of the many varied interests of each district. These would include. such factors as homogeneous groups, their . commercial, industrial, economic, social, cultural, spiritual, -county, and regional interests, their interests . arising from- their national origin, their special wants and needs,-their different historical and political heritage; -their language differences, and their different customs, traditions and way of life. Moreover, I.believe, that large minority groups are entitled to-representation, whenever reasonably possible. In some of .these fields, I repeat, we do not have sufficient information,- nor have these very important facts and criteria, been adequately furnished to us by anyone, nor are we, within the' short time available, in a position to: obtain them. For example, it is a matter of common knowledge that a mountain or a river or a large body of water, and sometimes a modern highway, often so separates neighboring people that many or most of the.interests, customs, traditions and way of life of the people on one side thereof are very different from those of. the people on the other side. An outstanding example of . fundamental differences would be that of Philadelphians on the one hand and, on the other hand, the Amish, the Mennouites, the Dunkards, and other wonderful people often popularly called the plain people. The language, the interests, the religious beliefs, the customs, traditions and way of life of the plain people \u2014 indeed, their very different and distinctive dress \u2014 are so different from those of Philadelphians that to combine them in one district, if these-communities were compact and contiguous, would-be absolutely ridiculous. ..\".y;\nFor these reasons, I cannot agree fully with\u2019-any of the 30 different plans submitted to this Court, nor iri tolo with the plans formulated and the views' set forth in the' majority Opinion, or in the Opinion by Justice Musmanno. Furthermore, I strongly\u2019disagree with the views expressed by Justice Eagen. Perhaps the biggest difference between the majority and myself is that since all or nearly all the Senators have been Unconstitutionally elected, I believe- that all 50 should be Constitutionally elected in the general election next November from the new Senatorial Districts for a term of, four, years. If the newly. elected .Legislature wishes to create staggered Senatorial terms they may validly do so.\nSince I cannot persuade a majority of this Court, to. adopt my aforesaid views and my concept of our Government, this creates a frustrating situation. Even though my views and recommendations cannot prevail, this Court would be derelict in its duty if we failed, as. the Legislature failed, to formulate a redistricting plan for Pennsylvania. Everyone knows that no redistricting plan can satisfy everybody. Since any redistricting plan requires the approval of a majority of this Court, and since I believe that the plans set forth in the majority Opinion are Constitutional and are better than any other plan which has been submitted, I am forced to join in the Reapportionment and Redistricting plans set forth in the majority Per Curiam Opinion.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nPopularly miscalled \u201cDemocratic\u201d or \u201cDemocracy.\u201d The United States has a Constitutionally guaranteed Republican Form of Government (Art. IV, \u00a74) with a democratic way of life. I also agree with the dissenting Justice who said that the realistic effect of the Court\u2019s decisions was to raise the practical question of whether there is or ever was any reason, use or necessity for a bicameral Legislature, which every State (except Nebraska) has and has had since their Statehood.\nWe note, in passing, that the plan for redistricting the Senate, which was passed by the Senate, was Constitutionally defective.\nDissenting Opinion of Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Clark in Lucas v. Colorado Gen. Assembly, 377 U.S., supra, page 750.\nArt. II, \u00a73 of the Constitution provides: \u201cSenators shall be-elected for the term of four years and Representatives for-the' term-of two years.\u201d Furthermore, it seems very unfair .that some' (25) Senators should have to run for election or re-election three times in four years.\nAt a time when our boys are fighting and dying in Asia, and Washington is proclaiming to the entire..world our inextinguishable desire and intent to give to peoples everywhere- their inalienable right to freely choose the kind of Government \u2022 they desire, it is almost incredible that a majority of Congress will not allow- the people of our Country to vote and adopt (through Legislatures or conventions) a Constitutional amendment to eradicate or change the above mentioned recent decisions of the Supreme Court. Such, an amendment (presently popularly known as the Dirksen Amendment) would enable the people of each State .and the people- of our entire Country to choose the kind of representative Government-they desire' in their particular State and in Congress. -They .co.uld thereby restore the kind of Government- which the people of each State as well as of our entire Country liave enjoyed ever since we became the United States of America \u2014 a representative Government which has enabled us in a relatively short period of time to become the greatest nation in the world.",

        "text": "Concurring and Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts :\nI join in the Court\u2019s Senate districting plan reluctantly, despite my strong disagreement with the majority\u2019s decision to limit the term of office of Senators to be elected from odd numbered districts in the forthcoming election to two years. However, in view of the imminence of the 1966 elections, the importance of a prompt decision persuades me to support the majority\u2019s Senate plan notwithstanding my disagreement with the two year term limitation. I do so in order to ensure that a constitutionally valid districting plan be made available to the voters of the Commonwealth for the 1966 elections.\nI regret, however, that this Court failed to produce an apportionment plan for the House which was at least as acceptable as that achieved for the Senate. This failure is all the more disappointing in view of the fact that the task confronting this Court in reapportioning the House was no more difficult, if not considerably easier, than that involved in districting the Senate. The unsatisfactory result achieved compels me to dissent from the majority\u2019s apportionment plan for the House of Representatives.\nI\nIn joining in the Senate plan, I am acquiescing in certain provisions (other than the two year term limitation) which are not entirely to my satisfaction. My decision to do so, and to concede my differences, is based primarily on my belief that the plan adopted is both in conformity with constitutional imperatives, and, on balance, a fair and sound accommodation of the varying and divergent solutions constitutionally and realistically available to this Court. Moreover, the difficulties and complexities involved in the implementation of our adjudication of September 29, 1964, the magnitude of the task, and its essentially legislative rather than judicial nature creates a situation not conducive to unanimity of agreement. Under such circumstances, satisfied that the plan is constitutional, and on the whole sound, I do not feel it appropriate that I condition my joinder on complete agreement with all aspects of the plan.\nThe primary objective of this Court in the task of implementing our previous decision in this case was the establishment of legislative districts -substantially, equal in population in conformity with the requirements of both the Federal Constitution and the Constitution-of this-.Commonwealth. In my view, an examination of the plan here adopted discloses that our objective has been.realized.\nAnalysis of the plan reveals that deviation from the apportionment norm has been restricted to a minimum, level. 66 per cent of the senatorial districts created deviate from the norm by less than 5 per cent; 78 per cent of -the districts deviate by less than 6 per cent; 84 per cent deviate by less than 7 per cent; 88 per.cent deviate by less than 8 per cent; and no district deviates beyond 9.8 per cent from the ideal. As a result, one of the more obvious and desirable features of today\u2019s adjudication is that the election of a majority' of the Senate may not be accomplished by districts containing' less than 50.1 per cent of' the population of the Commonwealth.\nThus, these figures reveal that the invidious discrimination which existed under the senatorial districting act invalidated in our earlier adjudication has been eliminated. Moreover, this has been accomplished under today\u2019s plan' without the enforcement of such mathematical exactness as would unnecessarily invade-the integrity of governmental subdivisions and county lines while adding little to the quality of representative-processes.\n. Equal attention, and consideration has been given to the need for the plan adopted to yield compact districts of contiguous territory. An examination of the Court\u2019s plan reveals that these constitutional objectives have been realized and harmonized with the equality of population principle and other guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court of the United States and this Court in our previous opinion in this case. On the whole, the accommodation which both the Federal and State Constitutions compel, and which this Court has sought, has been satisfactorily achieved. Thus, although the' plan is not perfect or ideal, it is constitutional and possesses sufficient merit to persuade me to join in its adoption.\nHowever, as I have previously noted, I am disturbed by the unnecessary and unwise provision in the Court\u2019s plan limiting Senators to be elected from odd numbered senatorial districts to less than a full four year constitutional term. In my view, such restriction is not mandated by the Federal Constitution and is inconsistent with Article II, \u00a73 of the Constitution of this Commonwealth which provides, \u201cSenators shall be elected for the term of four years . . . .\u201d I entertain grave difficulties, with a construction of that provision which limits its reach to one half of the Senate while denying, its effect to the remaining membership.\nOnce this Court concluded that all 50 Senators were constitutionally required to stand for election in the 1966 general election, that determination, in my view, should have been controlling and required that all senatorial seats be filled for a four year constitutional term. I believe that the Supreme Court of Illinois, with the approval of the Federal District Court for Northern Illinois, correctly decided the issue when it recently held that the entire membership of the Senate of that State would stand for election in 1966 for full four year terms notwithstanding a state constitutional provision providing for staggered senatorial terms. However, because I am unable to persuade a majority of this Court to require all Senators to run for a four year term, and having made clear my views on this aspect of the Senate plan and my disapproval of the two year limitation, I most reluctantly concur in the Senate plan adopted by the majority.\nSome comment on the plan embodied in Senate Bill No. 1162 would seem appropriate at this juncture.' That plan did not commend itself to a majority of this Court because certain of its provisions appeared both inequitable and unconstitutional.\nThe most fundamental failing of that proposal was the fact that it was obviously structured and designed to insulate 25 senatorial incumbents, elected in 1964, from standing for election in 1966. The undesirability, if not unconstitutionality, of such an approach is indicated by the fact that many of the districts represented by these incumbents would undergo, under the Bill, an infusion of voters from areas previously embraced by other senatorial districts. As a result of this transition, voters would be represented by a Senator in whose selection they were not afforded an opportunity to participate. Thus, by permitting 25 incumbents to complete a full four year term, Senate Bill 1162 would disenfranchise significant numbers of voters by depriving them of a choice as to their Senator until 1968, an additional two years. It is clear that any plan which practically and effectively delays reapportionmerit for such substantial numbers of voters for an additional two year period is both \u2019 undesirable and unacceptabl\u00e9.\nAnother aspect of the plan proposed in Senate Bill 1162 which militated strongly against its acceptability is the unnecessarily large deviation of the districts there created from the apportionment norm. At least 1 out of every 5 districts set up under\u2019 Senate Bill 1162 deviates from the apportionment ratio by 10 per cent or greater. Three districts deviate by 13 per cent or more and one reaches to a variance of greater than 14 per cent beyond the ideal. One result of these disparities and the extent of. deviation permitted under Bill 1162 is that districts containing 49.1 per cent of the population of the Commonwealth would be able to elect a majority of the membership, and thus achieve control,'of the Senate.\n\"Thus, although exact mathematical equality among, legislative districts is not required by the Federal or State Constitution, a greater regard for the \u201cone man, one vote\u201d principle than is apparent in Bill 1162 is clearly desirable.' That such a regard is practical and attainable is '. convincingly indicated by the result achieved under the plan adopted today.\nII\nMy disagreement with and dissent to the majority\u2019s House plan is based primarily on its failure to observe the equal population principle and other guidelines mandated by the controlling decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and set forth in our earlier opinion in this case. Unfortunately, the plan adopted by the majority permits representative districts embracing 47.03 per cent of the population of the Commonwealth to elect a majority of the 203 members of the House.\nMoreover, as undesirable, unnecessary, and unfair as that overall apportionment is, its imperfection is compounded by the serious and glaring population disparities between individual representative districts.\nIn my view, the majority, in formulating its House plan, unwisely proceeded on the unsupported assumption that the House apportionment norm of 56,597 might be exceeded by as much as 15 per cent or reduced by a like percentage. Thus, the Court\u2019s plan contains a number of legislative districts which reach to that, in my view, excessive level of deviation. For example, District 149, containing a population of 64,-529, deviates by 14 per cent above the norm. On the other hand, .District 99, with a population of 47,908, is 15.3 per cent below the House norm.\n\u2022While I fully recognize that some minor deviation from the population norm, made necessary by considerations seeking to preserve the integrity of local governmental subdivisions or to retain some convenient and realistic units for voters and the efficient functioning of local election machinery, is acceptable, the population disparities which the majority here countenances are without compelling reason or necessity. Under such circumstances, I cannot approve of , the . result achieved and must dissent from the House apportionment plan adopted today.\nThe odd or even numerical designation of all senatorial districts was fixed by the Legislature. The vast majority of these designations can be traced back at least as far as 1921. See Act of May 10, 1921, P. L. 449. With minor exceptions, these same designations were retained in the 1964 Act, Act of January 9, 1964, P. L. (1963) 1432, 25 P.S. \u00a72217 (Supp. 1965), and in Senate Bill 1162 of the 1965 Session. The Senate plan adopted by the Court in no way changes the odd or even numerical character assigned to any senatorial district by the Legislature. The Court merely accepted, retained and utilized the Legislative numbering system.\nButcher v. Bloom, 415 Pa. 438, 203 A. 2d 556 (1964).\nSee Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S. Ct. 1362 (1964); Butcher v. Bloom, 415 Pa. 438, 203 A. 2d 556 (1964).\nButcher v. Bloom, 415 Pa. 438, 462-63, 203 A. 2d 556, 570-71 (1964).\n96 per cent of the districts under the present plan, or all but 2, deviate by less than 9 per cent from the apportionment norm. The remaining 2 districts, numbered Districts 34 and 26, presented special problems because of peculiarities of geography and population. District 34, consisting of the Counties of Cameron, Centre, Clearfield, and Clinton, contains the lowest number of inhabitants. of any district in the plan, and deviates by 9 per cent from the norm.-However, the district consist's of a contiguous and compact area of 3562 square miles and embraces more than 4 times the total ar\u00e9a of both Philadelphia (127 square miles) and Allegheny (730 square miles) Counties,. Since this deviation is well within constitutional tolerance, a further reduction, which could only be accomplished by the fracturing of county boundary lines, did not appear justified in view of the size of the area already embraced and the nature-of the adjoining'area.\nDistrict 26, located within Delaware County, embraces an area of high population density and is composed of 12 boroughs and 8 townships. It contains a population of 248,695, the highest of any district in the plan and deviates by 9.8 per cent from the ideal. No significant reduction in this deviation was possible, however, Without invading the integrity of municipal subdivisions or affecting adjoining districts. In light of the minimal nature of the deviatien, the dislocation which would result from such' an invasion did not appear necessary or justified.\n\u2022Compare the Supplemental Report of the Advisory Council. on Reapportionment to the Legislature of the State of New York, dated January 17, 1966. The Council, in its amended recommendations, justified deviations extending to 10.8 per cent in order to increase materially the number of county lines preserved intact, thus reversing a previous recommendation which sought to hold- maximum deviations to a somewhat lesser level.\nThis figure is obtained by calculating the percentage of the' total population of the Commonwealth which is' embraced by the 26 least populous senatorial districts. Under the Senate plan adopted today, 5,666,S79 persons, out of the total population of 11,319,-366, reside in areas embraced by these 26 districts. The 1964 act invalidated by this Court in our prior adjudication permitted districts containing a minority of 44.02 per cent of the total population of the Commonwealth to elect a majority of the membership of the Senate. ........\nThe Act of January 9, 1964, No. 2, P. L. (1963) 1432, 25 P.S. \u00a72217 (Supp. 1965).\nSo long as the resulting plan does not submerge' the overriding objective of substantial equality of population among legislrtive districts, \u201ca State may legitimately desire to maintain the integrity of various political subdivisions, insofar as possible, and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory in designing a legislative apportionment scheme. Valid considerations may underlie such aims. Indiscriminate districting, without any regard for political subdivision or natural or historical boundary lines, may be little more than an open invitation to partisan gerrymandering . .. . .\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 578-79, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1390 (1964).\nMoreover, the utilization of existing county units as the building block of the plan here adopted' has the additional advantage of preserving established and convenient electoral units for the voters and, thus, avoiding unnecessary dislocation of local election machinery.\nPeople ex rel. Engle v. Kerner, 33 Ill. 2d 11, 210 N.E. 2d 165 (1965).\nId. at 167.\nSenate Bill No. 1162 (Printers No. 1466) was passed by the Senate of the General Assembly during the 1965 Session. The measure did not, however, secure approval of the House of Representatives, but was embodied in one of the plans submitted to this Court for consideration.\nAn illustration of such an infusion may be seen by an examination of District 25 proposed under Senate Bill 1162. Crawford and Forest Counties, containing a total population of 82,441, were added to the areas embraced by District 25. Thus, under Senate Bill 1162, the voters of these additional counties would be represented by the incumbent until the 1968 general election even though they were not eligible to participate in his selection. A similar result would have obtained in District 23, where Lycoming County, containing a population of 109,367 people, was added to the arqa embraced by that district; District 33, where Juniata, Fulton, Huntingdon, and Mifflin Counties, containing a total population of 110,276 people, were added to the area embraced by that district. Analysis of the 25 districts involved reveals that areas embracing approximately 800,000 persons were added to districts represented by-. Senators elected in 1964 and, under the Bill,'not required to stand for election until 1968.\nThe extent and number of deviant districts may well be accounted for by the fact that the Bill as structured was designed to preserve the senatorial seats of those Senators elected in 1964. As a result, a certain rigidity was introduced which limited the available avenues .for reducing deviation from tbe apportionment norm.. Thus, under Senate Bill 1162, District 33, containing a population of \"198,257, adjoins District 30, which contains a population of 257,-171. That district adjoins Districts 32 and 39, which contain populations of 258,003 and 258,407 respectively. But for the attempt to tailor the plan to preserve certain districts, a more equitable distribution of population would have been possible. Moreover, because of the limited avenues available, to equalize population among the districts, the following district was created: Mercer and Crawford Counties, traditionally one senatorial\" district, were divided and 'Crawford County, bounded on the \"West by the Ohio State line, was joined with ah area to the \"East to. form a district extending over 180 miles eastward, a distance greater than half-way apross the width of the State. This result obtained notwithstanding the fact that when joined to form a single district, Mercer and Crawford Counties contain a population which does not deviate significantly from the apportionment norm.-\nUnder Senate Bill 1162, the 26 least populous districts contain a total population of 5,560,339, 49.1 per cent of the total population of the Commonwealth.\nThe constitutional and practical significance of the fact that under Senate Bill 1162 districts containing a minority of 49.1 per cent of the population of the State could elect a majority of the Senate, when contrasted with the 50.1 per cent achieved under the Court\u2019s plan, is indicated by the results of the 1960 Presidential Election. In that election, the popular vote plurality was approximately 112,000\", a margin of only .0016 per cent of the electorate.\nUnder the majority\u2019s House plan, the 102 least populous districts contain 5,323,964 inhabitants, 47.03 per cent of the total population of the Commonwealth.\nFor some further illustrations of large population disparities, see House Districts, 8, 26, 139, 176 (substantially above the apportionment norm), and Districts 48, 59, 61, and 63 (substantially below the apportionment norm).",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno:.\nThe. Supreme Court of the United States decided, through a series of decisions, that the districts of the various State legislatures must be reapportioned on a one-person one vote basis, thereby overruling many state districting laws which had theretofore prevailed. In effect, as Chief Justice Bell says in his Concurring Opinion, each House of the State Legislatures .(a) must have substantial equality of population among the various districts, (b) the districts must be compact and contiguous, and (c) there must be no invidious discrimination.\nThis Court, with those criteria before it, set out to re-carve the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania so that in the end it might look, representatively speaking, like the ideal State envisioned by the Supreme Court of. the United States. I am afraid that the result announced by the Majority of this Court presents a map bearing little resemblance to the pragmatic representative perfection asked for by the highest court of the land. As I survey the terrain mapped out by the Majority of this Court I see marshes of inequality, swamps of uncompactness, bogs of invidious discrimination and barren wastes of unconstitutional performance.\nLegislative redistricting is not a matter of technical jurisprudence. It is simply the application of uncomplicated criteria to the raw materials of population, geography, topography, rivers and other natural boundaries, as well as commercial, industrial, economic, social, cultural and regional interests. No one could be more familiar with these factors than the popularly elected representatives in the various districts.\nThus, the State Senators, each representing a different district, each primarily concerned with his - own- local obligations, and each ardently championing his political views, nevertheless, through the process of discussion and analysis, and each keeping before him at all times the criteria laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States and this Court, agreed, by a nearly unanimous vote of 47 to 1, on a plan, which was constitutional, fair, equitable and representative of all the many interests involved. No senatorial district under the Senate plan exceeded the 15% variation from the norm of population allotted to each of the 50 senatorial districts. Under the Senate plan, the districts were compact, homogeneous and as equally peopled as the natural barriers, contours, and population concentrations of the State permitted.\nNot only did this plan squarely meet all- the reapportionment criteria and resolve them correctly, but it was the result of bi-partisan consideration. The Republican and the Democratic senators agreed to it, so that it could not be said that one party derived' any undue advantage over the other. With each side naturally and earnestly striving for a superior position, nevertheless the Republicans and Democrats came to a common understanding and wrote it into a Senate bill which, with but one adverse vote, received the unanimous approval of the upper chamber of the Pennsylvania Legislature.\nNothing could have and should have more appealed to this Court as a demonstration of excellent, fair and equitable work done by the representatives of the people than this Senate plan. I urged this Court to accept it. The Majority rejected it. In doing so I believe it committed a grievous error, and then it proceeded to magnify the error by the manner in which it proceeded from that point.\nOur Court is an appellate court. With very few. exceptions it. is our business to review decisions of.lower courts based on the. records made in those tribunals. But there was no such record in this. case. We did not even hear arguments on the case. Nor did we take original jurisdiction. Thus this Court, in a bizarre procedure acting neither as a trial court nor as an appellate court, served, in effect, a writ of certiorari on a finding by the legislature. With the definitive division of our government into three independent branches,, this ju: dicial invasion of the Legislature\u2019s prerogatives should be enough to cause .the architects of our form, of government to stir in their tombs, and soliloquize.\nIt is true that this Court acted in an appellate fashion when it sat on the case of Butcher v. Bloom, 415 Pa. 438, and. it is true that it retained jurisdiction of the case, but it is also true that it referred the matter of reapportionment to. the. Legislature and, although both Houses did not enact a final reapportionment law, the Senate, as above stated, practically unanimously approved of a reapportionment plan for the Senate. Why didn\u2019t this Court take that plan?\nThe Majority does not analyze the Senate plan. It merely rejects it. It jettisons the findings of the most knowledgeable persons on the subject. While the Senate plan in some instances showed districts with an appreciable difference in population figures, the districts always stayed, as above stated, within the variation percentage allowed. The plan submitted by the Majority shows districts varying in population density with a differential as high as 43,000.\nBefore this Court undertook to veto the will of the people, as spoken by the State Senators elected by the people, it should at least have had evidence on which to act. It might have appointed a commission; it might have designated a master to take testimony; it might have done a number of things to guarantee due process under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It did none of -these things.\nIn Butcher v. Bloom, supra, this Court said quite properly: \u201cThe task of reapportionment is not only the responsibility of the Legislature, it is also a function which can be best accomplished by that elected branch of government. The composition of the Legislature, the knowledge which its members from every part of the state bring to its deliberations, its techniques for gathering information, and other factors inherent in the- legislative process, make it the most appropriate body for the drawing of linesdividing the state into senatorial and representative districts(Emphasis supplied.)\nThis Court accordingly then, in September, 1964, sent the reapportionment problem to the Legislature and the Legislature moved at. once to the fulfillment of its mammoth task. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the only body charged by the' Constitution with reapportionment is the Legislature. Its findings, therefore, are entitled to maximum constitutional deference. In appreciation of its constitutional duties, the Legislature held hearings, it sent investigating committees throughout the State. It took testimony. The multifarious details inherent in a gigantic reapportionment of legislative districts for 11,319,366 people were discussed, analyzed and debated. There were innumerable conferences between the Senate and the House and its respective members through specially appointed committees.\nOne would assume that this Court would, therefore, look with great respect upon the findings made by the Legislature. The Opinion of the Majority manifests that it more or less ignored this great work accomplished by the highly skilled surveyors in the domain of statewide reapportionment. Instead of accepting the Senate agreements, the Court set about to accomplish reapportionment itself, armed with inadequate surveying instruments and other appropriate engineering equipment. And now the Majority has submitted its result, which clearly manifests the erratum committed in not assigning to the legislative findings the consideration they constitutionally deserved. I repeat that the Majority decision violates the Fourteenth Amendment and other provisions of the constitution of the United States, it fails to.follow the criteria laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States and, in fact, the decisions of this very Court itself.\nIn Butcher v. Bloom, this Court said,- in interpreting our organic law, that there is a constitutional \u201cintention to respect county lines and to utilize counties as units of representation to the maximum extent consistent with the equal-population principle.\u201d Of course, it was impossible not to cross some county lines. The Senate plan held county invasion down to eight crossings, the Majority Plan mandates thirteen such trespasses.\nThe Majority plan, aside from other constitutional and legislative encroachments, violates rules of apportionment, as well as of fairness in the matter of its numbering of senatorial districts. The State has fifty such districts, numbered necessarily odd and even. Strange as it may seem, it often happens that whether a district has an odd or even number determines to a considerable degree whether that district will elect a Republican or \u00e1 Democratic' senator in given election year's. Statistics appear to indicate that in some districts the Republican or the D\u00e9mocratic candidates, have a better chance of winning, depending on whether that particular election falls within a presidential election year or a gubernatorial election year. Thus, fortuitously, but nevertheless in the natural law which sometimes governs chance and fate, advantages or disadvantages attend the candidates according to the number their districts bear.\nThe numbering of senatorial districts, in order to achieve any order of methodical sequence, should begin at one end of the State and proceed, with some semblance of consecutiveness, to the other end of the State. The numbering should proceed horizontally,- clockwise, counter-clockwise, or up and down the State in vertical segments, but it should- not leapfrog. For instance, .if the numbering is to begin in Philadelphia, which has nine senatorial districts, the most natural process of numbering would be from 1 to 9. No comparison can be made here with the Senate plan because that plan called for the election of only 25 Senators, whereas the Majority plan calls for the election of all 50 Senators, even if for staggering terms.\nThe Majority, in numbering, the Philadelphia districts, did not follow the numerical sequence of 1 to 9. It used the numbers 1 to 8, .and then, even though not confronted with the problem of avoiding districts not coming up for election, wholly unnecessarily jumped to No. 36. In the adjoining Delaware County or portions thereof, the numbers became 9, 17 and 26.- In another contiguous county or portions thereof, Montgomery- tlie numbers gambolled through 12, 17 and 24. Then District 21 kangarooed between 41 and 47, or between 47 and '50, depending on the direction of the approach. A glance at the map, under the Majority plan, shows a chaotic jumble of numbers, which, however, when studied in connection with local conditions, will show not chaos, but a very planned arrangement to achieve certain partisan results which certainly fall within the inhibition of invidious discrimination. \" This kind of maneuver could influence the election or defeat of' candidates depending on whether the election year is a presidential or gubernatorial one. It has been said that gerrymandering can be accomplished sometimes as effectively by numbers as well as' by formulation of strangely-shaped election districts.\nIn view of the fact that the date for distributing nominating petitions in the May primaries is imminent, the decision of the Court in this case should be filed without delay. Thus, time being of the essence, I cannot write an extended Dissenting Opinion in which I Avould enumerate and discuss the other areas in Avhich I believe the Majority violated the Federal and the State constitutions. I will linger long enough to address my attention to one (of the many) major uncom stitutional provisions in the Majority\u2019s plan for reapportionment of the House of Representatives.\nThe Majority has awarded to Bucks County six House seats. Article It, \u00a717 of the State Constitution declares, inter alia, that \u201cThe members of the House of, Representatives shall be apportioned among the several counties, on a ratio obtained by dividing the population of the State as ascertained by the most recent United States census by two -hundred. Every county containing less than five ratios shall have one representative for every full ratio, and an additional representative when the surplus exceeds half a ratio . . . Every county containing five ratios or more shall have one representative for every full ratio.\u201d (Emphasis supplied. )\nUnder this section the ratio per representative in Pennsylvania is 56,597. Bucks County, with a population of 308,567 is, therefore, entitled to 5.45 representative ratios. Since .45 is not a half and certainly not a full ratio, Bucks is not entitled to six representatives under either ratio definition above quoted. The Majority, in an outright repudiation of the cited constitutional provision, has awarded six House seats to Bucks County. This arbitrary usurpation of legislative power can in no way be justified.\nIf it would be argued that, making the computation in reverse, each district would number a population of 51,000, and thus only 10% below the representative ratio, this, generally speaking, would not be abnormal if it involved only a single representative. Here, however, the minus ratio is repeated in six contiguous districts. Bucks County thus becomes over-represented at the expense of other parts of the State. If the Majority plan for awarding seats in Bucks County were to be followed in Philadelphia and Allegheny Counties, Allegheny County Avould be entitled to three more seats, and Philadelphia County to four additional seats. It must be quite clear, therefore, that the Majority plan, by assigning an advantage to Bucks County, Avhich is denied all other counties in the State, offends against the prohibition of invidious discrimination.\nIn a tight election between the two predominant political parties in Pennsylvania, the election of an additional representative by one party in Bucks County could determine Avhich party would control the House of Representatives. This would mean that legislation affecting the entire Commonwealth could be determined in a closely controverted issue, along partisan lines, by this one single vote which has been handed to Bucks County by the Majority on an unconstitutional silver platter.\nFor these reasons and others for which time will not permit discussion or even enumeration, I dissent.\nIt is true that the Legislature,, in creating a new senatorial district in Philadelphia, numbered it 36, but special circumstances brought this about. The district originally numbered 36 was underpopulated as a district and was \u00e1bsorbed into number 30. Another reason is that the newly created seat was to'be filled in the next election,- under the staggered plan of election, which, of course, followed the odd-and-even number sequence. This numbering however-was not controlling on this Court. Therefore, since the majority renumbered the districts on a State-wide basis, there is no reason, why logically it should riot- have given to the new Philadelphia district the number 9, so that it would adhere to a sensible, consecutive numbering.",

        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Eagen\nDissenting in Part:\nI cannot in good conscience even condone the redistricting plan of the Senate of the Commonwealth as decreed by a Majority of my brethren on the Court. As to this part of the decision, I must, therefore, emphatically dissent.\nWhile some fixed constitutional standards were generally followed in the planning and composition of all of the senatorial districts, it is, and will be, readily apparent to knowledgeable people that in the planning and composition of districts in a substantial number of areas, considerations other than judicious and legal were regretfully permitted to interfere. As a result, the total senate plan is basically unfair, and will result in control of that body remaining in the hands of one certain political party for all future time.\nThe House of Representatives and the Senate of Pennsylvania have previously always legislated their own districts. That the task has been \u201cwell\u201d done is clearly indicated by the results. With the exception of one two-year period (immediately following the Roosevelt \u201clandslide\u201d election of 1936), the same political party has continuously enjoyed majority control of the Senate of Pennsylvania during the present century. Unfortunately, today\u2019s decree of this Court follows the same unfair pattern.\nAssuming, arguendo, that the Majority\u2019s plan for redistricting the Senate conforms to the letter of the law, it is certainly violative of the spirit of the United States Constitution and the recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court, and presents the same type of situation that prompted the unprecedented, action of the United States Supreme- Court in assuming jurisdiction and ordering relief in the case of Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962).\nI fear also the constitutional validity of the Majority\u2019s senate redistrieting plan. for. other reasons. The 1960 census population of Pennsylvania was 11,319,-366. The Constitution of Pennsylvania provides for fifty senatorial districts. The perfect representative ratio would, therefore, constitute. 226,387. While I recognize that it is impossible for very practical reasons to achieve the perfect norm, I believe that it was. incumbent upon us to do so as far as it was reasonably possible. As we stated in Butcher v. Bloom, 415 Pa. 438, 465, 203 A. 2d 556 (1964), \u201cThose whose task it is to. reapportion the Pennsylvania Legislature must approach their assignment with the understanding that they-are to create districts which are as nearly equal, in population as is practicable.\u2019\u2019 (Emphasis added.) To the same effect see, Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S. Ct. 1362 (1964).\nDespite this constitutional requirement, I note that in. the senatorial plan decreed by the Majority, there exists wide divergence of total population in several districts. For example, District No. 34 includes a total population, of only 205,319, while District No. 26 includes 248,695. This means that the senator in District No. 26 will represent 43,376-or 21% more people than the senator in District No. 34.\n.While it may be-argued that the low composite population in District No. 34 and in similar situations was-necessarily achieved in order not to break-county lines, this position does, not hold water, particularly in reference to District. No. 26, which .is located in an area where county lines were crossed in order to reach the population figure.
