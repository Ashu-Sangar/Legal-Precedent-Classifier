Appellant alleged that it is engaged in the business of purchasing deferred payment contracts from dealers who.sell owner-completed houses. It further alleges that appellee is such , a dealer, and that, by a written contract between appellant and appellee, appellee agreed to submit to appellant for purchase at specified prices all of the installment or deferred payment con<a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>tracts made by appellee with its customers..for a 5 year period from tbe date of the contract. Averring, that appellee has failed to offer such contracts to .it-.and-intends to continue such actions, and averring that it bad no remedy at law, appellant sought equitable relief in the form of a decree (1) enjoining appellee from .offering installment contracts for purchase' to anyone but appellant; (2) directing appellee to offer these contracts to appellant; (3) requiring appellee-to account to appellant. for all such contracts not submitted to appellant for purchase; and (4) awarding appellant the damages which it had sustained by. reason "of appellee’s breach.</p>
    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[131,1053,1150,196]]]'>Appellee filed preliminary objections to: the- complaint, averring that an adequate remedy: existed, at law. Preliminary objections were sustained and the case certified to the law side.</p>
    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[131,1269,1150,480]]]'>In its opinion sustaining the preliminary objections, the court below stated: “Plaintiff, in addition to his prayer for damages, seeks, in effect, specific performance of the above-mentioned contract by enjoining the defendant from doing any acts in violation thereof, as well as an accounting of these contracts which allegedly have not been submitted to it. We will first consider whether or not plaintiff is entitled to an injunction on the basis of the allegations in its Complaint.</p>

Local Union No. 542, <a href="/pa/370/0073-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="370 Pa. 73" data-case-ids="1234552" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0073-01">370 Pa. 73</a> (1952), it is well- established that this power will not be exercised where-there is an ample remedy by an action for damages at law. Greenberg v. The First Mortgage Guarantee &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/pa/242/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="242 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="998908" data-case-paths="/pa/242/0035-01">242 Pa. 35</a> (1913); Streng v.

Here the plaintiff bomplains of the action of the defendant in not submitting to it (plaintiff) deferred payment contracts which the <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>defendant has entered into with its customers and further alleges that the defendant will continue this course of conduct. We do not know of any reason why plaintiff can not, under these circumstances, seek a complete and adequate remedy at law, in the form of an action in assumpsit for damages for this alleged breach of contract. The only way in which plaintiff would be injured by such a breach would be a loss of profits from not being able to finance these contracts. We do not see why damages can not be ascertained here with a reasonable degree of certainty by merely determining how much of a profit plaintiff would have made on each of these deferred payment contracts.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[205,1049,1148,476]]]'>“Moreover, we do not believe that an injunction is necessary to prevent any further breaches of this contract. If it is determined in an action at law that defendant’s past conduct did constitute a breach, the defendant is hardly going to continue in this conduct and render itself liable for additional damages. Even if there may be a possibility that defendant may again breach the contract, this is not sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of a court of equity.</blockquote>

Plaintiff argues that since it was to have the right to purchase <em>a&gt;U </em>of defendant’s deferred payment contracts, it has an exclusive privilege which should be protected by an injunction. We do not agree. The cases which are cited in support of this proposition are cases in which the exclusive privilege involved was the right of a plaintiff to enjoy certain services or to purchase certain products which were in some way or another unique and could not, therefore, be properly valued. Here, however, the loss, if any, which plaintiff has sustained can <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>be reasonably ascertained in dollars and cents in an action of assumpsit.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b593-3" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[158,449,1151,966]]]'>“We are also, of the opinion that equity jurisdiction need not be invoked to afford plaintiff'the information which it seeks to obtain by an accounting. Plaintiff in paragraph 6(c) of the Complaint seeks to have defendant make an accounting to it ‘for all sales on deferred payments since the inception of its agreement with plaintiff, which were not submitted to plaintiff for purchase.’ The Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure provide for an adequate means of obtaining any of this information which may be relevant to the issue of damages. Under our discovery rules,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> the plaintiff is free to take depositions of the defendant and to require for inspection the production of defendant’s records in order to ascertain the exact amount of its damages. It could-not obtain any more information in an accounting. We, therefore, believe that plaintiff does have an adequate remedy at law for the cause of action which it sets forth in its Complaint.”</blockquote>

That order stated: “. . . having reviewed all of the pleadings and the briefs filed, the undersigned is of the opinion that he erred in certifying this matter to the ‘law side of the Court’ and it is hereby decreed that the Opinion and Order rendered by the undersigned on May 3, 1962 is hereby revoked and vacated so that the above-entitled matter is hereby certified back to the equity side of the Court.” No further explanation is offered;for the action of the court.</p>

Any loss occasioned by the alleged breach of contract could be compensated by money damages which, in this factual matrix, are readily ascertainable. Where an adequate remedy at law exists in the form of an action of assumpsit, equity has no jurisdiction. <em>Meehan v.
