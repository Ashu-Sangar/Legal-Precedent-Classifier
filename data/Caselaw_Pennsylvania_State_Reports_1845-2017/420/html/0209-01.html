The Law was originally established to punish — severely and barbarously punish — persons who committed even small crimes. However, over the centuries the Law has developed and congealed, although not consistently or at times logically, along wiser and more humane lines. It is too often forgotten today (1) that the Law was established and exists <em>principally </em>for the protection and security of Society and (2) that in order to accomplish this <em>principal objective, </em>dangerous criminals have to be sentenced to and eonfined in prison. This not only furnishes sorely needed protection to law-abiding citizens while the imprisonment lasts, but it also acts as a deterrent to prospective criminals. Gradually people came to realize that the accused was likewise entitled to protection, i.e., the protection of a fair trial, and more recently that Society has a duty to (attempt to) rehabilitate a criminal. It took, we repeat, many years —sometimes more than a century — of trial and error <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>and of experiment and experience and evolution for the .law. to thus develop' and congeal.

    <p id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.6",253,[144,599,1150,632]]]'>The majority’s conclusion permits a defendant to he tried and convicted for a crime that he did not commit on evidence of the commission of a crime for which he has already been acquitted. I can see the wisdom of giving a jury the power to find a defendant guilty of an offense which is less than and included in the offense charged in the indictment. That was established in common law and is the law presently sanctioned by a majority of the states. But that is only true when the offense that the jury finds the defendant guilty of is less than and included in the offense alleged in the indictment.</p>
    <p id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.7",253,[146,1252,1150,636]]]'>Here, the defendant is being tried for an offense of voluntary manslaughter — no other offense is charged and no other crime is included in that charged offense. The evidence produced at trial discloses that the defendant, if guilty of anything, was guilty of a higher crime than that charged against him in the indictment. It discloses that defendant might be guilty of murder in the first or second degree. But a jury has already acquitted him of that crime. Evidence of a crime for which he has been acquitted cannot be used to secure the conviction of a lesser crime when the elements of the lesser crime are not proven.</p>

No appeal to emotions by phrases such as “protection of society”, “technical rules”, “dangerous criminal”, “mockery of law and justice”, should deprive any accused of the right to know the nature of the crime, with which he is charged and to require the evidence <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>upon which he is convicted to conform with the charged crime.

    <p id="b254-5" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[188,502,1145,576]]]'>I agree wholeheartedly with the lower court. “There is not a scintilla of evidence in the record which could sustain ... a conviction of voluntary manslaughter as defined by our appellate courts.” Since defendant is not now on trial for a murder indictment but only on trial for voluntary manslaughter, the evidence produced must show the elements necessary to constitute the crime of voluntary manslaughter. Neither the Commonwealth nor the majority argues that the evidence produced meets that requirement. Hence, the action of the lower court must be sustained.</p>
