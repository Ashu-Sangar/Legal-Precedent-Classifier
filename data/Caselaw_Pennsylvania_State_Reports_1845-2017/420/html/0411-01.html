In <em>May, 1961, </em>plaintiff submitted-to Aloysius J. Brady, the building inspector, a plan for the construction of a four unit apartment building on his land. A permit was issued for this plan. No action, was taken on the proposed project by plaintiff until sometime prior to August, 1964. At that time, the same four unit plan was resubmitted, the original permit having lapsed. At the September, 1964 meeting of council the plan was referred to a committee. The four unit plan was approved by council in its <em>December, 1961¡. </em>meeting.</p>

After plaintiff had finished the excavation, he received on April 18, 1965, ¿ letter from council ordering him to cease construction. Thereafter, on April 21, 1965, council ordered the permit rescinded.</p>
