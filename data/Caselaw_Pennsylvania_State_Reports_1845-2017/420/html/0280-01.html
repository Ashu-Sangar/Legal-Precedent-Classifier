In the instant case, plaintiff’s theory of defendant’s liability is that the accident was caused by the defendant’s negligence in that the operator of the bus drove at an excessive speed under the circumstances; that is, in driving on a straight-a-way on South Penn Square where traffic was coming into South Penn Square from South Broad Street, the bus driver, in operating his vehicle at a speed of 25 to 30 miles an hour when traffic was heavy, should have been aware that a condition might be created where it would be necessary for him to bring the bus to a sudden and abrupt halt because of traffic stopping in front of the bus, or cutting in front of it from another lane of traffic and causing an emergency stop. The circumstances of speed in a congested area of traffic swerving and cutting in front of other vehicles and, in the instant case, the truck negligently cutting in front of the bus, would place liability on the bus company if the bus was being operated at an excessive rate of speed and there was evidence from which the jury would be warranted in finding that under the circumstances the speed of the bus was excessive.</p>

Pgh. Rwys. Co., </em>supra, when plaintiff relies upon this doctrine 'and there is-a satisfactory explanation for the stop, the inference Of-'negligence is rebutted-. In <em>Wilson, </em>supra, we recognized the principle that where' the explanation for the stop appears affirmatively.from the evidence, there can be ho' imputation of negligence so long as the explanation itself does not disclose negligence. This doctriné is well settled in Pennsylvania as set forth in <em>Schilling, </em>supra, and cases cited therein, Avhere we said: “In cases such “as the present case, Avhere appellants are relying <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>on the''sudden stop’ doctrine, the unusual or extraordL nary character of the stop must be shown before the-transit company is required to produce a. reasonable and satisfactory explanation for the actions of the operator.” In <em>Lambert, </em>supra, we said: “'An inference of negligence on the part of the common carrier is not called for if its action is sufficiently explained,’ Stopping to avoid a collision with a person or object has been recognized consistently as a sufficient. explanation for a sudden stop.”</p>
