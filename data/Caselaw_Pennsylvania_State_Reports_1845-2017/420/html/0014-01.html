The lower Court further stated: “But what effect is to be given plaintiff’s specific objection to The use of public funds for the construction ... of a sports stadium for private enterprise’ (emphasis supplied) ? It is sufficient to note, as the City does, that the ordinance refers not at all to private enterprise; any objection to the use of the stadium by private enterprise is therefore premature. However, because of the public interest in this case, it should be noted that the City has the power to lease the stadium to private enterprise, if such a lease would not be inconsistent with the public use of the stadium: see Clarey v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/311/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="311 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1146273" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0011-01">311 Pa. 11</a> (1933). Even if the ordinance specifically provided that the stadium will be used primarily by privately owned football and baseball clubs, there would be no conflict with the public nature of the stadium, for the City would be entering into the lease, not to engage in the private business of promoting sporting events or leasing buildings (which might be a private, not a public, use), but rather as incident to providing for The recreation or the pleasure of the public’.”</p>

In fact, within the forty-eight states of the Union ninety-three municipal stadiums have been erected, or are in process of erection, to say nothing of private stadiums and those of colleges and universities. New York City has two municipal stadiums, one in Manhattan and the other in the Bronx.

Philadelphia, </em>311 Pa., supra, a taxpayer sought to enjoin the City of Philadelphia from leasing or permitting Philadelphia Convention Hall to be used by promoters of professional boxing, wrestling and other sporting events to which spectators are charged admission. In affirming the lower Court’s dismissal of the complaint we said (page 14) : “Unquestionably this hall, built with public funds upon property dedicated to public purposes, must be held to be devoted to public use. But there can be no sound reason why, when the hall is not required for public purposes, the city may not permit its use by private persons. From its very nature as a building designed to accommodate large groups of people, the hall cannot possibly be in demand for public gatherings for more than a small portion of the time, and necessarily must frequently be idle, yet with little diminution in the cost of maintenance. There can be no objection to the city’s receiving a return from the use of the hall by private persons upon occasions when it would otherwise be idle. To say, under the facts of this case, that the City is engaging in private business — that of pro<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>moting sporting events or leasing buildings — is absurd. Complainant’s contention is, in effect, that the hall must stand unused at all times when it is not in demand for strictly public use. Although he objects only to the use of the hall for professional sporting events, if his objection is sustained for the reasons he gives, or any reasons, the effect is to confine the use of the hall to purely public functions and thereby exclude its use for all private affairs, with the result that the city will be barred from receiving any revenue for its maintenance, and the entire cost thereof will have to be borne by the taxpayers. Such argument must be rejected. It is not sound in law or business practice. It would be folly to require this large and expensive public structure to be kept idle when it is not needed for public use, and when it might be used by private persons for a proper rental, to the mutual advantage of the taxpayers of the city and those permitted to use it.”</p>

In modern times the principal purpose of a park, namely, public recreation, is not limited to physical recreation but includes aesthetic recreation and mental and cultural entertainment as well. While the entire park acreage or any substantial part of it cannot, of course, be built upon so as unduly to destroy the enjoyment of fresh air, sunshine and exercise, the erection within its borders of monuments, museums, art galleries, public libraries, zoological and botanical gardens, conservatories, and the like, is commonly recognized and accepted as being within the normal scope and ambit of public park purposes, and an open-air public auditori<a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>um comes within the same category as such another permissible structure: Los Angeles Athletic Club v.

The fact that in the Bernstein case the lease was for the presentation of light opera, — affording mental and emotional entertainment, — while here it is for the purpose of enabling those who find pleasure in playing a kind of truncated golf to obtain thereby physical recreation, is likewise a difference without any basis for a legal distinction, for each of these methods of enjoyment has its devotees who find amusement therein (de gustibus non est disputandum) and each therefore has a legitimate place in a public park.”</blockquote>

      <p id="b58-5" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[202,1305,1155,1035]]]'> Philadelphia now has three large stadia seating 30,000 or more — Connie Mack, primarily a baseball stadium with very insufficient parking spaces; Franklin Field, which is wonderful for football because of its compactness, space and angle of elevation of the stands with resulting spectator visibility, and ample nearby parking spaces; and the John F. Kennedy Stadium which is a white elephant, poorly constructed for close spectator visibility, and rarely ever used except for the Army-Navy football game. Whether under these circumstances it is wise to erect a multi-purpose stadium for a combination of professional baseball and professional football within ten blocks of the present John F. Kennedy Stadium is a matter upon which there is a tremendous difference of opinion, especially since the cost of construction will be at least $25,000,000. However, the wisdom or lack of it is a matter for the City administration and the voters of Philadelphia, and not for the Courts. City Council passed an ordinance submitting to the voters of Philadelphia the question of whether they would approve a loan of $25,-000,000 to build a sports stadium near Broad Street and Pattison Avenue, Philadelphia. On November 3, 1964, the voters approved such a loan. However, the exact size, or the design, or the lines and angles of the stadium and of the playing field, or the use of the proposed stadium and the lessees thereof, have not yet been determined or approved by City Council and the Mayor.</p>
