It is also urged that a trustee’s investment in an investment company is in substance nothing more than a fractional ownership in a diversified portfolio of securities, as to which the trustee should account as if he held the portfolio securities directly. The special character of regulated invest<a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>ment companies and their specialized tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code also have some tendency to give capital gains distributions the aspect of principal.” (p. 712).</p>

With respect to each such group capital gains may be realized when certain investment decisions are acted upon (and capital losses may be realized under like circumstances).

D. &amp; C. 21</a>. <em>Lovett </em>— decided without reference to the Principal and Income Act — presented a “non-adversary” situation: the court, in our view mistakenly, treated distributions arising from <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>capital gains as an income distribution largely because of.the nature of the business of á regulated investment company. <em>Summerfield </em>— an “adversary” situation— held a capital gains distribution to be income assigning two reasons therefor: (a) testatrix’ intent that such.be so considered by the inclusion of “profits” in the term “net income” and in consonance with the ruling in <em>Quay’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/253/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="253 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1024039" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0080-01">253 Pa. 80</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.%201029" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="97 A. 1029">97 A. 1029</a> that a testamentary direction to pay “income and profits” to a life tenant includes capital gain; (b) §5(1) of the Principal and Income Act with its optional provision for the receipt of stock or cash, by the trustee. In <em>Summerfield, </em>neither §5(3) nor the excepting proviso of §5(1) was considered. <em>Cohen </em>— apparently a “non-adversary” situation — treated “capital gain dividends” as income under the authority of §3(1) of the Principal and Income Act (20 P.S. §3470.3(1)) without the provisions of §5(3) being urged upon the court.

We agree with appellant that “liquidation” — a word of art — describes a situation where “thé affairs of the (corporation) are wound up so that the assets are distributed to those entitled to receive them” <em>(Buist's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/297/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="297 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1118271" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0537-01">297 Pa. 537</a>, 543, <a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.%20606" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="147 A. 606">147 A. 606</a>), a situation wholly unlike that which transpired in this case. Moreover, “the intent of the first sentence of §5(3) was to cover a situation where a complete liquidation was to take placé over a period of years so that it would be consummated by several partial liquidations.” See: Commission’s Comment, 20 P.S. §3470.5, p. 688. It is clear that the legislature did not intend the application of this rule in §5(3) to distributions of an investment company which arose from its ordinary operations and not from a “winding up” of its affairs. Appellee’s contention in this respect lacks merit.</p>

Such designation is mandated by Title I, §19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, supra, which provides: “It shall be unlawful for any registered investment company to pay any dividend, or to make any distribution in the nature of a dividend.payment, wholly or partly from any source other than (1). [accumulated undistributed net income excluding- profits" or-losses realized on sale of securities or other' properties] or [net income for current or preceding fiscal <em>year]; unless such payment is accompanied by- a written statement which adequately discloses the source or sources of such </em>payment.” In accord with such statute the Fund described the payment of <em>8‡ </em>per share as “pay<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>able from realized capital gains.” Clearly, the Fund has “designated” this “disbursement of its corporate assets” as “a return of capital” and, clearly, this dis-. tribution or disbursement falls within the. second rule of §5(3) and, therefore, must be “deemed principal.”</p>

The nature of a mutual fund or regulated investment company, as' a conduit of profits arising from the sales of securities ánd the essential inequity of the imposition of lossés on principal and of profits on income refute, per sé, any justification advanced for appellant’s position. Much more sound is the position taken by appellee-. Section 3(2) of the Principal and Income Act (20 P.S. §3470.3(2)), provides, inter alia: “Any profit or loss, <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>resulting from any change in form of principal, shall enure to or fall upon principal, unless otherwise expressly provided in this act.”. The policy underlying this provision is “to link gains and losses together and to consign both to principal.” To sustain appellant’s position would mean that any gains realized from the sale of mutual fund investments would go to income while any losses would be imposed on principal — in contravention of the expressed policy of the statute. The distribution presently in controversy arose from a capital gain which represented a “profit” which resulted from the “sale” of shares of the Fund — the language of §5(3) commands the allocation of such “profit” to principal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">25</a>

      <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[192,777,1159,1582]]]'> Professor Bogert takes the view that a distribution of capital gains should be allocated to income on the ground that a trustee who holds shares in a mutual fund owns an interest in an investment business the income and capital gains Of which, represent the profits of the operation of such business and, therefore, should be treated as income of the trust owning the interest in the fund. It. is his contention that when an investment is made in a mutual fund the investor relies on <em>both </em>the. income and the capital gains as part of the expectable yield from such investment and, since the income from the fund is small, it is only the prospect of a capital gain which impels an investment in such fund. Prom such basis Professor Bogert argues that,'only by treating, capital gains distributions as income, can trustees be protected from claims of a breach of trust in investing in- such low yielding investments. See: Bogert, Trusts and Trustees (2d ed.), §858, p. 553 et seq. On the other hand, Professor Scott takes a contrary view. “Where the trustee does not hold the property which is sold, but holds shares of an investment company which makes a gain on the sale of securities held by it, a more difficult question arises. Where a trustee owns shares of a corporation which buys and sells unproductive land and this is its only source of profit, it is held .... that the net profit is income. On the other hand, in the case of an investment company, the principal source of return is the income received, although capital gains may be received and capital losses may be incurred. The capital gains received by the trustee from the investment company are not treated as income for tax purposes but are treated as capital gains. There is very little authority on the' question whether as between income beneficiary and beneficiary in remainder they should be treated as income or principal. In a few cases decided by the lower courts in New York, it has been held that capital gains received from incorporated .investment companies are allocable to income. Whether these cases will be followed is a doubtful question. They have met with strong criticism”. See: Scott on Trusts (2d ed.), Vol. III, §236.14, pp. 1844, 1845.</p>
