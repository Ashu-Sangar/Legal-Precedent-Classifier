Yes, and Mr; Hassel prepared a release because the Home: was left <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>without any assets to protect itself and at that time their Wills were offered to them, thinking that- since they were released they might desire to make Other provisions. These we were instructed to hold and keep,. That is the reason we had the Wills because I believe from repeated expressions from Mrs. Wachstetter., she said she did not want either his or her relatives to have any part of the estate, she wanted the Home to have the full amount, so that is the reason they didn’t make other Wills and they remained at the Home. . ... Q. When they left the Home did you turn their; Wills over to them? A. They were offered, yes sir. - Q. Did you turn them over? A. No, Mr. Hassel. was. their attorney and he understood we had the Wills. I offered them and we were told to keep them.; Q. You were told by Mr. Hassel to keep them? A. Yes, sir. By Me; Reese: Q. Just a couple questions. Dr. Dyrness first. After the Will of Mabel S. Wachstetter was signed, And that is the Will dated February 28, 1962, in whose possession-was it kept, or what was done with it after.it was signed? A. We did with it the same as we do with all Wills of our guests. It was filed in the folder for the Wachstetters. Q. Do I understand among the records of the Home? A. Yes, sir. Q. When the Wachstetter’s, that is Mr. and Mrs. Wachstetter left the home I understand they received certain papers and property. What, if anything, was done with the Wills at the time they left? A. At the time they left, they had Mr. Hassel as their attorney and I turned everything over to them with the Wachstetter Wills, and in other words, the fact he was representing them, therefore I offered at that time to give the checks and all other things that was not given into the hands of the Waehstetters to their legal counsel, Mr. Hassel, who was there with them, and he said, do you want the Wills and <em>the Wachstetter’s said, we would rather have you keep those. . . . </em>Q. But Mr. Hassel was present as coun<a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>sel of Mr. and Mrs. Wachstetter? A. Yes, sir. Q. And they again reiterated the statement they didn’t want the Wills, the Home was to have the estate? A. That’s right.”</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[205,552,1150,469]]]'>Thereafter the Wachstetters made a $5,000 deposit for the purchase of a new home but defaulted on their purchase agreement, and entered the Ephrata Nursing Home at Ephrata. Mrs. Wachstetter entered the Ephrata Home on May 15, 1968, and remained there until her death on August 1, 1963. Mr. Wachstetter had been at the General Hospital in Lancaster and came to the Ephrata Home from the hospital on June 10th, 1963. He died a week later.</p>
    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[207,1040,1146,252]]]'>We agree with the Court below that Mrs. Wachstetter’s will made an absolute gift of all her property to the Home, subject to a condition subsequent. That condition was, as we have seen, that the Home should take care of her husband for the rest of his life.</p>
    <p id="b264-6" data-blocks='[["BL_264.6",264,[205,1313,1149,310]]]'>We further agree that the Home’s inability to perform the aforesaid condition subsequent because of the prior death of testatrix’s husband did not invalidate the absolute legacy which she had given to the Home, subject as aforesaid.

Why the Wachstetters would leave the Quarryville Home and purchase their own home and thereafter go to the Ephrata Home, and still wish to leave all their property at their death to the Quarryville Home is difficult to understand. However, appellants’ own witness testified, as above mentioned, that in spite of leaving the Quarryville Home, Mrs. Wachstetter still wanted that Home to have all her estate, and this testimony of Dyrness<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">*</a> was believed by the auditing judge. As we have <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>often said, a Judge who sees and hears the witnesses is in a much better position than an appellate Court to determine the credibility of the witness. We must therefore conclude that the testatrix did not wish or intend to change or abrogate her will of February 28, 1962, and that under its terms and the conditions hereinbefore recited, the Home is entitled to all her residuary estate.</p>

    <p class="author" id="A9C" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[710,883,460,33]]]'>Mr. Justice Roberts:</p>
    <p id="b265-6" data-blocks='[["BL_265.7",265,[134,936,1151,357]]]'>I respectfully but strongly urge that the majority, in sustaining the present award, has misconstrued the instant will and read into it an intention on the part of the testatrix which finds no support in the instrument when considered in light of the circumstances surrounding its execution. I am compelled, therefore, to dissent.</p>
    <p id="b265-7" data-blocks='[["BL_265.8",265,[135,1314,1153,1021]],["BL_266.1",266,[226,334,1153,372]]]'>By concerning itself primarily with the issue of whether the provision of the will dealing with the support and maintenance of the testatrix’s husband is subject to a condition precedent or a condition subsequent, the majority has permitted the central question presented by this appeal to become obscured and, in the process, inadequately considered. There is no present need to consider the effect of that provision of the will, if the instrument, when considered in its entirety, discloses the existence of a condition which operates to defeat the residuary gift. Stated more particularly, if the residuary gift was <em>conditioned </em>on the continuance of the relationship between the testatrix and the appelleehome which prompted the bequest, there is no need to proceed further. Given such a condition, the fact that the testatrix and her husband had long since severed any connection with the appellee-home would be sufficient to defeat the gift irrespective of the effect to be given to the language of the instrument dealing with <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>the support :and maintenance of. testatrix’s.husband.: In <em>my </em>view,, the will,;when construed’in. light of the- circumstances -. surrounding its execution, discloses the existence;-of just such a-condition. Since that condition; was not realized, the gift failed and there is no need to'consider that provision upon which the ..majority'principally; relies.</p>
    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[224,716,1155,1014]]]'>In sustaining the instant award, the majority assumes --that’.an absolute' gift 'was intended-, subject to a condition subsequent which-was displaced by the fact that events: beyondrthe, control of the..appellee-home made its realization; impossible. Such am assumption ¡finds no support in fact or reason and leads to a result which, is-completely unwarranted. The facts and circumstances surrounding the execution Of the instant .-will, rather than supporting an intent on the part of .the testatrix tomate .such a gift, point to quite a contrary conclusion. They more readily and reasonably 'Suggest' that the. testatrix impliedly conditioned' the challenged: gift upon the continuance of the relationship which prompted and was the quid pro quo for. the execution of-the will. When the testatrix-and her husband-dépa-r ted. from the appellee-home and terminated any, connection therewith, the condition under which the gift was to be made . no longer was capable of realization and the gift failed. - .</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[223,1742,1153,577]],["BL_267.1",267,[125,336,1150,263]],["BL_267.2",267,[127,608,1000,43]]]'>,Such,.'a conclusion is compelled by .an examination of; the record. That examination reveals nothing to sug-gest. an. intent, charitable or otherwise, on the part of 'the;testatiix-.t.o benefit the appellee-home when she executed: the will.: To the contrary,-the record" reveals that the,;will was executed solely and exclusively, in response to. i.a requirement , imposed by the home as a condition ;of -.entry, thereto. The execution of- the will, was merely one ..aspect’ of-a business transaction in which the testatrix, and the Lome “bargained” over the price of entry fo the hómé. '-That transaction: included the execution <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>of a contract between the parties which provided for the conveyance of the testatrix’s property to the home and pursuant to which the instaht will'Was made."Thus, the testatrix executed the instrument, not oiit of any independent desire to benefit the appellee-home, but merely in fulfillment of a contractual obligation.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[124,662,1158,1284]]]'>Under such circumstances, I am unable to conclude that the testatrix, at the point in time' when the will was executed, entertained an intent to make a 'gift' which went beyond the business arrangement. between the parties. The only intention that I am able, to infer, at that point in time , was an intention to make the re-, quired residuary gift, subject to the condition that: either she or her husband, or both, continued to be provided and cared for by the home, an intention Which followed the contour of the contractual arrangment, Between the parties. When that , relationship was, severed, and the contract terminated, a set of circumstances, were created far different from those intended to be’ the operative basis' of the gift. Under such elicit instances, the only reasonable conclusion is that the gift was impliedly conditioned on a relationship which was terminated by the departure of . the testatrix, and, her husband from the appellee-home. The departure of the testatrix and her husband from the home, the rescission of the contract, and their entry into another home created a factual circumstance other than that’ under, which the gift was intended to .vest. Accordingly, the gift to the home failed and the award of the court be-, low should be reversed. • -</p>
