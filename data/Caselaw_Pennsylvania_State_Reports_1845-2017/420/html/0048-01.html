Fahringer, also nick-named ‘Park’ or ‘Parky’, is not related by blood or marriage to the decedent, nor have he and the <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>decedent ever resided in the same household. During the claimant’s youthful years, he resided in the samé neighborhood as the decedent and began to perform various chores in and around the decedent’s household for the decedent and his first wife. Such chores consisted in assisting in the care of the decedent’s pigeons, mowing the lawn, shoveling snow, washing automobiles, etc. Soon after the claimant was graduated from high school, he was employed by the decedent, at a salary undisclosed by the evidence, in a tobacco business conducted by the decedent trading as David Forry Tobacco Company. He remained in such employment until the business was sold by the decedent on or about February 1, 1957, or a period of about 25 years. Meanwhile, despite claimant’s own marriage in 1937, he continued the performance of household chores, such as above described, for the decedent and his first wife. Further, such chores consisted of lawn work, acting as a chauffeur on occasion, assisting in the care of decedent’s automobiles, and caring for the latter’s dogs. The only evidence as to the exact amount of time which the claimant devoted to such personal services is that it was ‘many and many a time’, ‘mostly Saturdays’, ‘every week mowing grass’, and endured until the decedent sold his tobacco business in 1957. There is evidence that from 1953 to 1956 another young man was employed to cut grass and wash cars for the decedent and, during much of this interval, the claimant was at the decedent’s home on Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons.</p>

There must be shown by believable testimony that the decedent, <em>in the presence of the claimant, </em>made statements, in the form of a promise or offer, upon which the claimant could reasonably be expected to act in reliance on such statements.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Such a rule is sound because a con<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>tract to bequeath by will must be shown as any other contract must be shown; essential to such proof is evidence that the minds of the parties met on the terms of the contract and, absent any proof that decedent made a statement or statements amounting to the requisite promise or offer, to the claimant or in his presence, upon what basis can it be said that the claimantpromisee, either by word or by act, accepted a non-communicated promise or offer?</p>
