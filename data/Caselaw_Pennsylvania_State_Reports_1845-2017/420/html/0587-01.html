Initially, the propriety of such procedure must be determined. In <em>Rogers </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/379/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="379 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="1253640" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0494-01">379 Pa. 494</a>, 495, 496, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.2d%20924" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="108 A.2d 924">108 A. 2d 924</a> we said: “In the settlement of a decedent’s estate disputed title to property should not be determined upon exceptions to an inventory and appraisement which happens not to include the property claimed on behalf of the estate. The function and object of an inventory and appraisement in a decedent’s estate is to fix <em>presumptively </em>the existence of property in the possession of the fiduciary and the value thereof. This is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of ownership and value. Such list-ting does not affect the true ownership and value: [authorities cited]. The question of ownership is of interest to creditors, federal and state taxing authorities, and others. Such title, therefore, should not be finally determined until after an audit, with due statutory notice. . . . Nonetheless, the proper procedure is as we have hereinabove indicated and is, therefore, to be followed.” See also: <em>Higbee v. Koziol, </em><a href="/pa/383/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="383 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1261986" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0116-01">383 Pa. 116</a>, 118, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.2d%20707" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="117 A.2d 707">117 A. 2d 707</a>. <em>Rogers </em>and <em>Higbee </em>would proscribe the procedure followed in the court below.

The record indicates that, after the death of the decedent, the physical possession of the stock certificates was in Helen Mockler but the question arises how did she obtain possession? While she claims that she received possession of these certificates three days prior to his death from the decedent by a hand delivery of them to her as a gift; such claim is not supported, as we shall demonstrate infra, by any competent testimony. Such portion of the oral testimony presented by her <em>that was competent </em>would indicate that she was the first person in decedent’s home after his death, that at that time she was alone and that she was aware of. the presence of these securities, all factual testimony evidencing that she had full opportunity to have received possession of these certificates other than by delivery from the decedent. Under such circumstances, Helen Mockler’s physical possession of the certificates immediately after the decedent’s death does not give rise to any presumption: cf. <em>Reading Trust Co. v.

In support of Mrs. Mockler’s position, reliance is placed upon <em>Scheid v.

Factually, <em>Scheid, Kaufmann </em>and <em>King </em>are not presently apposite. Moreover, the theory of competency on which Mrs. Mockler proceeds is that <em>her </em>statements to the witnesses Travis and Girton, even though self-serving, were admissible because she was <em>then </em>in possession of the stock certificates and her statements merely explained her possession; the major difficulty with this contention is that the record does not show such possession as would justify the application of the rule which is urged.</p>

The exception to the hearsay rule which counsel urge is based upon the theory that the hearsay rule is inapplicable where the testimony offered consists of “the acts and declarations of claim of title by the occupant [or the possessor]” of property which make “more definite and significant the nature of [such] person’s custody or occupation [or posses<a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>sion]” of the property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Even under that theory and again assuming, arguendo, the possession of the stock certificates by Mrs. Mockler at the time of decedent’s death, the declarations and statements of Mrs. Mockler sought to be introduced through the testimony of the witnesses Travis and G-irton went far beyond the type of statements and declarations contemplated as an exception to the hearsay rule. The exception to the rule admits self-serving statements and declarations only if they are restricted and limited to show the character of the possession or occupancy claimed; statements and declarations should be excluded if “their sole effect is to show the source of title, . . . and are but narrative of past transactions with respect to title.” <em>(Radford v.
