However, the actions of the life tenant — widow in the case at bar — were such as to command judicial interference that the clearly expressed intent of the testator be not completely thwarted. The proceeds of -the gift made under the will were taken by the life tenant — widow and, literally, given away to her own kindred. The will clearly shows the testamentary design of the testator; the property disposed of in the Sixth paragraph of the will which is-the subject of this litigation was the property- of testator’s mother over which she had given testator the power of disposition; in making such disposition, the primary object of testator’s bounty was his wife and to her he gave this, property in such manner that she was-to have not only the income therefrom but even the principal <em>if </em>she needed it and she was to be the judge as to whether she needed to consume the principal, in whole or in part; however, <em>ij </em>she did not <em>need </em>to consume the principal,, in whole, or in part, he then provided that whatever remained of' the principal when she died should be given to his sister, the only relative having a common blood line with the original owner of this property. Despite this clearly expressed design of the testator, the life tenant-widow sought to change the testamentary plan and, through the medium of a trust, to dispose of the property to her own blood relatives to the exclusion of testator’s blood relative specifically designated by testator as the second taker of the. property. The record portrays ail attempt on the part of the life tenant-, widow to divert this property to a purpose other than that provided by the will, a diversion which cannot be countenanced.</p>

[testator’s] intention was to give [his wife] so much, and only so much, though possibly amounting to the whole, as should be necessary for her own comfort and enjoyment of life, <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>and the residue, be it much or little, was' to pass-under his will. This disposition of his estate violated no rule of law. . . . But, the purpose being clear and lawful, it is the duty of courts to see that it is carried out and not defeated for mere inconvenience of form. The extent of the widow’s’ consumption of the estate was within her control. Her decision was without appeal, but it must have been honestly reached in accordance with the purpose the testator intended, and not merely color-ably to defeat his will. She had power to carry out his intentions by sale, transfer and consumption of the proceeds in such a way as to leave nothing at her death. But a transfer with intent not to consume for herself,' but to preserve for others after her death, and to change the beneficiaries after her from those chosen by her husband to others of her own selection would be a fraud on the testator and his will. . . . The test in all such cases is the good faith of the action of the beneficiary. If it is an honest exercise of the discretion with which the testator has clothed him his action is conclusive, but he cannot be permitted to make use of the mere form to’ defeat or evade the true intent and pervert the gift to a different purpose.” See also: <em>Johnson Estate, </em><a href="/pa/359/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="359 Pa. 645" data-case-ids="473133" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0645-01">359 Pa. 645</a>, 650, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20877" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="59 A.2d 877">59 A. 2d 877</a>.</p>
