    <p id="b103-4" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[126,500,1152,1348]]]'>The Fiduciaries Act of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, §621, 20 P.S. §320.621, provides that any action <em>may be </em>instituted against the personal representative of a decedent’s estate or his surety <em>in the county </em>wherein the letters were granted, and also provides for the method of service in the event the personal representative or the surety are not residents of that county. In construing substantially similar provisions in the Acts of March 27, 1854, P. L. 214, and June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, §37, 20 P.S. §784, lower courts of this Commonwealth have ruled that the legislature did not intend thereby to vest exclusive jurisdiction of actions against an estate in the county wherein the letters were issued. (See, <em>Harris v. Blatt, </em>35 Lanc. 361 (1918).) These courts concluded that this section merely provided the means of securing service of process upon nonresident fiduciaries in actions instituted against the estate in the county issuing the letters. Additionally, this Court has held that a foreign fiduciary (i.e., one whose letters were issued in another state) is subject to an action in our courts if he is personally served with process in Pennsylvania. See, <em>Laughlin &amp; McManus v. Solomon, </em><a href="/pa/180/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="180 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="888369" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0177-01">180 Pa. 177</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20A.%20704" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="36 A. 704">36 A. 704</a> (1897).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> We see no logical reason why a different rule should prevail in the present situation.</p>

      <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>'Section 601 of the Act of 1949, merely provides that all causes of action, except slander and libel, shall survive the death of either the plaintiff or defendant. ( Contra to the common law rule that all causes of action terminated and abated upon a person’s death.) It does not say that exclusive jurisdiction of causes of action against an estate shall be in the courts of the county wherein the estate is administered. Nor does it indicate that the personal representative of an estate is in a different category than the deceased himself would be if he had survived. It is, of course, established beyond argument as to the latter situation, that a personal action for tort is transitory in nature and any court may entertain jurisdiction if the defendant is personally served with process within the county of the instituted action. See, <em>Gossard v. Gossard, </em><a href="/pa/319/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="319 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1162298" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0129-01">319 Pa. 129</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.%20837" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="178 A. 837">178 A. 837</a> (1935).</p>

Although the rule specifically refers to actions against <em>individuals </em>and makes no mention of decedents’ estates, the majority concludes that it is applicable in both instances. Such a construction is unjustified and is contrary to the settled distinction between individual and representative actions. To ignore this distinction, as does the majority, places an unwarranted and unreasonable burden upon a decedent’s estate.</p>
    <p id="b106-6" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[235,1481,1148,421]]]'>Under the majority’s construction of Pa. R. C. P. 1006(a), a decedent’s estate in effect is carried with an individual fiduciary in his travels through the Commonwealth. Thus, such estate may be subjected to suit in any county, no matter how distant or inconvenient, in which the fiduciary is served with process even though his presence in that county may be wholly unrelated to his duties or responsibilities to the estate.</p>

Such a construction, in my view, is not sufficiently responsive to those considerations which are relevant in the determination of the appropriate situs for suit. While an individual may be subjected to suit in any county in which he elects to expose himself to service of process, a decedent’s estate, once placed in the “hip-pocket” of a fiduciary, may be drawn to an inconvenient and distant forum without a similar degree of choice. Since the Act of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, §621, 20 P.S. §320.621 provides for deputized service in any county and thereby ensures that a fiduciary may not, by removing himself and remaining absent from the county in which his letters were issued, insulate the estate from suit, I see no reason for a construction which places undue emphasis on the problem of securing service of process at the expense of other considerations more relevant to the issue of proper venue.</p>

Such a fiduciary, under the majority’s construction, by making himself amenable to service of process in the county of plaintiff’s choice, may make the situs of suit solely a matter of plaintiff’s discretion.</p>
