This motion was denied by the court below on the ground that this question could have been raised by the appellee in opposition to the appellants’ petition to open the judgment; that, having failed to do so at that time and having failed to appeal the adverse ruling, appellee could not in this manner collaterally attack the order opening the judgment.

Counsel for the parties stipulated that, if this amount was found to be due, the interest thereon amounted to $3,245.89 and, further, that the appellee would be entitled, in accordance with the terms of the note, to a collection fee of $1,899.98.</p>

To invoke the instant application of this principle, they contend that the appellee’s conduct in entering judgment on the note and his assignment thereof to the use of The Federation of Jewish Agencies, a charity, was part of a fraudulent design on the part of appellee to obtain a federal income tax deduction. In line with such alleged design, it is contended that appellee, aware that his chances of total repayment of the note were slim, conceived a plan to obtain a charitable deduction. Assuming, - arguendo, that appellee did conceive such plan, it is of no moment, since to render parol evidence admissible the fraud involved must be material and relevant to the execution of the written instrument. Here the alleged fraud upon which appellants base their contention occurred some months after the execution of the judgment note.</p>

Use-plaintiff Hughes’ rights clearly will be preserved, notwithstanding our denial of his motion.” (R. 26a) Judge Sporkin clearly did not pass upon the parol evidence issue. The third order is that of our Court on. the appeal from Judge Sporkin’s order. We simply affirmed Judge Sporkin on-the ground.that the issues, including, .the parol evidence issue, could have been. raised.-at . the hearing to open the judgment and that orderly procedure precluded the appellee being given another’ opportunity <em>prior </em>to trial to raise such issues, particularly when the earlier order was not appealed.</p>
