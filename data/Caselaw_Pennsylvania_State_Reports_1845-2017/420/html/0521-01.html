For order of abatement purposes in the Fiduciaries Act, “issue” constitutes a legislative mandate determining a favored class <em>to keep </em>that part of decedent’s estate which has already been specifically devised or bequeathed.

However, this line of cases defines “issue” in the context of what the <em>testator </em>was presumed to have intended by his choice of that word, sometimes buttressed by other language in the particular will under consideration. On the other hand, the Statutory Construction Act’s definition of “issue” is not based on a legislative presumption of what <em>decedent </em>might have intended if he had written a will but rather on a <em>state policy </em>of what class of people should be favored if decedent has made no such provision. Similarly, the statutory order of abatement is not based on <em>testator’s </em>presumed priority of abatement but rather on a <em>state policy </em>of what class of people should keep their specific devises and bequests at the expense of other specific devisees and legatees who must first pay for the estate’s deficiencies.</p>
