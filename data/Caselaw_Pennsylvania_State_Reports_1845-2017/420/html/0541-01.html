The child subsequently died. Costanzo has not been seen or heard from by anyone since about 1921. In 1927 decedent entered into a meretricious relationship with appellant. Several attempts were made to locate Costanzo: inquiry where a relative of his was supposed to be living, inquiry in the Poconos where Costanzo was supposed to have a place of business, and inquiry of the parish priest who also fruitlessly sought him. Testimony of decedent’s sister shows that appellant and decedent may have heard information that a Prank Costanzo resided in Beading, but they did not inquire further. Appellant and decedent were married in Delaware in 1946. Appellant knew of the prior marriage.</p>

By introducing the marriage certificate of decedent and Costanzo, appellees satisfied their initial burden of proof since <em>Watt Estate, </em><a href="/pa/409/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="409 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="1883179" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0044-01">409 Pa. 44</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20781" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="185 A.2d 781">185 A. 2d 781</a> (1962), holds that there is a presumption that a valid marriage, once contracted, continues until proof of divorce or death of a spouse. However, the same case also holds that there are presumptions of the validity of a second marriage and the innocence of the spouses. These presumptions are rebuttable by direct evidence or inferences of fact.</p>

This rule was stated in <em>Madison v. Lewis, </em><a href="/pa-super/151/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="151 Pa.

This is a sufficiently long period of time to come within the rule of <em>Madison </em>and <em>Watt. </em>Bolstering our determination that the burden rests upon the appellees are the facts that: (1) some of the appellees encouraged the second marriage or acquiesced in it, and (2)' Costanzo’s whereabouts continued to be unknown. Since the appellees have not met the burden reimposed upon them by the long absence of Costahzo, requiring them to show the continuance of the prior marriage, they must fail.</p>
