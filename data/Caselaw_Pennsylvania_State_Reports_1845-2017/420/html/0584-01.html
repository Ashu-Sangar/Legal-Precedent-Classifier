On July 24, 1963, after service of the writ, appellee ruled appellants to file a complaint within 20 days or suffer a judgment of non pros. On November 22, 1963, a judgment of non pros, was entered.</p>
    <p id="b621-8" data-blocks='[["BL_621.10",621,[131,1097,1153,304]]]'>Appellants then filed a petition to strike the judgment of non pros. Appellee answered the petition and a hearing was held.

In that case, we said that in order for a default judgment to be opened, (a) the petition mus.t be promptly filed; (b) the. default or delay reasonably, explained or excused;,(c) a.defense shown-to exist on the merits. In a case involving the striking of a judgment of non pros., the same criteria should <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>apply; (1) the petition should be timely filed; (2) the reason for the default reasonably explained or excused, and (3) that facts constituting grounds for a cause of action be alleged. Our examination of the record in this case convinces us that the above criteria have been met and justice is best served by striking the judgment of non pros, and permitting the case to proceed to trial on its merits.</p>
    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[188,777,1150,1448]]]'>Appellants were first represented by ah attorney in Clearfield County. Within two weeks following the filing of the praecipe, appellants’ attorney suffered a “heart relapse” due to an aortic valve disease. The testimony established that the attorney’s heart rapidly deteriorated and his ability to perform his professional duties diminished. The testimony also discloses that the attorney was aware of his condition and was greatly frightened by this knowledge and by the neAvs that he had to undergo surgery. The attorney’s doctor testified as follows: “I think he was frightened to death, and I don’t believe Mr. Kitko knew what he was doing between the time, that is, generally speaking, not specifically, between the time he was told that he had severe heart disease and had to undergo surgery. He was in complete panic, and I don’t think Mr. Kitko particularly cared about what his work was. He was just scared to death and rightfully so. I would have been too. ... I believe Mr. Kitko was in such a state of mind that he was not thinking about his legal Avork or what he had to do legally. He wás thinking in terms of the surgery, heart surgery, and what the future had to offer for him and his family,” The doctor also-testified that as a result of the' attorney’s ailment, there wás an insufficient supply of blood reaching' the brain AVhich affected his cerebration, along with symptoms of dizziness and weakness in the legs.</p>
