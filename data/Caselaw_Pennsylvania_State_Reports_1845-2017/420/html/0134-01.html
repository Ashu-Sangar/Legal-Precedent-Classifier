The United States Government had no standing to move the court and its action in doing so and the court’s response thereto in terms of this appeal were without decisional force or effect. Accordingly, in the eyes of the law, no interest of either of the parties to this suit has as yet been adversely ruled upon by the court below and the parties remain in precisely the same position that they were prior to this unusual proceeding.

For while I view the circumstances previously noted as militating equally against the issuance of the writ, the majority proceeds to provide the extraordinary relief which defendant has sought. I am at a loss to understand the majority’s haste to act. To the date of the taking of defendant’s appeal, all that has occurred was the refusal of the hearing court to grant the motion to dismiss of a nonparty to the litigation. No determination has yet been made on the <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>regularly advanced claims of either plaintiff or defendant. Defendant’s preliminary objections remain pending in the court below. The net effect of these circumstances leads me to conclude that at this juncture we are confronted with a preliminary question of jurisdiction upon which the court below has not yet passed. The issue is obviously not ripe for appellate review. The record fails to disclose the existence of any prejudice or harm to the litigants which would justify or suggest either the need for or the desirability of immediate and extraordinary intervention on the part of this Court. In the absence of such circumstances, I find no basis for the present intrusion upon the regular process of adjudication which the majority presently undertakes.</p>
    <p id="b203-4" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[118,1154,1150,753]]]'>Aside from these considerations, a serious jurisdictional question is raised by plaintiff’s ex parte' dissolution of the attachment of the S.S. Ciudad De Valencia. Although defendant did not raise the matter of the dissolution of the attachment in its preliminary objections, it may and should be raised by this Court sua sponte. Sovereign immunity involves the exercise of restraint on the part of the court, in deference to the political arm of the government, with respect to jurisdiction which has once attached. If, because of some irregularity in the manner by which plaintiff has proceeded, neither defendant nor its property is properly before the court, then the question of sovereign immunity need not and should not be reached.</p>

The matter of defendant’s claim to immunity should not be considered by this Court until the court below enters an order which is in legal effect-adverse to and appealable by one of the parties.

It also seeks to concede that the dissolution of the attachment in no way affected any jurisdiction which may have been initially acquired thereby.</p>

Defendant’s view as to the effect of plaintiff’s dissolution of the attachment is not dispositive. Foreign attachment is a matter governed by statute and the Rules of Civil Procedure.

Moreover, all appear to involve written stipulations between the parties that any final judgment would be respected by the “claimant.” The effect of such stipulations is the creation of a contractual undertaking in lieu of bond. In the instant case, there is nothing of record to disclose any such undertaking between the parties. Therefore, a question is presented as to whether the court below retained a sufficient nexus with defendant or its property to ground jurisdiction. A determination as to the understanding of the parties, if such was the case, and its legal effect would appear required before this Court proceeds to hold that jurisdiction was not affected by the dissolution. I venture no view on the merits but believe the matter to be one requiring a determination by the court below in the first instance.</p>

No affront should arise merely because defendant is required to seek relief in accordance with the demands of an orderly judicial system.

In the latter part of April of that year the plaintiff entered into an agreement with the Venezuelan agency known as CADAEE, whereby it would install an electricity generating system-and sell power to the Venezuelan Government.

Even with this lion’s share being assured it, Venezuela still was not satisfied and, in September, 1962, demonstrated that the anti-gringo mask, behind which it had spoken, was not a mask but its actual face. Venezuela abrogated all its contractual obligations and ordered the plaintiff to complete the erection of its plant, produce energy and sell it to Venezuela at a ruinous loss per kilowatt hour. This was confiscation — bare and unadorned. It defied international law and subjected the plaintiff to losses aggregating $116,807,258.88. The plaintiff turned to the United States government for protection and asked the Secretary of State to intercede in its behalf. The Venezuelan Government, however, refused to enter into any dismission whatsoever on the subject. The plaintiff thus was compelled to file an action in the court of common pleas for damages caused by breach of contract and illegal expropriation of private property without compensation.

We have here, I cannot repeat too often or emphasize too much, the simplest business transaction and I cannot share the alarm evinced by the Majority Opinion that this litigation portends a crisis of state which conjures up even fear of a war with Venezuela. I cannot see in this dollar- and-cents commercial dealing an international extremity which should compel us to abandon primary princi<a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>pies of law, elementary concepts of justice, ordinary rules of logic and to turn our backs on our own citizens to enrich a nation which dispossessed American property owners, collected $380,000,000 from the pockets of American taxpayers, opposes allowing American investors a forum in which they may present their claims without apprehension or coercion and whose police condone the burning of the American Flag.</p>
    <p id="b231-4" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[161,771,1151,633]]]'>The Majority of this Court, in its final judgment, ignores the plain intendment of the decision of our highest court in the land, in the <em>Republic of China </em>case, it in effect defies a solemn act of Congress (<a href="/citations/?q=78%20Stat.%201009" class="citation" data-index="159" data-cite="78 Stat. 1009">78 Stat. 1009</a>), <a href="/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A72370" class="citation" data-index="160" data-cite="22 U.S.C. §2370">22 U.S.C. §2370</a>, which is practically the law in the case, and it treats casually the official pronouncement of the State Department itself in Dept, of State Bulletin, volume 26, page 984, which has never been recalled, changed or modified. For these reasons, therefore, I must dissent to what the Majority has done and what, in the face of the dominant law, it has failed to do but should do.</p>

But never before, in the annals of mankind, has the ingratitude been so enormous as in the case of Charles de. Gaulle’s massive contempt for the United States ... Of all recipients of U.S. aid, France stands at the very top in total amount received — $8,834,000,000 in. the period from July 1, 1945 to December 31, 1964. This sum, though astronomical, does not begin to tell the full story. It can be written only in the agony and blood of the thousands of Americans who have fought in France in two World Wars and have died in battle in order that the French might endure as a free people. Charles de Gaulle expresses his ‘thanks’ with a campaign of vicious abuse that knows no limits . .</p>
