Judge Hand in that case stated-: “The perils clause is an ‘all risk’ clause, and. the. libelant has discharged his burden when- he has proved, that the loss was due to. a casualty and was caused by some event,, as here by the hydrostatic .test, covered by the general expressions of the policy.. ‘He is. not bound to go further, and prove the exact nature of the accident or casualty which- in fact occasioned his loss.’ British &amp; Foreign Marine Ins. Co. v. Gaunt, (1921) A. C. 41. In the Inchmaree clause the casualty came within a specified risk. ... As Lord Sumner, said, in the recent case of British &amp; Foreign Marine Co. v. Gaunt, (1921) 2 A.C. at page 57: ‘The expression' does not cover inherent vice or mere wear and tear. It covers a risk, not a certainty; it is -something which happens to the subject-matter from without, not the. natural behavior of that subject-matter, being what it is, in the circumstances under which it is carried. Nor is it a loss which the assured brings about by his own-act, for then he has not merely exposed the goods to the chance of injury; he has injured them himself. Finally, the description ‘all risks’ does not alter the general law; only risks are covered which it is lawful to-cover, and the onus of proof remains where it would have been on a policy against ordinary sea perils.’ See, also, Schloss Brothers v. Stevens, [1906] 2 K.B. 665; Grant Smith &amp; Co. v. Seattle Construction &amp; Dry Dock Co., [1920] A.C. 162.”</p>

Rothblum, Inc., </em><a href="/misc/147/0865-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="147 Misc. 865" data-case-ids="830449" data-case-paths="/misc/147/0865-01">147 Misc. 865</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=265%20N.Y.S.%207" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="265 N.Y.S. 7">265 N.Y.S. 7</a>. It was there held that the sole obligation of the plaintiff was to furnish the defendant with such explanation as it, in good faith, had received and accepted as to the time and cause of the loss. If we were to require the plaintiff to go further and guarantee the accuracy of the explanation of the loss that might have been given to it by the person to whom custody of the goods had been entrusted and who, himself, might be guilty of a fraud unknown to the plaintiff, the inclusive character of the Coverage afforded by the insurance policy would be a mere delusion. If the custodian of the property converted the same and was guilty of a breach of trust, the defendant should establish that fact. This rule was followed in <em>Chase Rand Corp. v. Central Ins. Co. of Baltimore, </em><a href="/f-supp/63/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="63 F. Supp. 626" data-case-ids="631481" data-case-paths="/f-supp/63/0626-01">63 F.

The plaintiff, at trial, proved delivery of the jewelry to Ben Levit, a jewelry dealer, on consignment. Ben Levit, in turn, entrusted certain items of jewelry which he had received from the plaintiff to his nephew, Hyman Levit, who was employed by his uncle as a salesman. Hyman Levit reported the jewelry in his custody was stolen while he was on the road going to Van Horn, Texas. There was serious question at the trial as to whether the alleged robbery, in fact, did occur. Defendant, in its answer, in addition to a general denial of the allegations set forth in' the complaint, set forth six affirmative defenses, all but two of which were abandoned. The ones that remained were: “(2) That the defendant, by an exception contained in the policy, is without liability, if loss, damage or expense occurs to the assured as a result of theft or an act of dishonest character on the part of the assured or his employee, or any person to whom the insured property may be delivered or entrusted. It is then alleged that the jewelry in question was entrusted to Ben Levit on memorandum, and .that he, in violation of his trust, delivered the same to Hyman Levit and that the loss was due to a breach of trust. (6) That the loss, if it occurred at all, was the result of the. conversion of plaintiff’s merchandise by Hyman Levit, to whom Ben Levit had entrusted it, and that such conversion is not within the .terms of the policy.”</p>

A box containing certain rings was missing. A thorough search was made for the ring box and rings but they were never found. There was no evidence of possible entry, either of the store or the safe where the box was stored. The missing rings were insured under provisions of a Jewelers Mutual policy. Various defenses were raised by the respective defendants, similar <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>to those in the instant case. In considering the first defense, that of mysterious disappearance, the court very clearly and, we believe, correctly answers this question, stating: “Considering the first defense — mysterious disappearance — raised by Jeweler’s as a defense to the suit brought against it by Julien and Harriet Balogh, and by Western Assurance as a defense to the suit brought against it by David Balogh, we must begin with the proposition that this is not a theft policy. Plaintiffs in the respective suits are not required to show a theft before they are entitled to recover. The policy here involved is much broader and is of the type known as an ‘all-risk’ policy. It is axiomatic that plaintiff must show that the loss falls within the risks insured against, but it is also axiomatic, that it is for the defendant to show that the loss was not due to one of the risks insured against but rather to an excepted cause. It would seem that all plaintiff need show in such a case is a loss, since losses from all causes are covered. Defendant, arguing that a mysterious disappearance is ‘any disappearance the circumstances of which excite — and at the same time baffle — wonder or curiosity.’ attempts to distinguish between the classic cases of lost or misplaced property, and a case which is baffling and therefore a mysterious disappearance. Assuming that it has proved its point, at least in the first instance, defendant argues that plaintiff was therefore under the obligation to go forward and prove a theft, and, having failed to do so, cannot recover. As can be seen, defendant relies to a large extent on semantics. Under his theory, any loss, the exact cause of which could not be proved by at least a preponderance of the evidence, would automatically be classed as a mysterious disappearance, and recovery would be defeated unless the plaintiff could prove a theft, embezzlement, or some other specific cause. What then becomes of the ‘all-risk’ feature of the policy? As the Court said in <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>Chase Rand Corporation v. Central Ins. Co. of Baltimore, in construing such a feature of a jeweler’s block policy: ‘Plaintiff’s sole obligation was to furnish defendant with such explanation, as it, in good faith, received and accepted concerning the time and cause of the loss, and this it has done. If plaintiff were required to go further . . . the inclusive character of the coverage of the insurance policy would be a <em>delusion, and a </em>snare’ (emphasis in original) citing and relying upon Agricultural Insurance Co. v. A. Rothblum, Inc., which had held that ‘in an action by the insured against insurer, the onus would not be upon the insured to allege and prove, as a condition precedent, that the loss was not occasioned by the specified exceptions. Rather it would be incumbent upon the insurer to allege and prove, as a condition subsequent, that the loss arose from one of the excepted causes.’</p>
    <blockquote id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.4",612,[180,1263,1151,420]]]'>“If the clauses in each of the policies, that of Jeweler’s Mutual and that of Western Assurance, be examined, it will be found that they read: ‘This Policy Insures Against All Risks Of Loss Of Or Damage' To The Above- Described Property Arising From Any Cause Whatsoever Except: ... (M) Unexplained loss, mysterious disappearance or loss or shortage disclosed on taking inventory.’ ”</blockquote>

In fact the whole-exception seems to concern itself with losses, disappearances or shortages disclosed upon the taking of inventory. At least it is equally susceptible of such an interpretation and the ambiguity is to be resolved against the party drawing the instrument. Furthermore such an interpretation would be more in keeping with the ‘all-risk’ feature of <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>the policy than would defendant’s suggested interpretation. It must be observed that the cases upon which defendant relies do not involve ‘all-risk’ policies, but rather theft policies, in which a mysterious disappearance is made prima facie evidence of theft. This type of policy is so different from that with which we are here concerned that the cases construing such theft policies are of little or no weight in the present situation.”</p>
