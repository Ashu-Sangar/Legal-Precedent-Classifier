As stated in the early case of <em>Marsh v. Commonwealth, </em>16 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 319 (1827), “[I]t is time enough to permit him to arrest the course of the criminal law, when he has suffered actual injury.” The issue here, therefore, is whether or not the Act of 1957, supra, creates an exception to the established rule and permits a defendant to appeal from an order (which is <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>patently interlocutory) refusing his discharge after motion filed under the act. We conclude it does not.</p>
    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.4",100,[192,438,1149,467]]]'>The Act of 1957, in pertinent part, provides as follows: “In all criminal prosecutions in this Commonwealth in which the jury is dismissed or discharged by the court without reaching a verdict recorded by the court on motion of the defendant that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the charge, the court shall discharge the defendant and dismiss the case if it decides that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction.”</p>

In fact, the word “appeal” is not mentioned. This is particularly significant when contrasted with the Act of April 20, 1911, P. L. 70, §1, 12 P.S. §684, whereby a party litigant is given the right to move for judgment on the whole record after a jury disagreement in civil cases, and wherein the right to appeal from an order on the motion is specifically and expressly granted.</p>
    <p id="b100-6" data-blocks='[["BL_100.7",100,[191,1465,1147,680]]]'>It may be argued that the right to appeal exists by implication and, unless such right exists, the act serves no purpose. But this is not so. Under the law, prior to the Act of 1957, if the trial court erroneously overruled a motion for a directed verdict and submitted the issue to the jury, it could not subsequently order a discharge of the defendant, even though the evidence at trial was insufficient to warrant conviction. The only remedy open was to grant a new trial: <em>Commonwealth v. Wright, </em>supra, and <em>Commonwealth v. Heller, </em><a href="/pa-super/147/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="147 Pa. Super. 68" data-case-ids="1039031" data-case-paths="/pa-super/147/0068-01">147 Pa.

Obviously, the purpose of the disputed section of the Act of 1957 was to correct such a situation.</p>
