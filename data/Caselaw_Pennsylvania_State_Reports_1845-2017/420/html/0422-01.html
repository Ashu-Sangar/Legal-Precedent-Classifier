    <p id="b460-4" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[186,727,1145,424]]]'>The Philadelphia Electric Company, believing this ordinance to be an improper exercise of governmental power, refused to be bound by its provisions and began construction in November, 1964, of a pipeline which would carry natural gas from one of its existing lines in Chester County to a residential development in another part of the county, without first filing plans as dictated by the ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.5",460,[186,1163,1147,528]]]'>The county authorities instituted an action in equity to enjoin the company from pursuing its construction job. The Philadelphia Company filed preliminary objections, averring that the court had no jurisdiction, that the propriety of its pipeline construction was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commission, that the county, in enacting the ordinance in question, violated both the Federal and State Constitutions, and that the county, if it had any remedy, was required to seek it in law and not in equity.</p>
    <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.6",460,[186,1702,1148,310]]]'>The Court of Common Pleas of Chester County sustained the preliminary objections on the basis that the county lacked constitutional power to enact the ordinance and that, therefore, it was unnecessary to consider the other matters raised by the company.' The county appealed.</p>

The State, speaking through the Public Utility Law, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1053,. §1 et seq., as amended (66 P.S. §1101 et seq.) has given the Public Utility Commission all-embracive regulatory jurisdiction over companies such as the defendant company in this case. In <em>Lansdale Boro. v. Philadelphia Electric Company, </em><a href="/pa/403/0647-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="403 Pa. 647" data-case-ids="1299520" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0647-01">403 Pa. 647</a>, this Court held: “no principle has become more firmly established in Pennsylvania law than that the courts will not originally adjudicate matters within the jurisdiction of the PUC. Initial jurisdiction in matters concerning the relationship between public utilities and the public is in the PUC — not in the courts. It has been so held involving rates, service, rules of service, <em>extension and expansion, hazard to public safety due to use of utility facilities, installation of utility facilities, location of utility facilities, </em>obtaining, alerting, dissolving, abandoning, selling or transferring .any right, power, privilege, service, franchise or,property and rights to serve particular territory.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

The necessity for conformity in the regulation and control of public utilities is as apparent as the electric lines which one views traversing the Commonwealth.
