In the meantime the strip mining of anthracite coal had created in the anthracite coal field in Northeastern Pennsylvania an intolerable situation. In disregard of the interests of the public, the strip mine operators scarred and defaced the region, removed the overburden from the coal and piled it in huge and unsightly refuse banks which constituted potential fire hazards, created holes, open pits and huge craters in the terrain which were left unfilled and in such condition as to constitute potentially dangerous' traps for unwary children and adults, converted vast areas of scenic beauty into unsightly and ugly surroundings and even conducted their mining operations in close proximity to the yards and homes of the public: in short, these operators created a situation which adversely affected the properties, the safety and the general welfare of the public in the area. The complete indifference of government on the state level to the creation and existence of this intolerable situation. up until 1947 is beyond understanding; even now, the condition remains but slightly alleviated.</p>

On the other, hand there are statutes which expressly provide that municipal- legislation in regard to the -subject- covered by the State act is forbidden. Then there is a third class of statutes which, regulating some industry or occupation, are silent as to whether municipalities are or are not permitted to enact supplementary legislation or to impinge in any manner upon the field entered upon by the State; in such cases the question whether municipal action is permissible must be determined by an analysis of the provisions of the act itself in order to ascertain the probable intention of the legislature in that regard. It is of course self-evident that a municipal ordinance cannot be sustained to the extent that it is contradictory to, or inconsistent with, a state statute: [citing an authority]. . . . municipalities in the exercise of the police power may regulate certain occupations by imposing restrictions which are in addition to, and not <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>In conflict with, statutory regulations: [citing authorities].

It is also apparent that, even if the statute is silent on supersession, but proclaims a course of regulation and control which brooks no municipal intervention, all ordinances touching the topic of exclusive control fade away into the limbo of ‘innocuous desuetude’. However, where the Act is silent as to monopolistic domination and a municipal ordinance provides for a localized procedure which furthers the salutary scope of the Act, the ordinance is welcomed as an ally, bringing reinforcements into the field of attainment of the statute’s objectives.” Through an examination of the state’s legislation on the subject, we must seek to determine, if possible, whether the legislature has manifested an intention to preempt the field of regulation of the anthracite strip mining industry.</p>

Relying on its supposition, that, the 1941 and 1959 statutes, supra, which deal with the safety of the workers in the industry might be considered to have been repealed, impliedly, by the 1963 statute; the Borough contends that the legislature wanted to remove any doubt that might arise as to the continued vitality of the 1941 and 1959 statutes and for that reason inserted into §10 of the 1963 statute the language in the second clause of the sentence. Such is the background of the Borough’s argument based on the word “and” connecting the two clauses. With that background in mind, the Borough then argues that the second clause modifies the first clause of the sentence and that such modification requires the conclusion that exclusive jurisdiction to the department and the secretary extended only in respect to the formulation and enforcement of rules aimed aLt the protection of the health and safety of workers in the industry which is the subject of the second clause.

Viewed in such light, it would be absurd to <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>attribute to the legislature’s employment of the phrase “exclusive jurisdiction” an intention to confine such exclusive jurisdiction to a field not covered by the provisions of the statute. We cannot interpret the grant of “exclusive jurisdiction” in so limited and restricted manner; to do so would render absurd, the legislative intention.</p>
    <p id="b309-4" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[157,710,1156,1670]]]'>. The Borough next contends that the phrase “exclusive jurisdiction” must be confined to the <em>administration </em>of the provisions of the statute and, since the Borough does not by its ordinance intend to <em>administer </em>the provisions of the state statute, the field in which the Borough intends to act has not been preempted; In this connection another provision of the 1963 statute must be noted. Section 10 provides, inter alia, for the creation within the Department of Mines and Mineral Industries of the Commonwealth of a new Bureau to be known as the “Bureau of Anthracite Conservation and Reclamation”. To this Bureau, §10 <em>expressly </em>commits the “power” and “duty” to <em>“administer </em>all of the laws of this Commonwealth governing and relating to the mining of anthracite coal by the open pit or strip method and, subject to the approval of the secretary, to exercise all the powers and perform all the duties by law vested in and imposed upon said secretary in relation to such open pit or strip mining”. (Emphasis supplied). Act of 1963, supra, §10, 52 P.S. §681.20b. Having spelled out <em>by whom </em>the provisions of the 1963 statute, as well as all other statutes dealing with anthracite strip mining, are to be <em>administered </em>the legislature would indeed be guilty of redundancy if it intended that the grant of exclusive jurisdiction contained in another sentence of the same section be restricted merely to the <em>administration </em>of the provisions of the statute. When the legislature wanted to make clear <em>by whom </em>the statute was to be <em>administered </em>it did so and no further grant of power to administer the statute was necessary.</p>

The words “exclusive jurisdiction” must, be given their ordinary, plain and everyday meaning; there exists no reason to assign any other-meaning. Giving these words their plain meaning it. is clear beyond question that the legislature, by the employment of such words, intended that the Commonwealth, and only the Commonwealth, shall regulate the anthracite strip mining industry. These words, clear and plain in meaning, preclude legislative action in the same field by any political subdivision such as the Borough. The Commonwealth in. §10. of the statute has expressly preempted the field to the exclusion of the Borough and, in so ruling, the court below was correct.</p>

L. 958, §1, 52 P.S. §1472. The 1959 statute amended the 1941 statute in two respects: (a) it made the 1941 Statute’s provisions applicable to <em>every </em>strip mine operation in the Commonwealth; (b) it increased the penalties for violation qf the statute. The 1941 statute was <em>specifically </em>saved from repeal when the legislature in 1947 took the first step toward regulation of the industry with the passage of the “Anthracite Strip Mining Law”, supra (52 P.S. §681.22) and no later legislation has, either expressly or impliedly, repealed the 1941 statute, as amended. In this connection, it might be noted that the Borough, in interpreting §10 of the “Anthracite Strip Mining and Conservation Act of 1963”, supra, argues that, when the 1-941 statute was amended by the 1959 statute, the 1941 statute became a <em>new </em>statute and, therefore, the legislature in 1963, to eliminate the possibility that the 1941 and 1959 statutes might be considered as repealed by the 1963 statute, inserted §10 in the 1963 statute. Such argument is utterly without mérit. Both the 1941' and 1959 statutes, which provide for the health and'the safety of workers in the strip mine industry, remain in full force and effect and would have so remained in effect without the language of §10 of the 1963 statute.</p>
