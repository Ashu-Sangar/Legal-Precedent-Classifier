Anton-<a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>son, filed wrongful death and survival actions in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County. The action was tried before a judge and jury and, at the conclusion of the presentation of appellant’s evidence,. the trial court granted appellees’ motion for compulsory nonsuit. A motion to take off the nonsuit was filed and denied by the court en banc; this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[169,725,1151,1182]]]'>Briefly stated, the facts, as developed from the testimony, are that at or near the intersection of Sixth and Madison Streets in the City of Chester, on February 16, 1964, at about 9:00 P.M., ’ the decedent was crossing Sixth Street. Sixth Street runs east and west, and is intersected by Madison Street, which runs north and south. Both streets are wide enough to accommodate traffic in both- directions and parking on each side. Appellee’s cab had been proceeding north on Madison Street and, as he made a “short” left turn into Sixth Street, he struck the decedent. The impact occurred approximately one car length west of the intersection. The cab was damaged in the center of the hood. Immediately after the accident, decedent was found unconscious with part of his head on the' center line of the street and the remaining part of his body in the intersection, in the right lane of traffic. Appellee’s cab was within the center line of the street, and the body about <em>2y% </em>feet in front of the cab. The cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage following a fractured skull. The road surface was dry and there was a street light at the intersection.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[169,1919,1149,423]]]'>As we have often said, and recently reiterated in <em>Cushey v.

      <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>In a careful review of the evidence, viewing it in the light most favorable to appellant, we have not found sufficient evidence to create a jury question as to appellee’s negligence. As we said in <em>Fegely v. Costello, </em><a href="/pa/417/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="417 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="1893999" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0448-01">417 Pa. 448</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20243" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="208 A.2d 243">208 A. 2d 243</a> (1965): “It is well established that the mere happening of an accident, even when a moving vehicle strikes a pedestrian lying on the road, does not establish negligence by either presumption or inference. Flagiello v. Crilly, <a href="/pa/409/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="409 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1883308" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0389-01">409 Pa. 389</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.2d%20289" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="187 A.2d 289">187 A. 2d 289</a> (1963). Furthermore, there is no inference of negligence even though the decedent is presumed to have exercised due care, which presumption would absolve the decedent, at this stage in the proceedings, from contributory negligence.”</p>

The taxicab was making a left turn at this intersection; the 'sweep' of .the headlights would not have picked up the decedent until the taxi straightened out on Sixth Street.; the testimony indicates that the impact took place, as. the-taxi completed its turn. We can come to no other logical conclusion but that the driver could not have been expected to see the decedent in his headlights, as decedent came across the street from the driver’s left.”</p>
