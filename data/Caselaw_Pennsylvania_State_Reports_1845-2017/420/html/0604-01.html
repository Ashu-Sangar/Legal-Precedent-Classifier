Appellant’s business consists solely of operating a hotel and resort facility situate at Kiamesha Lake, New York. Lillian Stern-man, living at 6243 N. 12th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has been serving the appellant in the form of, as she puts it, a “missionary method” with various travel agencies, attempting to create good will and familiarize them with the facilities available, to encourage them to recommend appellant’s hotel to their clients, and in accepting reservations, herself, for appellant’s hotel. Mrs. Sternman has always operated out of her home, which is owned jointly with her husband. The appellant owns no part of the property, has no furniture there, pays no rent, nor does it have its name listed or shown on any part of the property. Approximately 5 years ago, Mrs. Sternman arranged with the Bell Telephone Company to list appellant’s name in both the yellow, or classified pages, and the white pages, of the Philadelphia Telephone Directory, above <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>her home address. She alone pays for this service. Appellant does supply Mrs. Sternman with various supplies in the form of envelopes, request forms for reservations on which its New York address is printed and on which Mrs. Sternman has a printer add her name and home address, and various types of advertising literature which Mrs. Sternman distributes to various travel agencies and prospective guests.</p>

Appellant then confirms or rejects the reservation and, in some cases, notifies Mrs. Sternman with a duplicate copy of a letter, the original of which is sent to the persons requesting the reservation. She is paid solely on a commission basis and has a drawing account against her commissions. She considers herself self-employed and pays her own Federal Social Security taxes. The appellant does not withhold any part of her commission earned for Federal income tax purposes. She holds a mercantile license from the City of Philadelphia which is issued in her own name. Lillian Sternman owns none of appellant’s stock, nor is she an officer or director of the corporation.

It is clear that the Pennsylvania legislature did not choose to exercise the full extent of jurisdiction conferred upon it and did not make foreign corporations suable as extensively as it could constitutionally have done. Through the medium of §1011B, the legislature has validated service upon a non-registered foreign corporation by service upon the Secretary of the Commonwealth only in a restricted area, i.e., where the action arose out of acts or omissions of the corporation within the Commonwealth <em>and </em>where a corporation has ‘done business’ in Pennsylvania within the meaning of §1011C.” (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>

It was re-enacted in 1959 and reads as follows: “C. For the purposes of this section, the entry of any corporation into this Commonwealth for the doing of a series of similar acts for the purpose of thereby realizing pecuniary benefit or otherwise accomplishing an object, or doing a single act in this Commonwealth for such purpose, with the intention of thereby initiating a series of such acts, shall constitute ‘doing business’.” 15 P.S. §2851-1011, sub. C (supp. 1962). By its very definition, subsection C is limited by “For the purpose of this section . . .” to §2852-1011 of the Business Corporation Law. Subsection A is concerned only with registered foreign corporations; Subsection B is concerned only with foreign corporations which are not registered with the Secretary of the Commonwealth, where the cause of action arises out of acts or omissions of the corporation within the Common<a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>wealth. It is undisputed that appellant is not registered to do business in the Commonwealth and that the acts or omissions of appellant, which gave rise to these actions, took place outside the Commonwealth. Therefore, by its very definition, subsection C is not applicable in the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b646-4" data-blocks='[["BL_646.4",646,[179,663,1149,796]]]'>It must be noted, however, that subsection C. was again amended by the Act of August 13, 1963, P. L. 703, 15 P.S. §2852-10110 (Supp. 1965). This amendment deleted the words “For the purposes of this section” and substituted, instead, the words “For the purposes of determining jurisdictions of courts within this Commonwealth”. This amendment became effective on August 13, 1963, prior to the filing of the complaint in the Doline ease. Assuming, arguendo, but not deciding that the Legislature by this amendment intended to divorce subsection C from the rest of §2852-1011, and create a test for doing business irrespective of the situs of the acts or omissions giving rise to the cause of action, we conclude that appellant is not “doing business” in this Commonwealth within that definition.</p>

It operates no regularly scheduled flights into or out of Pennsylvania, but has flown various chartered flights out of Philadelphia and, on at least one occasion, an Alitalia jet has landed in Philadelphia when weather made landing in New York impossible. Alitalia does, however, have two offices in Pennsylvania, employing eleven persons supervised by a district sales manager. Property in the form of furniture and office supplies is owned in Pennsylvania, and deposits of monies received by various travel agencies are remitted to the Philadelphia office which deposits monies received in a Philadelphia bank.

It also points out that the travel agents representing defendant are in no sense ‘legal’ agents. But even if the Court were to agree with these contentions, Alitalia is not able to escape the consequences of the fact that it has employees in Pennsylvania who are selling tickets and thus, binding the company. The requirement that the employee confirm the availability of space with the New York reservation department before making a ticket sale does not render the employee’s actions less binding. In reality, this is not the case of a representative who solicits an offer which is transmitted to an out-of-state principal for acceptance or rejection. Rather, the more correct analogy is to the salesmen who must check the stockroom supply before making a sale.</blockquote>

Lutz held this rule to require that the agent must have the power to bind the corporation, which power these employees do have. The facts of the Shambe case satisfied all of these requirements except number 5. The Court believes that in this case one million dollars worth of passenger and freight sales passing through the Philadelphia office is more than sufficient quantity and quality. Shambe v.

DiGirolamo was a manufacturer’s representative for Belgrade Shoes. He resided in Pittsburgh and advertised in the classified pages of the Pittsburgh Telephone Directory as “Belgrade Shoe Co., Moxees Division, Representative — Henry T. DiGirolamo”. Belgrade exercised no- control over the methods employed by DiGirolamo in contacting the various customers, and the only items Belgrade supplied were various samples of shoes. DiGirolamo was paid on a draw against commission and was responsible for his own Federal Social Security taxes and other various withholding obligations. DiGirolamo had no authority to bind the corporation to any, contract nor was, he reimbursed for any expenses except those incurred while attending, at the invitation of the corporation, an annual convention in New York. Belgrade stated that it did not own or rent any office space in Pennsylvania and that either party could discontinue its association at any time. It should be noted that DiGirolamo was a member of a company group insurance plan on which the company paid the premium. In that case, we held: “. . . that the relationship of DiGirolamo to Belgrade was that of an independent contractor, not that of servant or employee. The cases of Johnson v.
