Plaintiff was injured when he was struck by an automobile operated by defendant. This accident occurred on August 29, 1960, in the vicinity of the 222 Drive-in Sandwich Shop, East Cocalico Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. At this point, Route 222 is a concrete highway 22 feet wide. It has two lanes, one northbound and one southbound. Immediately prior to the accident, plaintiff, intending to go to the sandwich shop for something to drink, was walking from the western side of the highway to the eastern side. He could see a distance of 332 feet<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> looking in the direction from which defendant’s car was approaching. Plaintiff testified as follows: “A. Well, I waited a while off the street and the pickup truck went. Then I looked both ways and didn’t see any cars coming, so I crossed. I got halfway across and I looked again; I didn’t see ho cars coming, so I crossed. Q. When you got approximately halfway across, Mr. Firestone, in which direction did you then again look? A. I looked south. Q. That would be to your right? A. Yes. Q. And you <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>were then proceeding from the western side of the highway to the eastern side; is that right? A. Yes. Q. Where were you going? A. I was going into the 222 Drive-In for something to drink. Q. Tell us what happened after you had looked to the right and saw nothing? A. Then I crossed and got on the other side of the highway, and I don’t know no more about what happened.”</p>
