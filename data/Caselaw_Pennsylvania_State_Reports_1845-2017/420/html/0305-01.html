We <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>determined, however, that the imminence of the 1964 general election required the utilization of the apportionment plans contained in those acts, notwithstanding their invalidity, in order to prevent serious disruption of election processes and essential governmental functions. Moreover, we considered it appropriate that the Legislature, the organ of government with the primary responsibility for the task of reapportionment,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">6</a> be afforded an additional opportunity to enact a constitutional reapportionment plan.</p>
    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.4",344,[194,910,1147,410]]]'>Accordingly, while retaining jurisdiction, we deferred further judicial action in order to afford an opportunity .for appropriate and timely legislation on the part of the General Assembly.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">7</a> To assist in that task, we set forth guidelines for constitutional reapportionment as mandated by the Federal Constitution and decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">8</a>

And while we acknowledged the practical difficulties to be confronted, we expressed the hope that further judicial intervention would be rendered unnecessary by prompt constitutional legislation. At the same time, we sought to make clear that our reluctance to intrude into an area of primarily legislative re<a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>sponsibility would not deter this Court from proceeding with the task of reapportionment in the event that the Legislature failed to do so. We concluded, therefore, that should the Legislature fail to enact a constitutionally valid reapportionment “not later than September 1, 1965,” this Court would take appropriate steps to ensure that the individual voters of this Commonwealth are afforded their constitutional right to cast an equally weighted vote.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">9</a>

Accordingly, pursuant to our retained jurisdiction, this Court issued an order on September 29, 1965 notifying the parties of our intention to proceed with the task of fashioning such affirmative relief as would be necessary to ensure a constitutionally valid legislative apportionment for the forthcoming primary and general elections.</p>

    <p id="b419-6" data-blocks='[["BL_419.7",419,[150,559,1148,259]]]'>I cannot in good conscience even condone the redistricting plan of the Senate of the Commonwealth as decreed by a Majority of my brethren on the Court. As to this part of the decision, I must, therefore, emphatically dissent.</p>
    <p id="b419-7" data-blocks='[["BL_419.8",419,[149,831,1151,530]]]'>While some fixed constitutional standards were generally followed in the planning and composition of all of the senatorial districts, it is, and will be, readily apparent to knowledgeable people that in the planning and composition of districts in a substantial number of areas, considerations other than judicious and legal were regretfully permitted to interfere. As a result, the total senate plan is basically unfair, and will result in control of that body remaining in the hands of one certain political party for all future time.</p>
    <p id="b419-8" data-blocks='[["BL_419.9",419,[153,1374,1151,527]]]'>The House of Representatives and the Senate of Pennsylvania have previously always legislated their own districts. That the task has been “well” done is clearly indicated by the results. With the exception of one two-year period (immediately following the Roosevelt “landslide” election of 1936), the same political party has continuously enjoyed majority control of the Senate of Pennsylvania during the present century.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_5_1" id="ref_footnote_5_1">1</a> Unfortunately, today’s decree of this Court follows the same unfair pattern.</p>

Carr, </em><a href="/us/369/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="369 U.S. 186" data-case-ids="6166554" data-case-paths="/us/369/0186-01">369 U.S. 186</a> (1962).</p>
    <p id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[177,552,1156,909]]]'>I fear also the constitutional validity of the Majority’s senate redistrieting plan. for. other reasons. The 1960 census population of Pennsylvania was 11,319,-366. The Constitution of Pennsylvania provides for fifty senatorial districts. The perfect representative ratio would, therefore, constitute. 226,387. While I recognize that it is impossible for very practical reasons to achieve the perfect norm, I believe that it was. incumbent upon us to do so as far as it was reasonably possible. As we stated in <em>Butcher v. Bloom, </em><a href="/pa/415/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="415 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1891850" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0438-01">415 Pa. 438</a>, 465, <a href="/citations/?q=203%20A.2d%20556" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="203 A.2d 556">203 A. 2d 556</a> (1964), “Those whose task it is to. reapportion the Pennsylvania Legislature must approach their assignment with the understanding that they-are to create districts which are as <em>nearly equal, in population as is practicable.’’ </em>(Emphasis added.) To the same effect see, <em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em><a href="/us/377/0665-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="377 U.S. 533" data-case-ids="6171208" data-case-paths="/us/377/0665-01">377 U.S. 533</a>, <a href="/us/377/0665-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="377 U.S. 533" data-case-ids="6171208" data-case-paths="/us/377/0665-01">84 S.

    <p id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[177,1471,1155,410]]]'>Despite this constitutional requirement, I note that in. the senatorial plan decreed by the Majority, there exists wide divergence of total population in several districts. For example, District No. 34 includes a total population, of only 205,319, while District No. 26 includes 248,695. This means that the senator in District No. 26 will represent 43,376-or 21% more people than the senator in District No. 34.</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.6",420,[177,1902,1154,465]]]'>.While it may be-argued that the low composite population in District No. 34 and in similar situations was-necessarily achieved in order not to break-county lines, this position does, not hold water, particularly in reference to District. No. 26, which .is located in an area where county lines were crossed in order to reach the population figure. The-imbalance noted hardly effectuates or conforms with the equal protection provision' of the United States Constitution.</p>
