This agreement was evidenced in March 1959 when Henry Slavinski, appellee’s father, surrendered the pass book to appellee immediately before entering the hospital for the express purpose of having appellee pay the expected hospital bills. Appellee never relinquished control of the pass book after-that, even though his father recovered from that illness and lived until December 29, 1960, and even though his father and, later, his father’s executor demanded its return.</p>
