She alleged that the hearing and the affirmance of decision were in violation of the union’s constitution and by-laws, and a deprivation of her rights as an elected officer and member of the union. She averred further that as a result of being improperly removed from office and from membership in the union, she was deprived and will continue to be deprived of her salary and expense account as business agent; that her reputation- and good name as a union official has been damaged with injury to her future opportunities to procure like positions; she has suffered humiliation and embarrassment in her relation with members of the union and the community in general; has been deprived of union pension benefits, has <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>béen deprived of lier right to Avork in other positions in the industry, subject to agreement betAveen the union and its employers’ association, and that these deprivations have caused and will cause her to lose large sums of money as Avell as $21,000 Avhich she claims, inter alia, as loss of earnings to date.</p>

She asserts that, as a direct result of her expulsion as business agent and as member of the ILGfWTT, she “has been deprived of her right to work in those places of employment in the industry, subject to the agreements between the I.L.G.W.U. and its employers’ association, and such deprivation of her right to work in said industry is of the value of $25,000.” It is thus obvious that the heart of her complaint is the injury done to her employment relationship. The case accordingly falls within the scope of our decision in <em>Wax v. Int. Mailers </em>Union, <a href="/pa/400/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="400 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1292505" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0173-01">400 Pa. 173</a>, at 181, where we stated: “In the matter noAV before us, the appellee seeks reinstatement only because, as he alleges, the direct result of the expulsion has been to prevent him from continuing work as a mailer. He makes no claim for damages based on injury to his <em>rights as a member </em>of the appellant unions, AVhich in a proper case, as we stated in Falsetti, our courts will protect. Therefore, the crux of the appellee’s case is not injury to the union-member relationship, as it was in Gonzales, but rather injury to appellee’s <em>employment </em>relationship by reason of the appellant’s arbitrary and unreasonable action in expelling him. Since appellee has not pro-<a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>Tided any explanation of how or why the expulsion from appellant unions has prevented him from obtaining work as a mailer, we can only infer that in pursuance of agreements or arrangements between employers and the appellants, only members of the appellant unions could obtain work from the employers, and further, that as a consequence thereof, that appellants from August, 1956, on, caused the employers to refuse employment to the appellee because he had lost his membership in appellant unions. The theory of appellee’s cause of action, therefore, if substantiated by the evidence, makes it at least arguable, if not more, that the type of union activity involved was in violation of Section 8 (b) (2) of the Taft-Hartley Act and thus subject to the N.L.R.B.’s exclusive jurisdiction.” (Emphasis that of the court.)</p>

      <p id="b470-6" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[197,1265,1148,304]]]'>In <em>Perko, </em>the allegation of the union member, was that the union had conspired with the company to discharge him from his duties. Thus, the Court was confronted with a situation which was not peripheral to the employment relationship, but rather one which fell “within the ambit .of'the.unfair labor practices prohibited by §§8(b)(1) (A) and 8(b) (2) of the Act.” <em>Ornamental Iron Workers Union v.

      <p id="b470-7" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[194,1579,1149,399]]]'>In <em>Borden, </em>the Court was presented, with a unique situation in that the union member’s complaint “focused principally, if not entirely, on, the union’s actions with respect to Borden’s efforts to obtain employment.” <em>United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices v.

Because of the factual involvement of the. union in the employment relationship through its operation of a hiring hall, the Court distinguished that case from <em>Gonzales, </em>stating that <em>Borden </em>“does not come within the <em>Gonzales </em>rationale.” Ibid.</p>
      <p id="b470-8" data-blocks='[["BL_470.6",470,[193,1988,1149,312]]]'>It is equally significant to note that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Borden </em>described the' <em>Gonzales </em>rationale in these words: “the Gonzales decision, it is evident,‘ turned on the Court’s conclusion, that.the lawsuit was focused on purely internal union matters, i.e., on relations between the individual plaintiff and the union not having to do directly with matters of employment . . .” Ibid.</p>
