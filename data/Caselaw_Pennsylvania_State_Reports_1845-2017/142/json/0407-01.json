L. 48, having like jurisdiction with justices of the peace, subject to a like right of appeal and certiorari, a civil action before a recorder is within the provisions of \u00a7 22, act of March 20, 1810, 5 Sm. L. 171, and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in certiorari thereon is final.\nBefore Paxson, O. J., Green, Clark, Williams, Mc-Collum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 332 January Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 163 February Term 1889, C. P.\nOn January 22,1889, a certiorari issued from the court below to Mr. Selden Marvin, city recorder of the city of Erie, directing the return of the record in an action by A. J.

Foster had brought suit before the city recorder against the county of Erie, to recover the sum of $4, for two days\u2019 service on November 27, 28, 1888, as a member of a coroner\u2019s jury; and that on January 5,1889, the recorder had entered judgment for plaintiff for $4 and costs.\nExceptions filed by the defendant having been argued, the court, Gunnison, P.
