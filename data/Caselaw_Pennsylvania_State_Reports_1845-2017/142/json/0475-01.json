L. 194; that on February 20,1891, he filed his bond for such license, a certified copy of his said petition and bond being attached; that said petition was duly advertised according to law, and no remonstrance or objection was filed or made in said court to the granting of said license.\nThe petitioner further represented that be was the lessee of a certain distillery situate near the borough of Chambersburg, known as distillery No. 37 of the 9th district of Pennsylvania; that he began to manufacture whiskey in said distillery on January 13, 1891, and made return of his said distillery to the mercantile appraiser of said county, to have the same regularly rated according to law, and that he had been engaged in the manufacture of whiskey at said distillery ever since said date; that his said petition came on to be heard before the Honorable John Stewart, president judge of the said court, pursuant to a rule of the said court, on February 28,1891, at which time the said petition was heard by the said court and was held under advisement until March 9,1891, when the said court refused to grant the petitioner a license as prayed for.
