LAMBIE ET AL.\nAPPEAL BY DEFENDANTS FROM THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF FAYETTE COUNTY.\nArgued May 11, 1891\nDecided May 25, 1891.\nWhen, on a sale of lands by the sheriff, the judgment defendant is suffered to remain in possession and to grow crops on the land as theretofore, neither the purchaser, nor the vendee of his title, may enter and remove any portion of the crops so grown, as the owner thereof.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Stekrett, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 353 January Term 1890, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 66 December Term 1881, C. P.\nOn September 30, 1881, Samuel Potter and Sophia, his wife, in right of said wife, brought trespass against James T. Lambie,. Jonathan Birch, George W. Stewart, Leander Stewart, and Simon Stewart. Issue.\nAt the trial, on February 18, 1890, it was shown that in March, 1880, a tract of land was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale as the property of Sophia Potter, the beneficial plaintiff herein, to Pickersgill and Childs of Pittsburgh; that in June, 1881, the sheriff\u2019s grantees conveyed the land to Simon Stewart, one of the defendants herein; that the plaintiffs in this case, remaining in possession of the land after said sheriff\u2019s sale, in the spring of 1881 put in a crop of corn thereon; and that in September of that year, after a part of the crop had been \u201c cut up,\u201d Simon Stewart and the other defendants, his employees, entered the field and carried away one half of the corn in the shock, as a landlord\u2019s share of the crop.\nAt the close of the testimony, the court, Inghram, P. J., charged the jury in part as follows :\n[If you should find that the defendants were in possession* and that the plaintiffs raised the crop there, why then the crop would be subject to just such an arrangement as a tenant would make with a landlord; and, the owners of the title being in possession, and that possession being in a tenant, why they would have a right to the landlord\u2019s share. But, if the plaintiffs were in possession, then they would have a right to recover a verdict for the value of the corn at the time it was taken, with its interest down to the present time.] 8\nThe plaintiffs have submitted the following point [inter alia] :\n1. That, if the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiffs were in the actual possession of the property at and before the taking of the corn, the verdict must be for the plaintiffs.\nAnswer: Affirmed.1\nTbe court is requested by the defendants to charge:\n1. That a defendant under a sheriff\u2019s sale becomes quasi tenant at will to the purchaser, and will not be suffered to set up an adverse title.\nAnswer: Affirmed.\n2. That said Potter\u2019s title was extinguished by the sheriff\u2019s sale to Pickersgill and Childs, from whom Stewart purchased.\nAnswer: Affirmed.\n3. That a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale acquires the right to the possession of the debtor.\nAnswer: Affirmed.\n4. That after the sheriff\u2019s sale of Potter\u2019s land, in 1830, Potter had no right of possession, and therefore no right of property.\nAnswer: Refused.8\n\u2014The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for $112.04. Judgment having been entered, the defendants took this appeal, assigning for error inter alia:\n1. The answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 point.1\n2. The answer to the defendants\u2019 point.8\n8.
