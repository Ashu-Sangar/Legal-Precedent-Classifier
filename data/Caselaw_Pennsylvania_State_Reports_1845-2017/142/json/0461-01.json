J., Sterrett, Green, Clark and Williams, JJ.\nNo. 44 January Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 38 September Term 1888, C. P. in Equity.\nOn August 4,1888, Lewis B. Silliman filed a bill in equity against John R. Kuhn, for the settlement of the affairs of a partnership of the plaintiff and defendant, trading under the name of J. R. Kuhn & Co. in the business of producing oil and torpedoing oil wells. Issue having been joined, the cause was referred to Mr. James O. Parmlee, as examiner and master, who, on June 14, 1890, after the usual preliminary decree for an accounting, filed a report with his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a statement of account between the parties showing a balance due to the plaintiff from the defendant of $1,507.30.\nExceptions to the report filed by the plaintiff and defendant, relating cliiefiy to the master\u2019s findings of fact, having been argued, the court, Brown, P. J., 911 September 11,1890, entered a final decree ordering: (1) That the defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of $1,280.33; (2) that the defendant assign and convey to the plaintiff the one-third interest in a certain oil-leasehold estate; and (3) that the defendant account to the plaintiff for such oil production from said leasehold as he had received since the accounting in this proceeding. Thereupon, the defendant took this appeal, filing assignments specifying that the court erred in dismissing the defendant\u2019s exceptions, and in the several parts of said decree.\nMr. William JE. Rice (with him Mr. W. D. Hinckley), for the appellant.\nCounsel cited: Cross\u2019s App., 97 Pa. 471.\nMr. Samuel Grrumbine (with him Mr. Roger Sherman), for the appellee.\nCounsel cited: Rule of the Supreme Court XXV., as amended June 7, 1889, 125 Pa. xxii.; Weible\u2019s App., 127 Pa. 84, 43; Waring v.
