    "head_matter": "PHILADELPHIA v. ISAAC HIESTER. Philadelphia v. Mrs. Baker.\nAPPEALS BY PLAINTIFF FROM THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS NO. 1 OF PHILADELPHIA COUNTY.\nArgued April 8, 1891\nDecided April 27, 1891.\nIn Philadelphia, registered taxes cease to be a lien, unless a scire facias is issued upon the claim filed therefor within five years from the first day of January next after they become due: Section 1, act of March 11, 1846, P. L. 114: unrepealed by \u00a7 2, act of April 21, 1858, P. L. 885.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Gbeen, Clabk, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nNos. 276, 310 January Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, Nos. 24 September Term 1880, 150 December Term 1877, 0-P. No. 1, M. L. D.\nOn October 21, 1880, the city of Philadelphia filed a municipal claim for $335.16 for registered taxes for 1877 and 1878, against Isaac Hiester, owner, etc., and registered owner of certain property described, the said amount including interest, commissions and costs. On April 6, 1882, a suggestion was filed that the tax for the year 1877 had been paid.\nOn August 14, 1885, on affidavit of service of notice filed, a writ of scire facias issued. On October 12,1889, issue.\nAt the trial on June 21, 1890, the claim being read in evidence, by agreement of counsel and under the direction of the court the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $241.31 (being the amount of the claim less certain payments admitted), subject to the opinion of the court on the question of law reserved, to wit: \u201c Whether the scire facias issued by plaintiff on August 14, 1885, was issued in time to entitle plaintiff to recover.\u201d\nAfter argument of the reserved question, the court, Beddle, J., on June 19, 1890, filed the following opinion:\n. The point reserved on the trial of this cause was whether the registered taxes for the years 1877 and 1878 ceased to be a lien on real estate after the expiration of five years from the first days of January 1878 and 1879, respectively. On August 14, 1885, a scire facias had issued upon them, and previous to that date a claim had been filed in the prothonotary\u2019s office on October 21, 1880.\nThe act of February 3, T824, [P. L. 18, (8 Sm. L. 189,)] made, for the first time, taxes a lien, until paid, on real estate in the city and county of Philadelphia upon which they were assessed.\nThe act of April 16, 1840, P. L. 410, to which we have been referred, applies not to the city, but only to some of the districts of the county of Philadelphia. The act of April 16, 1845, P. L. 488, declared that no tax should continue a lien longer than until the first day of July, in the year immediately succeeding that in which such tax is due and payable, unless the same shall have been registered. And if registered in compliance with the provisions of the act, \u201c the lien shall continue for five \"years from the first day of January, in the year next succeeding that in which such tax was due, and no longer, unless a claim for the same shall be filed in the office of the prothonotary of the proper court, within the said term of five years, and if so filed, the lien shall continue for the same period, and may be revived in the same manner as is provided by law, in the case of mechanics\u2019 claims.\u201d\nIn the next year, March 11, 1846, P. L. 114, it was enacted, \u201c And all taxes registered as aforesaid, in said county commissioners\u2019 office, shall cease to be liens, after the expiration of five years from the first day of January, in the year succeeding that in which they became due, unless suit be brought to recover the same, as it now is or may be provided by law for the recovery of the same, and duly proceeded in to judgment.\u201d\nIt is, however, contended that the act of April 21, 1858, P. L. 886, repeals the act of 1846. It enacts, \u201c That the receiver of taxes of said city shall be charged 'by the city controller with the amount of the duplicates of each ward placed in his hands by the city commissioners for state and city taxes; and that in the month of January, annually, the said receiver shall, in books to be called \u2018 The Register of Unpaid Taxes on Real Estate,\u2019 register all unpaid taxes (except occupation taxes) of the preceding year; and the said taxes are hereby declared to be a lien on all real estate, in accordance with the provisions of the act of February 3, 1824, entitled \u2018An Act relating to taxes on certain real estate in the city and county of Philadelphia.\u2019 \u201d\nThere is clearly, here, no express repeal of the act of 1846, and if it so operates it is by necessary implication; that is, there is a repugnancy between the new and the old law so positive as to be irreconcilable: Barber\u2019s Case, 86 Pa. 392; Seifried v. Commonwealth, 101 Pa. 202. A previous act of February 2, 1854, had made taxes a lien simply by their assessment, without being registered, and the object of this act of 1858 appears to have been to restore the system of registration, which had been created by the act of 1846, in a new form, and at the same time to re-assert that they are still to be a lien on real estate, in accordance with the act of 1824. Nothing whatever is said as to the mode of enforcing this claim, and we find nothing to justify us in saying that its provisions are so \u201c irreconcilable \u201d as to repeal the eminently just provisions of the act of 1846. That act gives ample security to the city, and affords its citizens some protection against perpetual liens on their real estate. This point we have already orally decided in Philadelphia v. Ryers, 27 W. N. 71.\nIt is further contended on behalf of the city that, if the act of 1846 is still operative, a claim having been filed in this case, is \u201c suit brought \u201d as required by that act. To this point no authority is cited. The act of 1836 provides that every person entitled to a lien \u201c shall file a claim or statement of his demand,\u201d or, as would be said in the case of individuals, must send in his bill. And it would seem as unjust in the one case as in the other to say that the debtor has been sued. As was said by Judge Mekctjb in O\u2019Byrne v. Philadelphia, 93 Pa. 227, \u201c Every essential requirement of this act (1846) should be observed. The necessity is the same, whether the object be to sell for the non-payment of taxes, or for a municipal claim.\u201d\nAnd the legislature themselves seem very clearly to have distinguished between \u201c a claim \u201d and \u201c a suit; \u201d for whereas, in the act of 1845 they provided that \u201c if so registered, the lien shall continue for five years from the first day of January, in the next year succeeding that in which such tax was due, and no longer, unless a claim for the same shall be filed in the office of the prothonotary of the proper court, within the said term of five years,\u201d they, in the act of 1846, say that the lien shall expire at the end of five years, \u201c unless suit be brought to recover the same, as it now is or may be provided by law for the recovery of the same, and duly proceeded in to judgment;\u201d so that, while \u201c a claim filed \u201d was sufficient under the act of 1845 to continue a lien, nothing less than \u201c a suit duly proceeded in to judgment\u201d would do so under the act of 1846.\nProbably there are no two terms in more frequent use and better understood than these. For over half a century very few of our citizens have not had brought home to them, in a practical way, either by the city or by mechanics or material men, the ingenious devices by which their property can be encumbered. The privilege of being sued, before the time of lien can be doubled, is a distinct gain, and was, we think, intended as an act of beneficence by the legislature. By the act of May 4, 1889, P. L. 79, the lien of these taxes is limited to two years, unless entered of record, and limited to five, if recorded, unless revived and continued by \u201c writ of scire facias within said period and duly prosecuted to judgment,\u201d showing that at the very last session of the legislature it was their clear intention then, as before, to put an end to perpetual liens. This they did by this law applicable to the whole state.\nJudgment is therefore entered for the defendant on the point reserved, non obstante veredicto.\n\u2014The plaintiff thereupon took the appeal to No. 276, specifying that the court erred in entering judgment for the defendant on the point reserved, non obstante veredicto, and in not entering judgment for the plaintiff on the point reserved.\nOn December 26,1877, the city of Philadelphia filed a municipal claim for $58.70, for city taxes, interest, etc., for the years 1872, 1873, and 1874, against Mrs. Baker, owner, etc., and Abanus Bennett, registered owner of certain property described. On November 22,1882, a scire facias was issued on said claim, and on October 17,1887, a judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff for $92.70, for want of an affidavit of defence.\nOn January 14, 1891, a rule was granted to show cause why the judgment entered should not be stricken off and the writ of scire facias quashed; and on January 17, 1891, said rule was made absolute, without opinion filed. Thereupon, the plaintiff took the appeal to No. 310, assigning the order making said rule absolute, for error.\nMr. A. M. Beitler (with him Mr. Isaac H. Shields and Mr. Chas. F. Warwick), for the appellant.\nCounsel cited: Section 1, act of February 3, 1824, P. L. 18 (8 Sm. L. 189) ; \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10, act of April 16, 1840, P. L. 410; act of April 5, 1844, P.
