    <p id="b584-9" data-blocks='[["BL_584.7",584,[265,1446,1177,400]]]'>[It is your duty to find damages against the defendants, unless they satisfied you that they diverted the water with plaintiff’s consent or permission; or that they have by the evidence satisfied you that they had a right to do so by having used the water in the same way for a period of twenty-one years before the suit was brought, and thereby acquired a superior right by adverse user inconsistent with the plaintiff’s right under the contract.</p>
    <p id="b584-10" data-blocks='[["BL_584.8",584,[264,1854,1177,550]],["BL_585.1",585,[142,399,1169,247]]]'>To establish such adverse user the defendants, and those under whom they hold, must satisfy you by a preponderance of evidence that they held, used and enjoyed the water and the right and privilege of its use by means of the dam through the diverting channel, in the same manner and to the same extent, openly, visibly, notoriously, continuously, hostilely and adversely, under claim of right, for a period of twenty-one years before suit brought. And if this is shown, a grant might be presumed, and the superior right would be in the defendants. The user must be a peaceable user. Such, under the evidence, it was up to the time when Horn had built his mill <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>and began to undo what the defendants had done, to get his supply of water. This you will find was shortly before 1884. But this need not trouble you, for from 1886 up to that time the defendants were in the uninterrupted use of the water, and that is much more than twenty-one years.</p>
    <p id="b585-5" data-blocks='[["BL_585.4",585,[144,655,1171,1104]]]'>The undisputed evidence, if believed, shows that the defendants, and those under whom they claim, had peaceable, undisputed, visible, open, notorious and continuous user of the water, in the same way, for more than twenty-one years. But, before a jury can presume a grant of a water-course, they must find that the user was adverse. Though there be no express evidence of a claim of right to so use it, yet from such use being continued, open, visible, uninterrupted and notorious, it might be presumed by the jury to be adverse, if it was not interrupted or opposed during the running of twenty-one years, or if the use was not inconsistent with the right which Cade and those holding under him had of using the water for a power to the extent of two wheels. If it was used inconsistently with the right which Cade, and those holding under him down to Horn, had as to the use of the water to the extent of two wheels as a superior or first right, by virtue of the contract of July 8, 1852, then it was adverse. If the use was consistent with the right of Cade or Horn, it was not adverse. To find whether it was by defendants’ use inconsistent with the rightful use of the plaintiff Horn and those under whom he claims, is a question of fact for the jury; and it is the fact in this case.</p>

It specifies on the face of it that a suit was then pending, in which Cade alleges a diversion of the water. The settlement of that suit gave Cade the superior right and defined how Miller could in the future use the water. The evidence which you heard fully described the character of the stone dam then across the main channel, and the character and size of the diverting channel or race, and especially its character and size and depth at the point where the stream divided. Now,, if the condition that the dam and head-race were then in gave Miller <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>no more water in dry times than by the agreement he was entitled to, and if the defendants, prior to the time when the defendants and Horn began to dispute, had not enlarged the dam nor increased the depth of the race or enlarged its volume, and if at the time Horn complains of, or any time from 1884 to the bringing of this suit, the jury find it still to have been in the same condition as to its power of diverting the water, then the user of the diverted water was not an adverse user inconsistent with the rights of Horn and those under whom he holds. On such use by them, no cause of action could arise in favor of Horn.</p>

    <p id="b587-13" data-blocks='[["BL_587.13",587,[140,1930,1170,507]],["BL_588.1",588,[283,401,1181,354]]]'>We are of opinion that the court below properly rejected the offer of evidence embraced in the first assignment. The offer was to prove by the witness on the stand, and others, the terms of the compromise of the suit between Enoch Cade and John Miller, the circumstances leading to that compromise, and that it was compromised on condition that Mr. Cade was to erect a mill forthwith. The compromise referred to was a settlement of the suit of Cade v. Miller. It was an agreement in writing, carefully prepared, submitted to and approved by the counsel in that case, acknowledged before a justice of the peace, and <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>recorded July 9, 1852. It needs no argument to show that it would have been grave error for the court below to have permitted witnesses, after the lapse of nearly forty years, to give their imperfect recollection of what led up to that settlement, and to add to its conditions. If such evidence were admissible, nothing in this world could be considered as settled, excepting that the law upon this point is unsettled.</p>
    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[330,763,1127,45]]]'>The third assignment does not conform to the rules of court.</p>
    <p id="b588-6" data-blocks='[["BL_588.5",588,[284,816,1178,1156]]]'>The remaining assignments allege error in the charge of the court, and in the answers to points. We need not discuss them in detail. The learned judge below fairly submitted to the jury the question whether the defendants’ admitted use of the water for more than twenty-one years was adverse. Such use was conceded to have been peaceable, undisputed, visible, open, notorious, and continuous. “ If,” as the jury were instructed, “it was used inconsistently with the right which Cade, and those holding under him down to Horn, had as to the use of the water to the extent of two wheels as a superior or first right, by virtue of the contract of July 8, 1852, then it was adverse. If the use was consistent with the right of Cade or Horn, it was not adverse. To find whether it was by defendants’ use inconsistent with the rightful use of the plaintiff, Horn, and those under whom he claims, is a question of fact for the jury; and it is the fact in this case.” The learned judge then proceeded further to instruct the jury that, in ascertaining how Miller was to use the water, they must be guided by the agreement of July 8, 1852. In this we see no error. That was a settlement of a suit then pending, in which Cade alleged a diversion of the water. That settlement gave Cade the superior right, and defined how Miller could use the water in the future.</p>
