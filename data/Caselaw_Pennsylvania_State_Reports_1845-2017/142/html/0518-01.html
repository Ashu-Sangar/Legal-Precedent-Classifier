On March 8,1859, the interest of John J. Owens, in said land, was sold at sheriff’s sale to Lewis Arnett, to whom a sheriff’s deed therefor was afterwards made. Arnett and wife by deed dated November 10, 1860, conveyed the same land to Eliza .Crocker, the wife of F. O. Crocker. By deed dated June 28, 1865, containing a covenant of general warranty, F. O. Crocker and Eliza, his wife, conveyed the 83 acres in dispute to A. O. Vanlennep, whose title, by a regular chain of conveyances, became vested in the plaintiff in 1885. John J. Owens was not among the cestuis que trust mentioned in the patent to C. H. Owens. There was some evidence that after the sheriff’s sale of the interest of John J. Owens to Arnett, and Arnett’s conveyance to Mrs. Crocker, to wit, about 1863, the occupancy of the land in dispute was separate from that of the remainder of the original tract, and that it was separately occupied in 1870, at the date of the patent, the inference from the testimony on this subject, being that F.

The land is .part of a large tract known as the Owens tract. To establish the title, the plaintiff gives in evidence a patent from the commonwealth, containing 197 acres- and 42 perches and allowance. The plaintiff gives evidence that the piece for which the suit is brought is part of the land described in the patent. The patent was issued to C. H. Owens, and it appears that C. H.

It recites the date of the warrant as of January, 1836. It is in evidence that Eben Owens is dead. It is in evidence that Heman Owens was his son, and that Heman is dead; and that C. H. Owens and John J. Owens are sons of Heman. This would leave the title to the whole of the Owens tract in Chandler Owens and John J. Owens, provided Eben Owens had no other heirs.</p>

This we would be disposed to say, if it <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>appeared that Heman Owens was the only heir of Eben Owens; but whether he was or not does not appear. And the plaintiff, claiming and filing an abstract for the whole of the land in suit, ought not to recover the undivided half without affirmative evidence that Heman Owens was the only heir of Eben Owens. For all that appears, Eben Owens may have had many other heirs; and if so, the patent is in trust for them, as well as for Chandler and John J. Owens, the sons of Heman. We think the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, who claims an undivided interest in land, to show the extent of such interest. The patent does recite that it is to C. H. Owens, in trust for himself and some thirteen or fourteen other persons named, and among them F. O. Crocker. But there is no evidence that any of the persons, other than C. H. Owens, were the heirs of Eben Owens, in whose behalf alone the entire purchase money due the commonwealth was paid. And even if we should assume that they were all the heirs of Eben Owens, the plaintiff would only be entitled to recover the undivided one fourteenth or fifteenth part of the land in suit. We are not able to see any ground on which the plaintiff can recover, under the deed from Crocker and his wife to Yanlennep, and the subsequent conveyances to himself. It does not appear that the Crocker claim was in any way connected with the rights of John J. Owens, or that either Crocker or his wife were the heirs of Eben Owens.] 8</p>

Bachop, to recover eighty-tliree acres of land in Gonewango township, Warren county, in the possession of Stephen Critchlow. The land in dispute is part of a larger tract, surveyed in pursuance of a warrant dated January 28, 1886, to Mary Owens, in trust for the heirs and legal representatives of Eben Owens, deceased, who, it is alleged, in his lifetime settled upon and improved the land, and died in the possession thereof. It appears that Eben Owens left to survive him a son, Heman Owens, — whether he had other children does not appear, — and that Heman Owens afterwards died in possession of the land, leaving two sons, C. H. Owens and John J. Owens.</p>
    <p id="b549-7" data-blocks='[["BL_549.7",549,[159,1257,1171,856]]]'>On August 31,1870, a patent from the commonwealth issued upon the above-recited warrant and survey to C. H. Owens, “for himself and in trust for Medora J. Mead, C. F. Reese,” and others, “heirs of Mary Owens, deed., and F. O. Crocker.” The patent specifically refers to the warrant and survey of 1836, acknowledges payment of the purchase money by Mary Owens, trustee for the heirs of Eben Owens, deceased, and from recitals it appears that the title to the lands embraced therein had “since become vested in the said C. II. Owens, for himself and in trust as aforesaid.” The habendum is as follows: “ To have and to hold the said tract or parcel of land with the appurtenances, unto the said C. H. Owens, Medora J. Mead, C. F. Reese,” and others, “heirs of Mary Owens, deceased, and F. O. Crocker, their heirs, to the use of them, the said C. H. Owens, for himself and in trust for the other owners, their heirs and assigns forever, agreeably to their respective interests.”</p>

    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[246,648,1186,1314]]]'>The recitals of this patent are to the effect that at the time of- its date the title to the land embraced in it became vested in C. H. Owens and certain other persons named who were heirs at law of Mary Owens, deceased, and F. O. Crocker. It is not shown what F. O. Crocker’s interest was; there is some evidence that his part was separate from the other, but there is no evidence of a partition, or of his ownership in severalty of any particular portion of the land. Upon the face of the patent, his right, prima facie, would seem to extend to the one undi- . vided half, the persons named as the heirs at law of Mary Owens, deceased, being entitled to the other half. The defendant showed no title whatever. His treasurers’ deeds were not shown to cover the premises in dispute ; the name of S. Critchlow had in no way been connected with a title to the land, good or bad. There must be some element of identity in the assessment itself, leading to a knowledge of the land assessed, —a description of the land, or some circumstance, number, or adjoiner, associated or connected with it, or a name connected at some time with a title to the land, good or bad: Philadelphia v.

The testimony, as we have said, shows that Eben Owens left to survive him one son, Heman Owens, and there is no evidence that he had any other children: Heman Owens died leaving two children, C. H. Owens and John J. Owens, who, if the matter rested here, would be the heirs at law and entitled to the land in dispute. But John J. Owens is not named in the patent. His interest, if he had any, was sold at <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>sheriff’s sale in 1859, and was purchased by one Arnett, who in 1860 conveyed the same to Eliza Crocker, wife of P. O. Crocker. It is a matter of little consequence whether Mrs. Crocker held in her own right or for the benefit of her husband, as the patent might seem to indicate; for, in 1865 thej joined in a deed, with covenants of general warranty, to Yanlennep, whose title by a connected and regular course of conveyance the plaintiff now holds. These proofs may perhaps furnish a suggestion why F. O. Crocker is, and John J. Owens is not named in the patent. But it was not necessary at the outset to go back of the patent to explain or justify its recitals as against a person who has exhibited no title whatever. These recitals were evidence, and were sufficient, prima facie, to justify a recovery for one undivided half of the land, for the title in Crocker under the patent, through the covenants of warranty of title, would enure to the benefit of Crocker’s vendee: Wolf v.
