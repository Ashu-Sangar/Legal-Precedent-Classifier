The testimony of Mr. Gordon, who was called by the plaintiff as a witness in this case, is that the fact that this note was to be held by them, Murray &amp; Gordon, as custodians for the two parties, until she procured a divorce, was communicated to Martha Jane Irvin. He is called as her witness, and she cannot discredit him; but her testimony does not tend to that, and therefore we have taken the question of fact, that it is alleged is raised in this case, away from the jury, so that there are no facts in dispute in this case that can have any bearing or change the relations of the parties to this transaction.

The cross-examination was confined to the point upon which he had been examined in chief, to wit the possession of the note and whose property it was.

It is not directed to the attorneys, but is a certificate to whom it may concern. It might very properly have been filed by the attorneys, as their authority for discontinuing the equity proceedings. The testimony in regard to the stipulation concerning the divorce was not offered for the purpose of contradicting or varying the terms of the written agreement, and it did not do so. If was a part of the agreement not reduced to writing, but perfectly consistent with the part that was written. That there was something not expressed in the writing, is almost a necessary inference from the reading of the sixth paragraph. In such a case, the parol part of the agreement may be proved: Whart.

It is not necessary to refer in detail to the subsequent litigation and proceedings which culminated in the agreement dated September 11, 1884, between the appellant and John Irvin.

The witness was permitted to say: “ Well, it (the note) was left with us as custodians, and was to be held by us until the terms of the contract between them was complied with; amongst which were that she was to procure a divorce from her husband, provided he made no defence to it, or did not prevent her from procuring it.”</p>
    <p id="b309-8" data-blocks='[["BL_309.6",309,[175,1967,1165,452]],["BL_310.1",310,[271,390,1174,339]]]'>It will be seen that this directly contradicts the written agreement. It contains no clause by which Mrs. Irvin agreed to procure a divorce from her husband. On the contrary, she merely stipulated that in case she should proceed against him for a divorce, she would not assign any other reason than his desertion. To meet this difficulty, the defendant was permitted to prove by the cross-examination of the witness, and against objection, that it was the understanding at the time the agreement was executed that the plaintiff was to procure a divorce from her <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>husband, before she would be entitled to receive the four thousand dollars; that this understanding was in parol, and was purposely omitted from the writing. It was contended, on the part of the defendant, that the divorce was the consideration or a part of the consideration of the agreement; that such a contract was against public policy, and tainted the entire transaction.</p>
    <p id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[268,748,1175,657]]]'>It is almost needless to observe that an ample consideration appears upon the face of the paper. The plaintiff was relinquishing valuable dower rights for a moderate compensation. She denies that any such agreement existed in regard to the divorce. Upon this point, there is a conflict of testimony which we are not required to discuss. I will observe, however, that, in our view, the paper of March 23, 1885, purporting to be signed by the plaintiff, does not strengthen the defendant’s case- upon the facts. The reference therein to the divorce is entirely consistent with what is said about it in the written agreement. It is evidence merely that she had commenced divorcé proceedings : not that she had bound herself, as a part of the consideration of the contract, to procure a divorce.</p>
    <p id="b310-7" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[266,1414,1172,501]]]'>It is very clear that all this evidence was improperly received upon cross-examination. The agreement itself explained the terms upon which the note was held. If relevant at all, it was only by way of defence. We do not think, however, it was competent at any time, or for any purpose. The effect of it was to reform a written instrument executed under the hands and seals of the parties; not only to reform it, but to inject into it a stipulation which the defendant claims renders it null and void, and prevents the recovery of a valid consideration stipulated to be paid for its execution.</p>
    <p id="b310-8" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[264,1925,1172,502]],["BL_311.1",311,[171,386,1170,1208]]]'>The principle is too well settled to need the citation of authority that, where by fraud, accident, or mistake, something is omitted from an instrument, a chancellor will reform it in accordance with the actual agreement of the parties. But neither fraud, accident, nor mistake was alleged in this case. The contention is that the alleged clause stipulating for a divorce was purposely omitted from the paper. It is in direct conflict with the written instrument. The defendant contends that it destroys it in part at least. I know of no decided case and no principle of law which permits an oral contract, made <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>at the same time with a written contract under seal, and purposely omitted therefrom, to be set up not only to contradict but to destroy it. The two agreements cannot possibly stand together; one or the other must fall. When parties without fraud or mistake have put their engagements in writing, that is not only the best, but the sole evidence of their agreement. We may well be excused at this late day from entering upon an elaborate discussion of the law in relation to the admission of oral evidence to affect written instruments. It may be received to explain the subject-matter of such papers: Barnhart v. Riddle, <a href="/pa/29/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="29 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="982903" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0092-01">29 Pa. 92</a>; to prove a consideration not mentioned in a deed, provided it be not inconsistent with the consideration expressed in it: Lewis v. Brewster, <a href="/pa/57/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="57 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="1010399" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0410-01">57 Pa. 410</a>; but not to contradict or vary the terms of the instrument itself: Martin v. Berens, <a href="/pa/67/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="67 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1022556" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0459-01">67 Pa. 459</a>. The exception is, where there has been fraud, accident, or mistake in the making of the agreement; and, even in such ease, the instrument can be reformed only by clear, precise, and indubitable evidence of what occurred at the time of the transaction. As was well said by this court in the ease last cited, “ Where parties without any fraud or mistake have deliberately put their engagements in writing, the law declares the writing to be not only the best, but the only evidence of their agreement, and we are not disposed to relax the rule.”</p>
    <p id="b311-5" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[172,1614,1170,646]]]'>When the plaintiff had proved the agreement of September 11, 1884, and had identified the note in suit, she had a clear case. There was not a trace of anything in it that offended against morality or public policy. Hence we can understand the anxiety of the defendant to inject into it, upon cross-examination, something to discolor it. liad the evidence referred to been rejected, the defendant would have been compelled to set up what he designates as an unlawful, if not immoral transaction, by way of defence. As he was a party to it, he might have found this difficult. Without expressing an opinion as to the legal effect of the transaction, it is sufficient to say that it did not properly appear in the plaintiff’s case, and her right to recover could not be defeated for such reason.</p>
