    <p id="b117-7" data-blocks='[["BL_117.6",117,[199,1238,1168,653]]]'>The plaintiff company we find duly incorporated on November 11, 1884, under the general corporation act of 1874, to supply the borough of Shamokin with pure water, from a stream called Roaring creek, upon and along which are located the three tracts of land, viz., Mary Ruston, Jr., 380 acres, lying in Conyngham township; Thomas Ruston, 175 acres lying in Conyngham township, and 100 acres tying in Locust township; and Mary Ruston, 200 acres, tying in Lomist township; all in Columbia county; that they “ are unproductive mountain lands, affording little or no timber, covered principally with undergrowth; and are useless to said company, except to protect the stream, to enable the plaintiff to carry out the purpose of its corporate existence.”</p>
    <p id="b117-8" data-blocks='[["BL_117.7",117,[200,1898,1164,348]]]'>From the draft of record in the case, by the plaintiff, and also the opinion of Judge Rockefeller, of Northumberland county, in a similar case by the same company, relating to the same stream and adjoining lands, it appears that the tract of land in Northumberland county and the ground on which the reservoir is built are already exempt from taxation as real estate, and nothing to the contrary is proved by the affidavits.</p>
    <p id="b117-9" data-blocks='[["BL_117.8",117,[199,2253,1163,147]],["BL_118.1",118,[253,380,1171,245]]]'>It also seems that the plaintiff owns only the surface of the lands in question, and yet they are valued and assessed in the usual way; Judge Rockefeller’s opinion recommending other<a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>wise notwithstanding. But this is not a proceeding to regulate or reform the assessment, but an allegation that the lands are illegally assessed with county, road, school and poor taxes for the years 1888 and 1889, to the amount of $160.17, for which they are not liable under the laws of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b118-6" data-blocks='[["BL_118.4",118,[248,634,1173,999]]]'>The power to assess, and jurisdiction in the officers to levy and collect is denied, not that the assessment is too high, or improperly increased; and hence we hold the proceeding regular, and that the principle decided in the case of Hughes v. Kline, <a href="/pa/30/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="30 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="415626" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0227-01">30 Pa. 227</a>, and similar cases urged upon us by counsel for the defendants, not applicable to this case. With the numerous decided cases on this question, we deem it unnecessary to say more than simply to affirm the doctrine, that the lands actually used to carry on the business of the water company and indispensably necessary for its operations are not taxable for local purposes. But to hold, that eight hundred and fifty-five acres of unproductive mountain lands, principally covered with a small growth of timber, or under-brush, not used for improvements, dam or reservoir purposes, consisting of different tracts of land, exempt from such taxation, because they lie along the stream used for supplying water for the company, and slope towards it and drain into it, for fear a nuisance might be erected on said lands and contaminate said stream, is in our opinion carrying the principle far beyond the intention of the decided cases.</p>
    <p id="b118-7" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[246,1651,1171,745]]]'>Nearly all lands have a drainage, and nearly every stream is surrounded by sloping lands, or hillsides, or mountains; and every water company in the state might with equal propriety, and perhaps with stronger grounds than this one, claim ownership and exemption from local taxation, and from the Delaware to the Ohio such lands would be entitled to the same exemption. The law abates nuisances. We are strongly inclined to adhere to the principle laid down in the decision of Justice Porter, in West Chester Gas Co. v. Chester Co., <a href="/pa/30/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="30 Pa. 232" data-case-ids="415634" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0232-01">30 Pa. 232</a>, and hold only the portion of land used and indispensably necessary for the carrying on of the works, to be “ on the verge ” of allowing the exemption, “and we shall go no further.” The reasons are briefly, clearly, and forcibly given in that opinion, and on them we base our temporary decision in this case.</p>
