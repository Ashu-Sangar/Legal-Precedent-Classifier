It is called eminent domain, because it is superior to all private rights, and is an exercise of the sovereign authority which of necessity resides in all governments for the common benefit and welfare of their citizens. It was assumed by the framers of the constitution to be a right necessarily inherent in every sovereign state. Accordingly, they did not put into the constitution any express grant of such power to the legislature, while they took care to prohibit by express words any limitation to its exercise which should exempt corporations from its applications to their property, in common with that of individual persons. Article XVI., § 3, declares: “ The exercise of the right of eminent domain shall never be abridged, or so construed as to prevent the general assembly from taking the property and franchises of incorporated companies and subjecting them to. public use, the same as the property of individuals.” If this power which resides in the state is a great power, it cannot be denied that it is also a necessaiy power. If it may seem in one aspect of it to be a despotic power, it cannot be denied that it is at the same time a beneficent power and absolutely essential to the public welfare. Without it, a road could not be opened, a railroad or telegraph line constucted, a canal dug, a bridge built, a new street laid out or an old one altered, and all public improvements would come to a stand-still. It oppresses no one, for its exercise is always accompanied by adequate and full compensation. It is guarded by just restrictions, and its abuse is prevented bj adequate limitations.</p>

It would be a mere affectation of industry for me to parade the many cases decided in Pennsylvania and the other states of the Union which affirm this proposition, especially in view of the express words of the constitution already quoted, which subject all franchises, as well as other property of corporations, to the exercise of this right.

On the other hand, nothing can be plainer than that it is not necessary for the defendants to show any such absolute necessity for the taking, unless the plaintiffs have made good their claims to be corporations existing for public uses, within the true legal meaning of those words.</p>

If this definition were accepted, any man’s property might be taken upon the shallowest pretence of a public use. The test whether a use is public or not is whether a public trust is imposed upon the property, whether' the public has a legal right to the use, which cannot be gainsaid, or denied, or withdrawn, at the pleasure of the owner. A particular enterprise, palpably for private advantage, will not become a public use because of the theoretical right of the public to use it. The question is, whether the <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>public have a right to the use. The general public must have a definite and fixed use of the property, a use independent of the will of the private person or corporation in whom the title is vested; a public use which cannot be defeated by the private owner, but which is guarded and controlled by the law. The true criterion by which to judge of the character of the use is whether the public may enjoy it by right, or only by permission. The test is, not what the corporation owning the land may choose to do, but what under the law it must do, and whether a public trust is impressed on the land. A franchise for such a public use cannot be granted away. The question of a public use is not affected by the agency employed. It is no more of a public use for being held by a corporation. To constitute a public use, the property must be under the control of the public, or of public agencies, or the public must have a right to the use.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_3" id="ref_footnote_0_3">*</a>

They are both private corporations, authorized to build houses and stalls to be used as public market-houses, for the sale of meats, vegetables, victuals and provisions, with the right to rent the stalls for whatever prices they may choose, or to sell out and quit the business whenever they please. We may ask, then, as the Supreme Court pertinently asked in Girard Storage Co. v. Southwark Foundry Co., <a href="/citations/?q=105%20Pa.%20251" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="105 Pa. 251">105 Pa. 251</a>: “ What rights have the public in and upon these properties other than what it would have did that property belong to a private individual ? ” “ We understand very clearly,” the court goes on to say, “the relation of a turnpike road, canal, and railroad, to the public. The people of the commonwealth have the right-of-way over them, which right when occasion requires may be exercised regardless of the will of the corporations owning them. They are highways; and the companies operating them have the right of eminent domain conferred upon them only because of this direct interest which the public has in these methods of transit. But in the works of the corporation defendant the community at large has no other or further interest than it has in the storehouses of private individuals. It may receive the grain of one person and refuse that of another, or it may, at its own will, suspend operations and shut out the public altogether. Its organization is all that it has received from the public; beyond this, the public has no special interest in it, and when this organization disappears there is nothing left of a public character, or anything over which the commonwealth has control.” Every word of. this is as applicable to the corporations plaintiff in these eases as it was to the Girard Storage Co. Corporations are divided, said Thompson, C. J., in Foster v. Fowler, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20Pa.%2080" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="60 Pa. 80">60 Pa. 80</a>, into public and private corporations; “ that is, into those which are agencies of the public and directly affecting it, and those which only affect it indirectly. . . . .” The public is directly interested in the results to be produced by the former, and the use of them cannot be disturbed by the seizure of the property <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>essential to tlieir operations by creditors. They must recover their debts by sequestering their earnings, allowing them to progress with their undertaking, to accommodate the public. This direct benefit to and accommodation of the public very clearly distinguishes this class of corporations from private corporations, in which the public is but indirectly interested. Whether they progress or cease, the public is not directly affected.</p>
    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[201,799,1165,1416]]]'>To apply this reasoning to the cases now in hand. In a market established, managed, and controlled by the municipal authorities, and governed by municipal laws, there may be no doubt a public use. Such were the markets formerly maintained by the city in Market street and other streets. But what legal interest has the public in the plaintiffs’ market-houses ? Is not their property entirely under their own control? May they not rent their stalls to whom they please, and refuse them to whom they please? And may they not, by the express words of their charter, rent, or sell the whole building when and to whom they please ? The second section of their charter declares that they may. Where is there any trace of a public trust impressed upon their property? Or, where are there any rights of the public which can be enforced against them ? May they not be sold out by the sheriff at anytime upon a creditor’s execution, like any private individual ? The answers which must be given to these questions show, it appears to me, conclusively, that the plaintiffs are but private corporations owning property impressed with no public trust; that they are engaged in a purely private business, which is wholly under their own control, in which the community has no public rights, and with which the public has no right to interfere. It is impossible that corporations which exist solely for their own purposes and profit, and which are governed only by their own interests and their own will, and over which the public can by no possibility exercise any control, can bo regarded as corporations existing for public uses within the legal meaning of those words.</p>

    <p id="b614-6" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[244,537,1172,1770]]]'>A franchise, in England, is a branch of the king’s prerogative subsisting in the hands of a subject. It is derived from the crown, and must arise from the king’s grant,, or by prescription, which presupposes a royal grant. In this country, it may be defined as a privilege vested in certain persons by grant from the sovereign authority in the state, to exercise powers, or to perform acts, which, without such grant, they could not do or perform. A franchise is jus publicum and necessarily exclusive in its nature : 8 Kent Com., 573. What are the franchises possessed by the plaintiffs? They have the franchise of being a corporation. As such, they have a right in their corporate capacity to have and maintain a market-house. There is plainly nothing exclusive in that. Any person or association of persons has a right to do the same thing without any grant from the state. Every green-grocer and provision dealer in the city is engaged in the same business; that is, he keeps a market-house. Unlike the plaintiffs, however, he not only keeps the market-house, but he himself sells the provisions which are sold there. The plaintiffs are engaged in maintaining a market-house in their collective capacity, under the cover of a charter. Any person may do the same thing without a charter. There is nothing in the nature of a franchise in the business which they carry on, for aiij*- one who chooses may carry on the same business. Their franchise consists solety in being a corporation, and carrying on their business in a corporate capacity. When the defendants take their market-house under .the delegated power of eminent domain, they do not take their charter or touch their franchise of being a corporation, which is really the sum total of the franchises which they possess. Even if the taking of their property involved the loss of their charters, as their counsel argue, a proposition to which I by no means assent, they could obtain a new one, as any other person may, under the provisions of the act of 1874, for the mere asking. What is the commercial value of a franchise which any one who chooses to ask for may obtain for nothing ?</p>

At common law, in England, the establishment of public markets was no doubt a part of the king’s prerogative, and no one could set up a market without a grant from him. Such grants were doubtless at one time fruitful sources of revenue to the royal exchequer. Their establishment was, as Blackstone says, “ a part of the economies of domestic polity, which, considering the kingdom as a large family and the king as master of it, he had the right to dispose of as he pleased: ” 1 Bl. Com., 274. These English markets, with their stewards, their tolls, their courts of pie-poudre in which all disputes originating in them must be decided before the setting of the sun, their special privileges and peculiar customs, constituted an important feature in the domestic economy of every English neighborhood. They were a part of the royal prerogative, undoubtedly, but they never crossed the seas to this country in that capacity, any more than did the right to all royal fish, such as the whale and the sturgeon, the right to corodies, to wrecks, to treasure trove, or to bona waviata. Our ancestors, when they transplanted on these shores the principles of English freedom, left behind them all royal prerogatives except such as were to be, in the hands of the people, the necessary instruments of the free government which they here established. I am not aware that it has ever been supposed or maintained in Pennsylvania that no man or association of men could set up a market-house or establish a market without a grant from the legislature.</p>

The right to maintain a market-house or to carry on the business of a market is not a right so derived, but is a right belonging to all citizens of the commonwealth alike and which any citizen or any association of citizens may exercise without any grant or any warrant whatever from the commonwealth. A private company incorporated for that business is a private corporation, as much so as a private company engaged in the manufacture of goods, in insurance, in the keeping of a hotel, or the prosecution of any other business. They are not the less private corporations because they incidentally afford a con<a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>venience to the public. In Turnpike Company v. Wallace, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%20316" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 W. 316">8 W. 316</a>, it was held that a company in which the state held a hundred and seventy-one thousand dollars of the stock, and individuals sixty-two thousand dollars only, was a private, not a public corporation. If the foundation be private, the corporation is private, although the uses in a certain sense may be called public. The mere act of being incorporated cannot change a corporation from a private to a public one. “ To hold a corporation to be public because the charity is public, would,” says Chancellor Kent, “be to confound the popular with the strictly legal sense of terms, and to jar with the W'hole current of decisions since the time of Lord Coke : 2 Kent Com., *276.</p>

Moreover, the defendant is not a “railroad company ” within the meaning of the act of April 4, 1868, P. L. 62, but its road is a branch of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company. It is the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, using the defendant’s charter as a mere cloak for the accomplishment of its own purposes, that is really seeking to construct the road here complained of. After unsuccessful efforts to secure permission of the city councils to the construction of it under the defendant's charter, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company attempted to construct it, as a branch, under its own charter. It was decided in Philadelphia v. Railroad Co. (C. P.), 25 W. N. 320, that this could be done, but only under the act of May 31, 1887, P. L. 275, and so as to involve acceptance of the constitution. The efforts of the defendant to obtain municipal consent were then renewed, and finally succeeded. From these incontrovertible facts, it is clear that this road is but a branch of the Reading railroad, and that the proceeding to construct it under the defendant’s charter is an unjustifiable evasion of the constitution. As to the bonds filed by the defendant company, the fixing of an amount in a condemnation bond, beyond which the sureties are not to be liable, <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>is unwarranted by the act of April 9, 1856, P.
