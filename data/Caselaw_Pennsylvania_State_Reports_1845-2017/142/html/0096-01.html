June 20, 1866, this was vacant land, and that the commonwealth had the right to grant it to persons who might apply for it. At that time, on June 20, 1866, and for many years before, it appears from the testimony, the defendants, or their predecessors under whom they claim, had been in possession of the land in controversy, and that possession has been maintained to the present time. I say, this appears from the testimony in the case; it is for you to say whether the testimony is to be believed. There is no testimony to the contrary. Where a man goes into the open, notorious, adverse and exclusive possession of land, and maintains that possession continuously and without interruption for a period of twenty-one years, he acquires a good title as <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>against every person except the commonwealth.

    <p id="b123-4" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[178,579,1166,1008]]]'>But it is contended upon the part of the plainti ff that the statute of limitations, which bars an action after twenty-one years, did not begin to run in this case until June 28,1886, and that the action of ejectment having boon brought on June 21, 1887, it was within the time. This is a question in the case, and it is a legal question for the court to decide. On the part of the defence, it is claimed that the statute of limitations began to run on the date of the warrant, the warrant being what is called a descriptive warrant, the date of it being June 20,1866. And we so decide, that the statute of limitations began to run on June 20, 1866, for the reason that the warrant to John Keller being a descriptive warrant, and the purchase money having been paid, it gave him an equitable title as of that date, which he might forfeit and lose, it is true, by his negligence, but which was not forfeited in this case, because he pursued it with due diligence. Therefore, on that date he had the right of entry, namely, June 20, 1866; and, not having brought his action of ejectment within twenty-one years, he is not entitled to recover, if you believe the defendants’ testimony as to their possession.</p>

An action of ejectment instituted by tbe plaintiff on June 20, 1866, against tbe persons in possession of this land, could not have been maintained. True, the plaintiff on that date had paid to the commonwealth the amount of purchase money necessary to give life to his application for six acres and eighty perches of vacant land, and on that day there was issued at Harrisburg a warrant requiring the surveyor of Luzerne county to survey to the plaintiff the land applied for, “if not already surveyed or appropriated.” That warrant granted to the county surveyor a right of entry for the specific purpose of locating the survey, but no right to use the land for any other purpose was then granted; and, if the plaintiff had then attempted to make such use of land, admittedly in the possession of others, he would have been liable for damages in trespass. As a matter of fact, the warrant, issued at Harrisburg on J une 20th, could not, by any means of conveyance then possible, have gotten into the hands of the surveyor before June 21st, and the plaintiff could not have known on the 20th of the existence of even the surveyor’s right of entry for the specific purpose of locating the warrant.</p>

Upon payment of the purchase money, which always precedes the issuing of the warrant: Fox v. Lyon, <a href="/pa/27/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="27 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="979568" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0009-01">27 Pa. 9</a>, the warrantee is immediately invested with an equitable title, upon which he can maintain ejectment, or trespass, for a wrongful entry upon the land described, made between the date of the warrant and the survey: Sergeant’s Land Law, 135; Bechtel v. Rhoads, 3 S. &amp; R. 333; Washabaugh v. Entriken, <a href="/pa/34/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="34 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="417967" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0074-01">34 Pa. 74</a>. Indeed, an adverse possession will run against a settler from the inception of his settlement: Munshower v. Patton, 10 S. &amp; R. 334. A fortiori, it will run against the owner of a descriptive warrant.</p>

The ejectment, brought on June 21,1887, was too late, the defendants’ possession having then ripened into a full legal title: Martin v. Jackson, <a href="/pa/27/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="27 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="979774" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0504-01">27 Pa. 504</a>; Olwine v.

Moreover, the warrant and survey conveyed no title to the plaintiff, the commonwealth having none to grant. The warrant covers part of on old “Yankee” road, laid out by the Connecticut settlers, and recognized by the commissioners who surveyed their allotments and certified them to the surveyor general at Harrisburg. Such certificates called for the road as a boundary, and the title of the certificate holders extended, under a well-known rule of construction, to the middle of the road: Paul v. Carver, <a href="/pa/24/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="24 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="9503887" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0207-01">24 Pa. 207</a>; Paul v.

      <blockquote id="b122-8" data-blocks='[["BL_122.7",122,[275,1636,1169,759]]]'>“ The commissioners appointed to put in execution the act of April <em>4, </em>1799, [3 Sm. L. 362,] for offering compensation to the Pennsylvania claimants of certain lands within the seventeen townships of Luzerne county, laid out and returned in their surveys a number of certified roads, varying in width from four to eight rods, and lying between and bounding the various tiers of certified lots returned by the commissioners. These roads were laid out on the official surveys, in addition to the usual allowance of six per centum for ordinary road purposes, and in most instances have never been used as roads, because they were laid apparently with no regard to the topography of the ground, and over hills and ravines where it was impossible for roads to be built. The title remained in the commonwealth, and the unused and entirely impracticable certified roads, originally returned by the commissioners, have ever since been regarded by the commonwealth as vacant land. As the ground on which these roads were laid has gradually become of value for agricultural or mining purposes, application has been made for the same, and the commonwealth l¡as granted title thereto to her citizens, upon warrant, survey and patent.”</blockquote>

The remaining assignments present a single question of law, viz., when does title begin under a descriptive warrant duly surveyed and returned ? The appellant contends that it commences with the date of the return of the survey; the appellees contend that it begins with the date of the warrant.</p>
    <p id="b127-7" data-blocks='[["BL_127.6",127,[193,1553,1168,650]]]'>This, as before observed, was a descriptive warrant; its boundaries are fully set forth therein. A descriptive warrant gives a right of entry: Bechtel v. Rhoads, 3 S. &amp; R. 333. The warrantee has an equitable title, commencing with the date of the warrant. His title bears a close analogy to that of a vendee under articles of agreement. A descriptive warrant, and payment of part of the purchase money, gives an equitable interest in the land from its date, which can only be divested by conveyance or twenty-one years’ adverse possession: Washabaugh v. Entriken, <a href="/pa/34/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="34 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="417967" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0074-01">34 Pa. 74</a>. When the patent issues, the warrantee becomes possessed of the full legal title, and it relates back to the inception of his equitable title. We are of opinion the statute runs from the date of the warrant.</p>
