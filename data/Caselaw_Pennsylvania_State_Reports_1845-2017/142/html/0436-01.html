When he had cut about 30,000 feet of lumber and had logs cut in the woods for about 60,000 feet more, writs of ejectment and estrepement for lot No. 5204 were served upon him and the defendant at the suit of Henry <em>&amp; </em>Parmlee. The writ of estrepement was modified on December 12, 1874, so as. to permit the plaintiff to take away the lumber made from logs cut prior to June 20, 1874, and to saw and remove the lumber from logs cut prior to that date.</p>

Watson, was brought against Davidson, the defendant herein, and others, for tract No. 5207. Rogers, the plaintiff, was not then occupying that lot, but remained on lot No. 5204, until in the following spring he had worked off the lumber permitted by the order modifying the writ of estrepement, when he removed his mill and other property and disposed of it from time to time as he could. The ejectment cases were tried <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>in 1877 and 1878; that brought by Henry &amp; Parmlee for lot No. 5204 terminating in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs therein, under which they were finally put in possession.</p>

    <p id="b462-7" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[250,749,1179,657]]]'>As we construe this contract, it became the duty of the plaintiff in this case, under it to manufacture the pine timber on lots Nos. 5204 and 5207, according to the terms of the contract ; and also, to manufacture the other timber specified therein, according as it is stated in this contract. That is the meaning of this contract as we understand it. The expression that is used in the first clause, or in the premises, “ and manufacture the pine timber owned by the second party on that lot and the one adjoining, No. 5207,” does not mean, as we understand it, that the plaintiff, Mr. Rogers, agreed to manufacture so much of the pine timber as belonged to the defendant, Mr. Davidson, but that he would manufacture the pine timber on those lots which belonged to the defendant, Mr. Davidson.....</p>
    <p id="b462-8" data-blocks='[["BL_462.6",462,[247,1415,1181,607]]]'>The duty of Mr. Davidson, under the contract, corresponded to that of Mr. Rogers; they were correlative. Therefore, under this contract, Mr. Rogers acquired a right in the nature of an irrevocable license to go upon the land, to take the timber and manufacture it into lumber, and to deliver it at Tidioute. And it thereby became the duty of Mr. Davidson, with whom the contract was made, to see that Mr. Rogers would be protected in that right. If Mr. Davidson failed to do so, he failed to perform his contract. This being under seal, then, he broke his covenant as therein claimed, and is guilty of a breach of the covenant for which he must compensate the plaintiff in damages.</p>
    <p id="b462-9" data-blocks='[["BL_462.7",462,[245,2030,1180,401]],["BL_463.1",463,[168,384,1175,857]]]'>The defendant gives evidence, as already mentioned, that, shortly after Mr. Rogers commenced . operations on this land, an action of ejectment was brought against Mr. Davidson, by other persons claiming title to it paramount to his ; and that, accompanying this writ of ejectment, there was a writ of estrepement, which was served upon the plaintiff in this ease and •upon Mr. Davidson, whereby Mr. Rogers, the plaintiff, was prevented from cutting any further timber on tract No. 5204. Mr. <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>Rogers testifies that he requested of Mr. Davidson that he should take such proceedings as would be necessary to free him from the restraint placed upon him by virtue of that writ of estrepement, so he might go on and fulfil his contract; but that Mr. Davidson refused to do so, or neglected to do do, and never did do so, as matter of fact. Neither is there evidence in the case to show that he did so, or attempted so to do. Mr. Rogers testifies that he was ready and willing to go on with the completion of his part of the contract. Now, gentlemen of the jury, this is not a fact in dispute, as I understand it, with regard to these writs, and with regard to the fact that the plaintiff in this case was prevented from carrying out his part of the contract, by being stopped by the writ of estrepement. If our construction of the contract is correct, that constituted a breach of the defendant’s covenant, and would entitle the plaintiff here to recover whatever damage he sustained by reason of that breach.</p>
    <p id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[170,1256,1175,547]]]'>The question, then, which follows, is that of the amount of damage which the plaintiff sustained; the amount of compensation which he is entitled to have by your verdict in this case. On the part of the plaintiff, considerable evidence was introduced tending to show the amount of profit which the plaintiff could have made, and would have made, had his contract been carried out. But you probably already clearly understand that that evidence has been withdrawn from your consideration; as that, in our view of the law, is not the correct basis for estimating the amount of damage the plaintiff, in this case, sustained.....</p>

These are the things that you are to consider ; that is to say, you are to consider how much expense the plaintiff in this case was at, in this preparation and in the removing of his machinery away, and the depreciation in the actual value of the property necessary for the carrying out of his contract, between the time it was purchased and put in place and the time when it was removed and disposed of by him. And the difference in that value, together with the amount of expense which was lost by the loss of the opportunity to manufacture the lumber, is the plaintiff’s damage arising from the breach of the contract.....</p>

    <p id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[257,1251,1176,1116]]]'>[Gentlemen of the jury, the learned counsel for defendant calls the attention of the court to the indefiniteness of the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff; and we are asked to instruct you with regard to that. ' We say to you that it is incumbent on the plaintiff in this case to show to you affirmatively what his actual loss was. By that we do not mean to say that it is incumbent on the plaintiff to show to you, to a precise amount in dollars and cents, what his loss was before he can recover anything. But the plaintiff should satisfy you that his loss was a certain amount; that it was, at least, as great as a certain amount before you would render him a verdict for that amount. If there is uncertainty, and you are left to conclude between a smaller sum and a greater sum, and if that uncertainty arises from indefiniteness of the plaintiff’s testimony, he could not complain if you only allowed the smaller amount and not the larger. But if the plaintiff satisfied you that his loss- was at least a certain amount and possibly a certain greater amount, if you are satisfied that it was at least as large as the greater amount stated, then you would be warranted in rendering a verdict for that amount. In other words and in a word, you are to determine, not b} a .guess, but by the evidence in this case, how much damage the plaintiff has sustained.] <em>9</em>
