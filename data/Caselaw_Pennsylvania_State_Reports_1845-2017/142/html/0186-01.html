Schrank thereupon brought replevin for the goods-against the plaintiffs in the attachments and the constable who executed them. He also brought actions of trespass against the same persons, to recover damages for their seizure. The paper-books did not disclose what disposition was made of those suits. Subsequently, Schrank caused writs of fieri facias to be issued upon his judgments against Raisch, by virtue of which the sheriff levied on the property covered by the attachments of Utz, Brown and Shoemaker, and, on November 20, 1886, made sale of the same. The attaching creditors were present.at the sale, and gave notice that purchasers would take the property subject to the attachments. The goods were all purchased by Schrank.

Execution was issued on both these judgments, and placed in the sheriff’s hands, and these executions were levied by the sheriff upon a stock of butcher’s equipments, goods, personal property and merchandise contained in the store and about the premises of Frederick Raisch, the defendant. The sheriff sold all this property to George Sehrank, the plaintiff in the writ. His title to this property, therefore, depends on that sheriff’s sale. So far as the forms of the law are concerned, the sale was regular and valid, and if there were nothing else in the case than this, would vest in George Sehrank, or in his executor, the present plaintiff who stands in his stead, a good title to the personal property in question.</p>

The defendants now claim that these attachments having been laid upon this property first, or prior to the lien of the sheriff’s execution, or before the lien of the sheriff’s execution attached, therefore the subsequent proceedings upon the execution were void. We say to you at this point, that we are unable to adopt that view of the case, and as we understand the law, it is competent to levy an execution like this, in the hands of the sheriff, upon property already covered by such attachments as those in question, and to proceed with the sheriff’s sale of the property ; and that the effect of the attachments upon the execution in the hands of the sheriff, is to bring the money for distribution into court, but not to prevent proceedings on the sheriff’s writ up to that point. In other words, that the property is not in the custody of the law <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>in such a sense, by reason of the attachments, that the sheriff had no right to proceed with his executions. And we say this in regard also to property which may have been delivered on the attachments to the judgment creditors, as well as in regard to property remaining in the hands and in the possession of the defendant in the writ. The sheriff may pursue such property, levy upon it, sell it, bring the money into court, and the attachment creditors must look to the fund, upon distribution, for their money.</p>

And if fraud be shown to your satisfaction, it vitiates the whole proceeding and makes it void. Fraud is not presumed in law; it must be proved. Men are assumed to deal honestly until the contrary is established. But this rule of the law means no more than that the jury must be satisfied from all the evidence in the case, and the weight of the evidence, that fraud exists. If they are so satisfied, either from the direct proof, which is unusual in cases of alleged fraud, or from indirect and circumstantial proof which leads inevitably to a conclusion of fraud, they may find it to exist, although there is a legal presumption that all things are fair.</p>

That paper has been read in your hearing. It is supposed to be a bill of sale. As such, its effect would be to transfer the title to this personal property from the vendor to the vendee. Your attention is also called to the fact that notwithstanding this bill of sale Raisch never surrendered possession of the property, but remained apparently its owner; that as such he went on with the business of butchering at the old stand ; that he contracted debts for cattle in the line of his business, and sold to customers in the ordinary way; that there was no change of the sign over the door of his shop, as I understand it, or of the name and advertisement painted on the wagon by which the meat was peddled on the streets of the town.] 3</p>

      <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>[Furthermore, your attention is called to the fact of certain declarations made by Raisch to various parties who were called here as witnesses, or whose testimony we have from the record, that he was solvent and out of debt, excepting a very inconsiderable amount at or about the time when he conveyed his personal property to Schrank for a presumed debt, under the bill of sale.] 4 The defendants also call your attention to the fact that, whilst Schrank claimed to be a creditor of Raisch to the amount of about $800, advanced at different times and in different sums, in no instance has he shown any acknowledgment for such indebtedness in the form of a note or due-bill or memorandum, such as it is claimed it is customary to give in similar transactions between man and man. Your attention has also been called to a book which has been described in evidence, which Mr. Schrank testified was his book of original entries in a certain sense, or at least a book in which he put down the amounts loaned to Raisch at the time they were advanced, which it now seems could not have been the case, because the book at the time of the dates of these entries, had not been made. But you must consider also in this connection his explanation that he meant to be understood, not that the only and original entry was made on this book, but that it was made on slips of paper and by him transferred to the book at a subsequent date. The defendant has called your attention also, in connection with the allegation of fraud, to the fact of certain proceedings brought by Raisch before Esquire Kulp about the thirtieth of August, 1886, or in August, 1886, in which he claimed title to this property, notwithstanding the bill of sale heretofore made; also to suits brought by Schrank in August, 1886, in replevin; also to the actions of trespass ; also to what is known as the Sherman &amp; Lathrop suit against Raisch before Alderman Parsons in July, 1886, upon which there was a judgment and an execution issued upon which Raisch claimed an appraisement and an exemption, as if he were the owner of the goods at that date. The bill of sale was dated on July 2,1886; the judgments are dated March 25, and July 7, 1886, respectively, but no executions were issued upon them until October, 1886, and then the sheriff’s sale to Mr. Schrank was made.</p>

That is the question. Did Frederick Raisch honestly owe George Schrank this money? Were these judgments confessed to Schrank for the purpose of liquidating an honest indebtedness? If so, the sale upon them having been regular, the present plaintiff ought to recover the property involved in this issue.

    <p id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.4",219,[164,413,1175,761]]]'>The only testimony taken before the referee in the attachment suits, and used in the case at bar, was that of George Schrank himself. It was admitted and was admissible, for the purpose of contradiction. His admissions and contradictions tended strongly to establish our allegation that the judgment notes under which the sheriff’s sale took place, were fraudulent. All his contradictions, and the circumstances connected with his claim of the goods under the bill of sale, were submitted to the jury, not as evidence of fraud subsequent to the sheriff’s sale, but as bearing upon the character of transactions prior thereto. The declarations of Raisch and Schrank, of the rejection of which the appellant complains in the fifth assignment of error, were made after the defendants had given credit to Raisch, and could not be received to affect them. Nor were those declarations in rebuttal of anything.</p>

    <p class="author" id="AAl" data-blocks='[["BL_219.6",219,[403,1234,586,32]]]'>Mr. Chief Justice Paxson:</p>
    <p id="b219-7" data-blocks='[["BL_219.7",219,[159,1285,1168,351]]]'>This was a feigned issue, under the sheriff’s interpleader act. The appellant claimed title under a sheriff’s sale. It appears that the appellant’s testator, George Schrank, held a judgment against one Fritz Raisch, upon which he issued an execution, levied upon the personal property of Raisch, and at the sale thereof became the purchaser. This gave him a good title to the property, in the absence of fraud.</p>
    <p id="b219-8" data-blocks='[["BL_219.8",219,[149,1643,1175,761]],["BL_220.1",220,[276,376,1178,504]]]'>It is proper to mention that, some time before Schrank issued his execution, he had taken a bill of sale from Raisch, for the same property levied upon, and allowed the latter to remain in possession. Afterwards certain creditors of Raisch issued attachments against him, upon which the property was seized. Schrank, claiming it under his bill of sale, brought trespass against the plaintiffs in the attachments and the officer who served them, and also sued out a writ of replevin. Finally he issued his fieri facias, as before stated, levied on the property subject to the writs of attachment, and became the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale. The effect of this sale was to free the property from the lien of the attachments ; the purchaser took a good title, and the lien of the attachments was transferred from the property to the fund. These facts are mentioned, not as having any special importance in the case, but for the <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>reason that they appear to have led to some confusion upon the trial in the court below. The most that can be made of the bill of sale, the suit for trespass and the replevin, is that the whole was a clumsy device of an ignorant man to secure himself against loss, assuming him to have been a bona-fide creditor of Raisch. Subsequently, the attaching creditors obtained judgments, and proceeded to levy upon the same property which the sheriff had previously sold to Schrank. This feigned issue was then framed to try the question of the ownership of the said property.</p>
    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[274,887,1172,301]]]'>As before observed, the sheriff’s sale gave Schrank a good title, in the absence of fraud. If the judgment upon which his execution issued was bona fide, and for an honest debt, his title was good against the world. It follows that the only question properly before the court below was the validity of that judgment.</p>
    <p id="b220-7" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[266,1194,1178,964]]]'>The first assignment alleges that the court erred in admitting the testimony- of a number of witnesses taken in another suit, to which Schrank was not a party, to be read in evidence. Among those witnesses was Schrank himself, and his testimony was offered for the purpose of contradiction. So far as it tended to contradict his evidence given in the present proceeding, it was competent. The mere declarations of a party to a suit, made out of court, may be used to contradict his testimony in court, provided the proper ground be laid for their introduction. I am somewhat at a loss to know whether the testimony of John Utz, and the other witnesses referred to in this assignment, was admitted and read to the jury. The paper-book is not clear upon this point. If admitted, it was error, for the reason that it was taken in another proceeding, to which the appellant was not a party and where the issue was entirely different. Moreover, much of the testimony was irrelevant, even if otherwise admissible. As the case must be reversed upon other grounds, these suggestions are made for the guidance of the court below upon another trial.</p>
    <p id="b220-8" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[265,2164,1171,246]],["BL_221.1",221,[177,399,1166,286]]]'>We think it was error to admit the bill of sale referred to in the second assignment. It had no bearing upon the validity of the judgment. We are dealing with an allegation of actual fraud, and a bill of sale is only evidence of a constructive fraud when not accompanied with the possession of the pro<a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>perty. It is good between the parties, yet, when taken in the most perfect good faith and based upon the fullest consideration, the law declares it a fraud against creditors when there is no corresponding change of possession. It is, however, a constructive fraud only, and is not of itself evidence of actual fraud.</p>
    <p id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[176,705,1164,145]]]'>Assuming that the bill of sale was a badge of actual fraud, the learned judge fell into error in that portion of his charge embraced in the third assignment. It is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b221-6" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[171,858,1169,864]]]'>“ The defendants allege fraud, and to establish it they call your attention to several different facts and circumstances; first, to what is called the bill of sale, whieh purports to have transferred the title of this personal property from Frederick Raiseh to George Schrank on July 2, 1886. That paper has been read in your hearing. It is supposed to be a bill of sale. As such, its effect would be to transfer the title to this personal property from the vendor to the vendee. Your attention is also called to the fact that notwithstanding this bill of sale Raiseh never surrendered possession of the property, but remained apparently its owner; that as such he went on with the business of butchering at the old stand; that he contracted debts for cattle in the line of his business, and sold to customers in the ordinary way; that there was no change of the sign over the door of his shop, as I understand it, or of the name and advertisement painted on the wagon by which the meat was peddled on the streets of the town.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b221-7" data-blocks='[["BL_221.6",221,[168,1730,1170,606]]]'>All this was irrelevant to the issue before the court, and the evidence of which it was predicated had no proper place in the cause. It related to matters which occurred prior to the sheriff’s sale, which sale, as before observed, passed a good title to Schrank, in the absence of fraud ; and that fraud, if it exists, must be found in the judgment, not in the clumsy and abortive attempt to hold the property by virtue of a bill of sale. Had Schrank claimed title by virtue of this bill of sale, it would have been a case of constructive fraud, and the charge of the learned judge would have been correct. But his title had been perfected by a judicial sale, and the case has resolved itself into a question of actual fraud.</p>
    <p id="b221-8" data-blocks='[["BL_221.7",221,[171,2343,1163,95]],["BL_222.1",222,[277,403,1173,444]]]'>We cannot say that this ruling did the plaintiff no harm. On the contrary, it was vital, and took the heart out of his <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>case. Indeed, but for this, I do not see how the jury could have found for the defendants, as the integrity of the judgment was not assailed by a single witness, so far as I have observed, and I have read the testimony with some care. The testimony of both Schrank and Raisch, the parties to the judgment, fully sustains its consideration. The most that can be urged against it are some trifling contradictions in their testimony. Neither witness was- impeached, or seriously contradicted.</p>
    <p id="b222-6" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[274,865,1173,502]]]'>We think it was error to call the attention of the jury to certain declarations of Raisch, made to various parties, as to his financial condition. That a defendant in a judgment cannot destroy it by his mere declarations is settled law. The latest case upon this subject is Unangst v. Goodyear Co., <a href="/pa/141/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="141 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="974924" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0127-01">141 Pa. 127</a>, decided at the present term. The holder of a judgment would have a very precarious security, if his debtor could destroy it by his mere loose declarations. Aside from this, Raisch was not a party to this proceeding and was a competent witness. His declarations were not competent.</p>
    <p id="b222-7" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[269,1376,1178,289]]]'>The plaintiff has no reason to complain of the rejection of the-testimony of Valentine Wich. He was offered to prove the declarations of the plaintiff himself, and of Raisch. If such testimony were competent, the parties to a suit could manufacture evidence without limit. This does not require discussion.</p>
    <p id="b222-8" data-blocks='[["BL_222.6",222,[534,1683,907,84]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>
