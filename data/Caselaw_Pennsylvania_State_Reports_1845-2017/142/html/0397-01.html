The uniform manner in which the*defendant’s miners were employed was that the miner contracted with the company to do the mining of coal for a specified price by the quantity, such price covering all the labor, etc., required to get the coal out. The miner would then hire his own laborers or helpers, who would be compensated out of the moneys payable upon the contract between the company and the miner. The payment of the laborers employed by the miner was regulated, however, by a usage to the following effect: About the first 'of each month the miner “ turned in ” to the company a statement of the wages earned by his laborers during’ the preceding month. The company then deducted the amounts so turned in from the sum its accounts showed to <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>be due to the miner upon his contract, and paid directly to the laborers the amount of such deductions, paying to the miner the remainder of the contract price of the mining done. These payments were made on the regular pay-day, to wit, the Saturday nearest to the twentieth day of the month succeeding that in which the moneys were earned. In the interval between the first and the twentieth of the month, the company’s clerks would make up accounts showing the amounts payable to the miners and laborers, respectively, for the work of the preceding month.</p>

The plaintiff worked in the capacity of a laborer for Dennis during the month of October, 1889, and, on the regular pay-daj in November, received the amount of his wages from the defendant in accordance with the usage above stated. He continued to work during the month of November, 1889, and his wages earned in that month amounted to $24. About December 2d, Dennis turned in to the company a statement of those wages. On the same day, or the day after, the plaintiff quit working for Dennis, went to the office of the defendant, and demanded payment of the $24 due him, saying that lie was going away and wanted his money. The defendant’s superintendent replied he would advance the balance coming to the plaintiff, if the latter would cause to be turned in, for deduction from the $24 claimed, a board bill owing from the plaintiff to Dennis. This proposition being declined, the superintendent refused to pay the plaintiff anything. The plaintiff testified that the reason given for wishing the board bill turned in, was that Dennis was indebted to Harvey Yeager, the storekeeper, and it was desired to apply the amount of the board bill to that debt. On cross-examination, the superintendent was asked: “ Q. The truth is you wanted to protect Harvey Yeager, did you not? A. Yes, we did.”</p>

    <p id="b424-7" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[278,1188,1174,646]]]'>So far as the facts of this particular case are concerned, there is very little dispute or difference. It is not denied that the plaintiff was employed by one Dennis, who was a miner for defendant company, as his laborer in these particular mines; nor is there any dispute about the amount which the laborer •earned by his work for the month of November, 1889, at the rate of one dollar and a half per day. The controversy really arises out of this question: Whether the custom of paying the miner on what is known as pay-day, which occurs about the twentieth of the month, is applicable to this case, so that the plaintiff had no legal claim for these wages for which he could bring an action, until the arrival of the next pay-day after he ceased work in these mines.</p>
    <p id="b424-8" data-blocks='[["BL_424.6",424,[276,1852,1174,554]],["BL_425.1",425,[167,395,1173,399]]]'>Now, there are two views of such a question, to be taken in .any comprehensive discussion of the points involved. As most of you are well aware, the mining of coal is generally done under a contract between the employer and the miner, as to the price which the latter shall receive by the car or quantity for the coal mined. In other words, the owner or employer contracts with the miner for the mining of the coal; the miner employs his own laborer and out of the pay he receives from the employer, he compensates his laborer. In other words, there is no relation of contract, as a general rule, in the mining region, between the laborer and the Gompany or the employer. <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>The bargain is between the miner and the employer, for the mining of the coal, and the miner makes his own contract or bargain with the laborers, who do the work of putting the coal into the cars, and other labor necessary. So that, in the absence of any custom to the contrary, making the law of the relation, a laborer who has earned a certain amount of money must look to the miner for his compensation, and not to the employer of the miner.</p>
    <p id="b425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_425.4",425,[168,804,1174,1210]]]'>But, gentlemen, there has grown up in this mining region a custom, or practice, or usage which is tantamount to law, of this kind: That at certain collieries the contract or arrangement is that while the company pays the miner and bargains with him for tlie mining of the coal, it is also provided, for reasons of mutual convenience or benefit, that the miner shall return, or “ turn in,” as it is called, every month to the employer, the amount due the laborer, and that then the employer shall pay that amount, not to the miner, but to the laborer himself. And where this custom is established clearly, and has become uniform and well known, it becomes, in our judgment, the law of the relation between the laborer and the employer. And while, in the absence of such a custom, the laborer must needs look to the miner for his pay, in the presence or existence of such a usage or custom, the laborer may have a legitimate claim for his wages directly upon the common employer. Another custom, which amounts to a law, practically, in this mining country, is this: That the wages or pay due the miner from the employer, as we have already said, is not payable at the end of the month, but is to be paid at the next pay-day, which, as we understand it, occurs about the twentieth of the following month. So that, practically, the company or employer is always two thirds of a month behind in making a payment to the miner or laborer.....</p>
    <p id="b425-6" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[173,2034,1172,400]],["BL_426.1",426,[263,396,1179,760]]]'>Now in our judgment, gentlemen of the jury, this custom of paying once a month, on or about the twentieth, the wages earned during the preceding month, where it has been agreed to and practiced under by the miner and employer, becomes also the law of the relation. It, no doubt, had been found necessary that the employer should have a certain amount of time to examine the accounts, to post the books and to make the arrangements for paying the miner, for the work done dur<a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>ing the preceding month. [But, gentlemen of the jury, in our judgment this custom or rule, while having the force of law, so long as the workman remains in the employment of the employer or company, is no rule of action to be enforced by a court when the relation of employer and employee terminates and ceases. In other words, the rule is applicable to the parties while the relation lasts of employer and employee. But, if for any reason the relation terminates, and there is a certain amount of money due the employee for wages, then and in that case it becomes immediately pajmble, and the employee is not obliged to wait two thirds of a month later, if he wishes to remove elsewhere or seek other employment.] 1 This, in our judgment, after a careful consideration, is the fair and just exposition of the law on this subject; and, of course, it controls our judgment in this case.....</p>
    <p id="b426-6" data-blocks='[["BL_426.4",426,[262,1162,1175,963]]]'>Before referring to the points, gentlemen, [I would say furthermore, as a portion of my general charge, that there is some evidence in this case, namely, the testimony of William Dennis, to this effect: That the rule in question in regard to monthly payments, did not apply to a man who left the company’s employment. In such a case, he says they pay when he leaves. That is in this record. Nor is there any evidence on the part of the defendant to the contrary.] 8 It is furthermore in the evidence that when the plaintiff asked for his pay, Mr. Smith, the superintendent of the company, declined to pay him, or advance the money to him, to use his language, unless he would leave behind a sufficient sum to pay the board bill, some fifteen or eighteen dollars. There is no evidence that the boarding-house keeper claimed this money, or claims that it should be retained, or that there was any contract between the parties to that effect. [Nor is there any evidence that Mr. Smith, on behalf of the company, declined to pay because the monthly pay-day had not come around.] 3 That was not the reason assigned.</p>

Even if such a distinction holds good in a case where such a relation exists, it has no application in the present case. The testimony of Dennis, that he had known of eases in which men were paid before the pay-day, is insufficient to establish a custom to that effect: (1) Because he does not say that laborers were ever thus paid; (2) because evidence of the practice of the company, in particular instances, is not sufficient to establish a custom: Burger v.

If the verdict of the jury was rendered upon a finding that Fair-field was directly in the employment of the company, and not of Dennis, the questions raised upon the assignments of error would be unimportant. But the verdict, under the charge of the court, may have been, and probably was, rendered upon an entirely different theory as to the facts. The charge of the court proceeds mainly upon the assumption that Fairfield was a laborer, employed by Dennis; that there was no contractual relation existing between Fairfield and the company, other than would result from the usage of the company in the payment of laborers when their time was turned in by the miners by whom they were employed; and it must be conceded that the testimony throughout is reasonably consistent with this view of the case.</p>

But it is alleged that there existed, not a general custom, technically so called, but an arrangement or usage of the company, established for the convenience and benefit of all parties interested, by which the miner, at the end of each month, was to “ turn in ” to the company the amount due to his laborers, and the company should charge the account of the <em>miner, </em>and pay the amount to the laborer himself. Under this general mode of conducting the business, as was said in Plymouth Coal Co. v. Kommiskey, <a href="/pa/116/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="116 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="554339" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0365-01">116 Pa. 365</a>, the “ turning in ” of the laborers’ <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>time by the miner was in legal effect an order on the company to pay the amount; and the company, recognizing this mode of settlement between the miner and his men, paid the men as if they had been in the company’s service. The testimony shows that the time was turned in about the first of each month for the month preceding, while the pay-day was on the Saturday occurring nearest to the twentieth of the month. This time was accorded, doubtless, to enable the company to examine the accounts, post their books, and prepare the vouchers for payment.</p>

' What their reasons were it is unnecessary to consider, for, if the company was not obliged to pay in advance of the regular pay-day, that, of itself, was a sufficient reason.</p>

He says : “ The rule is applicable to the parties while the relation lasts of employer and employee. But, if for any reason the relation terminates, and there is a certain amount of money due the employee for wages, then and in that case it becomes immediately payable, and the employee is not obliged to wait two thirds of a month later, if he wishes to remove elsewhere or seek other employment. This, in our judgment, after a careful consideration, is the fair and just exposition of the law on this subject; and, of course, it controls our judgment in this case.” Whether this would be so, if the relation of employer and employee had existed between these parties, it is unnecessary to decide. It must be observed that, upon the theory of the facts upon which we are now considering the case, no such relation existed. The company employed Dennis, and Dennis employed Fairfield. Dennis was not quitting the employment of the company, and certainly Fairfield’s- rights were not in .any sense superior to those of his employer. If the turning in <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>of Fairfield’s time was equivalent to an order upon the company to pay the amount, the acceptance of it, under the general usage and understanding, was an undertaking to pay at the regular pay-day, and not sooner. If Fairfield wanted his money sooner, he was obliged to look to his employer, and not to the company.</p>
