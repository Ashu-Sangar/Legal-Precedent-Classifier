The plaintiff, by the terms of the contract dated September 8, 1880, having warranted the pipe to stand the hydraulic pressure from the upper tank, the location of which he acknowledged in said contract lie knew, and the uncontradieted evidence showing that the pipe delivered under such contract would not stand said pressure and was wholly unfit for use in connection with said tank, and if the jury believe that he had notice thereof and was requested to remove the same, there can be no recovery in this case and your verdict should be for the defendants.</p>

      <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>Now, a mere technical failure on the part of the plaintiff to comply, would not defeat his right to recover. It must be a substantial failure, such as impairs, if not absolutely destroys, —impairs to a considerable extent, the value of the thing done, in order to defeat the plaintiff’s right to recover. You all understand very well that in an ordinary contract, perhaps for the construction of a house, there might be left out an unimportant part of it, and yet the person constructing it have a right to recover his pay. But, suppose there was a substantial departure from the contract, without right, a substantial and material failure to perform as he had agreed, then he could not recover. Just so this case stands here. If you find from the evidence, in the first place, that these defendants are liable as partners by reason of signing this paper and paying money or participating in this work; if you find that all of them have done that, then you would pass by that, and come to the other question. If you should fail to find that they were liable as partners, that they or any of them had not participated in this transaction in such a way as to make them liable, your verdict would be immediately for the defendants. [But if you pass that and come to the other question, then you inquire whether or not the plaintiff has substantially complied with his contract with these defendants. If you find that he has, then your verdict would be for the plaintiff for the amount of his claim and the interest upon it. But if you find that he has not, and that there has been a substantial failure to do as he guaranteed that he would do, his case falls.] 4 You have nothing to do with the effect upon him or upon any one. You are simply to determine from the naked evidence that has been given before you..</p>
