In an action for negligence against a street-railway company, the evidence showing that the plaintiff had mounted the step of a moving car, and, instead of passing within, remained on the step and was struck therefrom by a standing post, with the position of which he was familiar, he was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>

The car was moving slowly when the plaintiff got upon the step. He testified that seven or eight persons were then on the narrow platform, and he was prevented by their presence there from entering the car where there was abundant room for him, and was obliged to remain on the step holding to the platform rail. There was evidence that the plaintiff was familiar with the position of the post and its surroundings, and had repeatedly been warned about getting on at the place he did; also, that, after the plaintiff got upon the step, there was no difficulty in passing into the car; others had done so.</p>
