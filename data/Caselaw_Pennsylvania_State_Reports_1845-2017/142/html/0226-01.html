We permitted the plaintiff to give evidence that at a very early day, before the public school system of our state was created, there was an old log tenement upon this property; that the people in the neighborhood maintained a school there by subscription, as it was called; that this old log schoolhouse was the place to which the children of the people of the neighborhood were sent to be educated, until it became worn out, and that then a new building was erected upon this disputed one acre of ground, — not, indeed, upon precisely .the same foundation with the former one which it superseded, but seventeen feet remote, at one corner from where the <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>original building bad stood; that this building, in its turn, became insufficient for the purpose; that, finally, in 1871 or 1872, this plaintiff school district erected the structure which the defendants removed.] 8</p>

You must have observed that this evidence does not disclose the legal title to this disputed acre as being in this plaintiff school district. By the conveyance, as we have told you before, the title was lodged in the trustees. The evidence offered by the plaintiff was insufficient, as Mr. Rhawn, one of the learned counsel for the plaintiff, very well admits, to establish a title by adverse possession under what is commonly called by lawyer's the statute of limitations ; the reason being that there was not that continued, uninterrupted, visible, notorious, distinct and hostile possession required by the statute in order to confer title in that way. The plaintiff closed its case by giving the line of testimony such as we have indicated. The evidence of the plaintiff disclosed that the churches had possession, too, for schools.] 8</p>

They called witnesses to show who the beneficiaries were that are mentioned in the conveyance of November 4, 1822, from Henry Ehsher to these trustees, as “the union meeting and school house.” [This evidence undeniably establishes what was meant by the term “ union meeting and school house.” The uncontradicted evidence in the case is that the beneficiaries in this deed mentioned are the German Reformed and the Lutheran congregations, who worshiped in that portion of the township, in that neighborhood; they were the beneficiaries in the deed, and not all the people in the neighborhood. The fact is unquestioned that, before they erected their church building in 1833, these congregations, under the form of a “ union church,” as they then existed all through the German sections of the commonwealth, and as they exist in some localities within the state to-daj, were the legal beneficiaries under this conveyance, — the per sons for whose benefit and use these trustees under the Elsheideed held the legal title to this disputed acre of ground. It Is in evidence that in 1833 they built a union church on the north side of the lot, or across the road from this old log schoolhouse, and that during all these years they exercised dominion <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>and control over this schoolhouse property for church and school purposes.] 3 We do not know, according to my recollections of the evidence, the exact date when that old log building was pulled down and the new plank structure described by the witnesses was put up in its place; but we do know, and the evidence is clear and undenied, that in 1871 or 1872 this school district plaintiff did erect the new schoolhouse in question upon this disputed acre of ground, and the evidence is also clear that it was erected and paid for out of the school funds. The learned counsel for the plaintiff ask me to say that, if you believe these facts, they constitute such a license on the part of the trustees as would extinguish their legal title to this acre of ground, and would place it beyond the power of the beneficiaries under the deed to revoke the license.</p>
    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[256,1144,1184,1018]]]'>The law wisely provides that when one man desires to acquire from another title to real estate, he shall do it by a writing duly signed, sealed and delivered, and not by parol. This is a salutary provision of the law, and the general rule is that no man can acquire title to real property held by another, unless that other gives him the right by a writing duly executed. While this is true, there are certain exceptions. An easement or a license in land may lie, and often does lie, in grant, as -well as in parol. The statute of frauds and perjuries declares -that the instruments of ownership of real property must be in writing; yet, the object of the statute 'in making that requirement being to prevent the perpetration of fraud, the law in its wisdom provides that when one man has, by word of mouth or by verbal agreement entered into with his neighbor, induced that neighbor to part with his money or other valuable thing upon the faith of that promise or agreement, the bargain will be enforced notwithstanding the statute of frauds and perjuries. If the law failed to do that, it would bring about the very result which the statute of frauds and perjuries was intended to prevent.</p>

If the evidence in this case disclosed fairly and clearly that, before this school district expended a dollar in the erection and construction of this schoolhouse, they had consulted with the trustees named in the Fisher deed, or with their successors in office, and had <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>obtained tbeir consent to tbe expenditure of money in the erection and putting up of a schoolhouse on this disputed land, and had then proceeded to erect the building, then neither the present trustees nor the beneficiaries under the deed could revoke such license. [But, so far as this evidence goes, as I understand it, it discloses no more than this: that, whilst these churches were the owners of this land, they simply did not interfere to'prevent these people, the plaintiff, from going upon their land and putting up a house. I charge you that the burden of proof is upon the party who claims under a license to satisfy the conscience of the jury clearly and plainly by the weight of the evidence that he had such license.] 4 The claim of the defendants in the present case is that there is no such evidence. On the contrary, we have evidence that whilst this occupation was going on, on the part of the school district, they acknowledged they had no title. One of the witnesses, himself a school director at the time, says that as early as 1858 or 1859 they were trying to get title to this property; that they went to a certain justice of the peace, who was also a surveyor and a scrivener, to get him to make a deed, and that the justice said he could not make a deed because he had not the metes and bounds. In 1871 or 1872, according to the evidence of Fetterolf, a member of the board that built the schoolhouse in question, before they built it was appointed as a representative of the school board to consult the successors of the trustees or the officers of the beneficiary congregations under this Fisher deed, in order to obtain title to this acre; and he says that they refused to give title, that he reported their refusal to the board and that the board nevertheless went on and did erect this schoolhouse. Under this evidence, the court would not be justified in charging you that simply because the trustees under this deed knew or might have known the fact that the plain till’ was building on their land, and did not interfere nor interrupt the work, this was equivalent to granting the plaintiff an irrevocable license. Such is not the law; at best it could amount to no more than a license at will.</p>

Moreover, the case was properly withdrawn from the jury. The school district, plaintiff, had not proved any title to the property in dispute. The use tbat bad been made of it was permissive merely. Tlie one acre of ground was conveyed by Henry Fislier on November 4, 1822, in consideration of twenty dollars, to John Fisher et ah, “ trustees of union meeting and scbool bouse, and to tbeir successors forever, in trust, nevertheless, to and for the use, benefit, and behoof of the said meeting and scbool house.” The school district was not named in the deed as a beneficiary, nor was there evidence aliunde to sbow that it was intended as a beneficiary. Indeed, at that time there was no such school district, nor for many years afterward. Sucb use as the district made of the schoolhouse was, as before observed, permissive merely. So far from having any title to any portion of this one acre, the scbool district applied to the trustees in 1859, and again in 1871, to give them a title, and in each instance was refused.</p>
