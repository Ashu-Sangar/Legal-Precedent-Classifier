It is nevertheless particular, because it relates to a class created by the constitution itself, and was passed to carry out a constitutional mandate as to that class. In prescribing the compensation of county auditors in counties of that class, it is to be presumed that the legislature had regard to the peculiar duties which the act imposed upon them. These differ in some respects from the duties of auditors in other counties. Therefore, the reason for holding that the act <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>of 1887 was not a repeal by implication of tbe act of 1876, is quite as strong as if tbe latter were a local act.

The salary act of 1876 is unconstitutional, because the classification of counties made by it is not in harmony with the provisions of the organic law, or with the decisions of this court. The act goes beyond the constitution in making such a classification; it creates four classes of counties and formulates a schedule of fees for each of the first three classes, making no provision for the fourth. The only classification of counties to be sustained, is that recognized and sanctioned by the constitution itself, which contemplated that there should be but two classes, one having 150,000 inhabitants or more, and the other having less than that number: Morrison v. Bachert, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20Pa.%20330" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="112 Pa. 330">112 Pa. 330</a>; McCarthy v.

This court has refused to sustain an attempt to classify counties with reference to the number and geographical position of the cities contained in them: Scowden’s App., <a href="/pa/96/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="96 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="494621" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0422-01">96 Pa. 422</a>; Commonwealth v.

There is a wide distinction between the classification of cities, sustained in Wheeler v. Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20Pa.%20349" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="77 Pa. 349">77 Pa. 349</a>, and an attempt to expand the classification of counties made by the constitution itself.

Here are two apparently general laws which cover the same subject, to wit, the compensation of county auditors, and they cannot be reconciled. A subsequent statute revising the subject matter of a former one, repeals it to that extent: Martz’s Election, <a href="/pa/110/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="110 Pa. 502" data-case-ids="543742" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0502-01">110 Pa. 502</a>. The court below seemed to think that the act of 1876, having been passed in obedience to the “constitutional mandate,” should not be altered or changed, and should not be governed by the rules of construction applicable to other acts. Nevertheless, its provisions have been altered and reformed: Act of May 11, 1881, P. L. 21; act of June 13, 1883, P. L. 113; and it was intended to be changed, so far as the salary of auditors is concerned, by the act of 1887, the design of which was to make the salary of auditors uniform throughout the state, unless where some county or local law existed upon the subject. The act of 1876 is not a local law in .that sense ; it applies to all the counties of the state having the requisite population. There can be no difference whether the plaintiff’s .compensation be called salary or wages: Commonwealth v. Butler, <a href="/citations/?q=99%20Pa.%20542" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="99 Pa. 542">99 Pa. 542</a>; Ranck v.

L. 95, which fixes the compensation of county auditors at three dollars per day and mileage. It is not to be presumed, however, that the legislature intended the act of 1887 to. operate in counties where a salary had been fixed by the act of 1876, in obedience to the constitutional requirement. The act of 1887 contains no repealing clause; and, while the act of 1876 is neither a local nor a special law, for the reason that it applies to all counties of a certain class, and that class created by the constitution itself; yet its operation is confined to a limited number of counties, and we think comes within the reason of the rule laid down in numerous cases, that a general statute without negative words does not repeal a previous statute which is particular, even though the provisions of one be different from the other.</p>
