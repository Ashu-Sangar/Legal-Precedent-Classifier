The-question is confined to the meaning of what the testator has-said, and does not extend to the consideration of what he might have said but did not. The maxim, also, is fundamental, that' the heir or statutory distributee will not be disinherited except by express words or necessary intendment: Hancock’s App., <a href="/pa/112/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="112 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="546641" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0532-01">112 Pa. 532</a>; and hence, as a corollary, “he who does not claim by descent, must show a written title to himself. No intention in his favor can avail him that is not expressed in the written will. If the expressed intention is inadequate for his purpose, the law of the land and the title of the heirs must prevail, and all doubts about its adequacy must operate to his prejudice: ” Brendlinger v. Brendlinger, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Pa.%20132" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="26 Pa. 132">26 Pa. 132</a>.</p>

It seems no less clear that if the sister should die as the brother has done, without leaving children or issue, an intestacy as to the entire residuary trust-estate will be disclosed. The intestacy in this respect existed at the death of the testator, subject to being defeated by the vesting of the estate in persons capable of taking under the provisions of the will at the expiration of the life-estate. If a contingent remainder is created by deed, the estate, until the contingency has determined, continues in the grantor or his heirs; if the creation is by will, it continues in like manner in the persons entitled under the residuary clause or intestate laws, as the case may be, who stand in the place of the testator. It is quite immaterial, therefore, that until the time designated by the will, it cannot be known whether the remainder will take effect or not. If in point of fact it does not, the will to this extent has failed ab initio, and the distribution of so much of the estate as it does not dispose of, must necessarily be under the statute. The rights of the statutory distributee are fixed at the moment of the death of the ancestor, and no delay in the falling in of the estate or in the discovery of the fact that part of it passes under the statute, can take them away, even if the distributee should die before the dis<a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>covery. In case of such death, the representatives of the distributee will take his or her place. The law gives to the widow of one who dies without children or issue, one half of the personal estate, not disposed of by a will whose provisions she has accepted, absolutely. If the estate so passing consists of securities not beginning to bear interest until, say, five years after the husband’s death or beginning of the intestacy, and not maturing until a still later period, it could not be contended that, because of the widow’s death before the interest had begun to run, her executor or administrator was on that account not entitled to her share of the income when it did begin, and of the principal afterwards. If entitled to the principal she must be entitled to the intervening interest.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[212,1041,1165,809]]]'>That the widow’s rights, under the statute, in the personal estate of the husband, are not affected by her death before the maturity or realization of the portion of the estate to which they relate, seems so clear as to require no citation of authority; but the point has been expressly decided in numerous cases, some of which were cited by Mr. Parsons : Conger v. Barker, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Ohio%2015" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="11 Ohio 15">11 Ohio 15</a>; Armstrong v. Grandin, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20Ohio%20386" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="39 Ohio 386">39 Ohio 386</a> : Kingsbury v.

And Heginther’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=83%20Pa.%20339" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="83 Pa. 339">83 Pa. 339</a>, is a further illustration of the same principle. Of course, as a widow’s interest in real estate, under the statute, is restricted to her lifetime, her representatives would have no right to a share of rents falling due after a life-estate, created by the will, not terminating until after her death; but, in the case under consideration, the estate with reference to which the question arises, is personal property exclusively.</p>

The gift of interest is not to the brother and sister for life and the life of the survivor, nor is the principal, in its entirety, given to a class composed of the children, per stirpes, of the two; in case of such a gift, the whole, under well-settled principles, would go to such members of the class, even if they were all children of but one <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>of the tenants for life, as might be living at the determination of the life-estate. But the testator, with or without reason, has chosen to sever the fund and to make a distinct gift of one half of the interest and afterwards of a corresponding’ half of the principal to one class composed of the brother and at his death his children, and of the other half to another class composed of the sister and at her death her children; and there is nothing, whatever, which, under any circumstances, gives the share of one class, either of interest or principal, to the other. The proportion of interest to which the surviving tenant for life is entitled is not increased by anything provided in the will, by reason of the death of the other tenant for life without children; and the postponement of the distribution of the principal to the time of her death is only that she may have until then the advantage of half the interest of an entire fund, as in Wilen's App., <a href="/pa/105/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="105 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="454244" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0121-01">105 Pa. 121</a>, instead of the interest of half the fund, which might be less certain; but the intestacy, made apparent hy the death of the brother without children, extends to principal as well as income, though the distribution of principal, for the reason mentioned, cannot yet take place.</p>
