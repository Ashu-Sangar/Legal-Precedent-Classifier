Neither can we infer that White was the owner of any stock when this suit was brought; and, from the fact that H. E.

    <p id="b473-4" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[157,492,1167,656]]]'>The case seems to be this: Willard White believed himself the owner of the lands included in the deeds A and B, and, desiring the sale of them, he employed the plaintiff, Copeland, to procure a purchaser, agreeing to pay him the sum claimed in this suit. Copeland secured such a purchaser in the person of J. D. Potts, and thus, as between him and White, became entitled to the agreed compensation. It transpired that White was not, but the corporation defendant was, the owner of the lands, which company, without any knowledge of the agreement between White and Copeland, or of Mr. Copeland’s agency in procuring a purchaser, executed the deeds to Potts, pursuant to the contract White had made and was enabled to make by means of the procurement of Copeland.</p>

We are reluctantly brought to the conclusion that the law compels us to answer that question in the negative.</p>

    <p id="A59" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[273,711,1173,1063]]]'>We are of opinion that judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto was properly entered. The contract between the plaintiff and Willard White for a commission on the sale of the real estate was the individual contract of White, who at the time regarded himself as the owner of the property. It was not made on behalf of the defendant company, and was unknown to any of the stockholders until after the delivery of the deeds. The company could not ratify an act of which it had no knowledge. It appears from the agreement of facts, upon which the reserved point was based, that the deeds to Mr. Potts “ were executed by the president and secretary, in pursuance of resolutions authorizing it to bo done, passed at meetings held at Stoneham, as recited in them; that none of the persons present at the meeting knew of the arrangement between Mr. White and Mr. Copeland, or of the agency of Copeland in making the sale, but H. E. Norris, the secretary of the company, attended the meeting as the proxy of Willard White.” The case was argued as upon facts outside of those agreed upon, and upon which the judgment non obstante was based. This is a privilege which counsel sometimes take, but it is one in which we are not allowed to indulge.</p>
