Early in 1886, they began the erection of a largo pavilion of brick and iron, near Broad and Huntingdon streets, Philadelphia. At this time they had about $30,000 on deposit in the bank. It was foreseen by the managers of the club that this sum would be insufficient for their purposes, and application was made to the board of directors of the bank for such a loan as might be needed, in addition to the deposits already in bank, to construct the building mentioned. The subject was finally considered by the board at its last meeting in November, 1886. At that meeting, the plaintiff, John S. Stevens, a director of the bank, was present; also, John I. Rogers, treasurer of the Philadelphia Ball-Club, Limited, also a director of the bank. Mr. Rogers explained to the directors the resources of the club, and asked the board to authorize the president to make the necessary loans, without his applying to the board every time it became necessary to have a note discounted. The president, while satisfied with the security, objected to the obligations of a corporation, because their notes, being under seal, were objectionable to the banks, which did not like to take them. To this, Mr. Rogers replied that the ball-club did not want the banks to take its obligations, but that they proposed to pledge their deposits for the payment of their notes. No further conversation was had on the subject. The entire subject was referred to the president with power to act.</p>

The renewal note was a mere substitute to protect the same debt; when it was given the original note was surrendered. The two notes were therefore connected with and relate to the original transaction, which was a direct loan upon the security of the first note.

It was there held that a note of a corporation signed by its treasurer may be negotiable, although the corporate seal is attached. The court said: “ The only feature of this note that is referred to as importing an intent to create an obligation under seal, is the impression of the seal of the corporation on its face. The note would be perfect without this impression, being signed by the proper officer of the corporation. It is in the ordinary form of a negotiable <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>promissory note, with nothing beyond the mere presence of the seal itself to indicate an intention to give it any other character.

The expressions of our courts now indicate a substantial uniformity with the courts of all the other states, and there has been an evident aim to make them agree. The custom of merchants and the undoubted law has been accurately defined by the text books. The absence of an individual case in Pennsylvania may well be ascribed to the general recognition of the principle enunciated, that a promissory note issued by a corporation under seal, in form negotiable, is not open to any defence to the maker in tbe hands of an innocent holder for value.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b83-6" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[206,1499,1169,395]]]'>It cannot be doubted that it was the intention of the ball-club to issue an ordinary promissory note, and that this meant a negotiable instrument. This is evident from the language of the resolution passed by the ball-club on January 5, 1887, that, “ The chairman and treasurer be directed to execute the proper promissory notes for the instalments borrowed, and secure the same with a judgment note for the whole amount, $25,000.”</p>

Itogers to the president of the Columbian Bank, at the time negotiations for a loan were being carried on, in November, 1886, indicated an intention to give a non-negotiable instrument. We cannot attach such a meaning to the remark, in view of tbe language of the resolution passed by the ball-club and before quoted. In any event, if this note is negotiable, the defendant is estopped from interposing as a defence to recovery upon it, a mere conversation which took place between the representative of tbe defendant, the ball-club, and <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>the payee, the Columbian Bank; a conversation which resulted in no distinct agreement, and was substantially no more than an incidental observation in the negotiations for the arrangement of the loan.</p>

To hold the note non-negotiable would, we think, be inequitable and a step backwark in the progressive movement of commercial and of corporation law.</p>

    <p id="b85-9" data-blocks='[["BL_85.7",85,[225,1496,1166,297]]]'>The learned referee and the court below held that the note in question was negotiable. That it was so in form is not disputed. It was signed by the treasurer, and his authority to do so was expressly found by the referee. It was urged, however, that the fact that the seal of the Philadelphia Ball-Club, Limited, was attached, destroyed its negotiability.</p>
    <p id="b85-10" data-blocks='[["BL_85.8",85,[227,1801,1167,605]],["BL_86.1",86,[255,382,1172,504]]]'>The association was organized under the act of 1874, providing for the creation of limited partnerships. Such associations were referred to, in Oak Ridge Coal Co. v. Rogers, <a href="/pa/108/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="108 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="539251" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0147-01">108 Pa. 147</a>, as quasi corporations. They are certainly artificial bodies, not natural persons. Whatever may be the character of such associations, there is nothing in the act of 1874 which requires or authorizes them to use a common seal, as in the case of a corporation, nor is there anything to show that it had ever adopted a seal. The resolution authorizing the issue of the note in suit is as follows: “ The chairman and treasurer be directed to execute the proper promissory notes for the instalments borrowed, and secure the same with a judgment note for the whole amount, <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>$25,000.” Here was authority to issue proper promissory notes, which means, in the usual form of such instruments. There is not a word about a seal, and the seal appended was evidently not that of the officer who signed the paper, nor was it placed opposite his name. It was on the left-hand side of the note, over the body of the writing, and was a stamped device. As the association had no common seal, so far as the case shows, andas there was no instruction or authority to affix it, we must regard it as surplusage, and not as interfering with the clear intention to make the instrument negotiable.</p>
    <p id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[254,892,1170,655]]]'>We need not discuss the question of the effect of a seal upon instruments issued by a corporation, further than to say that in such cases the question of their negotiability depends to a large extent upon the purpose for which they were issued. As was said in Mason v. Frick, <a href="/pa/105/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="105 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="454312" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0162-01">105 Pa. 162</a>, in regard to coupon bonds: “ Presumptively the bonds were issued to raise money to construct the works of the company. It was a private corporation, and it put these bonds in the market for sale. The clear intent of the maker was that they should pass as negotiable paper.” In the case in hand, we think the intent equally clear that the note was intended by the maker to be negotiable. Even if we treat the device referred to as a seal, it does not show a contrary intent, nor destroy the negotiability of the note.</p>
