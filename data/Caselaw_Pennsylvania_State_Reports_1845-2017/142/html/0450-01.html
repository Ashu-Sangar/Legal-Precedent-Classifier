This argument applies with much force to a case where the certificate was lawfully granted, and the judge who granted it afterwards concludes that the purposes of the corporation are not beneficial to the community, and that he ought in his discretion to have refused it. But, if we had no lawful authority to grant this certificate, it is void, and it is now spread upon the records of this court; and we cannot agree that we have not the power to revoke, or strike off, a void judgment, decree, certificate or order. Moreover, we deem it our duty, on notice, to revoke any void judgment, decree or order, remaining upon our records, whenever our attention is directed thereto.</p>

The contention of the learned <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>counsel for the company is that this society is within the provisions of par. XX., § 2, act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 74, viz.; “ The maintenance of a society for beneficial or protective purposes to its members from funds collected therein.” An examination of the scheme or plan of this company, convinces us that this is not a society for beneficial or protective purposes to all its members, but it is a beneficial society to its officers, and a scheme to hand over the sum of two hundred dollars to a few of the first members who join, at the expense of those coming in later, and this on an investment of about fifty dollars by each of the fortunate low-number certificate holders. It is quite apparent that this can only continue so long as the treasury can be replenished by bringing in new members.</p>
    <p id="b480-6" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[240,1034,1184,1417]]]'>For example, start with four members, and, according to the scheme, when certificate holder No. 1 has paid five dollars for his certificate, and twenty monthly payments, which will amount to forty dollars more, and the small monthly dues, and five dollars for a new certificate, he can then draw two hundred dollars, as soon as there is that amount in the certificate or endowment fund. It is perfectly plain that No. 1 carries off about one hundred fifty dollars that was paid in by Nos. 2, 3, 4. The question now arises, how are the remaining three members to get their two hundred dollars each? If they keep on paying until another two hundred dollars accumulates in the endowment fund, No. 2 according to the scheme, takes this, and the same as to Nos. 3 and 4. But it is plain that this plan is much more beneficial to No. 1 than to any of the others. No. 2 has the advantage of No. 3, and 3 of 4. But what becomes of poor No. 4? He is certainly entitled to sympathy. It will not be difficult to convince him that he does not belong to a beneficial society. In reply, the inventors of this scheme say this is not a fair illustration ; we constantly receive new members, their payments will help raise funds to pay Nos. 2, 3, and 4, and so on ad infinitum. This is wffiere the vice of this beneficial society appears. Each member finds that his only hope for realizing his two hundred dollars depends on getting in as many new victims as possible. It should be noticed that this endowment fund is not to be invested, so as to earn or accumulate anything, but, as often as two hundred dollars accumulates in the treasury, the lowest, numbered certificate holder takes it, provided his preliminary payments have been made.</p>

      <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>It is very plain that each member who grasps the desired two hundred dollars gets about one hundred fifty dollars of money that never belonged to him and his investment never earned. It is equally plain that the time will come when new members cease to join, and the treasury will be empty, and a. large number o£ certificate holders will not get a cent, although they have paid their dues and assessments just as promptly as their more lucky associates, who have carried off their two hundred dollars each. And there is nothing in the world to prevent the low-number certificate holders from taking the two-hundred dollars each, and severing all connection with the company. It is said that they must take a new certificate before they draw their money. This is so, but they only pay five dollars for it, and when they have drawn their two hundred dollars apiece on an outlay altogether of about fifty dollars, they can well afford to throw the new certificate in the fire.</p>
    <p id="b481-5" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[137,1200,1175,657]]]'>Take another illustration. We have seen that it takes the assessments of four members for a period of more than twenty months to pay and retire certificate No. 1. Now, if it requires the assessments of four members for this length of time to pay No. 1, it will require the assessments of at least twelve more to pay Nos. 2, 3 and 4; and, as this company is said to have seven hundred members, it would be an interesting exercise in figures-for some beneficial society expert to calculate when the seven hundredth man will get his two hundred dollars, and how many members this company will need to bring in to provide the money for this man; and this calculation ought to be made on the theory that each man who grasps his two hundred dollars can, and probably will, sever all connection with the company.</p>

If this is so, the company has no legal existence whatever, and our certificate is being used to mislead and deceive the public; and, believing that it is our duty and that we have the power, we propose to revoke this certificate.

This is not good cause for the revocation of a charter: Chincleclamouche Lumber Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/100/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="100 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="498396" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0438-01">100 Pa. 438</a>. The assertion of the auditor that the association is beneficial to its officers, rather than its members, is certainly unwarranted by the facts.</p>
    <p id="b483-6" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[147,1203,1171,912]]]'>3. We submit that this is a beneficial association. Its purposes are, primarily, to provide benefits for its members in case of sickness or accident; and, secondarily, to give to them, in their respective turns, a benefit in the nature of a share in the distribution of the endowment or surplus fund. The latter is not its chief merit as a beneficial society, but it is a safeguard against malfeasance or embezzlement by officers, as it prevents the accumulation of any large fund. It is, we grant, an inducement to join the company, but it is a perfectly fair inducement. The member may be compelled to wait a considerable time for the maturity of his certificate, but all that time he is protected by an indemnity, at a very low rate, against sickness or accident. The provision that officers should not be certificate holders was adopted as a safeguard around the practical workings of the company. And all the arguments of the court below are based upon an assumption of “ dishonesty ” and “ fraud.” But there was no proof that any one was defrauded, and no member of the company had made any complaint.</p>

The matter was then referred to an auditor, who reported, inter alia, “ that the purposes and objects of the National Indemnity &amp; Endowment Company do not come within the first class of corporations, according to the provisions of the act of assembly of April 29, 1874, nor any of its supplements; ” and that the learned judge “ who granted the certificate erred in certifying that the purposes of said corporation were lawful, and not injurious to the community.” The court thereupon vacated its order of approval, and this appeal was taken by the company from said order.</p>
    <p id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[263,1100,1184,653]]]'>The appellant company claims to be a beneficial association, within the meaning of the ninth paragraph of § 2 of the act of 1874. Without going into detail, the auditor and the court below have sufficiently demonstrated that the only persons likely to be benefited by the scheme set forth in the charter are the officers themselves. It manifestly belongs to that class of associations, by far too numerous, the practical effect of .whose operations is to enrich a few at the expense of confiding and ignorant people. Such corporations are “unlawful and injurious to the community; ” and, in this age of deception and fraud, too much care cannot be exercised in scrutinizing the provisions of charters with sounding names and alluring schemes to benefit the public.</p>
    <p id="b484-7" data-blocks='[["BL_484.5",484,[270,1762,1175,349]]]'>We are in no doubt of the power of the court to revoke this alleged charter. It never was a charter. It was not authorized by any act of assembly, and is absolutely void. Had it been authorized by the act of 1874, it could only be reached by a quo warranto. But a void charter confers no rights, and the court below was justified in revoking the order which gave it an apparent validity.</p>
    <p id="b484-8" data-blocks='[["BL_484.6",484,[1270,2121,172,33]]]'>Affirmed.</p>
