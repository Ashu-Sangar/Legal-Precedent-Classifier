Espy, Esq., acting as attorney for George Lazarus, informed decedent that the aforesaid note was outlawed, and requested decedent to give George a renewal in some shape. Decedent acknowledged his indebtedness to George upon the note, and said “ that George was indebted to him for some rent, and he would indorse that on the note and make it good.” Pursuant to this understanding, decedent, on September 10, 1885, signed and gave to George Lazarus a receipt as follows: “ Received, Hanover, September 10, 1885, from George Lazarus, live hundred dollars, in full for rent to April 1,1886, the same indorsed on note dated March 21,1876.

The rule of law is laid down in Jordan v. Stewart, <a href="/pa/23/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="23 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="974025" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0244-01">23 Pa. 244</a>: “ When no disputed claim exists in relation to an interlineation in a deed or other written instrument, the presumption is that the alteration was made before execution; but when a contest exists, and the instrument is offered in evidence and the alteration is beneficial to the party offering the instru<a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>meat, it is not to be considered a forgery, but it is incumbent upon him to explain the alteration to the satisfaction of the jury.

    <p class="summary" id="b130-6" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[258,583,1175,1053]]]'>The testimony offered established the fact that the decedent in 1885, before the indorsement was made, and after notice that the statute barred a recovery, and that such indorsement would toll the statute and work a revival, distinctly acknowledged his indebtedness upon the note; and, subsequently, after the date of the indorsement, and of the receipt containing the alleged interlineation, declared to Mr. Espy that he had “ fixed the receipt for rent on the back of the note, and that ought to be sufficient; ’.’ that he “ had fixed that up satisfactorily with George by making that indorsement, and he ought to be satisfied.” He also declared to C. B. Lazarus, in the fall of 1885, “ that George had a note of $2,000, and that he had indorsed a year’s rent upon it, going to let it go on that note.” Throwing out of view everything but the testimony of Mr. Espy, and the note and receipt, (there being no positive evidence in disproof of the claim,) it is clear that the decedent was indebted to George Lazarus on this note in the sum of $2,000, and that he distinctly and unequivocally acknowledged the existence of the debt in the year 1885, both before and after the indorsement of $500 paid thereon. This acknowledgment is sufficient to remove the bar of the statute: Wesner v. Stein, <a href="/pa/97/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="97 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="444834" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0322-01">97 Pa. 322</a>.</p>

Lazarus, we think the auditor has come to a correct conclusion. Mr. Espy’s testimony is clear, distinct and positive that the decedent’s attention was directly and specially called to the note in question, by him as attorney for George B. Lazarus, and that he acknowledged the debt and also referred to the receipt on the note. Mr. C. B. Lazarus’s testimony is also very clear upon the subject, and of the same import. The testimony of these gentlemen is sufficient to toll the statute, without the written evidence produced; but we think their testimony also fixes the genuine<a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>ness of the indorsement on the note, and the receipt of September, 1885, with the last line added. The apparent interlineation is not a forgery, if the testimony of these gentlemen is to be relied upon, and we see no reason for rejecting it. Mr. Espy was not attorney for Thomas Lazarus when the conversation was had with him. The claimant had a right to call C. B. Lazarus, or any and all of the adverse parties in interest, to testify. The friendly relation existing between the two brothers goes only to the question of their credibility, and not to their competency to testify for each other. We believe the indorsement on the note is genuine, but alone it would not annul the statute, having been made long after the statute had commenced to run. The receipt of 1885, alone, might be considered doubtful evidence of the acknowledgment of the debt, but these, with the testimony of the witnesses named, are to us convincing beyond a doubt. There is no doubt about the genuineness of the original note, and not a spark of evidence is produced to show its probable payment in full.</p>

The master held there was a sufficient acknowledgment of the debt, and in this he was sustained by the court below. The case is exceedingly close upon the facts, and the writer is bjr no means sure that he would have reached the auditor’s conclusion had he been in his place. But it by no means follows that, because we think the auditor might have found the other way, we would be justified in reversing his finding, sustained, as it is, by the opinion of the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court. They are both in a better position to consider and decide questions of fact than we are, and we would not reverse merely because we would have sustained the finding had it been the other way.
