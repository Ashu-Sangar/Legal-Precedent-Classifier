Although the first section clearly includes her among cities of the third class, she has not accepted the act as provided for in the fifty-sixth, fifty-seventh and fifty-eighth sections, and therefore is not subject to its provisions: Reading City v. Savage, <a href="/pa/124/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="124 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="563054" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0328-01">124 Pa. 328</a>.

    <p class="summary" id="b225-4" data-blocks='[["BL_225.4",225,[172,702,1170,505]]]'>But .the act of May 1,1876, already cited, must be held to include her, although the word “ councils,” used in that act, properly applies only to a municipal legislature composed of two bodies or branches. All cities, except those of the first class, being expressly brought within the enactment, and the act relating to a subject-matter where classification is permissible, and the exclusion of Philadelphia free from objection, the act extends to Wilkes-Barre, as to all other cities of the second and third classes. Besides, it is to be noted that the act, by its title, is not a supplement to the act of 1874.</p>

That it is unconstitutional, which is the main objection, must be because it was so when passed, or was made so by the constitution of 1874. That it was so originally, cannot be maintained, in view of the numerous authorities which have sustained the frontage rule of contributory assessment in the built-up parts of towns and cities. As to the operation or effect of the new constitution upon this and other like acts of prior enactment, it must be admitted that general laws to supply their place, and better designed to subserve public objects and preserve private rights, should have been passed by the legislature.</p>

The limitations of this doctrine need not be here examined ; it is sufficient to say that unless the act of 1867 is shown to be plainly inconsistent with some immediately operative provision of the constitution, or has been displaced by subsequent legislation, it stands upon the same ground with other borough laws relating to Wilkes-Barre, which the charter of <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>the city continued in force, and which are still operative as city laws.</p>

The grant is in general terms and, upon an admissible interpretation of the word “regulate,” might confer power upon the council to direct a street to be paved at the expense of the city, or of the property owners along it. But if this should be admitted, it would still remain true that the city could exercise the very power in question, as to the paving of Franklin street at the expense of the lotowners thereon. As, however, the collection remedies, contained in the act of 1867, are wanting in the city charter, the place of the former act would not be fully supplied; and, as repeals by implication are not favored in law, we must upon the whole conclude that the charter, upon any acceptable construction, does not repeal or displace the act of 1867.</p>

But, in this case, the question is a mixed one of law and fact, and no conflict of evidence or contradiction of witnesses is involved. Its decision depends almost wholly upon a true construction of certain statutes, and the inferences or deductions to be drawn from certain proved or admitted facts. “ The weight due to a master’s or auditor’s report depends on the matter in question. When he reports facts directly proved by the witnesses, we are accustomed to give his report great weight, because of his superior opportunities of judging of the credibility of the witnesses and the effect of their testimony.

L. 841, power and authority were conferred upon the town council of the borough of Wilkes-Barre “to grade, pave or macadamize, in such manner as they deem proper, any street, court or alley of said borough, and upon completion thereof, to assess for contribution against the respective properties fronting or adjacent thereto, whether improved or unimproved, and the owners thereof, the pro rata cost and expense of said grading, paving, etc., in front of each respective lot or property, according to the front width thereof, to the middle of every such street, court or alley.” This act became part of the law governing the city upon its incorporation in 1871, and is in force still. The city of Wilkes-Barre, never having accepted the provisions of the act regulating the government of cities, passed in 1874 and 1889, is not subject to the provisions of those acts relative to the passage of ordinances in general or paving ordinances in particular, but, as to the power and authority of its corporate officers and the mode of exercising the same, is governed by its own charter. This proposition was fully discussed in our former opinion, and at this time we simply refer to the cases of Phœnix v.

The evidence taken before the master shows, as we intimated in our former opinion, that this is the ordinary case of the first pavement of a street within the compactly-built part of the city, but having, it is true, here and there vacant lots abutting on it.

The fact that the lots abutting on Franklin street differ somewhat in depth and value, does not of itself render the assessment void because of inequality.

The pavemezzt of a street at the expezzse of the frontage owners was not directly before the mind of the legislature when this act was passed, for at that time the borough authorities had not such power; nevertheless, notice and an opportuzzity to be heard, in such a case, are required by prizzciples of natural justice and are within the comprehensive terms and gezzeral purposes of the act.”</p>

Such is not the letter of the act, and we cannot agree that its purpose requires such a construction to be placed upon it. Before a complete ordinance for the pavement of a street at the expense of the abutters can be intelligently acted upon, many things must be taken into consideration, requiring special investigation which the council as a whole cannot well make. They must, in very many cases, obtain information both as to the general proposition and as to the details, through committees; and unless the legislature has expressly directed otherwise, a notice to appear before a committee to whom the matter has been referred, is equivalent to notice to appear before the council, as for this purpose the committee represents the council: Preble v.

What kind of pavement, under all the circumstances, should be selected? All these are questions upon which the property owner has a right to be heard, and concerning which it is important that the council, acting through the medium of its committee, should obtain as much and as early information as possible. No inflexible rule is prescribed for the citjr of Wilkes-Barre, under which the introduction of a formal bill must precede the reference of a general proposition like this to the appropriate committee for investigation. For the sake of mere formality of proceeding, this might be the better method; but, so far as the substantial purpose of notice and hearing is concerned, something can be said in favor of the hearing of the interested pro<a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>perty owners before tbe method and details of carrying out the proposed improvement have been precisely formulated in an ordinance.

Much less does it warrant the presumption that the committee did not meet at the time and place appointed.] 4 It is just as reasonable to presume that they met, and that none of the lotowners attended, or that none who attended offered any objections to the proposition, in which case a formal report would be unnecessary. [If presumptions are to be resorted to, it would seem more natural to presume that the committee did their <em>duty.]ls </em>If they did not meet or did not accord to lotowners a hearing, it was a very easy matter to prove; but not a lotowner asserts the fact, so far as we can discover, after a very thorough examination of the testimony.</p>

If this were a scire facias on a lien this might, to a certain extent, be true; but in a suit in equity to restrain the city from enforcing a lien for an improvement made pursuant to an ordinance perfectly valid on its face, it is not so. The plaintiffs allege-that the ordinance is illegal and void, because certain legal prerequisites were not complied with. The bill does not aver that the lotowners did not have notice of the proposition and an opportunity to bo heard, but that they did not have such notice <em>after </em>the introduction of the ordinance. We have endeavored to show that all that the act of 1851 requires, is notice of the proposition, and that this does not mean notice of the perfected ordinance. If this conclusion be correct, it is not clear that this part of the bill might not have been demurred to.

This important distinction between a proceeding to enforce a lien in a court of law, and a suit in equity to restrain legal proceedings upon a lien prima facie valid, is to be observed, not only in determining where the burden of proof lies, but also in determining, whether, even conceding that the plaintiffs might have a valid legal defence to an action at law, they have presented a case clearly entitling them to the exercise of the extreme power of a court of equity: See Pittsburgh’s App., <a href="/pa/118/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="118 Pa. 458" data-case-ids="556621" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0458-01">118 Pa. 458</a>.</p>

There would be force in this objection, if there were nothing to connect the two. We cannot agree, however, that they are to be treated as separate and independent propositions. We think the irresistible conclusion from the evidence is that the ordinance of February 2,1886, was the culmination of proceedings in the council upon the proposition to pave Franklin street with asphalt, which was first entertained in February, 1883, and although at times held in abeyance, was at no time wholly abandoned or permanently arrested. In arriving at this conclusion, we have- not overlooked the injunction granted in July, 1885, and the resolution of September 16, 1885, relative to a block-asphalt pavement; but, as we have already stated, the injunction went only to the contract, not to the ordinance or proposition pursuant to which it was made. The resolution referred to could not have misled any vigilant lotowner, for he must have known that the entertainment of a proposition to pave the street with block asphalt was not an abandonment of the proposition to pave with sheet asphalt, and that directing the committee to report an ordinance to pave the street with block asphalt did not bind the council to the adoption of the ordinance when it should be reported.</p>

Instead of tiie fact being that tbe lotowners were prejudiced by want of notice of the pendency of tbe proposition, we think, as is very forcibly argued by the city solicitor, that tbe effect of the delay was to give greater publicity to it, and to afford them a more extended opportunity to express their views and exert their influence upon the council concerning it; and an examination of the proceedings heretofore referred to at length will show that they availed themselves of it. It is true, as the learned master suggests, that the remonstrances and suit in equity show that there were many lotowners who did not acquiesce in the proposed action of the city council, and their case is not like those which decide' that a lotowner who has been instrumental in inducing tbe council to pass an ordinance and make an improvement of tliis kind, is estopped from denying tlie authority of tbe council: Bidwell v.

Whether those who signed the petition of September 19, 1885, in favor of a sheet-asphalt pavement would be estopped, we need not now inquire. Conceding for present purposes that they stand on the same footing as those who continue to object, the very acts which arc relied on as showing that the lotowners did not acquiesce in the action of the city council, show their actual knowledge that the proposition of which they had due formal notice in April, 1884, had not been abandoned, and that they opposed it during tbe year 1885, but upon other grounds than want of notice and opportunity to be heard. [ Having bad actual knowledge of tbe pendency of the proposition, and having objected to it upon other grounds, we are of opinion that they are now estopped from objecting that tbe notice of April, 1884, was too remote in point of time. To say the least, they are not entitled to equitable relief.] 15 To adopt tbe language of tbe court in Pepper v.

If the council had power to make the assessments for the proposed improvement on the basis of the valuations of the lots it would be highly important that the lotowners should be afforded an opportunity to be heard upon that question, but that is not this case. [The report called for by the act of 1876 was not the assessment, and did not bind the lotowner. It was for the information of the council, and the purpose of the valuation was to assist the council in forming a correct judgment as to the propriety of making the improvement at the expense of the frontage owners, and not to fix a basis for Che assessments.] 16 Under the law they were to be made according to <em>frontage; </em>and such being the case, we cannot see how the lotowners were prejudiced by the failure to give them notice of the time when their lots would be measured and valued, it not being alleged or even intimated that they were over-valued, or that there was any mistake made as to the frontage. If the measurements of the frontage were not correct, they will have an opportunity to show it on the trial of the scire facias : Pittsburgh v.

In order to act intelligently upon a proposition of this kind, it is desirable, if not absolutely necessary, that the city council should have in some form the information which the schedules, estimate and valuations required by the act of 1876 would give. Due deliberation and regard for the rights of those who are to bear the expense, would dictate to them the importance of obtaining such information either in detail, or substantially, even in the absence of a statute expressly requiring it; but, in order to make sure that it should be before them when the proposition should be finally acted upon, the legislature declared that the estimate, <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>map or plan and schedule should be made and attached to the ordinance before its passage. Compliance with the act made it impossible for the council or any member thereof to be deceived, for they had directly before them detailed information of what the proposition was and what would be the effect of their action upon it. Thus construed, the act became an additional safeguard against hasty and inconsiderate action of the council. But, having complied with the act strictly and literally, we have no warrant for declaring the ordinance null and void, upon any presumption that the council did not give to the information thus acquired due consideration, especially as the proposition had been the subject of discussion and active agitation for at least two years before.</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[202,1067,1176,1223]]]'>It is claimed, also, that without previous compliance with the act of 1876 there eonld he no proper hearing of the lot-owners. If they had deemed this essential in order to enable them to express an intelligent opinion upon the pending proposition, undoubtedly they would have included it in their objections. But they did not do so. On the contrary, it is evident that those wdio opposed the proposition did so with full knowledge that it was proposed to pave the street with asphalt, and to assess the cost upon their lots according to the-frontage rule. This has already been shown. It also appears affirmatively from the remonstrance of July 7, 1885, that tliey knew very nearly tbe cost per foot front. The amount of each one’s assessment was a matter of the simplest calculation, and the map and schedule would give them very little more information. Therefore, [even if they did not have sufficiently full information in April, 1884, which does not affirmatively appear, they had full knowledge before the final ordinance was-passed, ] 1'5’ and while they were actively objecting to tbe proceeding. [But, leaving these facts out of view, we can find-nothing in the act of 1876 to warrant tbe conclusion that compliance with its provisions must precede tbe hearing of the property owners.] 18 This might be desirable, but the act does not make it essential, and we have no right, under the guise-of construction, to make it an additional prerequisite.</p>

This proposition is so far-reaching as to require very careful consideration. The evidence shows that the city provided two books, one called the “ Resolution Book,” in which the resolutions were recorded, and the other called the “ Ordinance Book,” in which the ordinances were recorded. All the ordinances heretofore referred to as such were duly recorded in the latter book and published. Until about the beginning of the year 1886, the ordinance book was kept most of the time in the city office in the court house, where the council met and where the other books, records and documents of the city were kept, and, so far as appears, was always open to the inspection of the public and parties interested. The mayor had his office in the lockup building on Butler alley, about eight hundred feet away. It does not distinctly appear when the practice of keeping the book at the city office originated, but we think a fair explanation of the reason for so keeping it will be found in the testimony of Mr. Deitrick, the present city clerk. We make a single quotation from his testimony: “ Q. Now, to whom was the permission or consent given, to keep the ordinance book in the city office ? A. The book was kept there by permission and consent of Mayor Broderick. Mayor Broderick had no safe in his office, he had nothing to keep the book in. Mayor Broderick was in the office several times during his term when Mr. Jones was clerk. I heard him say to Mr. Jones that he had no place to keep the book; and, while he knew that the <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>city charter provided that the book should be kept in his office, he said, that as he had no safe Mr. Jones should keep the book there, and that as soon as he had a safe the book should be taken over, and it was done.” It is fair to say that some of his former testimony upon this question does not so clearly show the permission or request of the mayor; [but, taking the competent testimony as a whole, the legitimate inference is that when the book was kept at the city office, it was with the consent, if not at the express request of the mayor. To all intents and purposes he <em>Icept </em>the book at the city office for safety and without any detriment to the public.] 19</p>

Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20Pa.%20806" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="82 Pa. 806">82 Pa. 806</a>, construing the provision of the act of 1867, concerning the custody of the jury wheel and the keys, is somewhat analogous. The act of 1871 designates the custodian of the book, but does not designate the place where he shall keep it. Indeed, we can find no express provision in the act, relating to his having an office. [To declare that every ordinance passed during Mayor Broderick’s term, 1880 to 1886, is void because he did not keep the book in which they were duly recorded, all the time or most of the time, at his <em>office, </em>would be to introduce something into the act which the legislature did not put there.] 80 Now that a safe has been provided for the mayor’s office, we think he should keep the book there, and we understand this has been done since the beginning of 1886. We go further, and concede that, under existing circumstances, it is now a duty, which, if necessary, he might be compelled to perform by mandamus; but the law does not declare that the penalty for his failure to keep the book at a particular place shall be the nullification of the ordinances recorded in it, and duly published, and we do not think the legislature so intended.</p>
