L. 539. The supplement of April 2, 1872, P.

There are, however, two objections which seem to us fatal to the plaintiff’s claim. In the first place, while no objection to the location of the office is suggested, still it does not appear that any action of the city council as a body was ever taken or requested on the subject, and we need hardly remark that the suggestions of individual members of the council cannot take the place of such action. In fact, then, the selection of the office was the plaintiff’s individual and voluntary act; <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>and, even supposing that the duty of the receiver to obtain the approval of council, is sufficient ground for implying a legislative intent to create an obligation on the part of the city to pay the rent, such obligation is not an unconditional one, but the approval of council is essential to the creation of any liability. Under the referee’s interpretation of the charter, the city is interested, not only in the question of location, but of the rent to be paid, and is entitled to the deliberative judgmént of the designated tribunal upon those questions. It certainly never was contemplated that the supervisory authority of the city council might be ignored, and yet the city be bound either to the lessor or the receiver by a lease of such premises and upon such terms as he might deem wise. We do not intend by this remark to suggest that the plaintiff’s office is unsuitable, or the rent unreasonable, but to show the effect of holding that the approval of council is not essential to the creation of liability on the part of the city. The officer, although acting in entire good faith, or even the court and jury, cannot thus put themselves in the place of the council, to whose supervisory discretion the law has committed the matter.</p>
    <p id="b142-6" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[266,1408,1176,1007]],["BL_143.1",143,[192,376,1164,656]]]'>But further, we are of opinion that, as the charter does not expressly declare it to be the duty of the city to provide the receiver with an office, no legal obligation so to do can be implied from the nature of his duties, or from the fact, even conceding it to be so, that he is a city officer, or from the fact that the location of his office is made subject to the approval of the city council. He takes the office with all its burdens, and amongst these is the duty to “ have an office which shall be open during business hours for the receipt of taxes.” The legislature had complete supremacy over the whole matter, and could in its discretion require the receiver to keep his office in a certain ward, as in the act of 1871, or make its location subject to the approval of the city council, as in the act of 1872. Under the former provision, the city was no more liable for the rent than the county, or the school, or poor district. What greater reason is there for presuming such liability under the latter provision ? The manifest, and, so far as we can discover, the sole purpose of both was to prevent the location of the office in an inconvenient place, the latter simply giving a somewhat greater latitude of choice than was allowed <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>under the former. If it had been intended to make it the duty of the city to provide an office for the receiver, it seems to us clear that the legislature would not have left it to implication, but would have said so in direct terms. In the absence of such express provision, the presumption is that the commissions upon collections were deemed sufficient to repay his expenses and compensate him for his services. The adequacy of the allowance was for the legislature, and not for the court to determine. For these reasons, we conclude that the city is under no legal obligation to provide an office for the receiver, and therefore there can be no implied assumpsit to repay him the amount expended for rent, heat and light. The defendant’s second exception is sustained.</p>
    <p id="b143-5" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[183,1041,1173,1317]]]'>The plaintiff’s fifth, and the defendant’s first exceptions raise questions which may be considered together. The referee has allowed the plaintiff commissions upon amounts paid into the city treasury for permits to tap sewers, building permits and theatre licenses, although the money did not actually pass through his hands, upon the ground that the ordinances concerning licenses and permits entitled him to receive it. On the other hand, he has disallowed the claim to commissions on contributory assessments on street openings, the same not having been collected by the receiver and he not having performed any services concerning the same, upon the ground that such assessments are not within the meaning of the act of 1871, supra. In addition to what the referee has said upon the construction of the terms “ taxes, levies and public assessments,” as used in the act of 1871, we refer, without quoting them, to the provisions relating to the collection of such assessments contained in § 16, act of May 4, 1871, P. L. 539; § 1, act of April 2,1872, P. L. 740; § 2, act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 525; and § 7 of the act of April 5, 1867, P. L. 841. These provisions, prescribing as they do the specific mode in which the collection of these assessments shall be made, tend to show that the legislature did not mean to impose the duty upon the receiver; and, as no ordinance makes it his duty and no service was performed, the referee rightly held that he is not entitled to commissions on such assessments paid directly into the city treasury.</p>
    <p id="b143-6" data-blocks='[["BL_143.5",143,[226,2367,1122,44]],["BL_144.1",144,[255,378,1176,1824]]]'>We think it equally clear that the charter does not make it <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>the duty of the receiver nor give him the right, to collect the fees established by ordinance for theatre licenses, and sewers and building permits. These were ordained under the power to regulate, and not for revenue, and therefore cannot be regarded in this connection as taxes: See clause 19, § 27, act of 1871, supra; also city ordinances, titles, Amusements, Licenses and Permits; Johnson v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/60/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="60 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="1014396" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0445-01">60 Pa. 445</a>. If, then, the receiver is entitled to collect these fees and to compensation for the service, his right is derived solely from the ordinance. The provision of the charter allowing him commissions obviously has relation to such collections as the charter authorizes him to make. Conceding for a moment that, in addition, the city council could by ordinance appoint him to make the collections in question, still he cannot recover on a quantum meruit count, for no service was rendered by*him, nor under the ordinance, for it annexes no compensation to the dutj7 or appointment. The general doctrine upon the subject of the compensation of municipal officers is so clearly stated by Judge Dillon that we are constrained to quote from his work at .some length: “ There is no such implied obligation on the part of municipal corporations, and no such relation between them and officers which they are required by law to elect, as will oblige them to make compensation to such officers, unless the right to it is expressly given by law, ordinance or by contract. Officers of a municipal corporation are deemed to have accepted their office with knowledge of, and with reference to, the provisions of the charter or incorporating statute relating to the services which they may be called upon to render, and the compensation provided therefor. Aside from these, or some proper by-law, there is no implied assumpsit on the part of the corporation with respect to the services of its officers. In the absence of express contract, these regulate the right of recovery, and the amount: ” 1 Dillon on Mun. Corp., § 169. For these reasons the defendant’s first exception must be sustained. The remaining exceptions filed by the plaintiff are dismissed for the reasons contained in the referee’s report.</p>
