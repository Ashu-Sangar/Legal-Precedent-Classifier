On the part of the lien creditors it is urged, however, that the reasoning of this and kindred cases is no longer applicable, since the passage of the act of April 7, 1870, P. L. 58, which gives a remedy by fieri facias instead of sequestration, as under the act of June 16, 1836, § 72, P. L. 755.</p>
    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[279,904,1167,344]]]'>It is undoubtedly true that the franchises and corporate property of a corporation, not being a county, township, or other public corporate body, can now be sold under a fieri facias, and that a creditor need no longer apply for a sequestration; but the difficulty in the plaintiffs’ way, in this case, is that there is no execution process to which he can resort under either of the above cited acts, and hence his lien is of no avail.</p>
    <p id="b636-6" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[275,1260,1168,590]]]'>Prior to the act of 1836 a creditor had no remedy to enforce his claim against the franchises or property of a corporation, in its nature public, necessary to its corporate existence, as was shown by C. J. Tilghman in Ammant v. Turnpike Road, 13 S. &amp; R. 210, in which case he expressed his regret that such was the law, and recommended some mode of sequestration. No doubt his remarks led to the passage of the act of 1836, by which a proper remedy was provided. Under that act, when an execution against a corporation had been returned unsatisfied, in part or in the whole, the plaintiff in the judgment could petition for a writ to sequestrate the goods, etc., of a corporation.</p>
    <p id="b636-7" data-blocks='[["BL_636.6",636,[272,1869,1170,551]],["BL_637.1",637,[192,389,1166,757]]]'>By the act of 1870, § 1, P. L. 58, it was provided that in addition to the provisions of the seventy-second section of the act of June 16, 1836, and in lieu of the provisions or proceedings bj sequestration under said act, the plaintiff might have execution by fieri facias, etc., by which the property, franchises, rights, etc., of a corporation could be sold. It has, however, been held by Judge McCandless, of the United States Circuit Court, in Fox v. Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Phila.%20639" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Phila. 639">8 Phila. 639</a>; by Judge Mitchell, in Flagg v. Farnsworth, 12 W.

This view of the cáse seems also to have been adopted by C. J. Thompson, in Phila. etc. R. Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/70/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="70 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1028192" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0355-01">70 Pa. 355</a>, and by Judge Simonton, in Commonwealth v.

As opposed to this view, we have the decision of Judge White, in Williams v. Railway Co., <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pitts%20L.J.%20187" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="21 Pitts L.J. 187">21 Pittsb. L.

There appears to have been no attempt to comply with the provisions of the act of April 7,1870, and then adds, “We need not discuss the question whether a return of nulla bona should have preceded the levy and sale upon the fieri facias. If necessary, which we do not assert, it is but an irregularity,” etc.</p>
    <p id="AAo" data-blocks='[["BL_637.4",637,[194,1154,1167,1008]]]'>After a careful reading of these apparently conflicting decisions, we agree with Judge McDermitt, that “as this fieri facias is -in ‘ lieu ’ of sequestration, it is reasonable to presume that the legislature intended its aid should be called into action by the same precedent return of nulla bona, which was absolutely necessary before a writ of sequestration could be obtained by any creditor under the act of 1836.” If this position is correct, then this lien cannot be sustained; for, as was said by Judge Lowjjie in Williams v. Controllers, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20277" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="18 Pa. 277">18 Pa. 277</a> : “ Where there can be no execution, there can be no action ; and, as a levari facias is the only execution proper on a judgment on a mechanics’ lien,” there eannot be a return of nulla bona on a fieri facias; and, therefore, nothing upon which to base the fieri facias, allowed by the act of 1870. The principle laid down in Foster v. Fowler, <a href="/pa/60/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="60 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="1014462" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0027-01">supra,</a> was recognized in Girard Point Storage Co. v.

As before the passage of the act of 1870, this lien would not have been good, and as it is not helped by that act, the plaintiffs must resort to some other remedy to enforce their claim.</p>

L. 73, and its powers, privileges, and duties are defined by the thirty-fourth section thereof. It is clothed with the right of eminent domain, and it is protected from competition until it “shall have from its earnings realized and divided among its stockholders, during five years, a dividend equal to eight per centum per annum upon its capital stock.” It is bound to furnish a sufficient quantity of pure water at reasonable rates, and the Court of Common Pleas of the proper county may, on the petition of any citizen using the same, make 'such order in the premises as may seem just and equitable, and enforce its decrees by the usual process. It may, at the expiration of twenty years from its introduction of the water, be required to transfer to the municipality in which it is located its works at their cost, with ten per cent thereon, less the dividends it has received. This partial summary of its powers and duties clearly stamps it as a public corporation. It was decided in Foster v. Fowler, <a href="/pa/60/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="60 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="1014462" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0027-01">60 Pa. 27</a>, that the structures necessary to the operations of such a company are not subject to a mechanics’ lien ; and the present case is ruled by it, if the act of April 7, 1870, P. L. 58, which allows the personal, real, and mixed property, rights and franchises of a corporation to be sold on a writ of fieri facias, does not supersede it. It is contended that the act referred to has rendered the reasoning on which the decision in Foster v. Fowler, <a href="/pa/60/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="60 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="1014462" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0027-01">supra,</a> rests, and which is undoubtedly sound, inapplicable ; and our sole inquiry is whether this contention is well founded.</p>

Southwark Foundry Co., <a href="/pa/105/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="105 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="454223" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0248-01">105 Pa. 248</a>, where a mechanics’ lien was sustained on the ground that the public was not directly interested in the business of the defendant corporation. In that case, it was conceded that if the Girard Point Storage Company was in the nature of a public corporation, its works would be protected from the encumbrance of a mechanics’ lien. The case was heard in 1884, and this concession is evidence at least that it was not then suggested or supposed that the act of 1870 could have any part in the decision of it, nor can we now see how that act affects the claim of the appellants to a lien for their work and materials. The only execution process allowed for the enforcement of a mechanics’ lieu is a writ of levari facias to sell the building and curtilage bound by it, and the form of the writ is prescribed by the statute which gives the lien. The levy and sale on the writ of fieri facias allowed by the act of 1870 may embrace the property, franchises, and rights of the corporation in any and every county of the commonwealth, and pass the title thereto as effectually as if “ said property, franchises, and rights were located, used, levied upon, and sold in the county wherein said writ of execution was issued.” It is obvious that such comprehensive process was not designed for the collection of a judgment founded on a mechanics’ lien. This lien is statutory, and in the procedure for its enforcement the judgment and execution are restricted to the property bound by it. It is the policy of the law to keep intact the property belonging to and essential to the operations of a public corporation, and hence its creditors will not be permitted to divide such property and sell a part of it. It would be a signal abandonment of this policy, and it would invite a division of the property, to allow it to be sold on mechanics’ lien process. This could <em>not be done </em>prior to the act of 1870, and we discover nothing in that which authorizes it. The fieri facias allowed by that act is not a substitute for the ordinary fieri facias under the seventy-second section of the act of June 16, 1886, but it is in lieu of sequestration under the seventy-third section of it. The process and procedure provided by the seventy-second section remain, and the process provided by the seventy-third section is superseded by the special fieri facias given by the act of 1870. The condition <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>precedent to sequestration was an ordinary fieri facias, returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, and this must precede the writ which takes its place. By this precedent return on the ordinary fieri facias the insolvency of the corporation is discovered, and the necessity of recourse to a sale for the benefit of its creditors of its franchises and property essential to its operation is demonstrated. It was decided in Bayards App., <a href="/pa/72/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="72 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="434617" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0453-01">72 Pa. 453</a>, that a sale on the fieri facias given in lieu of sequestration did not change the rule of distribution, but that its proceeds were for the benefit of all its creditors, and on the footing of moneys made by a sequestrator under the act of 1836. The proceeds of a sale of real and personal property under the seventy-second section of that act were applicable to the liens in their order.</p>
