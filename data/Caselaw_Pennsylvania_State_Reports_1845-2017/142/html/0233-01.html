Klein, speaking of the agreement of Enlow, which was to furnish Moritz a team of horses, etc., necessary for country peddling, he to pay $2 per week for their use, etc., says: “ The use of such a word as furnish, vague as it is in its signification, would leave the clause in which it occurs of ambiguous import, if there were nothing besides to indicate the sense in which it was employed. It might imply a sale, a lease, a loan, <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>a gift, or a delivery of a chattel in payment of a debt, in accordance with its context and its subject matter. As used here, it was the manifest intention of Enlow to place certain personal property belonging to him in the possession of Moritz, for the use of which weekly payments were tq be made by the latter, and the ownership of which was to vest in him when, and only when, those weekly payments should have been made two hundred times.” No present interest was created in Moritz by this agreement, so as to make the property subject in his hands to the claims of execution creditors. Yet, as to the principle of this case, the Supreme Court say they will stop right where it ends; that it and Rowe v. Sharp stand on the border land, and are very close cases. We may accept this view and add, they are only to be followed upon like or similar facts. ' The principle of these cases is not to be extended beyond the domain of facts upon which they were decided and upon which alone they are to be considered authority.</p>

If not so understood, then it is certainly in conflict with all the cases upon the law of bailment, which is predicated of a return of the property at the expiration of the term, and is so held in Stephens v. Gifford, <a href="/pa/137/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="137 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="821489" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0219-01">supra.</a></p>

The price of the saw-mill was to be $1,500. “ According to the form adopted” by A. B. Farquhar, this was to be paid in two payments of $750 each, first payment in six months, and second payment in twelve months, which is termed “ hire ” in the order and lease, but it is to bear interest from date of delivery of saw-mill, and to be. secured by judgment exemption bonds. Hamer was also to pay the freight from York, Pa., in “ addition to the price.” The machinery was to be warranted as per manufacturers’ warranty, a copy of which was sent with the papers. All these terms are inconsistent with a lease of the property. The whole transaction is consistent with a condi<a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>tioual sale and with a sale only. The attempt to disguise it under the cloak of a bailment is too apparent, and it is as weak as apparent. There is no principle of law better settled in Pennsylvania than that a sale and delivery of personal property, with an agreement that the ownership shall remain in the vendor until the purchase money is paid, enables creditors of the vendee to seize and sell the same for the payment of his debts: Brunswick Co. v. Hoover, <a href="/pa/95/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="95 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="492935" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0508-01">95 Pa. 508</a>. This case rules the case under consideration. It is very much like it upon the facts, and in it the same attempt was made to cover up a conditional sale with the disguise of a bailment; a disguise, the court say, “ too clumsy to have the merit of being clever.” Thus holding the law, it follows that the motion for a new trial must be overruled, which is accordingly now done.</p>

If we concede they were improperly received in evidence, they did the plaintiff no harm. The learned judge below ruled the case upon, the construction of the article of agreement, and not upon the letters. He held that the paper called a lease, by which Solomon Hamer agreed to hire the engine and boiler from A. B. Farquhar, the plaintiff, was a conditional sale, and subjected them to execution and sale on the part of Hamer’s creditors. The construction of this paper was a question of law for the court, and the learned judge ruled it correctly. It is true, it was claimed to be a lease and the transaction a bailment, but it was not even so in form. It lacked the essential feature of a bailment, viz., a stipulation for a return of the property at the end of the term, in which respect the case differs from Rowe v. Sharp, <a href="/pa/51/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="51 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="999837" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0026-01">51 Pa. 26</a>, where there was an express stipulation for the return to the bailor of the property at the termination of the bailment. It is of the essence of a contract of bailment that the article bailed be returned, in its own or some altered form, to the bailor, so that he may have his own again: Benjamin on Sales, 6; Stephens v. Gifford, <a href="/pa/137/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="137 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="821489" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0219-01">137 Pa. 219</a>. Enlow v.

The case in hand comes directly within the ruling of Stadtfeld v. Huntsman, and the agreement was clearly a conditional sale.</p>
