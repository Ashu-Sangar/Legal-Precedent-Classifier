What he claims is, that the survey made for Mead on October 31,1864, adopted the east line of the plaintiff’s survey, as marked on the ground, for the west line of the Mead survey; and that Mead’s accept<a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>anee of a patent pursuant to the survey was an abandonment to the commonwealth of the strip in dispute, and by relation made good the prior grant of the commonwealth to the plaintiff. Assuming this to be the law, it does not avail the plaintiff, because there is no sufficient, if any, evidence that the marked east line of the plaintiff’s survey was adopted as the west line of Mead’s. It is probably true that in making the Mead survey the surveyor supposed that the west line would be identical with the line that a short time before he had, apparently through mistake, marked as the plaintiff’s east line; but he did not so return it, and in the absence of proof to the contrary, and after so long a time, we must presume the lines of the Mead survey were run in accordance with the survey as the same was returned to the land office; and this, we think, calls for plaintiff’s true east line, and not for one marked by mistake eighteen to twenty-two rods south of the east line.

Hence, we now find that in 1870 and 1871 the land of the plaintiff was assessed to him on the seated list as one hundred acres, ten improved, and such taxes were paid; that the treasurer’s sale to William Crull in June, 1872, did not divest the plaintiff’s title to any of the land of which he was previously the owner; that the survey made for the plaintiff in August, 1864, and the marking the east line of that survey at a point eighteen to twenty-two rods east of the plaintiff’s <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>true line, was a mistake occasioned by following the description in the deed from the committee of E.

There is no evidence that shows or tends to show that the plaintiff, or the surveyor, intended to embrace in the survey of August, 1864, any more land than the plaintiff then owned, or that Mead or the surveyor intended to include in the survey of October, 1864, any less land than Mead then owned.
