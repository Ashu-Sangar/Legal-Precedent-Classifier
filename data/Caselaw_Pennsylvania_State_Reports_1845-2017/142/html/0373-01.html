The partition was so proceeded in that the premises were subdivided into several allotments, all of which, under the order of the said court, were subsequently sold for prices amounting in the aggregate to §205,200. When the sale came up for confirmation in the Orphans’ Court, Richard Wistar, the defendant in this case, presented his petition, setting forth his interest as an heir at law of Richard Wistar, deceased, and praying the court that the sale might be set aside, and that he should be allowed to take the several allotments at the valuation fixed by the inquest. His petition was refused, and he thereupon, on June 20, 1888, filed the usual affidavit, and entered into recognizance of bail, with security in the usual form, for an appeal to the Supreme Court. The amount of the recognizance is not given, but it was conditioned according to the fifty-ninth section of the act of March 29, 1832, P.

Certainly not. The appeal suspended the order for permanent security, but the legislature has directed the Orphans’ Court to demand as a substitute for it security ad interim; and this was intended undoubtedly to secure the appellees against intervening waste.

Security was first entered in $100, but afterwards the Orphans’ Court increased the amount of security required to $50,000.

To hold that in either or any of such cases the unsuccessful appellant might be held liable in damages in an action upon the recognizance to each and all of the persons interested, for the interest accruing during the pending of the appeal as damages for the appeal, would be a monstrous wrong, and would operate in many cases as an absolute denial of justice.

The plaintiffs there, as here, contended that such damages were the natural, proximate, and orderly result of the writ of error; “ otherwise,” they argued, “ an owner of property is helpless against an irresponsible person in the wrongful use and occupation of his premises, as by merely purchasing a writ of error, and discontinuing it when reached for argument in the Supreme Court, he may occupy the premises for the intervening time without payment of rent.” But this court held that the recognizance, although the plaintiff in error did not prosecute his writ of error with effect, <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>did not bind the obligors to pay the rental value of the premises during the pendency of the writ of error; that such damages, not being included in the judgment, nor awarded upon the writ of error, were within neither the letter nor spirit of the condition stated in the recognizance.</p>
