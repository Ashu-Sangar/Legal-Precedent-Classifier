L. 32, and in due course was brought within the provisions of the general borough law of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320. In 1882, the council adopted an ordinance for the regulation of the streets and sidewalks, and subsequently, by the employment of a competent engineer, established a system of grades and levels defined and marked in an official grade-book adopted. In the same year, after the promulgation of the ordinance and the establishment of the system of grades and levels, a street in front of plaintiff’s lot, whereon he had put up a dwelling in 1881, was graded and paved. In September, 1886, there was an overflow of surface water into the plaintiff’s cellar, occupied by him as a saloon, by reason, as was alleged, of the negligent construction and maintenance of a drain for the surface water, from the gutter in front of plaintiff’s lot, through a “sump” to the sewer beneath.</p>

The sewerage of the borough was constructed with a sump or with seven sumps, as they are called — openings to the sewer from the gutter on the top. The sump opens from the gutter, carrying the water along the surface and down into an underground pipe. It has <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>been testified to here, and not disputed, that the opening to that sump near where this accident occurred was eighteen inches by twenty, or about that size, where the water passes under a covering of stone above the open gutter on the street, and drops directly down into the pipe. The openings on the sides of the sump — on either side of the stone covering, ás I understand the testimony — are eight inches high from the gutter, and about three feet wide or between two and three feet wide. There has been some testimony, and it is alleged here on the part of the plaintiff, that because these openings were not grated or screened, — that is, were not covered by an iron grate or screen, — therefore that was carelessness or negligence on the part of the borough authorities. There has been, to our knowledge, no evidence, nor any law, that we have so understood, quoted to show that the fact of not putting up grates to the interstices or openings to this sump is of itself negligence. It is a question of fact for you, gentlemen, under all the circumstances of the ease, <em>bringing </em>to this case such knowledge as you have of such existing circumstances; and, under the evidence in this case, it will be for you to decide whether that was negligence, or whether a grating or screen placed at that opening, or at those openings, would not choke it up more readily than to leave it entirely open as it was. It seems to us that that is a question to be submitted to you, under all the evidence in the case.</p>

It is also alleg’ed here, on the part of the defendant-borough, that if that sewer was sufficient to carry and take all the water, the surface water, from the street, in ordinary and usual showers and storms, and if this storm of the 28th of September, 1886, the one especially complained of and which brought the parties to this litigation or induced the plaintiff to bring suit, was an extraordinary and unusual storm, then the defendant is not liable; while the allegation on the part of the plaintiff is that the borough is liable, if the sump and sewer were not of sufficient capacity at that time to carry away the surface water.</p>

An extraordinary storm would be one described as an unusual water-flood or storm of a character not to be foreseen, which persons of ordinary observing capacity would not anticipate or expect to occur; such are exceptional floods and storms. The borough, in constructing its sewer for the carrying away of the surface water, was in duty bound to take into consideration, not only the ordinary and usual quantity of water in ordinary times, but also the liability to storms occasionally occurring or likely to occur; and, if they did so provide, and if then an unusual and extraordinary storm, whereby the whole immediate country around was overflowed and flooded — and which by the exercise of ordinary prudence, could not be provided for or guarded against — occurred, and if damage accrued to the plaintiff by reason of such disastrous extraordinary Storm, the borough would not be liable, the law only holding <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>it liable for the exercise of ordinary care and prudence, for failure to exercise ordinary care and prudence.] 7 . . . .</p>

To bring home notice to the corporate authorities, or to the municipality, of a defect in a sewer, it is not sufficient to report the defect to a member of the borough council. Notice must have' been given to the street commissioner or other person having supervision of the sewers, or to the president and the secretary of the town council; or else, to charge the municipality with constructive notice, it must be shown that a sufficient length of time had elapsed between the time of the stopping up of the sewer and the time of the occurrence of the injury, to enable the borough authorities by the exercise of reasonable diligence to have discovered the defect and repaired it.

If the town authorities exercised the best judgment they had upon the subject; knowing the situation, being familiar with the locality and with the usual variety of storms and amount of rainfall that were likely to come in the ordinary course and character of the weather, — if they exercised the best judgment they had under the circumstances, then the borough would not be liable, even if the sewer proved insufficient at first to carry off the surface water; but if, after having knowledge that the sump and sewer were insufficient or were stopped up, they neglected or refused to repair it or to put it in proper condition to carry off the surface water, as to that we have airead}1- instructed you.
