I bequeath to my sister, Charlotte, wife of my brother, ffm. R. Sweitzer, deceased, all my household effects, except the silver, during her lifetime, at her death to be divided between the children of my brothers, Bowman and Nelson. After my household effects, I bequeath hne tenth of all I possess to charitable objects, as follows: one fourth each to Diocesan Missions, Domestic Missions, Foreign Missions, and' to the education of young men in the ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church, so called now (or by whatever name hereafter called), to minister in the diocese of Pittsburgh. In this bequest, I desire first to provide for St. John’s Church, West Brownsville. This, being the first mission work I engaged in after my confirmation, has always been very dear to my heart. The rest or nine tenths of my available stocks I bequeath to my sister, Charlotte, during her lifetime, after her death to be divided equally between the children of my brother, Nelson B. Sweitzer. The silver plate that belonged to my sister, Anna J. Cowell, also all the spoons that belonged to my grandparents, I wish put into a neat, substantial, communion service, to be given to Christ Church, as a memorial to my sainted parents, Henry and Ann Sweitzer, and her babe, also dear brother Will. The tankard to my parents, the chalice and patten to sister Annie and brother William R. Sweitzer. The alms-plate to little Harry. In addition to the above named silver, I will add the gravy spoons of my dear mother’s set, and silver butter boat given me by my Aunt Taylor. The silver marked with parent’s name, I bequeath to my niece, Mary Sweitzer. The dozen teaspoons marked A. E. S. to my niece, Annie Duncan. To my brother, Bowman, the silver cream urn that belonged <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>to my grandparents, to be given to Bettie Park, at his death. To my dear friend and former pastor, Rev. H. E. Hayden, in consideration of his kindness to my dear mother, and since her death to myself, I bequeath the sum of $500, to be given at the time of my death, or from the first dividend accruing thereafter. I also bequeath $500 to be appropriated to a stained-glass window, or a brass memorial to my grandparents, Jacob and Isabella L. Bowman, to be placed in Christ Church, Brownsville. My real estate I wish sold at a propitious time, and divided among my nieces and nephews, for their use during their lifetime, at the death of each one to be appropriated to charitable objects, as above named. Should my real estate, etc., at any time (mining stock, etc.,) amount to over $50,000, I bequeath the over amount to charitable objects; if it should be deemed advisable by the Bishop of the diocese of Pittsburgh, to use for the support of St. John’s Church, West Brownsville; if not, to be used for the building of an orphans’ home; and also, in connection with the above, a home for aged clergymen of the diocese of Pittsburgh. My lot and house adjoining St. John’s Church, West Brownsville, I bequeath to said church, to be used for, or sold and the money appropriated towards a rectory for St. John’s Church.</p>

Sweitzer, deceased, all my household effects, except the silver, during her lifetime,” etc. She next provides that “ After my household effects, I bequeath one tenth of all I possess to charitable objects,” and names those objects. Then follows the clause over which the contention arises, viz., “ The rest or nine tenths of my available stocks I bequeath to my sister Charlotte, during her lifetime, after her death to be divided equally between the children of my brother, Nelson B. Sweitzer.”</p>
    <p id="b569-12" data-blocks='[["BL_569.11",569,[168,1823,1169,499]]]'>The heirs would construe this clause without regard to the other provisions in the will, and as if it read simply “ nine tenths of my available stocks,” and would interpret stocks to mean only shares of stock in incorporated companies; while the legatee would read it as if written “the rest” <em>of all I possess, </em>“or nine tenths of my available stocks,” and would hold the latter part of the clause to in no wise limit or restrain the force of the words “the rest,” beyond excluding unprofitable stocks, and, at the most, to be but a defective enumeration of what was intended to be embraced in the gift.</p>

Both the legatee and heirs have excepted to this distribution; the former because (1) the auditor did not include in her share nine tenths of the notes; (2) because he ruled out certain testimony; and (3) because he did not find her to be entitled to all the personalty not specifically given away by the will; and the heirs except to Mrs. Sweitzer taking anything beyond nine tenths of the shares of the available stocks of corporations.</p>

For, if stock be held to mean only shares of corporation capital, as the heirs contend is the ordinary acceptation of the term and the sense in which it was used by the testatrix, then all the bonds, notes and cash, aggregating nearly twenty-five thousand dollars, are excluded from this gift and nowhere else disposed of in the will, and this legatee gets only the dividends for life on some twenty-eight hundred dollars worth of corporation shares, while the heirs, for whom the will makes no provision, take absolutely the large amount aforesaid. Or, if the interpretation given by the auditor be correct, and stocks are held to include both government and corporation bonds, the testatrix yet died intestate as to the notes and cash, together amounting to about thirty-four hundred dollars. The one tenth given to charity, however, has not been deducted from the above aggregate, so that had that gift been effectual the intestacy in the former case would amount to over twenty-two thousand dollars, and in the latter to over three thousand dollars. An examination of the will should enable us to discover the intent of the testatrix, and to determine what property is thereby disposed of, and whether there really existed intestacy as to any. And what securities would pass by a gift of stocks, it is not necessary to decide, unless we find this bequest limited to “ available stocks.”</p>

Both the language employed and the care evidently exercised in regard to the comparatively trifling items of her personal estate, disprove any idea of intestacy, and particularly as to any such considerable portions of property as the bonds, notes or cash.</p>

Throughout the instrument she calls her “ my sister,” not sister-in-law, and clearly evinces her fondness for her. And, on the third point, she names her heirs, her brothers Bowman and Nelson, in her will, the former twice, the latter three times, makes Nelson one of her executors and gives Bowman a silver cream urn, and to their children, her nephews and nieces, gives the household effects, after Mrs. Sweitzer’s death, and the proceeds of her real estate for life, and to Nelson’s children gives in remainder the property about which this inquiry is made.</p>

This part of the will should be viewed in the light gathered from the whole paper, and not read as if written merely “ nine tenths of my available stocks.” Full force and effect are required to be given to the words “ the rest,” and the particle “ or,” immediately following, is not to be construed as equivalent to consisting of. The words “ the rest ” evidently have reference to what remains of the property in part previ<a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>ously given away; and the sentence, if written out in full, would be “ the rest ” <em>of all I possess, </em>“ or nine tenths of my 'available stocks,” etc. The latter part of this sentence does toot specify what articles of property are to be alone understood 'as embraced in the preceding words, and was not so intended. Its object was, I think, two-fold, viz.: first to express the quantum or portion of the property given, and, secondly to exclude the mining stocks. The first part of this proposition is evidenced by the very words used, “ nine tenths,” and by reference being had to the prior disposition of the one tenth. And the purpose to exclude the mining stock appears from .the subsequent part of the will, where this stock is mentioned and its uncertain value implied. However, the will should be read in the light of the knowledge possessed by the testatrix when it was drawn, and with the purpose of thereby discovering and giving effect to her intention. Upon examination, then, of the inventory, it is discovered that the testatrix had one thousand shares of Fall River mining stock, and that said stock is there marked as “ worthless.” This stock would therefore be of no use to Mrs. Sweitzer, for whom the testatrix sought to provide an income for life, unless and until it should prove dividend-paying, which is apparently regarded as hardly within the possibilities. Yet the testatrix evidently thought that this stock might at some time have some value, for she seeks to provide for such a contingency. But no matter what value it might attain in the speculative market, it would still, without dividends, be useless, not available, to Mrs. Sweitzer, whose interest in it would be but for life, and she could not sell the stock. Hence this stock is excepted from her gift; and the words “available stocks” were used for that purpose, because the testatrix was just then thinking of this mining stock, and recognized its unprofitable character, and, therefore, its uselessness to Mrs. Sweitzer, and desired that in so far as her stocks were embraced in her gift to Mrs. Sweitzer they should all be available. That is, she intended to limit the stocks of the gift, and not the gift itself, to “ <em>available </em>stocks; ” or, in other words, to exclude stocks not available. It is as if she had written “ the rest ” or nine tenths “ of all I possess,” except my unprofitable stocks, I bequeath to my sister, Charlotte, etc., meaning thereby to limit the quantity of the gift to nine tenths and <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>the quality thereof to that which would be useful and profitable, of her personal estate. Or, a somewhat different construction may be adopted while yet reaching the same result, by holding the words available stocks to be but a defective enumeration of what is embraced in the gift. At all events, I feel satisfied that by this clause of her will the testatrix intended to give Mrs. Sweitzer all her personal estate, not otherwise specifically disposed of, to the extent of nine tenths of the whole, the mining stocks excepted. This construction gives effect to every portion of the will, disposes of all the property of the testatrix, accomplishes her evident intention, and renders the whole instrument consistent and harmonious.</p>
    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[146,1004,1172,1216]]]'>It will not do to say that the testatrix intended her notes and cash for the payment of the legacies subsequently given and of debts and the expenses of administration, for she does not say so, and nowhere speaks of any debts or expenses, and undoubtedly gives one tenth of these items to charity. And it appears now, from the account filed, that none of the notes, except those of John Freyers and one of John Schwarting, have been collected, and that a large part of the money expended in the settlement of the estate came from dividends on stocks and interest on boards and notes. But it was evidently the intent of the testatrix that subsequent legacies should come out of the nine tenths of Mrs. Sweitzer, which she does not deny, and, consequently, the gift to Rev. Hayden must be so deducted. As that sum, less the collateral inheritance tax thereon, has already been paid and credit therefor taken in the account, it should now be added to the fund for distribution in order to ascertain the correct shares of the heirs, otherwise they would be paying a portion thereof. Mrs. Sweitzer does not claim as a general residuary legatee, so as to take all not effectually disposed of by the will; and she therefore does not contest the light of the heirs to the one tenth given to charity, which bequest failed by reason of non-compliance with the provisions of the act of April 26, 1855, the will not having been attested by two credible and disinterested witnesses.</p>
