Wade and others, commissioners of Erie county, filed their appeal from the report of the county auditors upon the accounts of M. V. B. Gilford, late sheriff of said county; and on May 26th, an issue was directed, wherein M. V. B. Gifford was made plaintiff, and the county of Erie defendant.

At the close of the testimony, various points were presented, on the part of the plaintiff and on the part of the defendant, upon the question whether the county was or was not legally liable for the payment of the plaintiff’s said account. The court, Gunnison, P. J., affirmed the points presented by the plaintiff, and refused those presented by the defendant, ruling the question of liability in plaintiff’s favor; and, as there was no dispute as to the facts of the case, the court instructed the jury to return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $2,117.25; exception.</p>

    <p id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.5",434,[270,779,1180,545]]]'>The fifty-sixth section of the act of April 15,1834, P. L. 547, provides that “An appeal may be made from such report (county auditors’) to the Court of Common Pleas of the same county, either by the commonwealth, the county, or the officer; and thereupon the court may direct an issue, as the ease may require, to be tried by a jury, upon whose verdict final judgment shall be entered.” As this was such a case, we are of opinion the judgment in the court below upon the verdict in the feigned issue was the end of it. This appeal is a substitute for a writ of error, and must be quashed: Gangewere’s App., <a href="/pa/61/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="61 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="428570" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0342-01">61 Pa. 342</a>.</p>
