Each of those cases illustrated an attempt to accomplish two distinct purposes by an act, the title of which gave notice of only one. The present case, however, presents a very different question. The alteration of the rate of taxation upon the company’s dividends affected a matter connected with its affairs disclosed by the title, “ An Act relating to the Ridge Avenue Passenger-Railway Company.” That the tax was payable to the city of Philadelphia, is immaterial. It was as a part of the machinery for the government of the state, that the city received this tax. If it had been payable to the state, could the validity of the act be denied? If the title of an act, with a reasonable degree of notice, discloses the object 'of the legislation, it is sufficient: Allegheny Co. Home’s App., <a href="/pa/77/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="77 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="436309" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0077-01">77 Pa. 77</a>.</p>

J., calls attention to the fact that the uniform practice in Philadelphia had been to subject passenger-railway companies to the cost of maintaining the paving of streets occupied by them. But the taxation of such companies has not been dealt with according to any uniform practice. But one third of those having special charters are taxable according to the present claim of the city; another third are taxed only upon the excess of their dividends over six per cent, and others pay no tax whatever to the city upon their dividends: Bright.

L. 300, and the latter under the act of March 28,1859, P. L. 264: By the terms of their respective charters, the original companies were required, annually, to “ pay into the treasury of the city of Philadelphia, for the use of the said city, whenever the dividends shall exceed six per centum per annum on the capital stock, the sum of six per centum on the said dividends thus declared.” After the consolidation, however, an act of assembly was approved, March 8, 1872, P. L. 264, entitled “An Act relating to the Ridge Avenue Passenger-Railway Company,” which provided that the said company should pay annually into the treasury of the city of Philadelphia, for the use of the said city, “ a tax of six per centum upon so much of any dividend declared, which may exceed six per centum upon their said capital stock,” etc. It is now contended on the part of the city that this act of 1872 was in conflict with § 8, article XI., amendment of 1864, of the constitution of this state, in force at the time of its passage, and that the company, therefore, remains liable for the greater tax imposed in the original charters. The company having paid, and the city having received the taxes, .according to the provisions of the act of 1872, for the years 1880 and 1888, inclusive, this suit is brought to recover the <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>balance which would remain unpaid for these years, according to the rate fixed in the original charters.</p>

A distinction exists, however, between the title to an original act and that of a supplement. When an act of assembly is a supplement to a former act, if the subject of the original act is sufficiently expressed in its title, and the provisions of the supplement are germane to the subject of the original, the general rule is that the subject of the supplement is covered by a title which contains a specific reference to the original by its title, giving the date of its approval, and declaring it to be a supplement thereto : State Line R.

Co. v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/124/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="124 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="563064" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0219-01">124 Pa. 219</a>; and upon that ground the act was held to be in conflict with the constitutional provision referred to. In the case cited, the com<a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>pany sought to have the advantage of a provision of the act of 1872, relieving it from the burden of repairing the streets, a burden imposed by the original charters, and releasing the company from control by the city councils; whilst in this case the company seeks to have advantage of a provision of the same act, which would in part relieve it from the payment of city taxes. If the title of the bill was not so expressed as to warn the city as to the former feature or effect of the bill, it was clearly defective as to the latter, for there is no reference in the title to either; indeed, there was nothing expressed in the title to call the attention of the city, that her rights were in any way affected by it. We are not inclined to change the conclusions to which we came in the case referred to, nor to recede from the rule so' well settled in our cases. It follows that the act of 1872 must be treated as unconstitutional, and therefore void, in so far, at least, as it affects the rights of the city and changes the rate of taxation for city purposes.</p>

It appears that, some time after the year 1879, the city brought suit against the company for the taxes of 1872 to 1879, inclusive. The claim was for taxes according to the provisions of the act of 1872. The company, admitting its liability under that act, contended that, upon a proper construction of the act, it was not liable for tax, excepting when any single or separate dividend declared exceeded six per cent of the authorized capital of the company. The city’s contention was, however, that as, upon this construction of the statute, the company could declare dividends as often as the directors desired, they might so manipulate their dividends as to defeat the manifest design of the legislature to provide revenue for the city. Suit having been brought, as we have said, defence was taken and such proceedings were afterwards had that the cause came into this court upon a writ of error, where it was held that the extent of the company’s liability under that act was to be ascertained by applying the aggregate annual dividends to the capital actual<a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>ly paid in, and judgment was entered against the company accordingly. The constitutionality of the act of 1872 was not drawn in question, and the company was compelled to pay according to the demands of the city under the provisions of that act: Philadelphia v. Railway Co., <a href="/pa/102/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="102 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="502740" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0190-01">102 Pa. 190</a>.</p>
    <p id="b517-5" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[168,639,1171,656]]]'>The argument of the company’s counsel now is that, although, in the case referred to, the point does not appear to have been made or decided, yet the constitutionality of the act of 1872 must be taken to have passed in rem judicatam; that the judgment in that case necessarily involved a decision that the statute imposing the tax was to that extent valid, and, although the cause of action is not the same, the city is estopped of record from re-litigating that question.

The former judgment is absolutely conclusive upon the parties, as to the cause of action involved in it, although the statute upon which the proceedings wore taken was not constitutional; that judgment can only be impeached collaterally for fraud or want of jurisdiction. It is a matter of no consequence now that the act of 1872, upon which judgment was entered for the amount of the tax, was unconstitutional and void ; judgment having been entered, and no appeal taken, the subject matter of the issue in that suit is res judicata. The former judgment, therefore, operates as a bar to any subsequent action founded on the same demands: Bigelow on Estop., 80-88. In the case at bar, however, whilst the point in issue may perhaps be the same, the cause of action is different; and, although the verdict, with the judgment thereon, would furnish conclusive evidence of the matters in controversy upon which the verdict was rendered, and operate as a bar to <em>the </em>further litigation thereof, it would not preclude the plaintiff in this suit from asserting the unconstitutionality of the act upon which the previous action proceeded: Bigelow on Estop., 90-108.</p>

It is a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy, concluding parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.....But when the second action, between the same parties, is upon a different claim or demand, the judgment in the prior action operates as an estoppel only as to those matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered. In all cases, therefore, where it is sought to apply the estoppel of a judgment, rendered upon one cause of action, to matters arising in a suit upon a different cause of action, the inquiry must alwaj^s be as to the point or question actually litigated and determined in the original action, not what might have been thus litigated and determined.

These demands were for the whole, and not for any portion of the taxes supposed to be due and owing for these years, respectively, and were paid and <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>receipted for in ful]. Whether the act of 1872 was in conformity with the constitution or not, was matter of law, not of fact.

She cannot in this manner repudiate the authority under which she assumed to act, to the prejudice of the company’s rights. The company accepted the results of the litigation which the city originated, and paid the taxes annually, at the rate demanded, and in accordance with the judgment of this court. Relying upon the annual adjustment of these taxes, the company, from time to time, declared dividends and distributed their surplus earnings among the stockholders, and upon these dividends, presumably larger by reason of the reduced burden of taxation, the city has from year to year received the tax at the rate demanded. Non constat that the stockholders then are the stockholders now, or were stockholders when this suit was brought. The city could not split up her claim in this way to the prejudice of the company, and we are of opinion that in so doing she must be held to have waived and relinquished her right to receive beyond the amounts from year to year demanded.</p>

It is said to be a poor rule that will not work both ways. The city cannot occupy inconsistent positions.
