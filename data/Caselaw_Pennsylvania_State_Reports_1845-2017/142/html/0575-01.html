The certificate was issued through one J. G. App, as soliciting agent. The beneficiary named therein was the plaintiff, Joshua Vanormer, the husband of the assured. Mrs. Vanormer died within thirty days after the certificate was issued, and on November 30, 1881, under an assignment of the certificate to him, Dr. W. H. Backus, the defendants’ testator, received from the company the sum of $286, in full discharge of the insurance. Subsequently, the sum of $48 additional was paid to defendants’ attorney by the company. Dr. Backus died in December, 1886, and this suit was brought to recover the money so paid to him upon the certificate.</p>

It is held in Pennsylvania that a near relative has such an interest in the continuance of the life of another, and that a creditor has such an interest, and those are the only two cases in which one may have a policy of insurance upon the life of another. It is not claimed that Dr. Backus in this case was a relative; and the only question, therefore, for the jury to determine is whether or not he was a creditor. If he was not a creditor, and it is not contended that he was a relative, he would have no insurable interest in the life upon which this policy was issued, and therefore could not recover.] 6</p>

In this case, the policy was taken out on the life of Mrs. Mary Vanormer, and nominally for the benefit of the husband, and by him assigned to Dr. W. H. Backus, who was not a relative of the assured, nor had he any insurable interest in her life. The evidence in regard to the real nature of the transaction was objected to, and its admission assigned as error. See second, third and fourth assignments. We think this evidence was properly received, and it showed very clearly that the transaction was a mere speculation on the life of the assured. In other words, it was a gambling policy. It appears that the agent who effected the insurance placed about thirty thousand dollars on <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>the life of- this woman, obtained the signature of the husband to blank assignments of the policies, and then peddled <em>them, </em>about wherever he could find customers for them. It was proved upon the trial that Dr. Backus was not a relative of the assured, and there was some proof that he had no insurable interest: in other words, that he was not a creditor. As the assured was dead, and the money paid over by the company to Dr. Backus, it may be conceded the burden was upon the plaintiff to show that Backus had no interest. This, however, required the plaintiff to prove a negative, and slight evidence would throw the onus upon the defendant. If he was in point of fact a creditor of Mrs. Vanormer or of her husband, the proof was peculiarly within his power, and he could easily have produced it.</p>
