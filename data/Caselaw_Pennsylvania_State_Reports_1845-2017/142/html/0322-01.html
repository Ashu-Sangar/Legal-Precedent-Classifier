It was contended by the defendant that the entry of the judgment of non-pros was a final termination of said suit to No. 140 January Term 1888, and therefore No. 87 February Term 1889 is not a continuation of the original action by an alias summons, but is in reality itself a new and independent suit, and there can be no recovery therein by the plaintiff, both by reason of the said judgment of non-pros, and because the limit of time within which suit must be brought, under the terms of the contract, had expired.</p>

Weaver, 11 S. &amp; R. 85, it is said : “ The attorney, though there be an appearance de bene esse, may move to set aside the writ or service, for his appearance de bene esse was, provided there was a good writ and good service.” And hi Skidmore v.

Mason, <a href="/pa/66/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="66 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="432503" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0138-01">66 Pa. 138</a>.</p>

The defendant was then out of court, and the entry of the judgment of non-pros made on the eleventh of January, 1889, was unauthorized and without full legal effect, and has since, upon application, been stricken off by the court: See Craig v.

But the most that can be said of the judgment is that it was irregular, if even that can be said. It remained valid until stricken off by the court. When it was entered it was the end of the cause. There was nothing left upon which to engraft an alias writ. The summons was functus officio. The judgment being therefore a bar to the issuing of an alias writ, a removal of the non-suit, after the issuing of the second writ, would not enable the plaintiff to maintain his suit. This cause must be determined as though that judgment had not been stricken from the record.</p>

That it was in the minds of the parties, when they agreed upon the terms of this contract, that by issuing alias writs of summons, the bringing of the suit and the trial of the cause might be .prolonged indefinitely, no one can for a moment believe.

The effort here is to invoke the principle which has grown up in Pennsylvania, that to stop the running of the statute of limitations, the alias summons must issue within six years from the date of the original: Curcier’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20262" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="28 Pa. 262">28 Pa. 262</a>; Jones v. Orum, 5 It, 249. This rule has been adopted in analogy to the statute of limitations. Under it, if the alias writ issue more than six years after the issue of the original, the action is barred. In this case, the original summons was required, by <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>the contract limitation, to be issued within twelve months. It would seem to be right to continue the analogy, and hold that, in order to toll the bar of the limitation, the alias summons must be taken out within twelve months from the date of the original. If this rule prevail, the alias writ issued a month too late. If, however, the analogy be disregarded, and the alias summons be allowed to issue within six years, the court will be making a new contract for the parties different from that which they entered into.</p>

The present case, therefore, depends’ upon two questions: First, whether this is an alias based upon <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>and supported by the prior writ; and, secondly, if so, whether the contract limitation applies to the period between the issue of the original and the alias.</p>

The service of the original was set aside, but the writ itself remained, and beyond question kept the action alive, at least until the entry of the nonsuit. Appellant argues, however, that, as the nonsuit was on the record when the alias issued, even though it was subsequently struck off, the original writ was functus officio for all purposes at that time, and the status of the so-called alias must be determined as of that date. This argument would be of great force if the nonsuit had been taken off by the court for any ground subsequently arising, though even then, as there were no third parties whose interests would be affected, the court might probably have ordered it struck off nunc pro tunc as of the date of its entry. But the court struck off the nonsuit, because it was entered without authority and therefore never was of any force. The special ground assigned in the opinion of the learned judge below is that, the service having been set aside, and the defendant having appeared de bene esse only, he was not in court, and had no standing to take any such step in the cause. The entry of the nonsuit was therefore no more than any unauthorized entry on the record by a stranger. This view of the extent of an appearance de bene esse is sustained by the general understanding and practice of the profession, and by the authorities as far as they appear to have passed upon the subject: Blair v. Weaver, 11 S. &amp; R. 84; Winrow v. Raymond, <a href="/pa/4/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="4 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="401889" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0501-01">4 Pa. 501</a>; Skidmore v. Bradford, <a href="/pa/4/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="4 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="401853" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0296-01">4 Pa. 296</a>, 300 ; Bolard v. Mason, <a href="/pa/66/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="66 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="432503" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0138-01">66 Pa. 138</a>. But there is also another view which leads to the same result. The rule of the court below under which the nonsuit was entered, while not expressly so limited, appears to contemplate cases where the defendant is within the jurisdiction of the court, either by service or by general appearance. Otherwise, as the court is without power to proceed in the case, there would appear to be no occasion for compelling the plaintiff to go through the useless form of filing a declaration. This appears to be the natural construction of the rule, and that such was <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>the view of the learned judge below who entered the final judgment we may fairly infer from his citation of Ashton v. Bell, 19 W. N. 38, where a similar rule was so construed by the Court of Common Pleas No. 3 of Philadelphia. On both grounds, therefore, we are of opinion that the court below was right in treating the nonsuit, thus entered without authority under the rule of court, as of no effect, thus leaving the present writ as an alias in fact as well as in name.</p>
    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[195,784,1168,1523]]]'>This brings us to the second contention of appellant, that, even as an alias, this writ was too late, being issued more than twelve months after the original; and, as the parties had by their contract fixed their own period of limitation, it should be applied to the alias as well as to the original. This, however, is too stringent a construction of the agreement against the plaintiff. Such agreements are lawful, as already said, but they are in derogation of the general law of the commonwealth, and to be available the stipulation should be clear. Here, it is that the action “shall be commenced within twelve months.” There is no provision for anything beyond the commencement. Thereafter it is to take the regular course, according to the general law. The present plaintiff has brought himself strictly within his agreement. He began his action within the time specially agreed, and he kept it alive by the means and within the time allowed him by the law. It was no fault of his that the first writ was ineffectual to bring the defendant into court, but his misfortune did not go beyond the failure of the service. If that were sufficient to end his action, then the defendant, by avoiding service for twelve months, could defeat him altogether. It is not reasonable to suppose that the agreement contemplated any such result. The cases of Hocking v. Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/130/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="130 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="569009" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0170-01">130 Pa. 170</a>, and Riddlesbarger v. Insurance Co., <a href="/us/74/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="7 Wall. 386" data-case-ids="3451340" data-case-paths="/us/74/0386-01">7 Wall. 386</a>, are widely distinguishable. In them the first action had come to an absolute end, and that which the plaintiffs had commenced, after the stipulated period had expired, was a new and distinct action. It was said in the former that it was a hard case for the plaintiff, but he was clearly within the prohibition of his contract. Here' the plaintiff is clearly not within the prohibition, but has preserved all of his rights.</p>
