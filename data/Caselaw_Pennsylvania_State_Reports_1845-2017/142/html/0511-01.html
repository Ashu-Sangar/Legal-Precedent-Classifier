L. 150, no appeal on the merits lies to the Supreme Court. The act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 158, does not extend the right of review or modify its exercise; and in an appeal thereunder, the expediency of such annexation cannot be considered.</p>

In providing that “ any lots,” etc., “ adjacent” to a borough, may be annexed by decree of the Quarter Sessions, the act of June 11, 1879, uses the word “ adjacent” in its primary sense as adjoining, or contiguous ; but under the provision a number of contiguous properties may bo annexed in one proceeding, though some of them do not adjoin the borough.</p>

The valuation of the land proposed to be annexed is $42,900, for purposes of taxation, while that of the township of East Pennsboro is $882,034. The latter has thirteen public schools. Those favoring annexation stated that it would give better roads and walks to them; permit new streets to be laid out and lots plotted more advantageously, and most likely insure the establishment of a graded school in the borough. It was on the other hand insisted by those opposing the annexation, that it would reduce the taxable property of the township for school and road purposes, and increase the burdens of the remainder in this respect. It was denied that any sufficient reason had been given which would justify the conclusion that it was expedient to add so large an amount of land to the borough, which appeared already to include within its limits a considerable area not built upon. In addition, there was a renewal of the objection that proper notice of the application had not been given, as well as the allegation that the land was not all adjacent to the borough.</p>

Not only did they then appear, but no formal exception was taken to our action until after the grand jury had returned the certificate.

    <p id="b539-6" data-blocks='[["BL_539.6",539,[149,1023,1174,657]]]'>1. Under the act of June 11,1879, P. L. 150, the jurisdiction of the court to annex lands to a borough is limited to such as are adjacent thereto. Lands are not adjacent, within the meaning of that act, because they touch other lands which do in fact adjoin the borough: Rapalje <em>&amp; </em>Lawrence, L. Diet., verb. Adjacent; Webster’s International Diet., Idem. The legislature never intended that two or a dozen different tracts could be tacked on to one that is adjacent, so as to enable the limits of a borough to be extended in the grotesque shape and form of the extension in the present case, and thus render possible the grasping by the borough, for purposes of taxation, of several hundred acres of the most valuable and tax-producing farm land of an adjoining township.</p>
    <p id="b539-7" data-blocks='[["BL_539.7",539,[145,1687,1175,654]]]'>2. And the notice is irregular and incomplete, and not such as is required by the act of 1879. It ought to show (1) the names of the adjacent owners, and (2) a description of the land proposed to be annexed, or such reference thereto as to enable its identity to be ascertained. It is begging the whole question to argue that because the exceptants appeared and objected, all defects in the notice are cured. The law requires a notice of a certain kind to be given, before the court can exercise jurisdiction. This notice is a statutory condition of the jurisdiction, and if it is not given the proceedings are fatally irregular. We ask that the decree be reversed because, for each of the reasons we have presented, the court did not have jurisdiction.</p>

      <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>George Oyster was one of the remonstrants and opposed to annexation. Even if his land had been included in the petition, he would have been entitled, under act of April 1, 1863, P. L. 200, to have it excluded by the court, and doubtless would have done so. In such ease, the situation would have been precisely the same as it is now, and yet under no law would such an exclusion have been fatal to the proceeding. The lands are in fact adjacent, and the peculiar formation or shape of the territory incorporated into the borough is of no consequence, there being no law prescribing the form or shape which shall be given to boroughs and townships. “Adjacent” does not properly signify bordering on or adjoining, but is defined by Webster as meaning “lying near; close or contiguous, but not actually touching.” See the same authority as to the distinction between the synonyms, adjacent, adjoining, and contiguous. The notice given is all that the law requires: Osborne Bor., <a href="/citations/?q=101%20Pa.%20288" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="101 Pa. 288">101 Pa. 288</a> ; Edgewood Bor., <a href="/pa/130/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="130 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="568944" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0348-01">130 Pa. 348</a>.

No appeal upon the merits was allowed in such case, prior to the passage of the act of 1889, and that act did not extend the right of review, or modify its exercise. It simply provides that “ all appellate proceedings in the Supreme Court, heretofore by writ of error, appeal, or certiorari, shall hereafter be taken in a proceeding to be called an appeal.” As we said in Rand v. King, <a href="/pa/134/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="134 Pa. 641" data-case-ids="814968" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0641-01">134 Pa. 641</a>, an appeal in name may therefore be a writ of error or a certiorari in legal effect; and it is necessary, in every case, to look into the record, and determine at the outset of our examination whether what is called an “ appeal ” is such in fact, or is a writ of error or a certiorari.</p>

L. 150, and it is complained that by the petition, draft, and decree, which constitute parts of the record, the “lots, out-lots, or other tracts of land” embraced therein, are not “ adjacent ” to the borough. If by this provision of the act it is meant that each and all of the several lots or out-lots, or other particular or single tracts of land, proposed to be annexed, must adjoin the borough, the appellants’ contention would seem to be sustained. But we are of opinion that this was not the meaning and intent of the legislature. If it were, the annexation of lots contiguous to each other, but not all contiguous to the borough, would have to be accomplished by a series of proceedings and decrees, which would lead to great confusion, embarrassment, and delay. The word “ adjacent,” we think is used in its primary and obvious sense as adjoining or contiguous, for we cannot conceive that the legislature would annex to a borough a section of land or village wholly severed by the intervening lands of a township, so as to establish two entirely separate villages in one municipality. The essential and distinctive purposes and object of establishing a borough, the locating, grading of streets, laying sewers, etc., would be rendered impracticable, and in most cases impossible, by reason of the intervening territory.</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[166,1556,1168,705]]]'>But the power of the courts is not restricted to the annexation of “ lots and out-lots,” in the popular sense of these words. These powers extend to “ tracts of land,” and a tract of land may either apply to a single farm, or to a territory embracing the lands of different adjoining owners, drawn and exhibited in a single draft. It may appropriately be applied to a section of land, or of the country, without reference to the lines of individual ownership. The act of June 11,1879, is a supplement to the general borough law of April 8, 1851, P. L. 820, which in its thirtieth section authorizes the burgess and town council of any borough, upon petition, etc., to annex “lots, out-lots, or other tracts of land in any section lying adjacent to said borough ; ” and it was doubtless intended, in a certain case, to place a similar power in the hands of the court.</p>

    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[260,528,1172,502]]]'>The objection to the sufficiency of the notice is wholly without merit.
