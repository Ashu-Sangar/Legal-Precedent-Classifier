The execution was upon a printed blank and directed thus: “ The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the Constable of ward, Titusville, Greeting; ” the blank space after the words, Constable of, having two perpendicular marks in ink much resembling the Roman numeral II. The defendant offered the execution in evidence, when the plaintiff objected because the process was directed to the constable of the Second ward of Titusville.

[You will consider, therefore, gentlemen, that the confession of judgment before ’Squire Strouse, on April 18,1889, for $195.20, was a lawful judgment, and that execution might issue upon it, for the collection thereof.] 8</p>

It becomes material, therefore, for you to determine whether the execution, offered in evidence, was directed by the magistrate, at the time of its delivery, to the constable of the Second ward of Titusville, or to constable Megahey, of the Third ward of Titusville; and it is in reference to this aspect of the case that it becomes material to determine what the meaning is of the marks entered by the magistrate on the execution, in the first line immediately preceding the words “ ward of Titusville; ” the marks to which reference has been made by the counsel for the defendant and by the counsel for the plaintiff.</p>

If the ward was not designated by the magistrate, if he did not put in those marks as indicative of a particular ward in Titusville, but left the ward blank, intending, as shown by the transcript in the case, to have the constable of the Third ward of Titusville execute the writ, then the sale by Constable Megahey, at the time shown by the transcript and by other evidence in <em>the case, </em>would pass a good title to the property.] 3</p>

What he interprets the matter now to be, is not a matter of consequence, gentlemen; his evidence of what he did at that time is material. The witness’s testimony seems to be that he did not at that time insert these marks for the purpose of indicating the First or Second ward, or any other ward in Titusville.

Inasmuch as the constable of the Second ward and the constable of the Third ward both live in Titusville, and the property was in the same locality in the country, you would perhaps readily conclude, as the court doubtless would, that the question of convenience was complied with in issuing the execution to the Third ward or any other ward in Titusville. The provision doubtless was made for the purpose of saving costs to the defendant, and to avoid an unnecessary bill for mileage of the constable. The constables of the Second and Third wards of Titusville were convenient to the residence of the defendant, who seems to have lived in the city of Titusville.....</p>

Eddy, and in favor of Rose Eddy, was void for want of jurisdiction, it may be that the defendant took no title to the goods in controversy by virtue of the constable’s sale. We do not assent, however, to the proposition that the judgment was void. It was confessed by the defendant in person, in an amicable action before the justice. It was not entered, as was alleged, by virtue of a warrant of attorney. We are unable to see any reason why the judgment is void, or even voidable. Under such circumstances an execution might lawfully issue thereon. For an irregularity in the execution process the defendant therein would have a right to complain. The objection, in this instance, comes from a stranger, who assails its validity and that of the sale had thereupon. It is familiar law that no one can take advantage of a mere irregularity but the defendant himself. There is nothing upon the face of this record to show that the execution was void. It appears from the transcript of the justice that the writ was issued to Constable Megahey. Complaint is made that the court below permitted the justice to be examined as to the meaning of the marks II, on the face of the execution. Unexplained, they do not mean anything, and have no more significance than any other mark or scroll. The court below might well have disregarded it as irrelevant. Under the circumstances, the explanation was not error, and the evidence of the justice was properly admitted. It left the appellant without a case.</p>
