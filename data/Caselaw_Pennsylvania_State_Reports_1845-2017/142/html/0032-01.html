The subsequent act of April 15, 1869, provides that whenever the court shall commit the person complained of to prison, it shall be lawful for the court, at any time after three months, if satisfied of the inability of such person to comply with the order or give security, to discharge him from imprisonment.</p>
    <p id="b58-6" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[285,895,1176,654]]]'>It will be observed that the court may require security, and imprison defendants who refuse to enter it. The court may, and frequently does, require the defendant to enter his own bond, when he is unable to give security. A man without property and unable to find sureties, but capable of earning good wages and supporting his wife and children, would better be at work out of prison than in it. He may, at least, save the county the expense of supporting his family, which is the purpose of the law. But, if he is defiant and contemptuous and will not comply with the order of court, either by giving security, or his own bond without sureties, as the court may have required, or will not work and support his family, then imprisonment is inflicted upon him as a punishment.</p>
    <p id="b58-7" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[279,1555,1174,754]]]'>Imprisonment is not a satisfaction of the order of the court; neither does it release him from the obligation to comply with it. The person imprisoned is not entitled to demand his discharge after the expiration of three months, but the court is authorized to discharge Mm, if satisfied of his inability to comply with the order or give security; and the practice always has been to discharge defendants, in such cases, on entering their own bonds to comply with the order of court. That was done in this case. The order of the court imposed no illegal or impossible or even difficult conditions upon him, as a prerequisite to his discharge. He is now held for his refusal to comply with an order of the court, made in his own case and for his own benefit. When he is in a better state of mind and signs a bond to comply with the order of the court, he will be discharged.</p>
