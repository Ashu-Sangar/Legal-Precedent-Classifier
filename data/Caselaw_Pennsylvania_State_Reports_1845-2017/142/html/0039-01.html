Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20Pa.%20202" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="101 Pa. 202">101 Pa. 202</a>. A previous act of February 2, 1854, had made taxes a lien simply by their assessment, without being registered, and the object of this act of 1858 appears to have been to restore the system of registration, which had been created by the act of 1846, in a new form, and at the <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>same time to re-assert that they are still to be a lien on real estate, in accordance with the act of 1824. Nothing whatever is said as to the mode of enforcing this claim, and we find nothing to justify us in saying that its provisions are so “ irreconcilable ” as to repeal the eminently just provisions of the act of 1846. That act gives ample security to the city, and affords its citizens some protection against perpetual liens on their real estate. This point we have already orally decided in Philadelphia v. Ryers, 27 W. N. 71.</p>
    <p id="b66-6" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[274,849,1171,603]]]'>It is further contended on behalf of the city that, if the act of 1846 is still operative, a claim having been filed in this case, is “ suit brought ” as required by that act. To this point no authority is cited. The act of 1836 provides that every person entitled to a lien “ shall file a claim or statement of his demand,” or, as would be said in the case of individuals, must send in his bill. And it would seem as unjust in the one case as in the other to say that the debtor has been sued. As was said by Judge Mekctjb in O’Byrne v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/93/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="93 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="442190" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0227-01">93 Pa. 227</a>, “ Every essential requirement of this act (1846) should be observed. The necessity is the same, whether the object be to sell for the non-payment of taxes, or for a municipal claim.”</p>
    <p id="b66-7" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[275,1460,1174,703]]]'>And the legislature themselves seem very clearly to have distinguished between “ a claim ” and “ a suit; ” for whereas, in the act of 1845 they provided that “ if so registered, the lien shall continue for five years from the first day of January, in the next year succeeding that in which such tax was due, and no longer, unless a claim for the same shall be filed in the office of the prothonotary of the proper court, within the said term of five years,” they, in the act of 1846, say that the lien shall expire at the end of five years, “ unless suit be brought to recover the same, as it now is or may be provided by law for the recovery of the same, and duly proceeded in to judgment;” so that, while “ a claim filed ” was sufficient under the act of 1845 to continue a lien, nothing less than “ a suit duly proceeded in to judgment” would do so under the act of 1846.</p>

For over half a century very few of our citizens have not had brought home to them, in a practical way, either by the city or by mechanics or material men, the ingenious devices by which their property can be <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>encumbered. The privilege of being sued, before the time of lien can be doubled, is a distinct gain, and was, we think, intended as an act of beneficence by the legislature. By the act of May 4, 1889, P. L. 79, the lien of these taxes is limited to two years, unless entered of record, and limited to five, if recorded, unless revived and continued by “ writ of scire facias within said period and duly prosecuted to judgment,” showing that at the very last session of the legislature it was their clear intention then, as before, to put an end to perpetual liens. This they did by this law applicable to the whole state.</p>

On November 22,1882, a scire facias was issued on said claim, and on October 17,1887, a judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff for $92.70, for want of an affidavit of defence.</p>
