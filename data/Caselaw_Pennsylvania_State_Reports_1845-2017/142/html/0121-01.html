The next day, October 17th, the sheriff made a return to the order of sale setting forth a sale of the premises for the sum of $18,600, the payment thereof by him of the costs in full, including the plaintiff’s counsel fee of $680 as fixed by the court, and of the balance in equal shares to the plaintiff and defendant; the deed to the purchaser was acknowledged also.</p>

The prayer of the petition was for an allowance of five per centum on this sum, as compensation for professional and clerical services rendered by the petitioner, and to this was annexed the written approval of the counsel for the defendants, and an agreement that the compensation or fee be fixed at six hundred and eighty dollars. We are now asked to revoke this order; first, for the reason that the counsel for the defendant was not authorized by his client to approve of and agree to this adjustment, and furthermore, <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>because, at the time of making the agreement, the defendant’s counsel was not of sound mind, having suffered a partial loss of his mental faculties, by reason of a recent stroke of paralysis.</p>

Notwithstanding the fact that the agreement was embodied in an order at nisi prius, and was made a rule of court, both the Master of the Rolls, and, on appeal, the Court of Chancery, refused to decree performance of the agreement against the objection of the client. And the ground of the ruling was, that an attorney has no authority to compromise a suit without the authority or sanction of the client.</p>

L. 641, provides, that “ The costs in all cases of partition in the Common Pleas or Orphans’ Court of this commonwealth, with a reasonable allowance to the plaintiffs, or petitioners, for counsel fees, to be taxed by the court or under its direction, shall be paid by all the parties in proportion to their several interests.” To justify a court in accepting and acting upon an agreement which relieves them of the responsibility imposed by this statute, the assent of both parties to the proceedings in partition should be clear and beyond dispute. It now appears from the testimony in this case: first, that the counsel for the defendants acted in the premises without any distinct authority from his clients in reference to the amount of the fee to be allowed Mr. Bohan; and secondly, that upon hearing of the agreement and the order of the court made in pursuance of it, they refused to affirm the action of their own attorney, and at once asked for a revocation of the arder. Under these circumstances, it would seem that the <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>question now presented must be disposed of by us just as if the agreement of October 16, 1889, were out of the case.</p>
    <p id="b148-6" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[250,478,1182,1304]]]'>The proceedings in partition in this case were instituted under and in pursuance of the statutes, and were in no sense amicable. It would no doubt be competent for tenants in common to make an agreement for a partition of an estate, and proceed to carry it into effect without recourse to a court either of law or equity: see Mellon v.Reed, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20Pa.%20653" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="114 Pa. 653">114 Pa. 653</a>. And in such case the agreement to compensate counsel, either by fixing the amount of the fee, or by consenting to a certain commission upon the sum raised by a sale of the premises, would be good and valid in all respects. But where the proceedings are adversary, and suit is instituted under the statutes, the act of April 27,1864, requires that the compensation of counsel shall be taxed as costs, not by the parties or by the attorney himself, but by the court. And as was said by our Supreme Court, in Grubbs’ App., <a href="/citations/?q=82%20Pa.%2029" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="82 Pa. 29">82 Pa. 29</a>: “ The act had relation to costs capable of calculation and ascertainment, and not to such fees as counsel and client are accustomed of themselves to adjust. The services for the performance of which the statute was meant to provide were searches, formal motions, the preparation of papers and conveyancing; in a word, for such professional duties as would properly enter into the bill of costs of an attorney under the English practice. Counsel fees, in the ordinary sense, such as are paid to a barrister for a trial in court, were not in contemplation, ” etc. See also Shoemaker v. Everhart, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Kulp%20183" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Kulp 183">4 Kulp 183</a>; Monestier v. Monestier, 17 W. N. 255, and cases cited.</p>
    <p id="b148-7" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[243,1799,1174,450]]]'>The act of April 27, 1864, and the decisions of our courts, leave no room for doubt that, in a case like the one under consideration, the court is bound to tax the allowance of counsel fees simply as part of the costs, capable of calculation in view of services actually rendered, and not as a commission upon a fund in court. And in our judgment, guided by this rule of the law, a reasonable allowance for counsel fees in this case would be the sum of two hundred dollars, to be paid by the parties to the partition in proportion to their several interests.</p>
