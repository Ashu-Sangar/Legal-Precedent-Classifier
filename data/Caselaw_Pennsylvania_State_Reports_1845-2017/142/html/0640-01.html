The plaintiffs admitted the existence of the defects mentioned, but presented testimony tending to show that they resulted in part from a lack of steam-heat in the building, which the defendant’s agent had promised to supply, such lack causing the plastering to become frosted; and, in part, from acts of the defendant’s workmen, done after the completion of the plaintiffs’ work.

By the terms of these contracts, disputes between the parties were to be referred to the architects. The work done was not satisfactory; confessedly so.

The verbal statement of Knowles to vary this written contract would depend upon whether it would come within certain exceptions. If you should find that Knowles did agree that steam-heating should be put in, then it was binding upon Decker. It is a principle of law that where an agent has general authority he has general power, and if he was. defendant’s agent at the time of making this contract, what he said in this regard binds defendant.</p>

Plaintiffs cannot recover if it came from defects of their own causing. If the plaster froze after plaintiffs finished and left the building, then plaintiffs would not be responsible. There is nothing to show that plaintiffs were to keep the heat in. As to the blackboards, the testimony is of a different character. The defendant’s testimony shows they were not good; while plaintiffs say the silicate was good, they say the defects resulted from the freezing of the walls. I ought to say to you that if plaintiffs told defendant before he completed the work that it would be defective without proper heating to dry it, and defendant relieved plaintiffs, why, of course, that would excuse plaintiffs of results. If, however, these defects were properly chargeable to plaintiffs, and the defendant was compelled to expend certain sums to remedy such defects, then, to the extent of such expenditures, defendant is entitled to an allowance.</p>

He further held that, even if the final estimate was erroneous, and the contractor’s covenants were broken, and although recourse to the tribunal selected was not reasonably possible, and although the engineer refused to act, and although there were such gross and palpable mistakes in the estimates as amounted to fraud in the engineer, the agreement of submission was binding, and the remedy was only by action against the engineer, and not by an action on the contract.

The learned judge of the court below, while recognizing the doctrine, declined to apply it, for the reason that the stipulation only applied to the interpretation of the contracts, and not to defective work which might flow from defendant’s acts. We are unable to agree to that view. There is no such restriction contained in the contract. There was a clear and well-defined dispute between the defendant and the plaintiffs as to the character and quality of the plastering and blackboard work done by the plaintiffs, the defendant alleging that it was defectively done. There seems to be no doubt that there were serious defects in the work, .which the defendant was obliged to correct at his own expense. But the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant had failed to furnish steam-heat to dry the rooms, and that this caused the defects in question. The defendant replied that he was not bound to furnish steam-heat, and that the plaintiffs did not ask him to do so; and he also testified that the work was badly done. Thus the parties were at issue upon the question of the character and quality of the work done, and that question was one which was not only within the proper function of the architects, but was exclusively within their jurisdiction to hear and determine.</p>

The case of Reynolds v. Caldwell goes very much further than it is necessary to <em>go </em>in this case, denying the right of any action on the agreement. To hold that if a jury, in an action on the contract, should determine that the defects in controversy were in any manner traceable to the negligence of one of the parties, al<a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>though such alleged negligence was denied and formed .part of the dispute, therefore the reference to the engineer or architect must be abrogated, and the waiver of all right of action, suit, or other remedy stricken out of the contract, would make the question of jurisdiction depend, not upon the agreement of the parties, but upon the finding of the jury on one of the disputed facts. We cannot agree to such a result. The appellees suggest that a right to sue was reserved in the contract,. and therefore, the reference to the engineer is avoided. But the right to sue is given only to the defendant, and it is limited to the recovery of any money which he could not recover, by withholding out of the money payable under the contract the damages he might suffer from the plaintiffs’ defective performance. We are clearly of opinion that all right of action on the contract was waived, except to recover upon an award made by the engineers and architects, and, as there was nothing of this kind in the case,</p>
