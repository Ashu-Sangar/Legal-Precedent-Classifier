D. 1888, Tony Auer, one of the defendants, applied to the plaintiff to sell him the stock and fixtures, and offered the sum of seven hundred dollars for the same. This sum the plaintiff agreed to accept, provided the said sum was paid in cash or was perfectly secured, but refused to accept Auer’s unindorsed notes for the same. Auer then offered Richard P. Lardner, another of the defendants, as indorser of his notes, and produced said Lardner, who did indorse said notes, averring at the time his perfect solvency and responsibility. Plaintiff not being satisfied with these assurances, as to the solvency of Lardner or Auer, by the directions of Auer called on Charles G. Harres, another of the defendants, and stated the whole transaction to him, and asked his knowledge of the responsibility of the parties, particularly of Lardner. Harres then stated and represented to the plaintiff that Lardner was perfectly responsible and solvent, and that he, the said Lardner, was the owner of the premises, No. 150 N. Water street, in the city of Philadelphia, which said property was clear of encumbrances, and was also the owner of an interest of the value of from <em>$5,000 to $6,000 </em>in an estate known as the Lardner estate.</p>

    <p id="b396-6" data-blocks='[["BL_396.5",396,[245,432,1175,909]]]'>This is an action for conspiracy to defraud, and the plaintiff’s case is substantially this: That, being desirous of selling out his grocery business, he advertised it, and received an offer from defendant Auer, which resulted in an agreement to sell for seven hundred dollars, payable in thirty and sixty days, and secured by two promissory notes of Auer, indorsed by defendant Lardner. During the negotiations, plaintiff claims that Harres, the third defendant, made very specific representations as to the financial responsibility of Lardner, including statements not only as to his real estate, but also as to°his bank accounts, and the balances then to his credit therein. The transaction was hurried through by the urgency of Auer, who said he wanted the benefit of the Saturday sales, and possession was delivered to him on that day. There is some evidence that the other defendants got groceries from the store that same night. On the following Monday week, the stock, fixtures, etc., were sold out at auction by Auer. The notes were not paid, and Auer and Lardner proved to be financially irresponsible.</p>
    <p id="b396-7" data-blocks='[["BL_396.6",396,[244,1349,1172,861]]]'>This is the transaction, according to plaintiff’s evidence, and it has the appearance of a bald fraud on the part of Auer, and conduct on the part of the other defendants which in fact tended to aid in its accomplishment. Whether done with that intent was a matter of inference from all the circumstances. Uncontradicted, the plaintiff’s case would support the inference of a combination to effect the actual result. There were some discrepancies in the evidence in plaintiff’s behalf, and some things difficult of credence. Among the latter, the fact that plaintiff’s friend and amateur counsel, Serfass, calling himself a lawyer, intending to make Lardner a surety for Auer drew up the notes so as to put him in the place of a subsequent indorser to plaintiff. But these difficulties only complicate, and do not necessarily destroy plaintiff’s case. Whether it was true, and, if true, whether it showed that the fraudulent advantage to Auer was intentionally aided by the other defendants, were questions for the jury.</p>
