Lines and four other persons, named therein as executors. Three of the executors were afterwards discharged by the Orphans’ Court on their own petition. By the terms of the will, the widow was to receive $750 annually for life, to be increased to $1,000 annually, if in the judgment of the executors the latter amount should be necessary for her support; and also, the testator’s furniture, for life.

There a husband, a short time before his death, in expectation of soon dying conveyed all his real and personal estate to his son, in trust for said son and other children of a former marriage, without valuable consideration and for the purpose of defrauding his wife’s right of dower and share in his estate. At the same time the husband leased the property from the trustee for his life at a nominal rent. It seems that the rights of a widow in that state at the time in question, 1842, were substantially the same as they are now in this state. The conveyance was set aside as to both real and personal property, at the instance of the widow. One of the grounds assigned for the decision was that the husband had in no way abridged himself of the control of the property, and that the gift was not consummated. Another ground was that the wife, in the lifetime of her husband, had such rights as ought to be recognized and enforced; that the attempt to elude them was mala fide, a fraud upon the law and the marital rights of the wife, and that the husband, so far as the widow was concerned, was to be regarded at the time of his death as being the owner of the property in question.</p>

The reasoning employed indicates that it would probably have been.

It seems beyond question to be the professional and judicial sentiment in this state that a wife has no interest recognized by law in her husband’s personal property.] 1 Killinger v. Reidenhauer, 6 S. &amp; R. 530, was a contest concerning a mortgage given by a husband, without consideration, for the sole purpose of preventing his wife from getting any part of the mortgaged premises. The contest arose after the mortgagor’s death. The court said that the widow might be admitted to defend pro interesse suo; that the mortgage was not fraudulent as to any other claim of the widow than her right to one third, her matrimonial endowment; for the contingent increase under the intestate acts was at the husband’s perfect disposition, and so far as he disposed of his estate the contingency never happened upon which said rights depended; that a man can never be said to commit a fraud on the contingent rights of others, where it depends on his own acts whether they shall ever exist; that the rights of the wife other than her common-law dower he could defeat in the same manner as he could the succession of his heirs.</p>

The two last named cases are referred to and the substance of what is above given is stated with approbation in Dickerson’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="115 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="551661" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0198-01">115 Pa. 198</a>.</p>

A husband had assigned bonds without consideration to trustees for the benefit of his brothers, with the object to deprive his wife of a share therein under the intestate laws. The transfers were declared void as to the widow, but it was found to be a fact that the husband retained the bonds and received the interest after the assignment, and handed them over to the trustees after long continued intemperance had rendered him unfit to transact business. There can hardly be a doubt that if the husband parted with the property absolutely, while he was capable to contract, the conclusion would have been different.</p>
    <p id="b183-5" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[179,1047,1174,962]]]'>Stress is laid by the plaintiff’s counsel upon the use in Dickerson’s Appeal, supra, and elsewhere, in discussing gifts of this nature, of the phrase “ good faith.” Evidently that expression must be understood to refer to the intent of the donor to divest himself of the ownership, not to the purpose to affect the wife. How can the motive concerning the wife, of the voluntary disposition by the husband, be material, inasmuch as the wife has no right in his goods ? If she had such right, the deprivation of it would be a fraud upon her, whether the intent had or had not been to prejudice her; a gift by the husband would be to her injury and consequently in fraud of her rights. In this case, the donor delivered the stocks and bonds mentioned in the deeds to the respective trustees, at or shortly after the time the execution and delivery of the deeds and the transfers of the shares and securities to the trustees were made. The certificates and books of the corporations show that the trustees were the holders of the stocks and the bonds in question. The transferees had the legal title, and the beneficiaries named had equitable interests. Valid, active trusts were created.</p>

In that to the trust company it is only as to the disposition of the property after donor’s decease. But that the reservation of such power is not inconsistent with the creation of a valid trust is decided in Dickerson’s Appeal, supra. That was material upon the question of the trust in favor of Mrs. Manning. “A reserved right of revocation is not inconsistent <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>with the creation of a valid trust. If the right is not exercised during the lifetime of the donor and according to the terms in which it is .reserved, the validity of the trust remains unaffected, as though there never had been a reserved right of revocation: Stone v. Hackett, <a href="/mass/78/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="78 Mass. 227" data-case-ids="2086067" data-case-paths="/mass/78/0227-01">78 Mass. 227</a>. In that case, a delivery of railroad stock without a consideration, in trust to pay the income to the donor for life, and at his death to transfer the shares to charities, with a clause of revocation, was good against the widow, who claimed her share in the same as part of her husband’s estate : ” by Mr. Justice Stebbett. It will be observed that in the Dickerson case, in the trust for Mrs. Manning, like that in this, the donor had reserved the income.</p>

The case does not present any question of conflict of laws between this state and New York. Our contention is that the agreement made in New York is testamentary in substance and effect; that it was a mere device and scheme on the part of Jesse Lines to put it in the form of a trust, for the purpose of cheating and defrauding his wife; and it is nothing but a will <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>in disguise. As such, it is governed by the law of Pennsylvania, Jesse Lines being domiciled here at the time of his death, and it is immaterial where it was executed. But, if the acts of Jesse Lines would be a fraud upon his wife, in case the instrument had been executed in Pennsylvania, they are just as much so, wherever else it was executed. It relates to a pretended transfer of his personal property, and in all such cases the transaction is governed by the law of the domicile of the owner of the property: 3 Am. &amp; Eng.

All through this report I have been restrained from the doing of equity by reason of the rigid rules of law, which equity in this case must follow; and now, as the costs can be disposed of upon equitable principles, I will avail myself of the opportunity and save the plaintiff from their payment.</blockquote>

    <p id="b188-9" data-blocks='[["BL_188.10",188,[269,1959,1172,251]]]'>This case has been so intelligently and exhaustively discussed both by the learned master and the court below that I fear anything I may say will be but a repetition of what they have perhaps better said. . It certainly renders an elaboration of it unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b188-10" data-blocks='[["BL_188.11",188,[269,2217,1170,197]],["BL_189.1",189,[181,395,1165,193]]]'>, The appellant objects to the deeds of trust to the Union Trust Company of New York and to William E. Lines for two reasons: <em>(a) </em>That they are in fraud of her rights as widow; and (5) that they are testamentary in their character. Hence <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>she asks that the said deeds be declared void as against her, and that the trustees may be decreed to hand over the securities, named in said deeds and remaining in their hands, to the executors of the will of Jesse Lines, deceased.</p>
    <p id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[175,601,1169,964]]]'>The first proposition cannot be sustained. It is the settled law of this state that a man may do what he pleases with his personal estate during his life. He may even beggar himself and his family, if he chooses to commit such an act of folly; When he dies, and then only, do the rights of his wife attach to his personal estate. She then becomes entitled to her distributive share, and of this she cannot be deprived by will or any testamentary paper. “ Who so ignorant,” said Chief Justice Gibson, in Ellmaker v. Ellmaker, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.%2091" class="citation" data-index="149" data-cite="4 W. 91">4 W. 91</a>, “ as not to know that a husband may dispose of his chattels during the coverture, without his wife’s consent and freed from every post mortem claim by her?” This point was expressly decided and thoroughly discussed by the late Justice Shabswood in Pringle v. Pringle, <a href="/pa/59/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="59 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="426957" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0281-01">59 Pa. 281</a>, where it was said that “a man’s wife and children have no legal right to any part of his goods, and no fraud can be predicated of any act of his to deprive them of the succession.” See, also, Dickerson’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="115 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="551661" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0198-01">115 Pa. 198</a>. It is sufficient to announce a rule so firmly settled, without discussing it.</p>
    <p id="b189-6" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[169,1574,1170,861]],["BL_190.1",190,[271,398,1175,595]]]'>It remains to consider the second objection in connection with each of the trust-deeds. That it cannot be invoked in this proceeding, so far as the deed to the Union Trust Company is concerned, is clear for obvious reasons. That deed is a New York contract. It was made in New York; the deed was delivered in New York, and it was intended to be executed there. Moreover, the trustee is a New York corporation, and the securities in question were delivered there to the said corporation. It is almost needless to say that the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton county has no jurisdiction of a trust, where both the trustee and the trust-estate are in another state. Moreover, if it be conceded that this deed is of a testamentary character, it does not help the matter, so far as the present proceeding is concerned. If the securities held by the Union Trust Company are a part of the estate of Jesse Lines, it is nevertheless an estate situated in the state of New York, and a court of equity in this state cannot by its decree take it <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>out of the hands of its custodian there and transfer it to executors in this state. It can only be reached by ancillary letters taken out in New York. It would then be subjected to the payment of the debts of the testator in that jurisdiction, and the balance only, after satisfying any such demands, would be forwarded to the executors of the domicile. This is familiar law. I may further add that the learned master has found as a fact that by the law of the state of New York a married woman has no claim and possesses no title or interest in her husband’s personal estate during his lifetime, and she has no right or privilege of taking his personal estate . against his last will and testament.</p>
    <p id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[262,1011,1181,706]]]'>It remains to consider the deed to William E. Lines. It was said in Mattocks v. Brown, <a href="/pa/103/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="152" data-cite="103 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="449171" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0016-01">103 Pa. 16</a> : “ Many deeds conveying and settling property contain provisions which become operative only after the death of the grantor or settler, but where a present interest passes to a trustee or grantee, it has never been supposed that such instruments were of a testamentary character.” I do not propose to review the numerous authorities cited and discussed by the learned master. I will add, however, that Dickerson’s App., <a href="/pa/115/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="153" data-cite="115 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="551661" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0198-01">115 Pa. 198</a>, is upon all fours with the case in hand. There the owner of certain personal property imposed a trust upon it in favor of his children, naming himself as trustee, and the trust was held valid, notwithstanding the reservation of the income to himself and a power of revocation.</p>
    <p id="b190-6" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[266,1724,1171,147]]]'>When we come to examine the deed to William E. Lines, we find an absolute conveyance to him of certain securities specified therein upon the following trusts :</p>

Lines, his executors, administrators and assigns, upon the following trusts, to wit: In trust to divide the same into twenty-eight equal shares, of which he shall hold fourteen shares for the use of my putative son, the said William E. Lines, and of the remaining fourteen shares he shall hold ten, to wit, one each for the use of the ten children of my deceased sister, Mary Fairchild, named respectively: . . . . And the remaining •four shares he shall hold for the use of my brother, John Lines. During my life the said William E.

And should he in the exercise of his discretion determine to hold the same during my life and thereafter, he may, after my death, pay the income thereof to the said beneficiaries respectively, and in their several proportions, until such times as he may see fit to transfer the principal of the said shares to the persons entitled thereto respectively,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[178,888,1171,1166]]]'>It is idle to call this a testamentary paper. It passed his entire legal title to the trustee, with a present interest. He parted with the property wholly and entirely. Even the reservation of the income to himself for life was optional with the trustee. The latter could have distributed the corpus of the estate to the beneficiaries the next day. The power of revocation reserved in the deed, having never been exercised, was precisely as if it had never existed. A reserved right of revocation is not inconsistent with the creation of a valid trust. If the right is not exercised during the lifetime of the donor, and according to the terms in which it is reserved, the validity of the trust remains unaffected, as though there had never been a reserved right of revocation: Dickerson’s Appeal, supra; Stone v. Hackett, <a href="/mass/78/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="78 Mass. 227" data-case-ids="2086067" data-case-paths="/mass/78/0227-01">12 Gray 227</a>. There is nothing in this deed to indicate an intention to create a trust to take effect only after the death of the donor. On the contrary, the intent is clear to create a present trust in favor of the beneficiaries named therein, to take effect immediately with the execution of the deed. The securities passed into the hands of the trustee along with the trust-deed. The transaction was complete, and the donor was absolutely denuded of his property. It is useless to pursue the subject further. The appellant had no case, and her bill was properly dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b191-6" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[440,2063,903,94]]]'>The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>
