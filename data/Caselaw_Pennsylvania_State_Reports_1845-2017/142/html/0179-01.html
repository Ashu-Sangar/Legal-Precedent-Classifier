The fact that the assignment was made on May 5, 1888, while the formal contract was not executed until July 13th, is immaterial, as the acceptance of Watson’s bid bj the city gave rise to a contract vesting in Watson rights capable of assignment. Moreover, work was done before July 13th, under the contract, and the city accepted this work and issued warrants therefor shortly afterwards. The fact that the work was not all completed at the time of the assignment is immaterial: Philadelphia v.

The power of attorney, copies of which were filed in the offices of the controller and the water bureau, was notice to the city of the use-plaintiff’s interest. The practice of filing similar powers of attorney in the city department has long been permitted in like cases, and would seem to be generally understood, both by the departments and the business public," as importing an assignment. If, then, the filing of the power of attorney was sufficient to affect the city with either actual or constructive notice of the use-plaintiff’s interest, it was manifestly improper to allow the defendant to set off against him a claim against the contractor arising from an entirely independent transaction, and acquired by i months after notice of his rights.</p>

The test, in such a ease, of the validity of a legal set-off, is not whether the claim was acquired by the debtor before or after notice of the assignment, but whether the set-off arose from a transaction collateral to the chose in action assigned, and subsequent in point of time to the assignment. Clement v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/137/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="137 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="821480" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0328-01">137 Pa. 328</a>, is distinguished by the fact that in that case the claim set off accrued before the assignment. In the cases in which a set-off acquired after an assignment has been allowed, the real ground of the decisions has been that the debtor, without notice, has altered his position by buying the claim to use it as a set-off: Rider v. Johnson, <a href="/pa/20/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="20 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="972345" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0190-01">20 Pa. 190</a>.

    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[172,1044,1172,862]]]'>3. Neither the contract with Watson for the grading of Montgomery Avenue, nor that with P. &amp; D. McNichol for completing the work, is averred in the case stated to have been awarded to the lowest bidder, after advertisement, as required by § 6, act of May 23,1874, P. L. 233, and it must therefore be assumed that this was not done: Berks Co. v. Pile, <a href="/pa/18/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="18 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="969086" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0497-01">18 Pa. 497</a>; Phila, etc. R. Co. v.

The contract with Watson therefore conferred no rights and imposed no duties on either him or the city. The arrangement with P. &amp; D. McNichol imposed no liability on the city, and the payment made to them by it was purely voluntary. Whether the claim attempted to be set off oe considered as arising out of Watson’s failure to complete the grading, or out of the voluntary payment to McNichol, the set-off is equally improper.</p>

The power of attorney was not an assignment to Elder of Watson’s rights under the clay contract, nor was it notice to the city of such an assignment. If there was any assignment, it was made against an express provision in the contract, that it should not be assigned, transferred or sub-let. The instrument, however, is simply a power of attorney to collect moneys “ due and owing ” for clay delivered. It is not on its face irrevocable, nor is it coupled with an interest, nor does it authorize the attorney to collect moneys which shall become due. Philadelphia v.

Watson did not release his control over the fund, as he could at any time have revoked the power of attorney, and at most there was an assignment of only part of the claim, to wit, the moneys due and owing; nor did the city in any way consent to such assignment.

He defaulted upon the latter contract, and the city seeks to set off, against his claim under the East Park reservoir contract, the damages sustained by reason of his default' on the Montgomery Avenue contract.</p>
    <p id="b209-5" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[170,785,1169,288]]]'>The right to such set-off would seem to be clear, under the authorities. It was decided in Hunt v. Gilmore, <a href="/pa/59/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="59 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="426970" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0450-01">59 Pa. 450</a>, that imliquidated damages, arising ex contractu from any bargain, may be sot off under the defalcation act of 1705, whenever they are capable of liquidation by any known legal standard. This is settled law.</p>
    <p id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[167,1091,1180,1271]]]'>It appears, however, by the case stated, that the plaintiff executed and delivered to Elder, the use-plaintiff, a power of attorney authorizing him to demand and receive from the city of Philadelphia “all moneys due and owing said Watson on account of said contract,” (East Park reservoir contract,) and that on the faith of it Elder advanced to Watson the sum of $5,560. This sum was probably advanced by Elder to enable Watson to complete his contract to furnish the clay, although such fact does not appear in the case stated. It was contended that this paper operated as an assignment of the contract, and an equitable assignment of the fund due from the city to Watson. That it was neither is too plain for argument. Watson had no power to assign or sub-let the contract. Such transfer was expressly prohibited by its terms. The power of attorney was a mere authority to receive the money due under the contract at its date. It was doubtless intended to cover all money due and to become due under it, but it does not say so. There was nothing upon its face to convey notice to the city that Elder had any interest in it beyond the collection of the money for his principal. It was not an equitable assignment of the fund; hence the question of notice to the city, and whether it was of the whole or only of a part of’ it, becomes immaterial, and we need not discuss the cases which hold that a municipality is not bound to recognize an assignment of a part only of a particular fund.</p>

Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/137/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="137 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="821480" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0328-01">137 Pa. 328</a>, i&amp; <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>directly in point. Clement, while indebted to the city, entered into a contract with it to do certain work. He immediately agreed with Josephs to advance him (Clement) the money to complete his contract, and assigned his right to receive the payments as they became due. Josephs was to deduct his advances and one half of the net profits. He received some payments, but less than his advances. In an action by Clement, to the use of Josephs, it was held that the city had a right to set off the balance on account of the original indebtedness of Clement, notwithstanding the assignment. That case was even stronger than this, for the reason that Josephs held an irrevocable power of attorney to collect the money, while Elder’s authority could have been revoked at any time. Upon all other points the cases are similar. The fact that in the one case the set-off was for an indebtedness prior to the contract, and in the other an indebtedness for breach of a concurrent contract, is ,a distinction without a difference.</p>
