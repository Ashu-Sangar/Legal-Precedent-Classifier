Our well-intended effort miscarried because one party refused to be bound by it. We again assume the role of a chancellor, in order to reinstate the case as it stood before the verdict was ordered. And, in doing so, it becomes a question, whether after this lapse of time we have any power to do so. This question we will leave to the Supreme Court to pass upon; and we do <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>now, in the light of the ruling of the Supreme Court, as we understand it, set aside the verdict, and also set aside the judgment entered thereon, so the case may stand as an opened judgment as it stood open and at issue on the pleadings immediately before the verdict was ordered and taken, restricting the defence precisely as it was then, without leave of amendment ; the costs of the trial of the feigned issue and of this rule to be paid by the defendant W.

Wilson, presented a petition for leave to withdraw the petition to open said judgment and all proceedings subsequent thereto, “ with the same and like effect only, as though no proceedings had been had to open the same. This action is not to prejudice, or in any way prevent or bar the said defendant from making or setting up any defence, on the trial under the scire facias, as he could have made of done in case no proceedings had been had or instituted under the judgment.” Objection being made and argued, the court, Babb, P, J., made the following order:</p>

It is therefore now ordered that leave to withdraw proceedings as prayed for be granted; exception.</p>

    <p id="b599-5" data-blocks='[["BL_599.5",599,[156,694,1166,706]]]'>The plaintiff alleges that the court below erred in striking off the judgment entered April 19, 1889, on the verdict rendered November 30, 1888. The order striking off the judgment was entered January 7, 1891; and, if the verdict and judgment had been in a common-law proceeding, the power of the court to dispose of it in this summary manner may well be doubted. But the verdict in question was rendered in a feigned issue ordered by the court to inform its conscience, and such proceedings are in an especial manner within the equitable powers of the court. If dissatisfied with the verdict, the court may disregard it; and where, as here, the court becomes convinced that instead of being an aid, it is a hindrance to the proper disposition of the cause in which it was ordered, it is clearly within the equitable power of the court to set it aside.</p>
