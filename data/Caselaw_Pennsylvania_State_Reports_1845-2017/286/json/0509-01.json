In looking for the testator\u2019s \u2018actual, personal, individual intent\u2019 (Tyson\u2019s Est., 191 Pa. 218, 225), we find that it is to give to his wife the use of his estate for life, except as to the legacy of five hundred dollars to Faith Church and the one of a thousand dollars to testator\u2019s boy De Yon; and at her death the principal, of which she may enjoy the income for life, is De Yon\u2019s.\u201d\nThe decree is affirmed, costs to be paid out of estate of decedent.",
