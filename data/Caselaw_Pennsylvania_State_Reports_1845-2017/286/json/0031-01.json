Lang et al., 283 Pa. 51, 59, where we ruled, inter alia, that the case was for the jury. This disposes of one of appellant\u2019s three questions involved.\nA question put on cross-examination to one of the plaintiffs was ruled out by the trial judge, but the substance of this interrogatory was answered by the witness in reply to other questions, on the same cross-examination, in such a way that no harm was done to appellant by the ruling. This disposes of another of the questions involved.\nThe trial judge affirmed ten requests for charge submitted by the present appellant and properly refused one, which asked for binding instructions. Then, during plaintiffs\u2019 closing address to the jury, several other points were handed up, which the court refused to answer. This refusal was quite within the judge\u2019s right, irrespective of any printed court rule on the subject; and, in addition, we are not convinced that the failure to charge on these particular requests did defendants any substantial harm. This disposes of the last question involved.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
