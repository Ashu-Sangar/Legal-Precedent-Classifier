The latter, nevertheless, prays that it \u201cbe permitted to intervene as a party appellant in the above proceedings,\u201d to \u201cfile printed briefs\u201d and to \u201ctake part in the oral argument.\u201d\nOn appeal, one will be permitted to intervene as a party only when he has such an interest in the cause of action or defense that a final judgment in the suit will directly affect him under the rule of res judicata, or by subjecting him to execution, or where it may fix or affect his liability to a party on the record; and the mere circumstance that, as here, such a judgment may indirectly affect petitioner, under the rule. of stare decisis, is not sufficient to entitle him to intervene; such a fact, however, is enough to bring him within Rule 61 of this court, which provides: \u201cAny one interested in the questions involved in an appeal, though not a party to it, may, before the time fixed for argument and without applying for leave so to do, serve upon appellants and appellees a brief in regard to those questions, and file twenty-one copies thereof with the prothonotary, for distribution as hereinafter set forth.\u201d\nThe prayer for leave to intervene as a party appellant is denied, but petitioner may' file briefs under the above Rule 61. The prayer to be allowed to participate in the oral argument will be considered at the time of argument ; in the meantime, it is suggested that counsel for petitioner should confer with counsel for appellant and arrange, subject to our approval, for the division of such time as may be allowed to appellant for the presentation of its case.",
