Franklin Slifer.\nMabel Slifer, petitioner, averred that plaintiff, Sara Slifer, is the mother of defendant, that the judgment note in controversy was given by defendant to plaintiff without a valuable consideration and for the purpose of defrauding the petitioner of her dower interest (now widow\u2019s interest under the Act of 1917) in defendant\u2019s real estate.\nPlaintiff and defendant filed separate answers in which they admitted the relationship between the various parties, but denied the note lacked a valuable consideration ; they averred that the obligation in suit was given for an indebtedness of $4,036.23, representing moneys advanced by plaintiff to defendant in various sums over a period of several years; the answers also denied any collusion between plaintiff and defendant for the purpose of defrauding petitioner.\nThe case was heard by the court below, on petition, answers and depositions; it turned on questions of fact, which were decided against the petitioner. After reading the pleadings and testimony, we find no reason for departing from the rule which controls the review of oases of this character. Applications such as those in the present instance ar\u00e9 directed to the discretion of the court; on appeal, we decide only whether there has been abuse of discretion on part of the court below, and of that we are not convinced in this case.\nThe appeal is dismissed.",
