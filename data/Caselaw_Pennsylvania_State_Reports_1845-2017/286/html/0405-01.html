The court below dismissed the bill and plaintiff appealed.</p>

Defendant demanded security for the deposit, threatening to withdraw the account if this were not furnished. ■ The trust company promised to comply with the request and adopted a resolution authorizing the proper officer to execute to defendant a bond in the sum of $560,000 and'pledge therewith the bonds, the subject-matter of this proceeding as collateral security, “for all moneys deposited on the books of the company in the name of” defendant. Pursuant to this resolution a bond was prepared in which John A. Bell, president of the trust company, was named as surety and recited the bonds deposited as collateral <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>.were the property of the surety to whom they were to be returned when released from the obligation.

Plaintiff claims the assignment of the bonds to defendant as collateral was void and that they should be turned over to him to distribute the proceeds derived therefrom among all depositors pro rata, the principal argument in support of this claim being that the Carnegie Trust Company, organized under statutes relating to title insurance companies, had no authority to engage in the business of banking and was without power to pledge its assets to secure one of its depositors.</p>

L. 73, for the purpose of insuring titles to real estate. In 1881 (May 24, P. L. 22) an act was passed enlarging the powers of such companies giving them the right to receive and hold on deposit and in trust, and as security, real and personal property, including the notes, bonds, obligations of states, individuals, companies and corporations, with the power to purchase, collect, adjust and settle, sell and dispose of the same. This act expressly provided that nothing therein contained should authorize such companies to engage in the business of banking. The Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 159, added additional powers, giving such companies the right to act as assignees, receivers, guardians, executors and administrators. This act also denied companies of this character the right to engage in the business of banking. The Act of <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>May 27, 1895, P.

Pratt, <a href="/pa/223/0633-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="223 Pa. 633" data-case-ids="960955" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0633-01">223 Pa. 633</a>, this court held that trust companies incorporated under the above-recited acts were not banking institutions within the meaning of the Act of May 11, 1874, P. L. 135, imposing double liability qn stockholders of such institutions. The Act of May 9, 1923, P. L. 173, passed pursuant to section 11, of article XVI, of the Constitution, gave every trust company and bank the right to discount paper. We deem unnecessary a discussion of the effect, if any, the Act of 1923 had on the rights and powers of the Carnegie Trust Company, organized as a title insurance company, or whether that company in fact attempted to exercise rights thereunder by carrying on a banking business because, in our opinion, the power given by the Act of 1895 “to receive deposits of money and other personal property and issue their obligation# therefor” is ample authority to sustain the transaction here involved. The power to issue an “obligation” for a deposit fairly implies a power to pledge securities therefor when necessary to safeguard the return of the deposit when called upon by the'depositor. The conditions on which the deposit was made worked no hardship on other depositors. Presumably their deposits were made more secure by the additional business secured by the company through the large deposits made by defendant. The fact that assets were pledged to secure the deposit did not alter the situation. The obligations of the company were- not thereby increased in the slightest degree. It was agreed by counsel at the trial that the pledging of assets by state banks and <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>trust companies to secure deposits by public officers is a general practice throughout the State. In view of this common practice, which is one to be encouraged rather than discouraged, we fail to see how other depositors, whose rights were represented by plaintiff in the proceeding, have any standing to complain. This general practice also answers the argument that pledging of the bonds to secure one depositor in preference to others is against public policy. It surely cannot be contrary to public policy to follow a practically universal custom established by long usage and good business and which has likewise the sanction of the federal government in the deposit of its funds in national banks. In fact, we find it difficult to see in what respect an arrangement intended to safeguard public money on deposit in banks could be deemed contrary to public policy. The greater the precautions taken the better the public is secured.</p>

In McFerson v. National Surety Co., supra, the court said (page 483) : “There is no question that a bank, in order to secure deposits, may give security for them. The giving of the indemnifying bonds was within the authority of the banks, and was a matter of ordinary business. The banks owned the securities pledged to the surety company, and had full right so to pledge them. It is further undoubted that when collateral has been pledged as security the pledgor has no right to such collateral until the purpose of the pledge has been fulfilled. It is unnecessary to cite authorities on these points.”</p>

This decision was based mainly on the construction of the banking laws of that state, it being held that since no express power to pledge assets was given in the provisions of the act relating to deposits, no such power would be implied. The court in this last-named case also recognized an exception where the law required security before a deposit could be made, as in the case of public funds, in which case it would necessarily have the right to furnish the required security. In the present case we consider it needless to enter into a discussion of the relative merits of the arguments for and against the exercise of a general power to secure deposits, not only because the funds here in question were of a public nature and consequently would properly fall within the exception of the Kentucky case, but also for the reason mentioned above, that a fair and reasonable construction of the Act of 1895 discloses an intent on the part of the legislature to grant the power exercised by the trust company in this case.</p>

McElroy, <a href="/pa/254/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="254 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="1025403" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0422-01">254 Pa. 422</a>, 429. See also Lemmon v. E. Palestine Rubber Co., <a href="/pa/260/0028-02" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="260 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="1040205,1040227" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0028-02,/pa/260/0028-01">260 Pa. 28</a>, 33, to the effect that “A corporation may not avail itself even of ultra vires as a defense where a contract has been entered into and executed in good faith by the other party and the corporation has received the benefit of the performance.”</p>

An estoppel binding on the corporation likewise is binding on its creditors or receiver: Manhattan Hardware Co. v. Phalen, <a href="/pa/128/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="128 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="567011" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0110-01">128 Pa. 110</a>, 119; 14 C.

At the time defendant took office the funds standing in the name of his predecessor were already on deposit in the Carnegie Trust Company, and were permitted to remain, a transfer from one name to the other being made on the books. It is immaterial for the purpose of this case whether the' preceding collector was acting within the scope of his duties by turning this fund over to his successor rather than paying it to the county treasurer. It was in fact turned over to defendant and the bond drawn to cover “all moneys deposited <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>with the Carnegie Trust Company......including any balance on deposit at the beginning of the term hereof, together with all moneys belonging and accruing to said deposits.” In a subsequent paragraph of the obligation it is stated, “all moneys deposited with principal as depository are funds and moneys belonging to obligee in hit official capacity.” These provisions clearly contemplate and provide for the securing of the money then on deposit and which had been turned over to defendant from his predecessor in office. That the entire fund was public money is not disputed and regardless of whether the Carnegie Trust Company had been officially designated as depository of funds collected by defendant, the effect of the transaction was to secure the deposit, and, inasmuch as the company had authority to enter into the transaction, it was valid and binding against the company and those succeeding to its rights.</p>
