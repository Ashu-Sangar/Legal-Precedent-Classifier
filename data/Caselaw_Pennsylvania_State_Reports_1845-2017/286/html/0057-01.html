Defendant alleged that she signed the written contract with the understanding and belief that the parol agreement was incorporated therein; and that it was omitted by “fraud, accident or mistake.” Evidence both in support and denial of the existence of the parol agreement was produced before the chancellor, who found as a fact “that the said written agreement contains the entire contract and that no oral agreement was made at the time of its execution and omitted from it by fraud, accident or mistake.”</p>
