On October 5, 1922, the former, in his own name, leased the property to Joseph Gasner for a monthly rental. The sum agreed upon was turned over to him until February 5,1923, but for the two months following was paid to the wife, the tenant believing this course to be proper since the lease, though' executed by the husband, was in right of both. Thereafter, Pierce caused a warrant of distress to be issued for unpaid rent, insisting that he alone was entitled to that accruing, having given no express authority to his wife to make the collection. The property seized by the constable, was retaken on a writ of replevin, a claim-property bond being given by the lessee. On the issue framed to determine the rights of the parties, the matter was brought before the court, which held, — the facts as above stated having been agreed upon, — that the payment to the wife was a satisfaction of the claim for rent, though the lease had been signed by the husband alone. This ruling was reviewed and reversed by the Superior Court, and judgment was directed to be entered for the defendant. From the decision rendered leave to appeal was granted, and the legal question involved is now before us for determination.</p>

In the present case, there is no negation of the existence of the estate leased, or that the husband had the right to rent the same, but it is insisted only that in so doing he was acting also impliedly for the wife, as undisclosed principal, who was equally entitled to the income to be applied for their joint benefit. The tenant could not deny the right of the former to make the agreement, but is not estopped from showing that he had no greater estate than necessary to support the contract: 35 C. J. 1242.

So, it has been held, when the beneficial owner in fact receives the sum due, the named lessor cannot recover in a suit for the accrued rent: Niles v. Gonzales (Cal.), <a href="/citations/?q=82%20P.%20212" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="82 P. 212">82 Pae. 212</a>. It was there said in part: “While as a general rule those only are bound by a written contract who sign it, and others cannot be held whose names do not appear therein, yet an exception to this rule exists, when evidence is admitted to show that it also binds another Avho has authorized its <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>signing, because the act of the agent in signing an agreement in pursuance of the authority is in law the act of the principal.”</p>
    <p id="b559-3" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[185,492,1152,534]]]'>The rules as to agency apply in the same manner where the husband represents his wife, as where the principal and agent are in other respects strangers, and the fact that he acts for her does not prevent the latter from enforcing rights or protecting interests under the contract entered into on her behalf (30 C. J. 623, 624), though her interest is undisclosed: 30 C. J. 624; Lancaster v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., <a href="/pa/153/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="153 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="840378" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0427-01">153 Pa. 427</a>. Legally, the husband acted for himself and as agent of the wife, executing the lease in the right of both.</p>
    <p id="b559-4" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[186,1037,1156,1238]]]'>It has at least been suggested by this court that all rent could be withheld until the wife joined in the formal contract, where it appeared she was possessed of an interest in the land, demised in the name of the husband (Kunkle v. People’s Nat. Gas Co., <a href="/pa/165/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="165 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="862066" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0133-01">165 Pa. 133</a>, 138), but the exact question raised in the case at bar has not been passed upon by our appellate courts, so far as we have been able to discover. In the only lower court decision dealing with the proposition now before us, it was held that the payment to the wife worked an acquittance of the lessee: Solack v. Solack, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20D.%20592" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="28 Pa. D. 592">28 Pa. Dist. R. 592</a>. The principle controlling here was applied in Moderwell v. Mullison, <a href="/pa/21/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="21 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="411561" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0257-01">21 Pa. 257</a>, where the contract had been signed by one partner, the rent paid to the partnership, and the tenant held to be relieved from answering to the individual named as lessor. There was some evidence in the case cited that the firm was a party to the agreement. In referring to this, the court said (p. 259): “And besides, if this lot were partnership property, and used as such, the lease, though made by Mullison in his own name, would enure to the benefit of the firm; for the partners are the agents of each other in partnership-transactions.”</p>
    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.6",559,[188,2295,1150,99]],["BL_560.1",560,[271,334,1149,477]]]'>Here, though either husbánd or wife could lease, both were entitled to the income. When the former acted, it <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>was presumably with her authority, and on her behalf. Whichever collected the rent, the appropriation of it must be for their joint use, and the receiver was bound to account to the other. The payment, in good faith, by Gasner to Mrs. Pierce, must be held a satisfaction of the claim. The proper disposition of the money paid is a matter for determination between the tenants by entireties, but the lessee was relieved from further obligation when the rent was given to the wife.</p>
    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[269,830,1150,206]]]'>The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and that of the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County is affirmed, and the record is remitted with directions to enter judgment for the plaintiff.</p>
