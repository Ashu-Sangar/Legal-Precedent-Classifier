Purcell, completed the purchase of the property known as No. 69 McMunn Avenue, Crafton, Pennsylvania, paid the consideration therefor in full with his own funds and took a deed to himself. Thereafter, on October 10,1923, through a third party, he had the title transferred to himself and wife as an estate by entireties. At the latter date Purcell was wholly insolvent and indebted to plaintiff in approximately $13,000, for which it later obtained judgment and, at a sheriff’s sale upon execution issued thereon, bought his interest in the property above mentioned and filed this bill to set aside the said conveyances from Purcell and to Purcell and wife.
