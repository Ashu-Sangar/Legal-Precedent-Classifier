Plaintiff has appealed.</p>

Shuklansky, <a href="/pa/172/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="172 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="874089" data-case-paths="/pa/172/0077-01">172 Pa. 77</a>, where we held, as correctly stated in the syllabus to the report of the case, that “a rule to open a judgment entered upon a warrant of attorney is an appeal to the equitable powers of the court, and will be considered as in the nature of a bill of review, notwithstanding the fact that a rule to open the same judgment had been discharged at a previous term of court.”</p>

On appeals from orders' opening judgments, the scope of our review is very limited (Stewart v. Stewart, <a href="/pa/246/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="246 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="1006260" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0344-01">246 Pa. 344</a>, 347; Tabas v.
