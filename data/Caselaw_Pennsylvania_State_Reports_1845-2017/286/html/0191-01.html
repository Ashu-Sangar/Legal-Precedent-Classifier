These he brought to the City of Pittsburgh for the purpose of discounting, intending that the proceeds should be forwarded to Scranton for the use of a copper company in which he was interested. Abbott undertook to sell for him, on commission, two of the obligations, one for $5,000, and the other for $6,000. These were taken by the latter to the Pennsylvania Guaranty Corporation, the holder at the time of maturity, and later assigned to Chidester, the present claimant. Herman Marwitz, of McKeesport, now deceased, was induced to endorse the notes, and they were delivered to the corporation by Abbott, who received therefor, instead of cash, stock of the company. The latter then made a loan to him, with a part of the shares purchased as collateral.</p>

He died on May 22, 1922, prior to the maturity of the notes, a fact known to the then holder, to whose right Chidester has succeeded. Letters of administration were taken out on June 3, 1922, and, on June 5th, the two obligations, above referred to, having been <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>sent to Tulsa, Oklahoma, so that demand could he made upon the maker at the place fixed for payment, were protested. The certificate of the notary indicates the forwarding of a notice to Herman Marvitz, not Marwitz, without designating any place to which it was sent, and also to other endorsers. The statement is made that there was a mailing of the same “in the post office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, postage prepaid,” but no averment as to the city to which they were dispatched. On the back of the note, beneath the name Marwitz, there had been marked, in lead pencil, the street number of his former residence in McKeesport, but, admittedly, this was not done by him; and fastened to one was a slip giving the same information. The decedent had moved his home to another location in the same municipality in the April preceding, though his place of business remained unchanged.</p>

Admittedly, Márwitz died on May 22, 1922, prior to the maturity of the notes, and this fact was well known to the Pennsylvania Guaranty Corporation, the then holder of the; obligations. It was thns advised as to the likelihood'of the appointment of a personal representative, a fact which actually did occur on .June 3d, prior to their maturity, and in ample time to give notification to the collecting bank, and through it to the notary who made the formal demand on the maker. The Negotiable Instrument Act (May 16,1901, P. L. 194, section 98), expressly provides that, in case of death, notice shall be given to’ the administrator or executor, if there be one, and if, with reasonable diligence, he can be found; otherwise, notice may be sent to the last residence, or last place of business of the deceased. It was, therefore, incumbent upon the holder of the note to notify someone representing the estate of Marwitz of the fact that Smith had failed to pay the obligations, and that it would be held liable for the amount due. The death of the maker does not relieve from the requirement of giving notice to the endorser: Groth v. Gyger, <a href="/pa/31/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="31 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="985038" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0271-01">31 Pa. 271</a>. Nor does the decease of the latter render unnecessary the giving of it to his estate: Deininger v. Miller, <a href="/nys/40/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="40 N.Y.S. 195" data-case-ids="5681119" data-case-paths="/nys/40/0195-01">40 N. Y. Supp. 195</a>. If the fact of death was not learned, a mailing to the decedent’s nearest post office is sufficient (Linderman v. Guildin, <a href="/pa/34/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="34 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="417930" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0054-01">34 Pa. 54</a>), but where the knowledge exists, then reasonable diligence must be used to furnish information to the legal representative: Frayzer v. Dameron, <a href="/mo-app/6/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="6 Mo. App. 153" data-case-ids="558188" data-case-paths="/mo-app/6/0153-01">6 Mo. App. 153</a>; Goodnow v.

Thus, it has been held (Massachusetts Bank v. Oliver, <a href="/mass/64/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="10 Cush. 557" data-case-ids="1991466" data-case-paths="/mass/64/0557-01">10 Cush. 557</a>), that, where the endorser was known to be dead, a notice to the estate was held to be insufficient, where the will had actually been probated three days before, though the officers of the collecting bank were ignorant <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>of the fact. It was there said (p. 562), “yet the facts show that certain knowledge might have been obtained in a very few minutes, if any proper inquiry had been made by any of those officers.” This is true where the holder has the information, or the means of acquiring it, though the notary be entirely ignorant of the circumstances: 8 C. J. 564.</p>

Bank, <a href="/pa/277/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="277 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1079571" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0401-01">277 Pa. 401</a>), and whether such diligence has been exercised, the facts being undisputed as here, is a question of law for the court: Smith v.

The necessary advice of protest in the present case was not sent to the last actual residence of the endorser, nor was it addressed to his estate, though he was known to be dead, nor to the personal representative, though proper inquiry by the holder would have, shown the appointment of such a person prior to the date of maturity. Under these circumstances, the court below has found that due diligence was not exercised, and with this conclusion we are not disposed to interfere. It is to be noted that the receipt of any notice was denied by the widow, and administratrix, who received all the mail of Marwitz after the time of his death. The truthfulness of her testimony as to this finds corroboration in the fact that there is nothing in the certificate of the notary which shows the sending of information to McKeesport at any address.</p>

We cannot say there was any abuse of discretion in so decreeing, and therefore its order will not be set aside.</p>
