There, the remainder was held vested on the ground that the testator had used language which, “it was practically conceded,” according to the interpretation generally placed thereon “at the date of his will,” created a vested interest in those who were to take after the life <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>tenant; the court said, “That being the generally accepted meaning of the language at the time the testator used it, [it] must, in the absence of anything to the contrary, be accepted as the expression of his actual intent.”</p>
    <p id="b364-4" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[279,616,1152,911]]]'>Appellant argues that the doctrine in the Hood Case should be applied to the present case, and that, if that course be followed, we are obliged, under the law as it was settled by our decisions at the time when the will now before us was made, to hold the estate here in controversy to be vested, not contingent; but we think appellant seeks to give too broad an application to the doctrine on which he relies. When properly understood, Hood v. Penna. Society simply decides that the “generally accepted meaning” of the language used by the testator when he made his will should be considered. The Hood Case does not decide that, in passing on a particular will, the courts must examine and hold themselves bound to apply all decisions, prior to the date of the will, construing language bearing a similarity to that used by testator, although this, in effect, is the import which appellant claims for that decision.</p>

The mere fact that certain previously-decided cases happened to construe wills couched in language somewhat like, but not the same as, that employed in the one up for interpretation, will not warrant a court in holding that the words used in the latter had, because of those prior decisions, acquired a fixed judicial construction, — much less a generally accepted meaning, — which had to be adhered to under all circumstances. As correctly said by Judge Gest, speaking for the court below in banc: “Unless the phraseology is identical with that of wills which had been [previously] construed, or if not identical is at least so similar as to afford a fair basis for the presumption that the testator was familiar with [the previous construction], it <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>would be......rash to assume that he had it in mind and intended to follow it”:, see opinion reported in 7 Pa.

In the first place, as was recently said by this court, in Kirkpatrick’s Est., <a href="/pa/280/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="280 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1084419" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0306-01">280 Pa. 306</a>, 312, “Precedents are of little value in the construction of wills, because, when used under different circumstances and with different contexts, the same words may express different intentions. When the intent of the testator, and by that is meant his actual intent, can be fairly gathered from his words, the fact that another testator has used the same words with a different meaning is of no avail. Neither precedents nor rules of construction can override the testator’s expressed intent.” Next, the wills in the cases particularly relied on by appellant (Manderson v. Lukens, <a href="/pa/23/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="23 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="974089" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0031-01">23 Pa. 31</a>; Womrath v.

    <p id="b366-6" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[273,799,1152,912]]]'>Carstensen’s Estate, <a href="/pa/196/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="196 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="916820" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0325-01">196 Pa. 325</a>, called to our attention by appellant, was decided before Mulliken v. Earnshaw, <a href="/pa/209/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="209 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="936199" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0226-01">209 Pa. 226</a>; but the decision in the former is neither inconsistent with that in the latter nor with our present determination. In Carstensen’s Estate, — where the remainders were held to be vested at the death of the testator, but liable to be divested as to any one of the legatees by his or her decease, in the lifetime of the first taker, leaving a child or children, — the gift in remainder was to brothers and sisters generally, without words of contingency; whereas here, and in Mulliken v. Earnshaw, the gift in remainder is to children of testator living at a designated future time, without any distinct gift to children generally preceding such restrictive description, and this combination has been held to create a contingent remainder; for governing rule, see Craige’s App., <a href="/pa/126/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="126 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="968896" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0223-01">126 Pa. 223</a>, 232.</p>

Earnshaw; but the language to this effect differs in the several wills, and, when seeking for the meaning of a testator, differences in expression may be significant, as also may be the light thrown on a particular devise by the use of a form of expression in another part of the will under investigation. For instance, the language in the immediately preceding item of the present will, which, as previously noted, indicates that testator knew how, in apt words, to create an unquestionable vested remainder when he desired to do so, <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>has some relevant force in construing the item with which we are immediately concerned. It was just such considerations as here pointed out, and which occur in almost all will cases, that led Chief Justice Sharswood to say, in Fox’s App., <a href="/pa/99/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="99 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="446165" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0382-01">99 Pa. 382</a>, 386: “Every will..... is to be construed from its four corners to arrive at the true intention of the testator; decisions'upon other wills may- assist but cannot control the construction.”</p>

In this connection, appellant calls attention to Groninger’s Est., <a href="/pa/268/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="268 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1061559" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0184-01">268 Pa. 184</a>, 188-89, where, quoting from earlier opinions, we said: “ What is required in such case is not that the words of the will admit of a possible, or even a reasonable, inference that the testator intended a contingent remainder, but that such intention should appear plainly, manifestly and indisputably,’ otherwise the estate in remainder is always held to be vested.” Here, however, the court below concluded that, reading the will as a whole, the language of the particular devise manifested an intention to create contingent remainders; and we are not convinced of error in this conclusion. But, whether we hold that the rule in Carstensen’s Estate applies, and that the remainders to testator’s children were vested, subject to be divested in the case of any"such remainder-men dying during the life-tenancy, leaving children, or that the rule in Mulliken v. Earnshaw (p. 231) applies, —that “Where real or personal estate, is devised or bequeathed to......such children who shall......be living at a certain [future] time, without any distinct gift to the whole class preceding such restrictive description, so that the uncertain event forms part of the description of the devisee or legatee, the interest so'devised is necessarily contingent on account of the person,” — the re-<a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>suit is the same; for here the child in question (son of testator and father of appellant) died, during the life-tenancy of his mother (the widow of testator), leaving children, hence his estate, if vested, was divested in favor of these children, or if contingent, never came into his possession for testamentary disposition. All of which leads to the conclusion that the decree complained of is unassailable.</p>
