The improvements contemplated vacation of several streets, opening, widening and paving of others, the relocation and removal of existing railroad tracks on various streets, and elimination of grade crossings, the object being to provide easy access to docks and piers on the Delaware River front in that locality from all parts of the city, and by these changes greatly improve its shipping facilities.</p>
    <p id="b28-7" data-blocks='[["BL_28.9",28,[247,1858,1149,534]],["BL_29.1",29,[198,382,1153,1676]]]'>As part of the improvement, the city opened Delaware Avenue at a width of 150 feet from Christian Street to ^Bigler Street, thence following former Commercial Avenue, a width of 200 feet, as far south as Porter Street, the northern line of defendant’s property, and from that point southward through defendant’s property, Delaware Avenue, formerly Commercial Avenue, was widened to 250 feet. In 1923 the city adopted an ordinance for the paving and curbing of Commercial Avenue now Delaware Avenue through defendant’s <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>property and, pursuant to its provisions, the city entered into a contract with the use-plaintiffs in this case for the performance of the work. The cost of the improvement was assessed against abutting owners on a front-foot basis and liens entered against defendant’s property for its proportionate share of the cost. Defendant’s affidavit of defense to the scire facias issued in each case was the same and denied the right of the city to recover, setting up, first, the improvement was not a local one assessable against abutting properties, but part of a scheme for the general public improvement and benefit of the city as a whole, and accordingly its cost should be paid out of public funds; second, the assessment against defendant’s property was arbitrary and discriminatory, resulting in denial to defendant of equal protection of the law and consequently in violation of the state and federal Constitutions for the reasons : (a) the city paid out of its general funds the cost of improvement in part of the same street in front of similar properties; (b) the street had been arbitrarily widened an additional 50 feet through defendant’s property, thereby imposing on defendant an additional cost of paving; (c) the character ^Pthe paving was arbitrarily changed in front of defendant’s property, making the cost nearly double that charged for paying in front of other properties; (d) the city delayed over ten years in making the improvement, during which time the cost of the work had very materially increased. A rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense was made absolute by the court below and defendant appealed.</p>

There is no averment, however, that the property is rural in its nature, or that the operation of the plants do not require the conveniences and facilities of city life. And further defendant expressly avers that “the scheme of general public improvement as aforesaid has been largely completed,” stating in addition that Delaware Avenue in front of defendant’s property has been opened and widened to a distance of 250 feet in the middle of which are located four railroad tracks and two more to be subsequently laid, making a total of 60 feet in width used exclusively for railroad purposes, and that the bed of the street in front of defendant’s property has been paved with granite blocks upon a granite base, all of which is part of the general scheme of public improvement, as provided in the original ordinance and agreement.</p>

In the present instance (as the effect will always be if the planning is wise) this resulting stimulus was not felt by Delaware Avenue alone, but by all the neighborhood affected by this part of the improvement, and, by the removal of the grade crossings elsewhere, not only the streets named in the contract, but the near-by property in every direction therefrom, probably extending for miles to the southward of the elevated railroad tracks. All this, however, is beside the questions here, which are: Had the City of Philadelphia a reasonable right to believe, and hence to act on the belief, that Delaware Avenue, in the neighborhood of defendant’s property, was ripe for the paving at the time it was done, irrespective of the question as to what was the cause of its reaching that condition, and was defendant’s property specially benefited by the paving? If these questions are answered in favor of the city, as they must be because of defendant’s failure to prove otherwise, that is the end of the controversy.”</p>

The benefit derived cannot be other than direct or special to the land merely because other properties are benefited in a similar manner or, as incident to the improvement, the entire community is benefited. In a sense, the entire community is benefited by every improvement which tends to add a commercial or financial benefit to the city. The advantage of more convenient access to a particular lot of land and having a front upon a more desirable avenue are direct benefits to that property and give it an increased value in itself, as distinguished from the benefit derived by the community or other property situated on the general line of improvements. This question was discussed in a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in United States v. Eiver Eouge Improvement Company, published in advance sheets of February 1,1926, on page 148. In that case the United States Government decided to deepen and widen Eouge Eiver which empties in the Detroit Eiver to afford a greater opportunity for loading and unloading large vessels. The improvement included the straightening, widening and deepening of the channel for a considerable distance and the appropriation of abutting property. The contention was that the remaining portions of the land abutting on the improvement would receive special and direct benefits by reason of the widening of the river and the more convenient access thereby obtained to their docks, while on the other hand the contention of defendant was, as here, that the improvement <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>as a whole was one intended for the general benefit of the port, and no special and direct benefit accrued to defendant which would warrant the assessment against it. In the course of the opinion of the Supreme Court by-Mr. Justice Sanford, it was said (page 151): “We are of opinion that an increase in the value of the remaining portion of any parcel of land caused by its frontage on the widened river, carrying a right of immediate access to and use of the improved stream, would constitute a special and direct benefit within the meaning of the statute, as distinguished from a benefit common to all the lands in the vicinity, although the remaining portions of other riparian parcels would be similarly benefited. This is in accordance with the rule recognized by this court and established by the weight of authority in the state courts in reference to special benefits to lands abutting upon a new or widened street;.....The advantages of more convenient access to the particular lot or land in question, and of having a front upon a more desirable avenue, are direct benefits to that lot, giving it increased value in itself. It may be the same, in greater or less degree, with each and every lot of land upon the same street. But such advantages are direct and special to each lot. They are in no proper sense common because there are several estates, or many even, that are similarly benefited.”</p>

If the assessment against defendant was proper it is no defense that' an assessment was not made against another abuttingjowner. The right to assess by the front-foot rule is a statutory one and is not dependent upon absolute uniformity throughout the city where conditions may requiré a different plan of pavement. A contrary rule would prevent a municipality, which has at any time adopted the plan of paying for paving out of general funds, from making a change <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>to another method and assessing the cost against abutting owners as the latter, under such circumstances, could, at all times, claim they had already paid their share of the improvement in front of other properties by way of general taxation and should not now be called upon to pay for the entire improvement in front of their own property. The objection here raised was made in Huidekoper v. City of Meadville, <a href="/pa/83/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="83 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1050822" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0156-01">83 Pa. 156</a>, and held to constitute no defense.</p>
    <p id="b34-4" data-blocks='[["BL_34.4",34,[254,850,1153,1015]]]'>With respect to the claim that the addition of 50 feet to the width of the street in front of defendant’s property increased the cost of paving, and made its assessment larger than that of any other abutting owner, this argument might have been used at the time the street was laid out and the damages assessed; it has, however, no place in the present proceeding. When the street was opened, defendant was given the benefit of the rule that the measure of damages is the difference between the market value of the property before and after the opening of the street. In fixing this amount, the cost it would subsequently be obliged to pay for paving the street in front of its property as of the width newly established, should have been, and presumably was, taken into account as affecting the damages. Questions regarding the width of the street and the increased cost of paving were, consequently, adjudicated in that proceeding and cannot be reconsidered here: Phila. v. Crew-Levick Co., <a href="/pa/278/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="278 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1080559" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0218-01">278 Pa. 218</a>, 222.</p>

It was the right of the city to determine the quality of pavement, the manner of doing the work, the terms of the contract, etc., without consulting abutting owners: Phila. v. Jewell, <a href="/pa/135/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="135 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="817442" data-case-paths="/pa/135/0329-01">135 Pa. 329</a>, 339; Phila. v.

    <p id="b35-4" data-blocks='[["BL_35.4",35,[199,645,1150,429]]]'>The fact that on account of tbe delay in tbe paving of tbe street there was a considerable increase in tbe cost by reason of tbe advance in price for labor, materials, etc., is not a defense.
