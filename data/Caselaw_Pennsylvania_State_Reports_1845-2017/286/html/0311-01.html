Gailey was employed at the time of his death by E. F. Diamond and E. S. Dickey,” the individual defendants; testimony by Diamond that the arrangement with Gailey was that, “besides getting out......coal,” he was to “take care of the mine......in general......, — keep the water out, keep the pump going,” — for which he was to receive a fixed compensation at the rate of from $1.90 to $2 a ton on the output, and that, in paying Gailey on the tonnage basis, they “allowed him more than otherwise, to compensate him for that work,” meaning the general care of the mine. Diamond said they told Gailey, from time to time, the amount of coal to mine, but the latter was free to hire whom he pleased to help him get it out. In conjunction with this, the witness stated that the reason for leaving Gailey free in hiring men to get out the coal was because “he knew more about mining coal than we did”; and this bit of testimony might be understood as tending to negative the idea, suggested by Gailey’s freedom of action in hiring men, that the owners were interested only in the results of the operation of mining the coal. Diamond stated also that, though in recent years the mine owners had not taken “any men out to the mine and put them to work,” yet <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>they had pursued this course “several years ago,” while Gailey (or his father, who had occupied a similar position) was in charge of getting out the coal; and the witness said nothing to suggest that the mine owners had surrendered such right. The product of the mine was generally sold from the main office, but Gailey at times disposed of coal at the mine itself, collecting the money and turning it in to the firm; and this latter service was considered part of his duties covered by the payment of so much per ton. Diamond testified that Gailey’s name did not appear on the bills sent to customers, but that his name did appear, as “foreman,” on the bills “as they came in.” In answer to the question, “Did you consider Mr. Gailey an employee of yours?” this witness said, “Well, in a way an employee, yes”; then he added that, under the arrangement with Gailey, they could have discharged him at any time; and he admitted that his firm had taken out an insurance policy in which David W. Gailey and the other men in the mine, whom the latter hired, were included as employees of the firm. R. R. Jones, who appeared as a witness for the mine owners and stated that he was in their employ, took care of their books, collected their bills, and “paid the men” (meaning the men at the mine), said that the payment was made directly to Gailey at regular intervals, in a lump cash sum based on the amount of tonnage reported by him. Gailey then paid the men, retaining the difference over their wages (about 86c a ton) as his net compensation. Finally, Jones stated, it was not only part of his duty to see, for the owners of the mine, that “the miners were paid,” but also to see that they “did their work in the right way”; so the record contains some evidence that the owners of the mine were interested in the manner in which the work in Gailey’s charge was performed, as well as in the results achieved, and that they assumed control, through their representative Jones, to the extent indicated.</p>

Our sole concern' is to see that competent proofs are present which support the material points of the claimant’s case, — here, that Gailey was an employee as that status is defined in the compensation law and as it is distinguished by our decisions from the status of an independent contractor. As already shown, the record does contain evidence on these essential points, and be the proofs meager or plentiful, weak or strong, they are present and legally competent; hence the referee’s findings that “decedent at time of his [accidental] death was acting as a mine foreman or superintendent of defendant’s mine on a per ton basis,” and that he was not acting as an independent contractor, will not be disturbed.</p>
