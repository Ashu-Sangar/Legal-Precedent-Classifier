Conner, who died on March 21, 1905. After making provision in her will for her now deceased husband, she gave the residue of her estate to the accountant in trust, to be held for the <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>benefit, in equal parts, of two sons and their children, “free and clear of debts, contracts, engagements, alienations and anticipations, and free and clear of all levies, attachments, executions and sequestrations.” One-half of the income was to be paid to one son, Alvin Brinckle, and his child, Minor Gordon Brinckle; the second portion to the other, Addington L. Brinckle, and his child.</p>
    <p id="b409-5" data-blocks='[["BL_409.4",409,[174,725,1152,860]]]'>Alvin is now deceased, and the return from the fund created for his benefit is payable to Minor so long as he lives. Upon his death, the principal was given by the will to descendants of the latter, or the representatives of those who may not have survived their parents. As to the other one-half, a monthly payment was set aside for Addington during his life, the balance accruing being payable to his son, and to the latter was given the entire income upon the demise of his father. Upon the death of both of those named, the principal was given to the descendants of the grandson, if any survived. He died, however, after his father without any issue. Provision was made for the disposition, in this contingency, of the second half of the residuary estate so held, by two clauses of the will, the interpretation of which has given rise to the present controversy.</p>
    <p id="b409-6" data-blocks='[["BL_409.5",409,[175,1596,1149,749]],["BL_410.1",410,[292,348,1148,89]]]'>The testatrix first directed that, in case of the death of both Addington and his son, if “there shall be no descendants of my said grandson then living, to pay over, assign and convey the principal of said share to my grandson, Minor Gordon Brinckle,” the child of Alvin, and the one entitled to the income of the other one-half. This provision was immediately followed by the clause “in trust in case of the decease of my said son, Adding-ton L. Brinckle, and his son, Addington Gordon Brinckle, without their [there] being, at the death of the survivor, any descendants of my said grandson then living, to pay over, assign and convey the principal of said share to the trustee of the other moiety of my residuary estate, to be held upon the same trusts as though said <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>share had originally formed part of said other part or share.”</p>

The court below determined that the one-half in question should be retained by the trustee of the residuary estate, and the income alone given to appellant during his lifetime, the principal to await distribution until death, at which period it would pass to his children or the descendants of any who may not have survived. One son has been born to him and is living, and was represented in this proceeding by a guardian ad litem. The wording of the will is unfortunate, in that there is a direction to pay to the present claimant the principal of the one-half share held in trust for Adding-ton and his son, immediately followed, as observed, by the provision that this portion of the residue, in the contingency which has occurred, should be held by the trustee as a part of the residuary estate “on the same trusts as though the said share had originally formed part of said other part or share,” referring to that half indisputably held for the grandson, Minor, during life only.</p>

In passing upon the correctness of this contention, it is to be kept in mind that, where an unlimited gift has been made, the interest passing will not be reduced by later words appearing in the will, unless it is reasonably certain that this was the intention. “Where a testator in the first instance uses language suitable to the grant of a fee simple estate, but, by subsequent words, immediately following in the devise, indicates a dominant intent to give only a less estate, the latter purpose will be upheld......On the other hand, where it is apparent from the words of the will that the dominant <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>purpose of the testator is to devise a fee simple estate, and the subsequent language indicates merely a subordinate intent to strip the estate thus given of one or more of its inherent attributes, the law will hold that this cannot be done; and the fee simple estate passes to the devisee with all of its inherent qualities”: Pattin v.

In the present case, a reading of the entire will makes plain the purpose of Mrs. Conner to provide for her sons, and then for the grandsons who are living at the time of their death, and that the principal shall pass ultimately to the great-grandchildren. It will be noted that spendthrift trusts were provided for the descendants of the first and second generations so there could be no dissipation of the estate during their lives, a clear indication of the desire that the entire corpus be preserved for those to take finally.</p>

Rules of construction have no place in determining the disposition of the property devised, where the intention of the decedent can be fairly gathered from the words employed (Deeter’s Est., supra), yet it may be noted that the two paragraphs, one giving the absolute estate, and the other providing for continuance of the one-half of the fund in trust, appear in the order named, and if the matter were to be determined on consideration alone of the two repugnant and irreconcilable phrases, the latter would necessarily control: Buechley’s Est., <a href="/pa/283/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="283 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1090534" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0107-01">283 Pa. 107</a>; White’s Est., <a href="/pa/132/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="132 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="970499" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0017-01">132 Pa. 17</a>; Patton’s Est., <a href="/pa/268/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="268 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="1061593" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0367-01">268 Pa. 367</a>. Under the circum<a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>stances appearing here, it is not necessary to apply this principle of construction, though adverted to by the learned court in passing upon the question involved.</p>
