Ample testimony was given to show that neither lights nor guards were in place at the point of accident at the time plaintiff met with her injury; the court below, however, in charging the jury, stated the “only question before the court is whether' or not the plaintiff has sued the right party,” and being of opinion she had errone<a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>ously named the borough as defendant, directed a verdict in its favor, for the reason that, it having placed the work in the hands of a contractor, without reserving control over the manner in which the work should be performed, it was not responsible for injury resulting from negligence on the part of the contractor to persons lawfully using the street. Plaintiff appealed.</p>
    <p id="b51-3" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[200,739,1153,864]]]'>The contract provides, among its numerous provisions, that, in absence of permission to the contrary, “the material excavated from the trench and the materials of construction shall be so deposited and the work shall be so conducted as to leave open and free for pedestrian traffic all crosswalks, a space on each sidewalk not less than one-third of the width of the sidewalk, and for vehicular traffic a roadway not less than eight feet in width. All street hydrants, water gates and fire alarm boxes shall be kept accessible for use. During the progress of the work the contractor shall maintain crosswalks, sidewalks, and roadways in satisfactory condition, and the work shall at all times’be so conducted as to cause a minimum of inconvenience to public travel, and to permit safe and convenient access to private and public property along the line of work.</p>

These provisions clearly distinguish the present action from Painter v.

On the contrary, this case comes directly within Norbeck v. Phila., <a href="/pa/224/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="224 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="963084" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0030-01">224 Pa. 30</a>, and Chas. E. Johnson Company v.

Under an agreement of this character and the cases last referred to, an obligation is imposed upon the municipality to see that a highway under construction, repair or improvement is maintained in a reasonably safe condition for both pedestrian use and vehicular traffic.</p>
