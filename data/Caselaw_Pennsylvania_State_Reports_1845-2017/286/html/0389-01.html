Agnew, in fee. Emily Dutilh, the second of the daughters named in the will, died October 7, 1921, unmarried and without issue. The one-third of the income payable to her was awarded by the orphans’ court (affirmed by the Superior Court, <a href="/pa-super/80/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="80 Pa.

Bell, the last surviving daughter, died September 26, 1925, leaving a will in which she exercised her power of appointment, giving to each of her three children pecuniary legacies and the residue of her estate, including the portion of the trust fund, if any remaining, over which she had power of appointment, to trustees in trust to pay the income to her children for life, with further provisions as to the corpus.</p>

It is contended by appellants, that two-thirds of the principal of the fund passes under Mrs. Bell’s will, or that, if the one-third which was limited to Emily, the daughter who died unmarried and without issue, is distributable to her heirs and next of kin, such persons are to be ascertained as of the date of the termination of the trust. The orphans’ court decided against appellants upon both contentions and we think both conclusions correct. Appellants’ counsel argue that the words “as aforesaid” in the phrase, “in respect to the share or portion, the income of which was paid to her <em>as aforesaid” </em>refer to the share of income which was being paid to Mrs. Bell at the time of her death, to wit, two-thirds thereof following the death of her sister Emily, and that these words fix the share of the principal, over which Mrs. Bell had the power of appointment, at that fraction of the principal, two-thirds. We do not so construe the words “as aforesaid.” To our minds they refer to a share in the principal of the fund measured by the share of income received by each daughter at the time of the death of the testator. The language <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>is, “to my said <em>respective </em>daughters in such manner and proportions as <em>she </em>shall have directed in any last will ......executed by <em>her </em>in respect <em>to the share or portion </em>the income of which was paid to her as aforesaid,” and, in default of a will, to such persons as would be entitled under the intestate laws “if <em>she </em>had died possessed thereof,” thus indicating a purpose to keep the three interests separate.</p>
    <p id="b417-7" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[185,788,1152,861]]]'>In order to sustain the construction that the heirs of Emily are to be ascertained as. of the death of the last surviving daughter, appellants would have us insert the word “then” before “died” in the phrase reading, “if she had [then] died possessed thereof,” citing as authority for our so doing Lippincott’s Est., <a href="/pa/276/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="276 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="1077538" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0283-01">276 Pa. 283</a>. We think it unnecessary to do this in order to ascertain the testator’s intent, which is manifest from the very words he used. Those who were to take in default of a will or of children or issue of children are “such persons as would be entitled thereto under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania <em>if she had died possessed thereof </em>single and unmarried.” If she had died possessed thereof her heirs would have been those living at the time of her death: Murphey’s Est., <a href="/pa/276/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="276 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="1077657" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0498-01">276 Pa. 498</a>; Crolius v.
