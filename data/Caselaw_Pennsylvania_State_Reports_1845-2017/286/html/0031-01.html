Then, during plaintiffs’ closing address to the jury, several other points were handed up, which the court refused to answer. This refusal was quite within the judge’s right, irrespective of any printed court rule on the subject; and, in addition, we are not convinced that the failure to charge on these particular requests did defendants any substantial harm. This disposes of the last question involved.</p>
