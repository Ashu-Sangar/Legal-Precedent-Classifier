An application was made to the orphans’ court, by the administrator of Elizabeth Myers, deceased, for leave to sell the property, in accordance with the terms of this contract, to pay the debts of decedent; and, in that proceeding, although the interests of the minor children were not represented, the court granted the prayer of the petition. Demand was made on defendant to pay the balance of the purchase money, and, <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>when he declined, an action in assumpsit was brought against him for the amount due. Plaintiff recovered a verdict; defendant filed a motion “for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v.”; the court below granted the first and refused the second, saying, inter alia, “We are of opinion that a failure to petition the court for appointment of a guardian ad litem and have such appointment made prior to the giving of notice provided for in the act of assembly, was a fatal defect in the proceeding [before the orphans’ court to obtain authority to sell the property in controversy] and renders the deed [tendered by plaintiffs to defendant] invalid.” To this the court added: “We observe, however, from the testimony, that defendant still retains possession of this property and feel therefore that plaintiff should have opportunity to promptly proceed and obtain a proper order of court and execute and deliver the deed in compliance with the contract. The defendant also testified at the trial that he was always ready and willing to receive a proper deed for the premises, and......the plaintiff should have an opportunity to procure a proper decree of court and then present a proper deed to the defendant.”</p>

L. 221. This act was recently construed by us in March v. Phila. &amp; West Chester T.
