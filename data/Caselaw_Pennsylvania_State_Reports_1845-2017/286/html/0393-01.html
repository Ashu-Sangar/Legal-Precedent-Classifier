Subsequently the court in banc entered judgment for plaintiff non obstante veredicto, and this appeal by defendants followed. In considering it, as appellee’s counsel frankly admits, all the facts and inferences therefrom, which are favorable to defendants, must be taken as true, and all such as are unfavorable to them, if depending solely on testimony, must be rejected : Fluke v.

It was heavily encumbered; plaintiff (who was a lender of money upon property already thus greatly burdened) was the holder of the fifth mortgage thereon, and also of judgments, which were the eighth, ninth and tenth in <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>point of lien. A building association, which held the second mortgage, had entered up the bond and warrant of attorney accompanying it, and the property was advertised for sheriff’s sale on a fi.- fa. issued on that judgment. Learning of this fact, plaintiff sent for appellant’s husband, and stated that he, plaintiff, had been in communication with counsel for the execution creditor, who would stay the sale if $10,000 was paid on account of his client’s judgment, and the property was deeded to a nominee of plaintiff, to assure its proper refinancing by plaintiff. He urgently requested the acceptance of this proposition, and said that if appellant would make the necessary transfers to his, plaintiff’s, son-in-law and partner, he, plaintiff, would advance the $10,000 necessary to be paid in order to obtain the stay, would arrange to borrow from a building association, with which he was connected, the sum of $30,000 on a second mortgage, would pay all the encumbrances on the property (except-the first mortgage of $70,000, which was to remain undisturbed), and would himself take a third mortgage for the amount due to him, plus a counsel fee of $500, and “six per cent for placing the $30,000 building and loan mortgage, and ten per cent on the money he had to put up.” He also said that, if this course was pursued, the property would be, reconveyed to appellant after the refinancing was completed, pending which she was to remain in absolute possession of it. Subsequently, the plan was modified by providing for a new first mortgage, for a larger^ amount than the existing one; appellant’s husband negotiated it, at plaintiff’s request, because told it was for her benefit.</p>

At the same time the son-in-law <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>signed and delivered a declaration of trust (prepared and the execution thereof witnessed by plaintiff’s counsel), in which, after acknowledging the receipt of the foregoing papers, he stated he held the property in trust to pay the current and future operating expenses of the apartments, the taxes, encumbrances, etc., and thereafter for appellant, as the owner “of the equitable interest in the said property, and entitled to the rent or increment received” from it. He also agreed therein to reconvey both the real and personal property to her or her assigns, after the amounts specified had been paid.</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[273,932,1149,966]]]'>In the meantime, one Emanuel Barrick filed a bill in equity, the exact nature of which is not stated, but which prevented the refinancing of the property; whereupon plaintiff urged appellant’s husband to negotiate for a purchase of the claim, again stating that he asked this because appellant was the equitable owner of the property. Her husband complied with this request, and $2,700, the amount Barrick agreed to accept, was paid to him, on the day of the sheriff’s sale, by virtue of a written order of appellant, out of the rent moneys which her husband had given plaintiff shortly before that date. This sum was hers, as the one ultimately entitled to those rents, when, as in that instance, they were not used for the other purposes specified in the declaration of trust. On being paid, Barrick quitclaimed his interest to plaintiff’s son-in-law, the then holder of the title, thus clearing the way for carrying out the settlement arranged. «</p>

On examining the record, it was discovered that, although the property had been sold on a fi. fa., inquisition had not been waived, and hence the company refused to issue the necessary policies, unless appellant would execute and file a waiver of inquisition. Plaintiff thereupon said to appellant’s husband that “the property had been purchased for [appellant] and they were acting as agent for her under the trusteeship, and [hence it would be] foolish for [her] not to furnish a waiver and stop the return of the sale for the terms of the sale not being complied with.” Relying on these statements, appellant executed a waiver of inquisition, post-dating it to precede the time the execution had issued, and it was delivered to plaintiff, who filed it of record, and he was thus able to get from the trust company, whose mortgage was negotiated by appellant’s husband, and from the building association, with which plaintiff was connected, the additional money needed in order to settle with the sheriff and obtain title to the property, which was taken in his own name.</p>

She finally received from him, during September, 1924, — some seven or eight months after the sheriff’s sale — a written account, in which he attempted to charge her, in addition to the amount he said was due to him, a bonus of twenty per cent thereon, instead of the ten per cent agreed on, and an additional twenty per cent bonus on the total of his alleged claim, including the first named bonus, the amount of the two being $15,817.26. This was, of course, improper; and the amount was also erroneous in that three credits to which appellant was entitled were not given. They were for $2,850 (above referred to), $887.62 and $1,625.93, respectively. For the first two of them, plaintiff then and there gave appellant a written memorandum of their amount. The third was a sum paid by her counsel, but which plaintiff neglected to allow. None of them was disputed.</p>

Plaintiff still said that it was appellant’s, and produced a written memorandum showing, as he alleged, that $163,000 was the amount necessary to be expended in order to pay the first and second mortgages and the money due to him. He asked appellant to accept $35,000, and allow him to keep the balance of the purchase price, which would have given to him an amount far in excess of the sum he was entitled to under their agreement, and nearly or quite three times the bonus he claimed four months before.

But here that relation arose after the execution issued, and one of its purposes was to protect appellant from the results which otherwise might flow from selling under that execution. Hence, even if nothing else appeared, plaintiff could not obtain a valid title at a sale, from the effect of which he agreed to protect appellant, without giving her express and clear notice of his intention to be no longer bound by his agreement, at a time which would give her ample opportunity to preserve her rights. Nor is there anything in the claim that, since plaintiff’s son-in-law was the trustee named in the declaration of trust, plaintiff himself was not affected. Equity is not so blind as this contention presupposes. The son-in-law was indeed the trustee named in the writing, and doubtless would have been debarred from becoming an antagonistic purchaser, because he chose to assume that relation. But plaintiff himself was the one relied on by appellant; he was the one jointly interested with <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>her; he controlled all that was done; it was at his request, and on his promise to protect her, that she made the transfers of her real and personal property, executed such other papers as he desired, and obtained part of the money required in order to carry out the plan agreed on. To her, therefore, he owed the utmost good faith, and he cannot be permitted to retain a title derived through a breach of that duty.</p>

There, defendant gave to plaintiff a judgment .note containing a waiver of exemption, but nevertheless claimed the exemption when execution was issued against his land. Instead of proceeding to have the claim set aside, plaintiff agreed with defendant that, if the latter would withdraw the claim, and he, plaintiff became the purchaser of the land, he would deed back to defendant the homestead and fifteen acres adjoining it. Defendant thereupon withdrew the waiver, plaintiff obtained title through the sheriff’s shle, and after-wards attempted to repudiate his promise.
