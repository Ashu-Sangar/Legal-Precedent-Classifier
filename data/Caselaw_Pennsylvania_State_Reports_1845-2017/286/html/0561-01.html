Shortly thereafter the Titusville Amusement Company, Robert A.

The bill prayed an injunction to prevent each and all of. the defendants “from in any manner howsoever acting or proceeding under or in pursuance” of said ordinance, and the Titusville Iron Works Company “from in any manner howsoever taking or holding possession of, or obstructing or constructing any structure or building on, over or upon any part of or all of that portion” of the street specified in the ordinance.</p>

They strenuously contended, however, both below and here, that sustaining the ordinance would result in the taking of private property (e. g. the private easement above referred to) for private use; but this is an evident mistake, so far as concerns the city and its officials, for, as already shown, the vacation was only “as a public street,” and with nothing else had or have these particular defendants anything to do.

Here, however, the ordinance does not authorize the taking of anything, but only the giving up of the city’s rights in “a public street,” without reference to any other rights in or over the soil thereof; and hence, in the absence of a controlling statute, the consequential loss, if any, must be borne by those who suffer it: McGee’s App., supra.</p>

We are not unmindful that, in Jessop v. Kittanning Borough (No. 1), <a href="/pa/225/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="225 Pa. 583" data-case-ids="965368" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0583-01">225 Pa. 583</a>, the municipality’s appeal from an injunction was dismissed, because the real wrongdoer was decreed to pay the costs, and, it was said, the borough, though innocent, was not harmed by the injunction, if it did not intend to do the thing which it was enjoined from doing. It is clear to us, however, that this is a palpable misapplication of a well settled legal principle. The fact that the borough was not awarded the statutory costs allowed- to it, was in itself a financial hurt, but the objection to the conclusion there reached is far greater. If a plaintiff may <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>charge two defendants with actual or premeditated wrong, he may charge a hundred, and, on appeal, may sustain an injunction against all, or any of the innocent parties, whether or not one or none of the others has been guilty of wrongdoing; for the same supposed absence of harm would appear in any and every such event. A decree awarding an injunction against an innoeént party is, in and of itself, a harm to him, calling for reversal; for he is required to defend himself against a charge of actual or intended wrongdoing, and, when he successfully does so, he is enjoined exactly as if the charge had been proved. Surely this is indefensible. Our Brother Frazer, when sitting in the common pleas, in O’Donnell v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/234/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="234 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="982493" data-case-paths="/pa/234/0401-01">234 Pa. 401</a>, followed the true practice, which is to enjoin the guilty party only.</p>

In antagonism to this claim, plaintiffs rely on the general rule set forth in their bill, as above quoted, viz: that as their predecessors purchased according to a plan upon which Washington Street, then an unopened private street, was plotted, that street, while it may be vacated as a public highway, cannot be closed, nor their private easement over it be impaired, without their consent. The rule, even as thus stated, has no applicability, however, to the Titusville Amusement Company and Robert A. McKie, for those two plaintiffs do not own any property which was embraced within the plan; and for this reason the bill should have been dismissed so far as concerns them. The property of Albert E. Hobart, the intervening plaintiff, is on the plan, however, and his predecessors in title purchased directly from Mrs. Chase, for whom the plan was prepared. True, his lot does not abut on Washington Street, but this fact alone will not operate to deprive him of the right to complain. Under proper circumstances, every lot owner on a plan, whether or not he is <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>an abutter on tbe particular street, has the right to object to any one obstructing it: Garvey v.

In that year, he laid out the Village of Titusville, and had it surveyed, and a plan of the lots and streets made. His plan did not include the property which is the subject of this controversy; but Washington Street, which appeared on it, extended nearly or quite to the edge of that property. By the Act of March 6, 1847, P. L. 224, the village was incorporated as a borough, and commissioners were named to survey, define and mark its boundaries, within which was included all the property under consideration here.</p>

On March 25, 1861, she approved a plan of so much of her property as was located between what was known as the Mill Race and Oil Creek. This plan was named the “E. H. Chase Addition to the Town of Titusville”; for convenience we shall call it the Chase Plan. Washington Street, including the part here vacated, appeared on it, as a direct extension of the street already opened in the built-up portion of the borough. Her first deed of any part of that property was executed September 14,1861, and recorded February 10, 1862. It did not describe the land purchased by reference to either the lot numbers on the plan, or to the streets plotted thereon, but started at a given distance from a white walnut corner, and continuing by courses and distances to the place of beginning. Apparently it gave to the <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>grantee no express right to nse any of the streets on the plan, but contained a provision “excepting and reserving for the use of a public street all that part of the said land which would be included and which is now marked out on the [Chase Plan]......as Washington Street.” It is clear, therefore, that the intention was not to grant a private easement over Washington Street, but to tender it as a public street, thereby vesting in and imposing upon the grantee, and on future purchasers of lots according to the plan, all the rights and limitations which grew out of that fact. Mr. Hobart, whose predecessor’s title arose long subsequent to that date, was affected by what appeared in that deed, since it was directly in his line of title from the same grantor.</p>
    <p id="b594-6" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[277,1119,1154,1129]]]'>On August 15, 1861, by decree of court, duly entered on the petition of the borough, it was given leave to accept the benefits of the Borough Act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320. Section 27, clause IV, of that statute (page 327) provides that streets “when duly opened according to law, <em>or by agreement of parties, </em>are hereby declared public highways, over which the corporation shall exercise jurisdiction under the provisions of this act.” This operated as an acceptance of Mrs. Chase’s tender, herein-before referred to, and Washington Street became a public street, as she intended it should be. At that time she still owned the lot which now belongs to Mr. Hobart, and hence its later sale by her was necessarily subject to the effect of that acceptance. Thereafter the borough seems to have taken charge of the street, for we find the borough employees clearing out its gutters and filling up its center, for the purpose of making proper drainage, exactly as is done in regard to opened public dirt roads <em>elsewhere; </em>and, on August 25,1864, the borough council directed “that a crossing be constructed across Washington Street” within the territory covered by the plan.</p>

This he did, using, inter alia, the <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>Chase Plan, and made a report to the council, which body, on December 18, 1865, resolved that the “town surveyor’s new map of the Borough of Titusville be adopted as the official map of the borough and ordered on file.” ’ At the instance of plaintiffs, the court below decided that the “municipality, by said resolution, thereby accepted and adopted said E. H. Chase plan of lots and streets as an addition to the municipality, now City of Titusville.” As Washington Street was on the “town surveyor’s new map.....; [thus] adopted as the official map of the borough,” exactly as it appeared on the Chase Plan, and was actually being used as a public street, it necessarily follows that, by the resolution, the borough either “accepted and adopted” the street as an open public street, or “accepted and adopted” it as a projected public street not yet legally opened. If the former, then when Mr. Hobart’s predecessor in title purchased, some eighteen months later, he bought a property which had no private easement over Washington Street, and hence none could arise when it was later vacated: Tesson v. Porter Co., <a href="/pa/238/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="238 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="991572" data-case-paths="/pa/238/0504-01">238 Pa. 504</a>; Bell v.

If the latter contingency resulted, then the subsequent purchase of the Hobart lot was with notice that the projected street'might be legally opened at a subsequent date (as it admittedly was by the city ordinance of April 25, 1869), and the only thing which Mr. Hobart became assured of, on a subsequent vacation, was a right of way “limited to one reasonably necessary to the enjoyment of the lot sold; if another [way] is open, the easement is lost of necessity”: Gailey v. Wilkinsburg Real Estate Trust Co., <a href="/pa/283/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="283 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="1090499" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0381-01">283 Pa. 381</a>, 386. The other way to which he was entitled, he had by the street on which his lot actually abutted, and the other highways connected therewith In either event, therefore, for this reason also, he had no right to object to the vacation of the portion of Washington Street under consideration, or to the building which the Titusville Iron Works Company pro<a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>poses to erect on and over it. In this aspect of the matter, it is of no consequence that Mrs. Chase had sold some of the other lots on her plan, before the adoption of the borough resolution of December 18, 1865. The owners of those lots are not here complaining, and Mr. Hobart cannot be heard to assert their rights in this regard, if any they have.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[236,732,1156,1565]]]'>The only other plaintiff is the United Natural Gas Company, which is not an owner of property in the Chase Plan, but whose complaint is based on a separate and distinct ground from that applicable to any of the other plaintiffs. No objection is made to the joinder, however, and hence we need not consider whether it was legally allowable. The evidence regarding the status of this company is meager, and the findings not less so; but sufficient is stated to show that its complaint cannot be sustained. It averred and proved that the city council had given to the Oil City Fuel Supply Company (a predecessor in title of this plaintiff) the right “to lay pipes and connections in and through the streets, alleys and highways of the City of Titusville, for the purpose of supplying natural gas to consumers”; that prior to 1922 such pipes had been laid along Washington Street, under the portion vacated by the ordinance of that date; and that to remove those pipes would cost “from approximately $4,000 to approximately $8,000, depending on the system of piping adopted.” Assuming that it will be necessary to remove the pipes from under the vacated part of the street, the gas company’s business would not be materially affected by so doing, and the cost to it, even if its own figures are accepted, would not be serious. To sustain its claim here would be serious, however, for, except in rare instances, the municipalities of the State would be debarred from vacating even a fractional portion of most of their streets, because of their occupancy by public service companies.</p>

Drainage Commission of New Orleans, <a href="/us/197/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="197 U.S. 453" data-case-ids="3636188" data-case-paths="/us/197/0453-01">197 U. S. 453</a>, 462, where plaintiff had an exclusive right of vending gas in the city, it was compelled, at its own expense, to relocate its pipes, when the city changed certain of its streets, to enable it to establish a new system of drainage. After considering at some length, the question involved, the Supreme Court of the United States said: “The gas company, by its grant from the city, acquired no exclusive right to the location of its pipes in the streets, as chosen by it, under a general grant of authority to use the streets. The city made no contract that the gas company should not be disturbed in the location chosen. In the exercise of the police power of the State, for a purpose highly necessary in the promotion of the public health, it has become necessary to change the location of the pipes of the gas company so as to accommodate them to the new public works. In complying with this requirement, at its own expense, none of the property of the gas company has been taken, and the injury sustained is damnum absque injuria.” Our own cases are to the same effect: American Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co. v. Millcreek Township, <a href="/pa/195/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="195 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="914112" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0643-01">195 Pa. 643</a>; Scranton Gas &amp; Water Co. v.

In the instant case, the vacation has eliminated a dangerous grade crossing, which is universally conceded to be a proper subject for the exercise of the police power (Tiedeman’s Limitations of Police Power, 599), a conclusion this court stated upwards of half a century ago (Pittsburg &amp; Connellsville R.
