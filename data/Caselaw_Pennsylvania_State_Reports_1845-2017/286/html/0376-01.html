    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.8",402,[269,847,1154,748]]]'>Ella Durning, a child of thirteen, purchased a ticket of admission to a moving picture theater, operated by the defendant, Hyman. With two friends, she entered the building from the rear, and passed up the aisle to a row of seats containing vacant places. When she pulled one down and sat upon it, the left side gave way, causing her to be thrown to the floor, sustaining certain injuries as a result. At the trial of the action instituted to recover damages, she testified, as did one of her companions, that the seat “broke,” causing the fall. Upon the conclusion of plaintiff’s testimony, a nonsuit was granted, on the ground that no negligence had been proved, which the court subsequently refused to take off. From this order an appeal has been taken.</p>

There is, ordinarily, no presumption of negligence arising from the happening of an accident, and the burden of proving that the injury resulted by reason of a failure of defendant to exercise reasonable care must be affirmatively shown. This is true, whether the claimant be a minor or an adult (Nichol v. Bell Tel. Co., <a href="/pa/266/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="266 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="1056032" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0463-01">266 Pa. 463</a>), and the assumption of the taking of due precautions for the safety of others (P. &amp; R.

Where there has been an omission to observe some absolute duty, or to perform an obligation as to which the defendant is practically an insurer, the contrary is true, and if the parties bear such contract rela<a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>tion, as in the ease of the carrier who agrees to carry safely, and has in its sole control the -appliances necessary for transportation, a presumption of negligence arises, where an injury occurs: Laing v.

There are cases in which an inference of negligence arises from the circumstances under which the accident occurred. “When the thing which causes the injury is shown to be under the management of the defendants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants that the accident arose from a want of care”: Shafer v.

Under such circumstances, a deduction of a lack of due care may be drawn by the jury. “It is sometimes said that the mere happening of an accident in this class of cases raises a presumption of negligence, but this is hardly accurate. Negligence is not presumed. If it were, it would be the duty of the court, in the absence of exculpatory evidence by the defendant, to direct a verdict for the plaintiff, whereas in these cases the question is for the jury. The accurate statement of the law is not that negligence is presumed, but that the.cir<a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>cumstances amount to evidence from which it may be inferred by the jury”: Zahniser v.

If such facts appear in the testimony of the plaintiff, a nonsuit should be entered (Stearns v.

It broke and caused the fall. The duty devolved upon the proprietor to show that reasonable diligence had been used to provide safe accommodations, and that a proper inspection was made to assure their suitable condition. A clear statement of the applicable rule is found in 1 Thompson on Negligence, section 996, cited with approval in Sellmer v. Ringling, <a href="/pa-super/62/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="62 Pa. Super. 410" data-case-ids="455324" data-case-paths="/pa-super/62/0410-01">62 Pa.

Doubtless the true theory is that such persons assume the obligation of exercising reasonable care, and that what will be a reasonable care will be a degree of care proportioned to the danger incurred and the number of persons who will be subjected to that danger. A good expression of the rule of liability, applicable to such cases, is...... to the effect that the proprietor of such structure is not a warrantor or insurer that it is absolutely safe, but that he impliedly warrants that it is safe for the purpose in<a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>tended, save only as to those defects which are nnseen, unknown and undiseoverable. Such being the nature of the obligation, it is obvious that the proprietor of such a building is under a continuing duty of inspection, to the end of seeing that it is reasonably safe for the protection of those whom he invited to come into it; and that if he neglects his duty in this respect, so that it becomes unsafe, the question of his knowledge or ignorance of the defects which rendered it unsafe is immaterial.”</p>
