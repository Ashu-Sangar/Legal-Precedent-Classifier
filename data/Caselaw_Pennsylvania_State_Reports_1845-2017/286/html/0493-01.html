It is true, in describing the subject-matter of the controversy or the purpose of the litigation where fees are allowed, we use expressions such as “for the common benefit of all the parties” (Winton’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=87%20Pa.%2084" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="87 Pa. 84">87 Pa. 84</a>), later restricted to “the actual financial benefit of all the parties” (Whitney v.

We have never, under our equitable powers, ordered counsel fees where no fund or property was before the court for administration or distribution; especially where, as here, the purpose of the litigation was to restrain and control the managerial acts of trustees or directors. There may be cases in which restraining orders issued where fraud or dishonest motives actuated such officers in the disposition of property. In such cases, fees would be properly allowable, the property involved being before the court for administration, bnt this condition is not present in this case.</p>

There is nothing before the court which enables it to give effect to such order. To enforce a decree under these circumstances would be to reach out and take property not within the court’s control. While it is true the resultant effect of the litigation may be to preserve property in a certain sphere, the motives of those in charge, who would otherwise dispose of it, being in good faith and for the best interest of the company, the proposed action is at best an error of judgment or of legal right; the labors of those who are successful in restraining the action must be placed on a plane beyond the reach of professional serv<a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>ices, as a charge against the property or institution whose original status they preserve.</p>

By resolution, it was proposed to move the institution and its educational activities to Chicago. It was tentatively arranged that the Pennsylvania property be transferred to the Illinois corporation to. be applied to the use of the school, in the instruction in religion and a preparation of candidates for the Christian Ministry. The court below and this court state “that the proposed removal would result advantageously to the prosecution of the purposes for which the......school was established.” Counsel for the moving trustees said, “We have no doubt but that the majority trustees are sincere and honest in their efforts.” Some of the members of the Unitarian faith and five dissenting trustees, desirous of keeping the institution in Meadville, took action to restrain this removal and the turning over of property and assets to the Illinois corporation. The court below granted a restraining order preventing the activities of the school from being moved to Chicago', as well as the transfer of the property. An appeal was taken to this court and the decree of the court below was modified: Hempstead v. Meadville Theological Society, <a href="/pa/284/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="284 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1092007" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0147-01">284 Pa. 147</a>. It restrained the transferring of the assets of the school to another person or corporation to enable the latter to carry on any of the purposes of the corporation, and from managing and directing its strictly corporate business in any other place than the City of Meadville, but did not prevent the board from transferring and conducting its educational activities to and in the City of Chicago'. While the litigation prevented appellants from moving ■its property out of the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania, it established their legal rights in the matter. When the <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>case was heard in this court, the trustees were permitted to amend their pleadings by stipulating that the transfer of the assets to the Illinois corporation was only an alternative, that they did not propose at any time to commit an act contrary to the laws of Pennsylvania. What they desired to do was to remove their educational facilities to Chicago in consonance with the laws of this State. It is clearly evident that the action of the trustees was prompted by the highest motives. Even had the act of transfer of property been entirely legal, it must be accomplished under our laws. They are very broad and it is difficult to. understand, with this property in existence, how such transfer could be accomplished in a way that would deprive the old school of its rights, though the parties in both were identical. While there may be merit in the suggestion that the successful trustees should not be compelled to bear the burden of litigation that prevents a corporation from doing ultra vires acts, the major portion of these acts are beneficial to the corporation. The fact that an endowment fund of $1,000,000 and property of $150,000 must be administered in the City of Meadville, is of no financial interest to them or the entire membership of the corporation any more than the preservation of a particular doctrine of the church would be of financial benefit. There was no disruption, or attempted disruption, waste or embezzlement of the property or of the trust funds. While under such circumstances the visitorial powers of this State might have been hindered, the presumption is that the laws of Illinois are as effective in this respect as ours. There is not the slightest allegation or proof of fraud. Even in those states where the payment of counsel fees have been authorized there was an element of dishonesty that amounted to fraud or actual fraud present in the (disposition of the subject-matter of the litigation. It may be a serious handicap' to the business affairs of this school to' keep this property in Meadville when its educational work is being carried on in Chicago. It was <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>solely because the law commanded it to be done that the order of the court was made. But the attempted transfer of property to the Illinois corporation, if it can be so called, to be used for the same purpose, would not be a dissipation of the property in any sense of the word. The transfer might have been to its very great benefit, certainly not to its disadvantage. The purpose of the old school and the trust created thereunder could have been carried on as effectively under that arrangement as under the one which was ordered by our prior decision. We so state to elucidate the question of the purpose of that and this litigation. Its effect was to control the managerial acts of the trustees. It was not to preserve property or a fund, and consequently under no Stretch of our law could it be brought within the scope of the cases allowing counsel fees. The court below was clearly in error in ordering the school to pay. There is no doubt but that these gentlemen earned the money, and, in all fairness to them, as a result of the litigation clarifying the legal standing and rights of the parties, they should be paid, but not from the school.</p>
