Plaintiff saw the car standing on the opposite side of Chestnut Street as she was about to leave the curb of Eighth, but did not look thereafter, and was struck just as she had cleared the second rail of the track. The police officer on duty at the corner blew his whistle when he gave the signal for traffic to proceed on Eighth Street, — the time when the car was put in motion, — and the motorman was ringing his bell as he crossed Chestnut Street. One of plaintiff’s witnesses testified that the car was only six or eight feet from the girl when she stepped across the first rail of the track.
