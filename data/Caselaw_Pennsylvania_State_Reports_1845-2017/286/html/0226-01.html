Its principal place of business was located there, and the assets were in the County of Luzerne, where all the officers and directors reside. Financial difficulties led to the appointment of a receiver by the Delaware courts in 1922, and this was followed by the selection of two others in this State shortly thereafter. These officers, alleging the concern to be insolvent, never having made any profit <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>from the conduct of its enterprise, filed a bill in equity to recover from certain directors the amount of dividends which they had “wilfully and negligently” paid from the capital of the company, averring that the sums so misappropriated were necessary for the payment of indebtedness and satisfaction of demands of creditors. Later, other directors were added as parties defendant, and an amended complaint submitted. ■-A demurrer was posed, denying the legal right of the receivers to maintain the proceeding on behalf of creditors. This was overruled, and an appeal taken by one of the parties in interest to test the correctness of the ruling of the court below on the jurisdictional question raised, as permitted by the Act of March 5,1925, P.

But the capital of the corporation is a trust fund for the benefit of every one interested therein, and, if it is misappropriated, those responsible for the diversion are liable jointly and severally for such payments as are made with their sanction, if it appears, as here charged, that they acted wilfully and negligently in so doing: Kisterbock’s App., <a href="/pa/51/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="51 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="999826" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0483-01">51 Pa. 483</a>. Of course, if the dividend was declared as a result of an honest error or mistake of judgment, no responsibility attaches, but that is a question of fact which must be determined after the parties have been heard. It cannot be disposed of on demurrer.</p>

The receiver, acting' for the creditors, has full power to ask that this be done, and, indeed, it is his duty to so proceed, if the facts justify the charge: Fell v.

The stockholders who are injured may also compel payment into the corporation treasury of the fund misused, though they may not have it distributed directly to themselves (Beeber v.

It is suggested that the dividends here paid were given to stockholders, and they would have no standing to complain. Doubtless, this is true (Loan Society v. Eavenson, supra, p. 416), but the action is for the benefit of the creditors of an insolvent corporation, and they have the right to compel a restoration of misappropriated capital. Nor is the objection well taken that the parties’ complainant have an adequate remedy at law. In a case such as this, where an accounting and discovery is necessary, equity will grant relief: Loan Society v. Eavenson, <a href="/pa/241/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="241 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="976037" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0065-01">241 Pa. 65</a>.</p>

What the law of that state in this regard is, does not appear in the record now before us. There is a presumption that the same legal rules apply as are in force in our own Commonwealth: Musser v.

The demurrer is, of course, barren of any suggestion as to the law of the place where the company was formed, and, as such must be proved as a fact, if deemed material, it must be presumed to be the same as that of our own: Cape May Real Est. Co. v. Henderson, <a href="/pa-super/42/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="42 Pa. Super. 1" data-case-ids="412423" data-case-paths="/pa-super/42/0001-01">42 Pa.

An examination, however, of the legislation there in force shows no difference as to the liability of directors who illegally declare dividends from capital: Corporation Laws of Delaware, 1915, section 35. There is found a provision <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>(section 51), that judgment shall first be had against the corporation, and execution returned unsatisfied, before suit shall be brought against directors, but that applies only where the attempt is to collect debts of the corporation from them individually, and not to circumstances such as appear here.</p>

Whether the directors made the payments al-'' leged while in office, and in so doing acted negligently and wilfully, as charged, are matters of fact which must be determined on hearing, after answer filed. As to the merits of the claim of the receivers we, of course, express no opinion, but hold that such matters have been alleged as to make necessary a reply by defendants, who, in due time, will have ample opportunity'to present their defense.. - .</p>
