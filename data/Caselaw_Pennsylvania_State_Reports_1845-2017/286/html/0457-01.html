It appeared that several properties were held by Bolard, Harter and Thompson as tenants in common, the latter two conducting a business jointly <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>in the production and sale of oil. The former acted as resident manager in Oklahoma, where the wells were located. * His one-fourth interest in the leaseholds was purchased in 1909 by the other co-owners, and, later, they acquired additional property, which has long since been either abandoned or sold.</p>
    <p id="b483-3" data-blocks='[["BL_483.4",483,[166,657,1153,965]]]'>In 1910, plaintiff was employed, as the superintendent at a fixed salary, and thereafter had charge of the developments. He contended that, in addition to the amount of monthly compensation agreed upon, both Harter and Thompson respectively undertook to carry for his benefit a one-sixteenth share in the land, being a part of that secured by their purchase from Bolard, the two vendees to be reimbursed for the outlays made from the profits which might be derived from the sale of oil. In 1917, the principal tracts of land were sold, and the purchase price paid to Harter and Thompson in equal proportions. With Harter, who was an uncle of Corn-stock, the last named made settlement in some way, not disclosed by the testimony, of-any claim against him, but Thompson refused to recognize any liability for a proportionate part of the purchase price of the land disposed of. This proceeding was instituted in 1921 to force a settlement by the latter.</p>

Indeed one, Harter, was not made a party to this litigation, and the firm was not named as a defendant, nor is it averred that Thompson was a liquidator of its assets. The interests of the parties are designated as tenants in common of undivided interests, and Comstock claimed one-sixteenth of the purchase money paid as against defendant individually. In the general findings of fact made by the learned court below, there is no statement that a partnership existed, though, in answer to two of the 123 requests presented by one side or the other, it declared there was such relation. Defendant’s exceptions to both of the answers referred to were overruled. <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>Since the bill was dismissed on other grounds, to be hereafter noted, no appeal was taken by him from these rulings, though the alleged errors are called to our attention here.</p>

It was denied that the earnings applicable to payment of Comstock’s supposed share equaled the price paid for it. As we have determined that the record in the present case must be returned for further proceedings, the question raised as to the existence of any partnership relation can be again brought to' the attention of the court, if a further hearing is had. We also note the bill averred the arrangement was merely to purchase “an undivided one-sixteenth interest in said leasehold,” and retain the same for plaintiff as a cotenant, in which case the effect of the statute of frauds must be considered: Edgecomb v.

The maxim referred to is to be applied where the wrongdoing is in reference to the matter in dispute (Dempster v.

    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[272,912,1161,1552]]]'>In the present case, the bill was dismissed because of the admitted defaults of Oomstock. The court found that he had failed to devote his entire time to his work as agreed upon, having for a certain period received forty dollars a month for services performed for others, had taken certain discounts on materials purchased for his own use, made false charges for money disbursed, and at one time deducted from the balance due by him a month’s pay for an absent employee, though this sum was later returned. Appellant claims the entire amount misused to be $734, to which defendant was entitled to one-half, while appellee insists it is more than double this sum. Admittedly, complainant was guilty of some peculation, which he had not offered to make good prior to instituting this proceeding, though the total would seem to be small in comparison with the value of the interest he claims to have owned, and for which he demands a settlement. We are not prepared to say (Wilson v. Keller, <a href="/pa/195/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="195 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="914031" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0098-01">supra),</a> that the misappropriation established will deprive Comstock of all rights he might have asserted if his conduct had been without fault. The offer is made in the bill filed to make restitution when an accounting is had. This is insufficient, in view of his own admission that moneys improperly diverted have not been reported and paid over, and, before the court proceeds, further restoration must be made by plaintiff of all sums wrongfully retained. Thereafter, the courts will pass upon the merits of the contention raised by the pleadings.</p>
