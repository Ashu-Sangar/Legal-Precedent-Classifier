The statement of questions involved asks us to decide only two points: “Whether the fourth paragraph of the will of Jacob H. Linck violates the rule against perpetuities in force in Pennsylvania”; and, in case it does not, whether a marketable title was obtained by the sheriff’s sale. Since we are clear the rule is violated, we need not consider the alternative question suggested.</p>
    <p id="b345-3" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[171,759,1161,1346]]]'>That paragraph is as follows: “Fourth. I give, devise and bequeath unto my said four children, Edgar B. Linck, Charles Y.

Linck, Charles Y. Linck, James G. Linck and Nellie L. Linck,......their heirs and assigns absolutely in fee simple forever; provided however, that if, at the termination of the period of thirty-five years as aforesaid, there shall be living lawful issue of any or all of my said children, then and in that case I give, devise and bequeath all the said property known as the Linck Block unto the said lawful issue as aforesaid, of all or any of my said children...... absolutely in fee simple forever.”</p>

Subsequently Nellie L. Linck conveyed all her interest in the property to two of the plaintiffs.</p>

Under this rule, a contingent estate to be valid must vest within the time above stated from the date of its creation. Moreover, the question as to whether the rule has been violated depends upon conditions as they existed at the death of the testator (21 R. C. L. p. 294) and as to what <em>may </em>happen; where the estate may not vest within the required time the rule is transgressed: Coggins’s App., <a href="/pa/124/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="124 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="563106" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0010-01">124 Pa. 10</a>; Lawrence’s Est, <a href="/pa/136/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="136 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="819995" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0354-01">136 Pa. 354</a>; Donohue v.

If the provision in the will is such that the title to the property may be kept in abeyance and not vest for a longer period than permitted by law, the bequest is void: Davenport et al. v.

If there is a possibility that a violation of this rule may happen, the devise is void. It is said if the persons to take may possibly not be ascertained before, or the contingency may happen after, the expiration of a life or lives in being at the creation of the interest and for twenty-one years, and possibly nine months......[thereafter, with an] exception as to charities: Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 173.”</p>
    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[163,1173,1156,1131]]]'>The application of these principles to the present will makes the conclusion exceedingly plain. Testator’s attempted limitation is for an absolute term of thirty-five years, without referring to any life or lives in being, and hence the remainder over is void under Johnston’sJ Estate, supra; especially as, during that absolute term, he forbids alienation, mortgaging or otherwise encumbering the property: Lilley’s Estate, supra. Moreover, he says that “At the determination of the said period of thirty-five years, provided <em>at that time </em>there shall be no living issue of any of my said children,” the children themselves are to get the property in fee simple, but “if, at.the termination of the period of thirty-five years as aforesaid, there shall be <em>living </em>lawful issue of any or all of my said children, then in that case” the property is given to such issue in fee. Those who are to take, if that provision is valid, cannot possibly be known until “the termination of the period of thirty-five years.” Issue may be born to the children at any time during that term, and some of them, but it is not known who, if any, may survive to the end of the thirty-five years.</p>
    <p id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[168,2315,1149,97]],["BL_348.1",348,[327,351,1149,803]]]'>In his affidavit of defense, appellant averred that the said Nellie L. Linck had a daughter living, who would <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>be entitled to an interest in the property, if the gift over was valid and she survived until the expiration of the thirty-five-year period. He therefore suggested that a guardian for her possible interest should be appointed and made a party to the proceeding. It is also clear, though defendant did not allege that they too should be represented, that issue hereafter born to. any of testator’s children, within that period, may, subject to the same contingencies, also have such an interest. If the objection stated had been insisted on in the court below, there would have arisen a duty to stay the proceedings until representatives of all such interests had been made parties to the record, and given an opportunity to be heard: Hebron v. Magda, <a href="/pa/280/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="280 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="1084461" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0508-01">280 Pa. 508</a>; Hoffeditz v.

Defendant said, in his brief below, that “if the court shall decide that the will of Jacob H. Linck, so far as pertains to the disposition of the Linck Block under the fourth paragraph of the will, violates the rule against perpetuities, and is, therefore, null and void, it will be unnecessary to consider the effect of the sheriff’s sale above referred to,” which otherwise would have had to be considered, if that tribunal had been of opinion, under the will alone, that plaintiffs could not recover until representatives of those possible remaindermen, born and unborn, were made parties to the proceeding. We cannot hold that the court below erred in not considering an objection which appellant stipulated, at least indirectly, it need not consider: Armstrong &amp; Latta v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/249/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="249 Pa. 39" data-case-ids="1013514" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0039-01">249 Pa. 39</a>; Weiskercher v.

If the objection had been there pressed, plaintiffs could readily have met the difficulty, and successfully overcome it, possibly by discontinuing the present suit, and beginning a new one in equity, raising therein, by due process, representatives of all such interests; and certainly could have done so by proceedings under the Revised Price Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 388, section 2 (b) of which provides <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>for just such a situation. Hence, if the objection had been urged below, and had been there sustained, much unnecessary delay and expense would have been avoided, both of which plaintiffs must suffer if we allow it to be renewed here. Possibly this fact alone should prevent our considering the objection at this time.</p>
    <p id="b349-3" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[147,696,1152,903]]]'>Moreover, as shown by the foregoing citation of the statement of the questions involved, this matter is neither raised in nor suggested by them.
