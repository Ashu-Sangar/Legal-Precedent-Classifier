The bill prayed that the wife be. decreed to hold the property in trust for plaintiff to the extent of his claim, that a trustee be ap<a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>pointed, and that defendants be restrained from encumbering or disposing of the premises.</p>

No exceptions were taken to this action, but plaintiff subsequently filed another bill in the same court, with averments like those in the first bill and praying that the deed from husband to wife be set aside, defendants restrained from disposing of the property in question, and decreed to hold the income therefrom in trust for the benefit of plaintiff until the suit should be determined.</p>
    <p id="b476-5" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[318,1098,1150,261]]]'>Mrs. Nouskajian, referred to above as the “wife,” answered this second bill, saying that it raised “the same questions of fact and law [as contained in the former bill, and therefore] the whole controversy [was] res adjudicata.”</p>

Our jurisprudence contemplates both trial and review; the latter requires a record, the making of which has <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>been rendered comparatively easy in Pennsylvania by our court-stenographer legislation, and this should be taken advantage of in cases such as the one now before us. In the absence of a proper record, we, of course, accept the statement of facts made by the court <em>below; </em>but where a bill is dismissed there should be a formal record to show warrant for the court’s action. Here neither testimony nor offer of testimony, on the second bill, are shown, and it is quite impossible to know whether the controlling rules have been complied with.</p>

More than this, the court also erre'd in treating the case as though defendant had proved all facts necessary to show that the issues involved had already been adjudicated. If the court was convinced from informal offers of proof that the doctrine of res judicata applied, it should have asked for formal tenders of evidence, including the record of the first bill, so as to establish the fact and scope of the prior adjudication; the fact that the record happened to be in the same court would not alter the rule in this respect: <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>Steel v.

On this petition, an order was entered restraining plaintiff from proceeding with the sheriff’s sale, and this is assigned as error.

Giles, <a href="/pa/155/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="155 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="983237" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0409-01">155 Pa. 409</a>, 416), we said: “If there be any doubt or dispute on the facts, the creditor is entitled to levy and sell, and proceed by ejectment on the sheriff’s deed,” and equity will not interfere : see also authorities reviewed in Brackin v. Welton Engineering Co., <a href="/pa/283/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="283 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="1090524" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0091-01">283 Pa. 91</a>. Section 9 of the Act of 1921 now provides that, “Where a conveyance or obligation is fraudulent as to a creditor, such creditor, when his claim has matured, may, as against any person except a purchaser for fair consideration without knowledge of the fraud at the time of the purchase, or one who has derived title immediately or mediately from such a purchaser: (a) Have the conveyance set aside or obligation annulled to the extent necessary to satisfy his claim; or (b) disregard the conveyance, and attach or levy execution upon the property conveyed.”</p>

In other words, it gives the creditor his choice between a procedure in equity and the old common law remedy; and, perhaps, an adverse party could compel an election on the .part of the creditor as to which remedy he would pursue. Here, for instance, the defendant in the equity suit who holds title to the real estate in controversy, after properly showing that plaintiff was pursuing Ms common law remedy in another court, might have asked the court below to make plaintiff elect between that remedy and <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>his bill in equity, and had the election been in favor of the remedy at law, it would have been proper to dismiss the bill on that ground. Again, the defendant in the common law suit might have petitioned the court in which that action was pending for a stay of execution on the ground that plaintiff had instituted and was pursuing a proceeding in equity against him in the court below to accomplish the same result that he sought by the execution in the common law suit, and this would have put plaintiff to his election between the two remedies. Neither of these courses was pursued, however, and there is nothing upon the present record to warrant the restraint of execution granted by the court below. The mere fact that plaintiff had proceeded in equity as authorized by the Act of 1921 would not affect his legal right to sell real estate alleged to belong to his creditor, which right is also recognized by that act; particularly is this so when we remember that his first equity suit had not reached any definitive conclusion and his second had not come to a hearing at the time of the order staying the sheriff’s sale.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[259,1440,1155,900]]]'>In addition to what has already been mentioned, appellant claims that the action of the court below in undertaking, in effect, to restrain the process of another court of common pleas was contrary both to general rules of law (for discussion of this general subject see Kane &amp;. Elk R. R. v. R. R., <a href="/pa/241/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="241 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="976006" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0608-01">241 Pa. 608</a>, 614, and cases there cited) and to a rule of the Courts of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, which latter provides for transferring cases from one court to another, in order to avoid mutual interference with the exercise of common jurisdiction and to prevent other such inconveniences. It is not necessary to determine either of these points, however, because both the final decree dismissing the bill and the order staying the sheriff’s sale must be reversed for reasons already indicated; but, of course, if defendant elects to pursue his adequate remedy at law, that will be an abandonment of his bill.</p>
