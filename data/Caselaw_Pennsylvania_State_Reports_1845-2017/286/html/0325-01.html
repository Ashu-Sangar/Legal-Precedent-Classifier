When the bonds fell due, plaintiffs demanded payment of them, and, this having been refused, they each brought suit and recovered a judgment, which, by agreement, expressly limited the right of execution upon it to “property which is not subject legally to the lien” of said mortgage. One of plaintiffs issued an attachment execution on his judgment, naming the Pennsylvania Railroad Company as garnishee, and sought thereby to attach defendant’s share of certain passenger, freight and car service rates, which had been paid to the garnishee in consideration of continuous service over the lines of the two railroads; each company being entitled to a specified part thereof. The other plaintiff issued a fieri facias on his judgment, and, under it, a levy was made on defendant’s office furniture and equipment, at the place where the clerical and executive part of its business is transacted. The court below decided that the assets referred to were not liable to the execu<a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>tions, and each plaintiff appeals from the order in his case.</p>

R. Co. v. Woelpper, <a href="/pa/64/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="64 Pa. 366" data-case-ids="1021293" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0366-01">64 Pa. 366</a>; Collins’s App., <a href="/pa/107/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="107 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="8858925" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0590-01">107 Pa. 590</a>. By the mortgage, the trustees became the repository of the title to the corporate franchise and the property mortgaged, in trust for all the bondholders: Com. v. Susquehanna &amp; Delaware River R.

The collections made by the garnishee are none the less “tolls, issues, income and profits” because they are still in its hands. They belong to the trustees because they are of the character stated. So, also, it is of no consequence to plaintiff that defendant, if and when, it receives the money, may use part of it in paying operating and office expenses. If the mortgage expressly or impliedly authorizes such expenditures/ no one can complain of that use; if it does not, the entire body of bondholders are the only ones who can be injured thereby, if indeed they can, since such use directly inures to their benefit, by enabling the railroad to function as a going concern. Certainly plaintiff, by virtue of his judgment, had no legal right to enforce an attachment against this money, which equitably belongs to the trustees, for the benefit of all the bondholders.</p>
