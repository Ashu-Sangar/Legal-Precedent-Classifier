    <p id="b58-9" data-blocks='[["BL_58.17",58,[269,1541,1150,746]]]'>Appellant and appellee are adjoining landowners in Lower Merion Township. Both front on Lancaster Avenue, appellee’s frontage being 83 feet and appellant’s 160 feet. These lots, and others thereabouts, are subject to a common building restriction or condition, which is as follows: “No more than one house should at any time be erected upon the above, described lot of land, and further that all buildings except steps, cellar doors, and open porches, hereafter erected upon said lot of land, shall be set back at least 85 feet northeastwardly from the middle line of Lancaster Avenue.” On each lot has been erected an expensive private dwelling which stands the required distance from Lancaster Avenue. These houses were built some 25 years ago.</p>
    <p id="b58-10" data-blocks='[["BL_58.18",58,[271,2298,1146,99]],["BL_59.1",59,[201,352,1156,1235]]]'>Appellant, desiring to make changes in his property, in addition to modernizing the house, proceeded to shut <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>out much of the noise and sight of traffic coming from this much-traveled highway by a stone wall nine feet high, enclosing the front part of the yard, with the exception of the driveway. The litigation is over this improvement. As it reached the house, it rose in height, connecting with the building, and continued, enclosing part of the lot in the rear, the walls there being 18 feet high. The outer surface was some inches in from the line of the adjoining property. The best material was being used and the design was artistic and is now partly erected. The walls were plastered and the lines were broken by buttresses, adding to its strength as well as to the appearance. The rear portion or “wistaria room” was without roof except by poles on which vines were to grow. As indicated, on the north side, or within the prohibited area, the height of the enclosure was to be nine feet. The court below, after a hearing on the bill to enjoin the erection as a violation of the restrictions, found that the whole structure, including the walls, will, when completed, constitute a substantial and integral part of defendant’s house or building. Based on this finding, the construction was restrained as a violation of the condition.</p>
    <p id="b59-4" data-blocks='[["BL_59.4",59,[206,1608,1148,477]]]'>The restriction here made was for the benefit of the plaintiff as well as all the owners of adjoining lots affected by its violation, and is enforceable in equity: Clark v.

It is intended to add to its privacy and repose. The plastering, the method of construction, the height where.it adjoins the tiled terrace, the location of the enclosure to the southeast, or on the sunny side of the house, its floor plan and steps, the facts that it does not extend to the property line on the side or in front and embraces only a section of defendant’s lawn, and its general appearance and character, all suggest that it, when constructed, will be an integral and substantial part of the house and not merely an enclosed garden......Moreover, a careful study of the photographs in evidence and oral testimony leads to the impression that, if the contemplated wall were in place, the casual observer must, as he looks at defendant’s improvements, reach' the ■inevitable conclusion that the house, with all its attachments, including this wall, constitutes one single, harmonious and homogeneous structure or unit.
