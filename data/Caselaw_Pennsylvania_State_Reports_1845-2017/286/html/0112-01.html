Schuchman, filed an account charging himself with the amount of an inventory previously filed, which included an item of $30,000, representing sums of money paid to him by decedent over a period of months preceding the latter’s death. Appellant then took credit in the account for $30,000, alleging it was a gift and explaining that he had inventoried the amount solely because he believed he was <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>obliged to do so for transfer tax purposes. Other residuary legatees excepted to this credit, and, at the hearing before the court below, the issue was whether the $30,000 paid by decedent to appellant constituted a gift or a loan. The court found that the transaction was a loan, surcharged the accountant with $30,000, plus interest, and subsequently dismissed appellant’s exceptions to the adjudication.</p>
