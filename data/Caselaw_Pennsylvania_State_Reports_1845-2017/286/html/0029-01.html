The only defense set up is that defendants were induced to endorse the notes by the verbal promise of plaintiff’s cashier to obtain for their (defendants’) benefit and security a second mortgage on certain land which Lafaw was about to acquire; and that, by plaintiff’s neglect, this mortgage, — executed by Lafaw alone on property owned by himself and wife as tenants by entireties, — if ever a lien at all, became so only after another mortgage),, for purchase money, that was subject to a previously existing first mortgage, had been recorded and a judgment for another debt had been entered against the mortgagor, which made the mortgage given for defendants’ security a possible third or fourth lien, instead of the second encumbrance contracted for by plaintiff’s cashier.</p>
