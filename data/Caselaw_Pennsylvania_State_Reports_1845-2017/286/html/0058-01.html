All were equal beneficiaries in what was known as the farm located in Delaware County. It had been in the family for many years. In fact, it is stated that the house, originally built early in 1700 and the oldest in the county, is still standing. At the time the incidents which we are about to relate occurred, these men were approximately eighty and eighty-one years of age, Mordecai being the younger. They had lived on the farm or homestead for many years, J. Lewis since birth and Mordecai, though at times away, with his brother and sister Elizabeth from 1909 until the latter died in 1915. Thereafter the brothers occupied the house, the land being under lease to others. Mordecai, the younger and more active of the two, assumed the management of the property.</p>
    <p id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.7",86,[282,1323,1150,794]]]'>The interests in the property having become quite involved owing to the various dispositions of the shares of the children who predeceased J. Lewis, these two old gentlemen, no doubt appreciating their years were drawing to a close, determined to make wills in each other’s favor, selecting as alternative devisees such persons as best suited their inclination. One such will was made July, 1921, where Swartz, a tenant, was named, and another in September, 1922, naming King. The dominant thought as expressed in the wills, was to provide for the survivor. It was no doubt the same feeling that prompted the sister Elizabeth to give them a life estate, though she gave part of her personalty and the remainder of her interest in the real estate to different persons than did the two brothers.</p>

Where the proponent has made out a prima facie case, establishing the validity of a writing that is manifestly testamentary, a presumption of capacity and absence of undue influence arises. Our first inquiry, then, is whether such prima facie validity was established. Proponent called the witnesses who subscribed it; they saw the testator sign his name, stating that he was of sound, disposing mind, memory and understanding. Though three witnesses so testified, giving a general idea as to what took place when the will was signed, it is stated, the witnesses did not “recollect the particulars of the signing and did not seem to know what testamentary capacity is.” Such condition of mind is the normal state of witnesses to wills. They are not required to remember details, though it might be helpful: White’s Est., <a href="/pa/262/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="262 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1044472" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0356-01">262 Pa. 356</a>, 361. Their lack of knowledge does not detract from the probative force of the fact that they signed, as a witness, stating at the time the person whose will was witnessed was of sound disposing mind, memory and understanding. To establish this fact, the certificate attesting it may not only refresh their recollection but also may be used by them as substantive proof to establish validity. To exact of a subscribing witness particular knowledge as to what was talked about or to require an interview with the proposed testator, and to demand that the witness treasure this information in his mind <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>for weeks, months, or years, is to go beyond what the law contemplates. The matter must be viewed in the aspect of everyday life. Testamentary capacity is not certain of definition. There are two spheres of capacity and incapacity which are quite easily understood. There is the sphere where circumstances may throw doubt on capacity; but, with the rules laid down for our guidance, incapacity should not be predicated on desire, wishes or unmerited disappointment. To persons who do not receive what they expect under wills, every state of mind responsible for the disappointment is incapacity. The layman should be as well qualified to determine incapacity as the judge and at times both have been known to err. The evidence here submitted was ample to make out a prima facie case of validity: Logan’s Est., <a href="/pa/195/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="195 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="914062" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0282-01">195 Pa. 282</a>, 283.</p>

Testamentary incapacity must be established by the manifest weight of the evidence. Generally speaking, a like rule exists, when it is claimed that testator’s capacity to make a will was so operated on by a moral coercion, as to prevent an unrestrained exercise of faculties, or, in other words, by undue influence. A mere balancing of proofs will not suffice. Where it is not questioned that a will was duly executed, before the judicial mind may condemn a person’s solemn declaration, disposing of his worldly effects after death, or order it to run the gauntlet of legal inquisition, for it and its maker there to suffer from unrestrained charges and insinuations by disappointed persons (when the giver is beyond the reach of inquisitorial process), as a court it must be satisfied that it would, on due consideration of the evidence as a whole, <em>in a light most favorable to validity, </em>reasonably reach the conclusion that the giver lacked the full and intelligent knowledge and understanding necessary to dispose properly of his worldly effects; or that the will did not express his real wishes because it was procured <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>through influences so exerted as to destroy free agency at the time the will was made: Tetlow’s Est., supra 496.

Failure of memory does not prove incapacity unless it is total or so extended as to make incapacity practically certain. A testator may not be able at all times to recollect the names of persons or families of those with whom he has been intimately acquainted. He may ask idle questions and repeat himself, and yet his understanding of the ordinary transactions of his life may be sound. He may not have the strength and vigor of a man able to digest all the parts of a contract, yet he may be competent to distribute his property by will: Wilson v.

We cannot form a judgment on our ideas as to wbat this man would have done had be lived according to tbe standards of ordinary social life. We must endeavor, if possible, to bring our reasoning to tbe environment in wbicb be lived and determine whether bis actions were those of a normal man. J. Lewis, tbe testator, lived a solitary life, in that be bad no companions except bis brother and a very occasional visitor or housekeeper. Here were two old men living for tbe most part alone. Lewis left tbe habitation only at rare intervals. This seclusion may have made him uncouth in manners, and, being unmarried, be may have become unkempt in personal attire and careless about bis habits. Testator never took much part in business and permitted Mordecai to handle all matters in connection with the farm. This was not unusual; tbe latter was tbe younger and more active. Lewis bad some money in tbe bank and some shares of stock. These be looked after himself. He could not make out a personal property return. Very many people of sound mind are unable to do this. Tbe newspapers were stopped because be did not read them. At bis age tbe world may have been uninteresting and bis mental recreation may have been secured in other ways. It is stated be was a harmless, senile old man who would sit on tbe porch and watch people pass by, — chewing tobacco, tbe juice from wbicb he permitted at times to run over bis clothing. He talked about a tree be moved years ago, and seemed to take great pride in its growth. He was much interested in and talked about bis horse, but did very few things about the farm. On one of bis very occasional visits to an acquaintance be remarked about tbe size of a lamp. (This was not unnatural; tbe only lamps be saw were those in his own bouse.) Considering that be was eighty years of age, we should not be too harsh in imposing our ideas as to wbat was proper for bim to do. This was bis life, not ours, nor the contestants’. Tbe few people, who, at intermittent periods, saw wbat they <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>termed Ms silly grin and vacant stare and other circumstances, as related, were chance visitors; there is scarcely any evidence on which to base the conclusion that he had an unbalanced mind, and we are sometimes too apt to term smiles, silly grins and study, vacant stares. His brother and this horse were the only living things around; there is small wonder that he discussed them. Then he waved at passers-by. This is not an uncommon habit among the best of people; a little more of its cultivation would be better for the world. At one time, many years ago, he was lost in the woods and found along a creek. Just what was the occasion for this, or the circumstances attending it, does not appear. Even that occurrence, assuming it came from an unsound mind (and it must be an assumption for there is no evidence of it), could not be said to be the act of a man who was permanently of unbalanced mind. Great stress is laid on the fact that he lost some checks, new ones were issued which he cashed and when the former turned up, he cashed them too, but, on being requested, returned the money. This bit of evidence might show considerable capacity in some directions but no doubt he forgot about the checks he cashed. Some testimony was given as to countryside reputation or the talk among the neighbors. This is the normal talk about people who live a secluded life, but such evidence is not competent to establish incapacity: Pidcock v. Potter, <a href="/pa/68/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="68 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1024529" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0342-01">68 Pa. 342</a>.</p>

Without going into unnecessary detail, Ms neighbors and friends denied the story of the vacant stares and silly grins, and stated there were no indications of weak-mindedness or imbecility.

From 1915 up to February 2, 1923, letters, leases and deeds passed, and the testimony as to incapacity covered this same period. Among such papers were letters from counsel representing contestants, enclosing checks and complaining about the" ones wrongfully cashed. During the time these documents were executed, there was not the slightest protest from any of the parties raising the question of testator’s capacity. Not merely one lease, but many, with deeds, were executed; and the witnesses and some of the parties were persons now testifying against the will. Courts cannot be blind to such conduct.

    <p id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[273,708,1150,480]]]'>In Phillip’s Est., supra, 43, we directed attention to the elements necessary to establish undue influence. These are totally lacking in this case. We refer again to the cases heretofore cited on these questions, and, without further discussion, hold that the evidence of undue influence was insufficient to submit to the jury, and the court was in error in reaching the conclusion that the will should not be probated. See Tetlow’s Est., supra, 486.</p>
