The sentence was imposed following the relator\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree by a court en bane, composed of three judges, on his plea of guilty generally to an indictment charging him with murder. The court was unanimous in its finding as to the degree of the murder, and the sentence of life imprisonment, which is authorized by the statute in the circumstances, was likewise unanimous. No appeal was taken from the judgment of sentence. In the proceeding here involved, the court below justifiably dismissed the rela: tor\u2019s petition for the reasons set forth in the opinion of President Judge Carroll. The appeal is without merit and the order of dismissal must necessarily be affirmed.\nOrder affirmed.",
