        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones,\nThese appeals by the Borough of Baldwin are from two separate orders of the County Court of Allegheny County commanding and directing the building inspector of the borough to issue to Norman J. Matthews and Anna Matthews, his wife, in the one instance, and to James T. Barnes and Irene Barnes, his wife, in the other, building permits for the construction of dwelling houses on two lots in the borough owned respectively by the Matthews and the Barnes.\nNotwithstanding that the plans for the proposed dwellings complied with the requirements of the borough\u2019s zoning ordinance, the building inspector refused nonetheless to issue the permits even though the property owners had made due and proper application therefor. The applicants thereupon severally appealed from the adverse action of the building inspector to the board of adjustment set up by the borough\u2019s zoning ordinance. The board subsequently affirmed the action of the building inspector. The only reason ever assigned for the refusal of the building permits was that the municipal authorities were of the opinion that subterranean fires in old mine workings existed at or in the vicinity of the applicants\u2019 properties and that excavations for the construction of the proposed houses might possibly open drafts to the fires and create an additional hazard to the life and property of the community.\nThe issuance of a permit by the building inspector in circumstances such as were here shown called for no more than the performance of a mere ministerial act which admitted of no discretion in the inspector. In Coyne v. Prichard, 272 Pa, 424, 427, 116 A. 315, it was said that \u201c. . . the obligation to grant the leave to build is absolute, where the prerequisite conditions have been fulfilled. The duty of the officials placed in charge thereafter is merely ministerial.\u201d See Herskovits v. Irwin, 299 Pa. 155, 160, 149 A. 195. The action of the building inspector was therefore arbitrary, capricious and unwarranted. Such being the case, the applicants did not even need to resort to an appeal, to the board of adjustment for correction of the inspector\u2019s action. In the existing circumstances mandamus was both the appropriate and efficient remedy: Coyne v. Prichard and Herskovits v. Irwin, supra. Cf. also Doyle v. Springfield Township, 394 Pa. 49, 145 A. 2d 695, which was concerned with a building inspector\u2019s refusal of an occupancy permit.\nThe appellant borough asserts that the building inspector, in refusing the requested permits, was exercising the municipality\u2019s inherent police power to insure the safety of its residents and their property. Granted that the borough has power to act to that end in appropriate circumstances, the authority of the enforcement officer or agent must be plainly spelled out in rules or regulations promulgated by duly enacted ordinance or resolution. There was nothing of that sort here. Without any authority of law, the building inspector arrogated to himself the power to withhold the permits to which the applicants had an undoubted right.\nThe orders appealed from are affirmed at the appellant\u2019s costs.",

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell :\nThis is a difficult decision for me because (1) I believe that under the opinion of the majority of this Court in Jacobs v. Fetzer, 381 Pa. 262, 112. A. 2d 356 (in which I strongly dissented) mandamus is not a proper or available remedy where a plaintiff seeks a building permit for the construction of a dwelling house, and (2) because only a Court of Equity can fairly and wisely determine whether the danger to - the community or municipality from subterranean fires is such as to justify an injunction denying plaintiffs the right to. build on their own property.\nSince a Court of Equity is apparently prohibited from considering this situation (See: Jacobs v. Fetzer, supra) I shall cut the Gordian knot and, considering the evidence before us, concur in the result reached by the majority.\nThe law as to mandamus is accurately and succinctly stated in Travis v. Teter, 370 Pa. 326, 330, 331, 87 A. 2d 177, and in Garratt v. Philadelphia, 387 Pa. 442, 448, 127 A. 2d 738.",
