        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nMichael D. Rogan, decedent, died, testate, on February 14, 1958, survived by a son, M. D. Rogan, Jr., and a daughter, Marie Neiderlander.\nOn January 31, 1958 decedent had a checking account in his own name in the Allegheny Trust Company, Pittsburgh, Pa. the balance in which was $18,-325.09. On that date on the basis of a writing purporting to bear decedent\u2019s signature the Trust Company permitted the balance in said account to be transferred to a joint checking account in the names of decedent and Sheila P. Rogan, the wife of M. D. Rogan, Jr. and decedent\u2019s daughter-in-law.\nOn February 17, 1958 \u2014 three days subsequent to decedent\u2019s death \u2014 Sheila P. Rogan withdrew from the checking account $17,500 and later the entire balance. Of the amount withdrawn $15,000 was deposited in the Peoples First National Bank and Trust Company, Pittsburgh, Pa.\nThe Potter Bank and Trust Company, the executor under decedent\u2019s will, presented a petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County seeking a citation against Sheila P. Rogan, M. D. Rogan, Jr., the Allegheny Trust Company and the Peoples First National Bank and Trust Company to show cause why they should not turn over to the executor the amount withdrawn, \u2014 to wit, $18,325.09 \u2014 and also sought a preliminary injunction restraining them, or any of them, from disposing of said money. To this petition and citation Sheila P. Rogan filed preliminary objections raising principally the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court in the matter. In a per cnriam opinion the Orphans\u2019 Court dismissed the preliminary objections.\nThe sole question at issue is whether under the circumstances the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the ownership of the bank account.\nAs President Judge Rhodes, speaking for the. Superior Court, in Smith\u2019s Estate, 141 Pa. Superior Ct. 571, 575, 15 A. 2d 523, well stated: \u201cThe jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court is entirely of statutory origin, and, although it possesses exclusive powers to assist'decedent\u2019s personal representative to acquire control of property rightfully belonging to the estate, there are ultimate limitations ...\u201d The Orphans\u2019 Court Act of 1951, as amended, prescribes the jurisdictional limitations of the Orphans\u2019 Court applicable to the present situation.\nIn Webb Estate, 391 Pa. 584, 138 A. 2d 435, 437, in delineating the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court to adjudicate the title to personalty, we have said: \u201cThis section considerably broadened the scope of the court\u2019s jurisdiction and jurisdiction now exists where the following situations arise: (1) If the personalty was in decedent\u2019s possession, actually or presumptively, at the time of death; (2) if the personalty came into the possession of decedent\u2019s personal representative subsequent to his death; (3) if neither (1) nor (2) exist, but if the personalty was \u2018registered\u2019 in the name of decedent or his nominee; (4) if there is an allegation by the personal representative that the personalty was in possession of the decedent when he died.\u201d\nOur inquiry requires a determination whether the personalty presently involved falls within any of the above situations. In our opinion it clearly does. McGovern\u2019s Estate, 322 Pa. 379, 186 A. 89; Keyser's Estate, 329 Pa. 514, 198 A. 125; Patterson\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 177, 19 A. 2d 165; and Smith\u2019s Estate, 141 Pa. Superior Ct. 571, 15 A. 2d 523, relied upon by appellant, \u2014 all decided prior to the Orphans\u2019 Court Act of 1951, supra\u2014held that the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court to adjudicate the title to personalty depended upon whether the personalty was in the actual or presumptive possession of decedent at the time of his death or subsequently came into the possession of decedent\u2019s personal representative. The Orphans\u2019 Court Act of 1951 enlarged the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court in that it conferred upon that Court the authority to determine title to personalty not only where actual or presumptive possession was in decedent when he died or where such possession was in the personal representative after the death but also where the personalty was registered in the name of decedent or his nominee or where the personal representative alleged that decedent possessed the personalty at the time of his death. It is under this enlarged jurisdiction that the Orphans\u2019 Court derives its authority to act in the instant situation.\nAt the time of decedent\u2019s death the bank account was in his name and that of appellant. Appellant contends that the word \u201cregistered\u201d in the statute was intended to apply only to those types of personalty where actual \u201cregistration\u201d occurs, i.e. motor vehicles and securities. Such a narrow and restricted construction of the legislative intent is without merit. It is obvious that the legislative intent was to include personalty in the name of the decedent at the time of his death, whether in Ms name alone or in the names of other persons and/or decedent. This Court has affirmed the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court in similar circumstances on recent occasions: Webb Estate, 391 Pa. 584, 138 A. 2d 435; Balfour v. Seitz, 392 Pa. 300, 140 A. 2d 441; Furjanick Estate, 375 Pa. 484, 100 A. 2d 85; Fell Estate, 369 Pa. 597, 87 A. 2d 310. See also: Martella Estate, 390 Pa. 255, 135 A. 2d 372; Comerford Estate, 388 Pa. 278, 130 A. 2d 458. In Fell Estate, supra, this Court, spealdng through Mr. Justice Musmanno, said (p. 601) : \u201cThe only points left to consider are the printed joint tenancy contract in the bankbook which was not signed, and the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court over this litigation ... As to the latter, the controversy was within the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court . . .\u201d\nWhether or not appellee, as decedent\u2019s personal representative, has alleged that this bank account was in the possession of decedent at the time of his death requires an examination of the petition and such an examination indicates the presence of the necessary allegation. While perhaps the allegation was inartistically pleaded yet in paragraph 4 of the petition appellee avers: \u201c4. Among the assets of the said decedent on February 14, 1958, the date of Ms death, was a checking account in the Allegheny Trust Company, which account, on said date, had a balance of Eighteen Thousand, Three Hundred Twenty-five and 09/100 ($18,-325.09) Dollars.\u201d The prayer of the petition seeks the delivery of \u201cEighteen Thousand Three Hundred Twenty-five and 09/100 ($18,325.09) Dollars which was in the decedent\u2019s checking account in the Allegheny Trust Company on the date of his death.\u201d Such allegations suffice to attach the statutory jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court.\nOn both grounds set forth in this opinion, the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the ownership of this bank account and, pending such adjudication, to enjoin the withdrawal or disposition of the proceeds thereof.\nDecree affirmed. Costs on appellant.\nUnder decedent\u2019s will dated June 27, 1951 the decedent gave his son $100 because \u201che has not shown himself to be an affectionate and devoted son\u201d and left the residue of his estate to his daughter.\nThe record indicates that the written transfer was delivered to the Trust Company by M. D. Bogan, Jr. and Sheila P. Bogan.\nAct of August 10, 1951, P. L. 1163, Art. Ill, \u00a7301, as amended. 20 PS \u00a72080.301, which reads as follows: \u201cThe orphans\u2019 court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of: . . . (13) Title.to Personal Property. The adjudication of the title to personal property in the possession of the personal representative, or registered in the name of the decedent or his nominee, or alleged by the personal representative to have been in the possession of the decedent at the time of his death.\u201d\nSection 301(13) was \u201cintended to obviate, wherever possible, a preliminary dispute as to whether the Orphans\u2019 Court has jurisdiction to determine the title to the disputed property:\u201d Explanatory Comment from the Report of the Joint State Government Commission of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania.\n\u201c \u2018Allegation\u2019 is a synonym for \u2018charge\u2019, \u2018statement\u2019; \u2018claim\u2019 or \u2018declaration\u2019. For a general discussion of the term see Words and Phrases, Vol. 3, pp. 322-326. The distinction between things alleged and things proven is clear\u201d: Webb Estate, supra, footnote 4, p. 588.",
