Chief Justice Jones,\nThis appeal is from a judgment of non pros entered on the defendant\u2019s petition.\nWhere a plaintiff neglects to prosecute his suit diligently and the delay would be harmfully prejudicial to the defendant, if the suit were to be put to trial,, the entry of a judgment of non pros is appropriate: Alker, v. The Philadelphia National Bank, 372 Pa. 327, 332-333, 93 A. 2d 699.\nThe facts appearing of record in the present case, and referred to in the opinion of President Judge Mc-Naughsr for the court en banc, fully justify the action of the .court below in entering the judgment of non pros. That being so, nothing is to be gained by pro-, longing the discussion. Such a judgment is .reversible on appeal only where its entry constitutes a manifest abuse of discretion (Wingert v. Anderson, 309 Pa. 402, 403, 164 A. 333) \u2014a circumstance entirely absent in the present instance.\nJudgment affirmed.",
