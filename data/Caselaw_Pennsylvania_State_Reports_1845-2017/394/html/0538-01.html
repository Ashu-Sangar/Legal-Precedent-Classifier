On May 30, 195.2, he went to live with appellants as a roomer, paying them $20 per month as room rent, which he continued to pay up until the time he moved to a new residence. At the time that he went to live with the appellants, Pecchio was unable to work, and was apparently partially crippled with arthritis and was suffering from some type of intestinal disorder. He continued to reside with appellants until March 6, 1954, when the appellee, his daughter, a recent arrival from Italy, took him to other quarters. Pecchio died on July 12, 1954, approximately four months after he had left appellants’ home. Appellants’ claim is for nursing and other services performed for Pecchio during the period of his residence with them. Appellants made no claim nor demand for payment during decedent’s lifetime.</p>

Furthermore, appellant must overcome a presumption that any services rendered were paid for from time to time while they continued: Gross’s Est., supra; Flaccus v.

This presumption ‘will gather strength with each succeeding year, and the evidence to overthrow it must of course be correspondingly increased’: Gregory v. Com., <a href="/pa/121/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="121 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="561239" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0611-01">121 Pa. 611</a>, 622; Gilbraith’s Est., <a href="/pa/270/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="270 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="1066069" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0288-01">270 Pa. 288</a>, 291.” In <em>Braden Estate, </em>supra, (p. 45), in discussing the quality of evidence required to sustain a claim of this nature, we said: “In respect to the contention that the furnishing of a room and of board and care to Lizzie Braden and her acceptance of the same during her lifetime created an implied contract, and that her estate should pay a reasonable amount by way of compensation, and that the complainants should be permitted to recover on a quantum meruit basis, what this Court held in Gilbraith’s Estate, <a href="/pa/270/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="270 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="1066069" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0288-01">270 Pa. 288</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.%20361" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="113 A. 361">113 A. 361</a>, in negativing such a claim is apposite here. In that case we said, quoting from the syllabus: ‘In claims, for board and nursing, the presumption is that the services were actually paid for periodically, exactly as is the rule in the case of servants’ wages; and this presumption cannot be overcome by vague and uncertain testimony. Claims against a dead man’s estate, which might have been made against him while living, are always the subject of just suspicion, and require clear proof before they will be allowed. . . . Where a claim is made for board and nursing covering a period of years, and it is not shown to have been made while the services were being rendered, nor during a later , period when decedent was living elsewhere, nor until after .the death of the alleged debtor, the burden of proof to overcome the presumption is greatly increased. <em>The presumption is not overcome by evidence of loose declan'utions made by decedent during his lifetime ... No recovery can </em>

These witnesses testified that decedent stated to them on various occasions that: “I am going to fix her. I am going to make her happy.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> “He told me that he was going to will the home on Maplewood Avenue to Mrs. Consentino for taking care of [him]”;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> “Don’t worry.

See <em>Braden Estate, </em>supra; <em>Mooney’s Estate, </em>supra; <em>Gilbraith’s Estate, </em>supra; <em>Monson Estate, </em>supra. The statement of this Court in <em>Mooney’s Estate, </em>supra, (pp. 275-276) is most apposite: “To remove the presumption of periodic payment. . . appellant’s niece explained that she knew her aunt was not being paid because she had to give her carfare to go to decedent’s house, and further that she heard decedent say, ‘If I don’t get my money and get things straightened up to pay her while I am living, I will certainly .leave it to her in my will . . .’ Another witness related that decedent had <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>said, ‘She has been so kind to me I will see she is taken care of.’ Nothing more conclusive appears in the case.’ .■. . The testimony was not nearly sufficient to support the claim. It was indefinite and unsatisfactory. In fact, it fell fár short of proving a single essential fact.”</p>
    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[232,706,1148,1366]]]'>Appellants further urge that the court below erred in refusing to admit into evidence certain paragraphs of the complaint which alleged the performance of services by the claimant and non-payment by the decedent, and were not initially denied by the appellee. Assuming that appellants are technically correct in this contention, we do not believe that the admissions would have materially altered the outcome of the suit. Counsel for appellee explained that the averments had not been denied through inadvertence, and sought to amend the answer at trial. We can see no valid reason for determining the rights of the parties to the present controversy on a technicality of pleading when appellants have been unable to substantiate their claim with clear and convincing testimony. The statement of this Court in <em>Stewart v. Hooks, </em><a href="/pa/372/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="372 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="1238049" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0542-01">372 Pa. 542</a>, 545, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.2d%20756" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="94 A.2d 756">94 A. 2d 756</a>, is most appropriate in dismissing this contention. “Furthermore, any common sense appraisal of the defendants’ position as revealed by all the pleadings leaves no doubt that it was nothing more than an oversight of counsel which occasioned the admission in the original answer. <em>It would be legal sophistry, reminiscent of an age long past, to determine the rights of litigants on such technicalities of </em>pleading.” (Emphasis supplied)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
