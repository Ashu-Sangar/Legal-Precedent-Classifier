Stated otherwise, where a wife [or husband] suffers an injury through the negligent conduct of the husband [or wife], does such injured spouse- acquire a cause of action against the other spouse, (a substantive right), which, solely because of the marital relationship she cannot enforce, (a procedural matter), or does the tort give rise to no cause of action whatsoever in the injured spouse?</p>

The shackles with which.the common law fiction, bound a wife no longer exist. The public policy of prevention of marital discord alone can furnish rational justification for a wife’s disability to sue her husband for a tort during coverture: such policy is directed to procedure. rather than substance. As early as 1826, Mr. <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>Justice Duncan speaking for this Court in <em>Dougherty v. Snyder, </em>15 S. &amp; R. 84, 91 recognized this distinction: “The last objection remains to be considered: it is, that if it be the law, that the wife cannot sue the husband, she cannot sue her husband’s executors; but if this be a contract where the day of payment is postponed until the death of the husband, then the right of action is only suspended. There are numerous decisions to this purpose; and it would not follow, that if it were payable immediately the debt was extinct; the remedy only is suspended, and one, among many other reasons for this is, that the husband and wife form but one body; but on his death, she being the survivor, has all the right not extinguished by the marriage; and therefore, her husband being dead, this can cause no strife between them. She may. sue his executors. . . . It does not follow, because for certain reasons the right may be qualified, and recovery suspended during the coverture, yet when the reasons are removed by the death of the husband, she should have no remedy against the executors.” The tort of a husband or wife which visits injury upon the wife or husband results in a cause of action; by reason of public policy such cause of action cannot be enforced during coverture. In <em>Schubert v. Schubert Wagon Co., </em><a href="/ny/249/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="249 N.Y. 253" data-case-ids="1984728" data-case-paths="/ny/249/0253-01">249 N.Y. 253</a>, 256, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20N.E.%2042" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="164 N.E. 42">164 N.E. 42</a>, Mr. Justice Cakdozo, then Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, stated: “The defendant [husband’s employer] to make out a defense, is thus driven to maintain that the act, however negligent, was none the less lawful because committed by a husband upon the person of his wife. This is to pervert the meaning and effect of the disability, that has its origin in marital identity. <em>A trespass, negligent or willful, upon the person of a wife, does not cease to be an unlawful act, though the law exempts the husband from liability for the damage. </em>Others may not hide be<a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>hind the skirts of his immunity.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> (Emphasis supplied. ) Danger to marital happiness and harmony arises not from the <em>existence </em>of a cause of action arising from the tort, but rather from its <em>enforcement.</em>

L. 73, §28 provided for the survival of actions but expressly excepted “wrongs done to the person”: §18 of the Act of April 15, 1851, P. L. 669, provided that an action based upon negligence should not abate by reason of the death of the <em>plaintiff </em>but that his executor could proceed with the action; the Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 236, provided: “Section 1. Be it enacted, &amp;c., That any right of action which may ' hereafter come into being by reason of injury wrongfully done to the person of another, shall survive the death of the wrong-doer, and may be enforced against his executor or administrator either by continuing against such personal representative a suit which may have been brought against the wrong-doer himself in his lifetime, or by bringing an original suit against his representative after his death.” The Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, §35 provided that a personal representative could be sued upon all personal actions which might have been maintained against the defendant. The effect of these survival actions is to continue causes of action already in existence during decedent’s lifetime: <em>Pezzulli, Admr. v.
