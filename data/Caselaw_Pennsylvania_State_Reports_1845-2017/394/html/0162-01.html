In 1946 these four children were adjudged “neglected” by the Juvenile Court of Cumberland County, and the Court, sitting as a quarter sessions court, placed them in a foster home. In 1948 the same Court committed the four children to the Methodist Home for Children,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">*</a> where they have received excellent care.</p>

Their house is valued at between $20,000 and $21,000, with a mortgage encumbrance of $12,500. Mr. Cochran has an annual salary of approximately $5,000 and an Army retirement pension of $3,200. Mrs. Cochran earns $4,500 a year. They have $2,800 worth of Government savings bonds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">**</a> Mr. Cochran is ready and willing to assume responsibility for the children. The Cochrans were found to be regular church members and of temperate habits. The children, who range in age from 15 to 18 (now 16 to 19) <em>are very anxious to live with their mother </em>and stepfather. The father, who lives near the Methodist Home, opposes the mother’s petition. However, he is in arrears in payment of the support order, and has visited his children much less frequently than their mother, who lives in New Jersey, approximately 200 miles away.</p>
