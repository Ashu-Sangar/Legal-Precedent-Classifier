In the <em>ShevaUer </em>case the Superior Court disapproved an instruction which bound the jury “to add legal interest to the sum of the unliquidated damages which they should fix by their verdict.” However, the present question was not raised and an examination of that opinion clearly indicates its emphasis was not on the amount of interest but rather, upon the fact that the jury was not bound to add legal interest or any interest “unless there is something in the particular case which would justify their going.to that extent.” Similarly in both <em>Mengell's Executors v. Mohnsville Water Co., </em><a href="/pa/224/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="224 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="963073" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0120-01">224 Pa. 120</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.%20201" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="73 A. 201">73 A. 201</a> and <em>Stephens v.

While we did say in the <em>Mengell </em>case (p. 127) that the jury could allow “a sum not exceeding six per cent, but they Can allow a smaller amount,” such was clearly by way of dictum as far as the present question is concerned, and was related solely to the right of the jury to diminish damages for detention because. of the particular circumstances of the case, or by virtue of the condemnee’s actions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> No question was raised in any of. the cases cited by appellant as to the propriety of an; instruction such as that now before us, where no <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>evidence was introduced as to tlie legal rate of interest, and it was admitted by the condemnor that detention damages were properly awarded, subject only to a determination of the proper rate.

It cannot, therefore, be recovered in actions of tort, or in actions of any kind where the damages áre not in their nature capable of exact <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>computation, both as to time and amount. In such cases the party chargeable cannot pay or make tender until both the time and the amount have been ascertained, and his default is not therefore of that absolute nature that necessarily involves interest for the delay. But there are cases sounding in tort, and cases of unliquidated damages, where not only the principle on which the recovery is to be had is compensation, but where also the compensation can be measured by market value, or other definite standards. Such are cases of the unintentional conversion or destruction of property, etc. <em>Into these cases the element of time may enter as an important factor, and the plaintiff will not he fully compensated unless he receive, not only the value of his property, hut receive it, as nearly as may he, as of the date of Ms loss. </em>Hence it is that the jury may allow additional damages, in the nature of interest, for the lapse of time. It is never interest as such, nor as a matter of right, but compensation for the delay, of which the rate of interest affords the fair legal measure.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

The owner of the property was entitled to whatever you determine was the value of the property as of that date, and of course, not having received it, she is entitled to the earning power, which the law fixes at 6%, and to your verdict should be added that amount.”</p>
