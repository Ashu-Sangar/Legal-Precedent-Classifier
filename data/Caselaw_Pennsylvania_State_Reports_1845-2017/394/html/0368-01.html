In 1938 Anna Leschinsky rented a property known as No. 115 Foley Street, Old Forge, Lackawanna County, and decedent moved into the property and became a member of the Leschinsky household. While decedent paid no stipulated amount either for board or rent he did contribute sums to Anna Leschinsky for the household support. In 1945 Anna Leschinsky discussed the purchase of this property with decedent, she having in her possession a sum of money consisting of savings from <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>contributions made to her by decedent and money contributed by her daughter. Up until November 1946 the latter made regular contributions to her mother.</p>
    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[245,539,1146,982]]]'>In October 1945 decedent decided to purchase the Foley Street property. ' To that end he consulted an attorney whom he instructed that he did not want his wife to have any interest in the property. It was décided to take title in the names of Walter and Anna Lynchensky, decedent’s brother-in-law and sister, who would then execute a mortgage for the balance of the purchase price and thereafter convey the premises to Dorothy Leschinsky. In discussing the ultimate grantee of this property decedent rejected the idea of designating any of his children because of their mother’s influence upon them, stating he was satisfied with Dorothy Leschinsky as the grantee “because he knew that if at any time in the future I should ask Dorothy to deed the property to me she will do so.” Neither Anna Leschinsky nor Dorothy Leschinsky took any part in the negotiations leading up to or at the time of the conveyance.</p>

The. Lynehenskys then executed a mortgage on the premises in favor of the Old Forge Bank. The following day Lynehenskys conveyed title to Dorothy Leschinsky subject to the mortgage who has been the title holder ever since that date. Of the purchase price of $4200, decedent paid $100 as earnest money and $2100 by a cashier’s check purchased ■from the Old Forge Bank; the balance of $2000 was financed by the mortgage. To provide the $2100 decedent withdrew $807.53 from his personal savings account and obtained $1300 from Anna Leschinsky which the court below found “came from a fund which Anna Leschinsky had been saving for the joint benefit of <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>John Zahorsky and herself, which at the time of the property purchase was over $1500. The fund was made, up in large part from the periodic contributions made to the household by John Zahorsky.” The court below, found no evidence that at any time after October 16, 1945 Dorothy Leschinsky, wife-appellant, acknowledged any beneficial interest in the property other than her own. Subsequent to the purchase date decedent continued to live in the property and to make contributions to the household expenses. Another tenant of part of the property continued his tenancy and to pay rent to Anna- Leschinsky. All taxes, utility service charges, repair and maintenance bills were billed to Dorothy Leschinsky, but paid by Anna Leschinsky from funds in her possession, including contributions by Dorothy Leschinsky and by decedent and rents received. Decedent personally paid three of the mortgage installments and Anna Leschinsky the rest. The mortgage was paid in full prior to decedent’s death.</p>

The court below found that as of October 16, 1945 a resulting trust in a one-half undivided interest in the property arose in decedent’s favor and directed (1) that the appellants execute and deliver to decedent’s personal representative a deed for such undivided one-half interest in the property for the use of the decedent’s heirs-at-law, (2) that appellants account for all rents derived from the property since decedent’s death and (3) that appellants pay one-<a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>half the balance thereof to decedent’s administratrix.

The evidence did not support such pleading, a fact which was inferentiálly conceded by counsel for plaintiff by brief and at the oral argument. The plaintiff rests her case entirely upon thé theory that the circumstances of the purchase gave rise tó a resulting trust in favor of John Zahorsky. It is obvious that an express trust could not be proved for there is no evidence in the record of such an alleged ■ agreement, and even if there were, the- title documents contain no words establishing a trust and the transfer to Dorothy Leschinsky was absolute in form. Furthermore, any effort to establish under the circumstances an express trust would be met by the bar of parol evidence rule, Restatement, Trusts, §38, and the bar of -the Pennsylvania Statute of- Frauds. Act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 532, §4, 33 P.S. §2.</p>

In other words, we think the evidence clearly establishes a resulting trust so far as John Zahorsky’s interest in the property is concerned running in his own favor, and that he did not at any time manifest an intention that no resulting trust should arise. . . .</p>

It is clear that a substantial part of the down payment made at the time of purchase came from a fund which was derived from a number of sources,' — contributions to the household made by John Zahorsky, contributions' made by Dorothy Leschinsky while she was employed at Raritan Arsenal and subsequently as a member of the United States Navy, and from rentals received, and that the practical management of the property, payment of household bills, taxes, insurance, etc., were all accomplished by Anna Leschinsky. It is understandable that under the peculiar circumstances of the relationship between John Zahorsky and Anna Leschinsky and Anna Leschinsky’s children that an exact accounting or division of the sources of the down payment money and the subsequent mortgage payment moneys could not be made. It seems fair and reasonable to assume that John Zahorsky’s contributions would equal at least one-half of the total paid upon the property, and that the contributions made by Dorothy Leschinsky <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>and other income received by her mother would, fairly amount to the other half.</p>
