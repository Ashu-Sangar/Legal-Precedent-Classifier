The appellant concedes that the spendthrift clause of the trust is ineffective against the claims of the. wife of the cestui que trust for maintenance and support to the extent of the husband’s interest in the trust. That is so even though the trust were created' by one other than the cestui que. It has long been our public policy that the spendthrift provisions of a trust cannot defeat the claims of the wife of a beneficiary for maintenance and support. <em>Moorehead’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/289/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="289 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="1103305" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0542-01">289 Pa. 542</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20802" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="137 A. 802">137 Atl. 802</a> (1927); <em>Stewart’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/334/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="334 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1190772" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0356-01">334 Pa. 356</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20910" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 A.2d 910">5 A. 2d 910</a> (1939). The rule is extended further where the settlor is the beneficiary of his own created trust. In that event, the spendthrift clause does not preclude <em>any </em>creditor from reaching the interest of the settlor-beneficiary. <em>Mogridge’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/342/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="342 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="1207021" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0308-01">342 Pa. 308</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20A.2d%20307" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="20 A.2d 307">20 A. 2d 307</a> (1941); Restatement, Trusts §156, comment (c) ; 2 Scott, Trusts §156 (2d ed. 1956).</p>

The reasoning is best documented by quoting from the opinion of Judge (now Justice) Bok, then of the court below: “Plaintiffs argue that defendant’s right to specify who shall be the beneficiaries of the trust upon his death, when combined with his right to receive the income from the trust during his life, operates to give defendant a fee interest in the trust thereby making the principal attachable for his debts. There is ample authority for this proposition: Benedict v. Benedict, <a href="/pa/261/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="261 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1042175" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0117-01">261 Pa. 117</a> (1918); Nolan v.

Assuming this interpretation to be correct, as a limitation on defendant’s power to control the disposition of the trust res such a restriction is insignificant. Defendant retained the right to give the principal of the trust to anyone whom he wished to name, including those who would be the beneficiaries of his estate. The rights of creditors cannot be circumscribed by such indirection. As was said in Rienzi v. Goodin, <a href="/pa/249/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="249 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1013692" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0546-01">249 Pa. 546</a>, 552 (1915) : ‘. . . It is against public policy to permit the defendant, under cover of a trust in which she reserves to herself the benefits of the property during life and the disposition of it after death, to enjoy all the benefits of ownership <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>and share none of the burdens, while at the same time the property is beyond the reach of creditors.’</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[271,479,1144,650]]]'>“Egbert v. deSolms, <a href="/pa/218/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="218 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="999555" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0207-01">218 Pa. 207</a> (1907), cited by garnishee is inapposite. There the settlors, husband and wife, created a trust, reserving to themselves the income for life, with remainder to their children, or to the issue of a deceased child. They retained the right to determine by will the proportions in which the various children would take. However, they could not appoint anyone but their children as beneficiaries, and, as there were children living at the time of the creation of the trust, the children as a class had a vested remainder. There is no similar vested remainder in this case. See Rienzi v. Goodin, <a href="/pa/249/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="249 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1013692" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0546-01">supra.</a></p>
