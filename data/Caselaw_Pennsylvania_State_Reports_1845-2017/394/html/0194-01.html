The Authority submitted the proposal, with plan, to the Council of the City, which fixed Jiily 6, 1955, as the time for a public hearing. This having been held, Council approved the project by ordinance. Plaintiff’s church is located in the area, and so is. another known as Epiphany Church.</p>

The Authority then exempted Epiphany Church from the project and entered into a bond and later an.agreement with the bishop, dated February 25 and 27, 1958. By this agreement the bishop accepted as damages the sum of $1,240,000 in compromise settlement of the taking and destruction of St. Peter’s Church. The bond and agreement were neither reported to the plaintiff parish by the bishop nor approved by it. This suit followed.</p>

Architecturally and artistically, it is breath-taking in its ampleness, sweep, harmony of lines and classical symmetry. It stands in the very midst of the metropolis of Pittsburgh, a blessed sanctuary of marble and precious stone, flanked by a grotto of heart-warming radiance — a Lourdes Memorial Shrine — to which through the years tens of thousands have made holy pilgrimage.</p>
    <p id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.6",235,[189,1359,1148,650]]]'>St. Peter’s Church, as a structure, will be razed because of a redevelopment plan which envisages the clearing of 90 acres in the so-called Lower Hill Area of Pittsburgh. The Most Reverend John F. Deardon, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, who holds title to the lands, buildings, and appurtenances of St. Peter’s Church in trust for the congregation, cannot but regard with heavy heart the disappearance of this magnificent and holy house of worship, but it is not within his temporal power to stay the act of an agency of government. The Constitution provides for a complete separation between church and state.</p>
    <p id="b235-6" data-blocks='[["BL_235.7",235,[189,2022,1145,320]],["BL_236.1",236,[205,353,1148,1037]]]'>The clearing of the 90-acre tract is the result of action taken under the provisions of the Urban Redevelopment Law of May 24, 1945, P. L. 991, as amended (35 P.S. §1701, et seq.). The clearing is part of the vast program of renaissance and rebuilding in Pittsburgh. This program, insofar as it pertains to the <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>Hill Area, has now reached an advanced stage of fulfillment. Any stoppage or major alteration in it would cause confusion and chaos as well as visit irreparable damage on others whose rights have since intervened. Judge Brown of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County well described the situation in his opinion refusing preliminary injunction: “The Urban Redevelopment Authority has entered into a. loan and grant agreement with the Federal Government; has issued its notes for land acquisition and other costs; and has acquired hundreds of properties in the Lower Hill Redevelopment Area. As this is one of the largest projects of redevelopment ever undertaken in our. City,as well as perhaps in the entire Commonwealth, and in view of the fact that the work is going on within a five-minute walk of this court house, we take judicial notice of the tremendous undertaking involved in this redevelopment project, which comprises over 90 acres in a formerly densely populated district.”</p>
    <p id="b236-4" data-blocks='[["BL_236.5",236,[203,1402,1145,484]]]'>Nevertheless, I sympathize with the parishioners and can appreciate their agony of spirit in the loss of a church to which they are attached and devoted through years of attendance, sacrifice and memories of the most sacred events in the lives of their respective families. But, as pointed out in Justice Bok’s opinion, the law applicable to the case is explicit and, as it now stands, can offer no alternative in the disposition of the legal issue involved.</p>
    <p id="b236-5" data-blocks='[["BL_236.6",236,[203,1898,1142,311]]]'>However, speaking for myself, I am confident that the loyalty manifested by the parishioners toward their Church can not go unnoticed and unrequited, and that in the broad expanse of their fealty and devotion, a church will rise to receive the expression of their faith and their love.</p>
