    <p id="b93-8" data-blocks='[["BL_93.12",93,[161,1457,1148,423]]]'>By ordinance No. 488 of December 1, 1947, as amended, the city imposed an annual mercantile license tax on persons engaged in the occupation or business of vending or dealing in goods, wares and merchandise with thé proviso, however, that the terms “dealer in” or. “vendor of goods, wares and merchandise” were not to be taken as including vendors of or dealers in articles of their own manufacture.</p>

The School District appealed its cáse to the Superior Court which held that the Electric Welding Company’s income was derived from manufacturing and that, therefore, it was not liable for <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>the mercantile license tax. See <em>Electric Welding Company v, Pittsburgh School District, </em>186 Pa.

Our study of the present record leads us, however, to the opposite conclusion, viz., that the goods, wares and merchandise, here in issue, which the Electric Welding Company deals in or vends are not of its own manufacture and that, accordingly, it is liable for the mercantile license tax on that portion of its business.</p>
    <p id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[248,860,1145,709]]]'>The operations of the company fall into five general classifications, as follows: (1) wire mesh, (2) load transfer units, (3) concrete reinforcing bars, (4) column spirals, and (5) special reinforcing assemblies. It is only the last three classes with which we are here Concerned. The City has heretofore conceded that the production of load transfer units, (2) above, constitutes manufacturing, while the company has likewise conceded that its wire mésh operation, (1) above, is not in any way connected with manufacturing. The question then is whether the company’s operations coming under classifications, (3), (4) and (5) above, constitute manufacturing.</p>
    <p id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.6",94,[246,1582,1145,642]]]'>The concrete reinforcing bars are used in the construction of highways, buildings, bridges, etc., in which concrete constitutes a considerable part Of the structure. As used in the construction, the reinforcing bars are- arranged in place and concrete is then poured around them. Thus, they become integrated with and give additional strength to the structure. The company purchases from the producers steel rods of various sizes, cuts them to desired lengths and then bends or twists them to suit the specific reinforcing purpose for Which usé the rods are then sold by the company to the construction contractor.</p>

The company purchases mill coils of steel rods which it straightens and recoils to a desired diameter and pitch of the coil. Steel channels are then tack-welded to the spiral, thus coiled by the company, for the purpose of giving- it stability. After the steel spiral has been set in place the contractor pours concrete around it and the spiral becomes an integral part of the completed structure.</p>
    <p id="b95-3" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[156,814,1152,823]]]'>Special reinforcing assemblies are the type of products which the company is called upon by a building contractor to design specifically for the purpose of strengthening concrete. Examples of special assemblies are trusses and pile cages. Trusses are the metal materials which are laid horizontally between two beams of a building, under construction, to support a concrete floor. Pile cages are steel rods sunk into the. ground in a circular pattern at the point where the piers of a bridge are to be located. After concrete is poured into the forms around the pile cages the structure becomes a support for the bridge, pier which will be constructed upon it. The operations required to make a special assembly depend necessarily and exclusively upon the design of the desired product.</p>

The changes which the company makes in the steel rods or coils which it purchases are purely superficial. In the case of the concrete reinforcing bars the company shears the steel rods to a specified length and bends or twists them into the desired shape. In preparing column spirals and special assemblies, the company performs similar operations. It straightens and recoils the steel and then makes its assembly operations either manu<a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>ally or by tack-weldiñg.
