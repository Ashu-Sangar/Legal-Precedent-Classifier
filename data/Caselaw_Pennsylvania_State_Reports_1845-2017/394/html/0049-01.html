The matter came before the court on preliminary. objections by. the. defendants to. the plaintiffs’ .amended , complaint, whose averments are necessarily to. be taken as true in the procedural stage obtaining.</p>
    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.9",82,[250,1139,1157,1202]],["BL_83.1",83,[141,377,1152,931]]]'>: The' plaintiffs, a father and son, were the operators 6f a restaurant business, licensed "to sell alcoholic and malt beverages, at 38 West Woodland Avenue, Springfield Township, Delaware County, under a lease of the premises from the owner. Compelled to seek a new location because of the local school district’s -contemplated acquisition of the premises, the; plaintiffs on January T, 1957, entered into an agreement with the owner of the-property and the School Board. Thereby ; the plaintiffs agreed to relinquish their leasehold interest and were given the right to a continued tenure of the premises for a minimum term of ten months. In July following, the plaintiffs’ leased Store No. 18 in the Springfield Shopping Center in Springfield Township., Under the provisions of the agreement between the plaintiffs, the School District and the owner of the property at 38'West Woodland Avenue, November 26, 1957 became the termination date of the plaintiffs’ lease of that property. On November 8, 1957, the plaintiff, John M. Doyle, personally delivered -to the township building inspector a written application for a certificate of occupancy for -Store- No! 1.8" in the <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>Springfield Shopping Center. The building inspector, failed to take any action on the application within the ten-day period limited therefor by the Springfield Township Building Code. On November 19, the plaintiffs demanded that the building inspector issue an occupancy certificate to them, which he refused-to do. The plaintiffs thereupon, by writing, appealed to the Board of Commissioners and the Township Committee on Building Regulations, the latter being a duly organized committee of township commissioners authorized to enforce the township’s building code. The ap-. peal was denied on January 14, 1958 without any reasons • being assigned for the refusal of an occupancy certificate as applied for by the plaintiffs. No question under the township, zoning ordinance was in any way involved; restaurants are a permitted use of property in the Springfield Shopping Center.</p>
    <p id="b83-4" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[139,1321,1155,698]]]'>Under the undenied facts of this case, issuance to-the plaintiffs of an occupancy certificate, for their usé. of Store No. 18 in the Springfield Shopping Center as a restaurant, called for a purely ministerial act on the part of the building inspector. The plaintiffs had done all that was required of them; and the building inspector’s refusal to issue • the certificate was arbitrary, capricious and unwarranted. In that situation mandamus afforded the appropriate remedy. See <em>Herskovits v.

What we said in <em>Hilovsky Liquor License Case, </em><a href="/pa/379/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="379 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1253581" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0118-01">379 Pa. 118</a>, 123-124, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.2d%20705" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="108 A.2d 705">108 A. 2d 705</a>, is peculiarly pertinent here, — “We conclude therefore, that, since restaurants are permitted by the ordinance in the district to which appellants wish to remove their business, they are entitled to locate there as a matter Of right so far as the zoning ordinance is concerned, and without surrendering the privilege of selling liquor under the license granted them by the Liquor Control Board, provided that that Board approves the transfer of the license.” See also <em>Dooling’s Windy Hill, Inc. v.
