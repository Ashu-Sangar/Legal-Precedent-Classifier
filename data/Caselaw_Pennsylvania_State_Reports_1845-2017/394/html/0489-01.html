On that date the district assessor, at the request of the School Board of Willis-town- Township, a fourth class school district, and, pursuant to §677.1 of the 1949 School Code, inspected and reassessed the said lots and buildings erected thereon. On July 2,1956 Prichard was mailed a notice of school tax for the 1956 school year covering ten lots (including those presently involved), based upon the assessment of bare ground shown by the tax duplicate of the preceding fall. A total of 18.63 acres of land was assessed at $3,384 for a total tax of $87.98. In July 1956, a second notice for the ten lots was mailed to appellee, also covering the 1956 school tax, but based upon the reassessment of June 1, 1956. In terms of building lots the land was reassessed at $8,000 and the improvements at $57,000 for a total tax of $1690.

On December 1,1940 the buildings were completed and the assessor reassessed these properties with the value of the improvements added. The property owner argued that an improvement on property made after August 31 of any year other than a triennial year was not subject to reassessment because the statute provides, inter alia: “. . . the assessors are hereby required to complete the said assessments and to make return thereof not later than ninety days from the date of the issuing of [precepts to make assessments which were to be issued on or before June 1],” and since this statutory provision was mandatory any improvement made after August 31 of any one year other than a triennial year would be tax free during the subsequent year and that such was the intent of the statute. The Superior Court stated (p. 361) : “The interpretation suggested ... is not necessary for the protection of property owners from unjust or inequitable taxation, or from the overreaching of the taxing authorities; but it would permit unwarranted exemptions from taxation . . .”, and the court held that the time of the return did not invalidate the reassessments or render them void, the statute being directory and not mandatory. <em>York &amp; Foster, Inc., Tax Assessment Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/163/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="163 Pa.

The appellant contended that an assessment increase by the Board made on November 24 was invalid because it was not made prior to September 1 and no notice of the increase was received until after October 1. The Superior Court held that the County Assessment Law was manifest of a legislative intent to establish a uniform system of procedure, that appellant had failed to show that it was injured by reason of the revision in its assessment having been made later than the date set forth in the Act, and that the statute was not mandatory but directory in its time provisions.</p>

The Act of July 27, 1939<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> provided that the Board of Revision of Taxes for Philadelphia County, ten days prior to the first Monday in October of each year, shall give printed or written notice to the registered owners of real property upon which the assessment had been increased or decreased, of the change made and that said notice must set forth that an appeal may be filed on or before the <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>first Monday of October. On December 1, 1949 a notice was sent to the owner of realty of an increased assessment for the next calendar year, the assessment covering a warehouse and bindery which had not been completed until November 1949. The realty owner protested that notice was not given prior to October 1 as the statute required. The sole question was whether the statutory provision fixing the time of sending notice of a change of assessment was mandatory or directory. This Court, speaking through the present Chief Justice, stated, inter alia: “. . . it is not necessary, in order to protect property owners from unusual or inequitable taxation or from overreaching by the Board of Revision or by an assessor, that [the statutory provision as to time] be interpreted as mandatory so long as the rights of property owners to protest their assessments and to appeal therefrom are respected. On the other hand, if the provision were construed to be mandatory, a property owner would escape taxation throughout the succeeding calendar year on all new construction completed after the third Monday of September of the assessment year. . . . Moreover, the Act was not intended to afford an escape for a property owner from just taxation because of the oversight, inadvertence or dilatoriness of an assessor or of the Board of Revision” (pp. 472, 473). In answer to the argument therein made, and presently made, that tax statutes are to be construed strictly against the taxing authorities and most favorably to the taxpayer, it was said: “To hold that a time limitation in a statute is directory rather than mandatory does not mean that the statute has been liberally construed ... In final analysis, the inquiry ... is as to the correct legislative intent. Nor does any rule of construction require that the statutory procedural provisions for the assessment of property for taxation be so interpreted as to permit <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>a particular taxpayer to escape payment of Ms fair share of the tax burden.” (pp. 474, 475)</p>
    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[247,473,1145,1190]]]'>The time provisions of Section 677.1 of the School Code are directory, not mandatory. Any other construction would thwart the legislative intent and render impossible of execution the salutary provisions of the statute. Property owners whose properties are reassessed under the statute have a right of appeal from such reassessment: they can file their appeal within a period corresponding to the time allowed between the nominal deadline for reassessment notices of August 25th and the appeal deadline of September 1. Prior to the passage of Section 677.1 a property owner who entered upon the construction of buildings after September 1 would not be subject to taxation of such buildings by the School District until a year from the following July. By Section 677.1 the legislature allows new building construction to be taxed immediately that it might bear its fair share of the tax burden. So long as the property owner has a right to appeal from a reassessment of his property as he undoubtedly has under this statute, the legislature was acting within its constitutional authority in the enactment of this statute.</p>
    <p id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.6",532,[245,1685,1146,647]]]'>Appellee’s next contention is that the statutory provisions are invalid because they do not provide for a tax levy. A tax levy is “the formal and official action of a legislative body determining and declaring that a tax of a certain amount, or of a certain percentage on value, shall be imposed on persons and property subject thereto”: McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (2nd ed.), §2564. The assessment involves “the preparation of lists of properties, real and personal, subject to taxation and the valuation thereof in the manner prescribed by law by the proper public authorities”: McQuillin, supra, §2565.</p>
    <p id="b533-2" data-blocks='[["BL_533.3",533,[141,366,1150,1707]]]'>
      <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>The tax levy in the instant case was made in the spring of 1956. Section 677.1 neither makes nor purports to make a new tax levy; it simply provides a method for the reassessment of taxable property and for the inclusion in the tax duplicate of any additional property subject to tax. While the inclusion in the tax duplicate of additional property subject to tax may result in an increase in the tax receipts over and above the amount of such tax receipts anticipated by the school district when it enacted its tax levy, such fact neither invalidates the inclusion in the tax duplicate of the additional taxable property nor affects in any manner the principle that the levy of taxes must not exceed the amount of the municipal budget. All that Section 677.1 accomplishes is the prevention of persons from escaping just taxation. What this Court said in <em>State Line &amp; Sullivan R. R. Co.’s Taxation, </em><a href="/pa/264/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="264 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="1048526" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0489-01">264 Pa. 489</a>, 493, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20A.%20860" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="107 A. 860">107 A. 860</a>, is apposite to the construction to be given Section 677.1: “It is not the policy of the law to permit persons to escape taxation through an omission by the assessor to place a property in assessment. That such result may not be accomplished, courts will give a liberal construction to those acts which tend to an equalization of the burden of taxation”. Section 677.1, providing for a reassessment of property as of a date after the first of the tax year and permitting the collection of taxes thereon for the remaining part of such year, realistically permits the imposition of a tax for a part of the year even though the subject of the tax has not existed during the full year. This contention of appellee is without merit.</p>

So it is .that the levy of school taxes is, in that respect, equal and uniform upon all properties of the same class, as is mandatory by Section 603 of the Code, and the general constitutional prerequisite.”</p>
    <p id="b534-4" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[253,1082,1144,596]]]'>The court below found that the provisions of Section 677.1 were “so vague and indefinite and ambiguous as to preclude plain application in the circumstances here”. Unfortunately we do not have the benefit of the reasons which led the court to this conclusion. Our own examination of Section' 677.1 leads us to the opposite conclusion. We fail to find any such ambiguity, uncertainty or vagueness in the statute which makes it unworkable or incapable of application in the instant situation, or would furnish any basis for declaring the statute invalid.</p>
    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.6",534,[251,1698,1145,474]]]'>The purpose inherent in Section 677.1 is salutary. By its terms the legislature has wisely and commendably closed a loophole in the tax statutes through which property owners by the postponement of building construction until after September 1st of any year could escape just and equitable taxation by a school district for a period of almost two years. We fail to find, in this legislative enactment any invalidity or conflict with the Constitution.</p>
