Item Eighth actually disposed of the residue of the estate. We are called upon to interpret by way of identification Item Eighth, paragraph 51 which provides as follows: “to any grandniece or nephew born •after the execution of this Will, one-half (%) part of the residue, until 3 parts are consumed.”</p>

The court below properly concluded that the language of Item Eighth paragraph 51 was intended to include only grandnieces or grandnephews and not great grandnieces or great grandnephews and that testatrix had specifically limited to six, the number of legatees entitled to distribution. Of the six <em>natural </em>grandnieces and grandnephews four were born more than one year subsequent to testatrix’s death and the <em>adopted </em>grandniece and grandnephew were adopted more than a' year after testatrix’s death. The court below properly concluded that the language of Item Eighth, paragraph -51 evidenced a class gift which failed as to all but the two grandnieces who were en ventre sa mere at the time of testatrix’s death. A grandniece and two • grandnephews who were excluded from the class gift have appealed from the decree of the court below.</p>
