Appellant was reinstated on November 28, 1955. In' the present action, appellant sought to recover his salary accumulated during the period of suspension.

There is something quite startling (insofar as public welfare is concerned) about a Court decision which places a premium on sloth and a penalty on industry. If Vega had sat in his parlor for nineteen months doing nothing but watching television, eating sandwiches, and drinking beer, the Borough would have had to pay him $5,850, but, because he exerted himself, as a good citizen and a responsible member of society should, by working, while the Borough was denying him what he was entitled to, he must give up $5,608.56 which he earned by his own sweat 'and toil. Such a situation does not strike a very melodious chord on the piano of justice which I always <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>try to keep tuned in the living room of my mind and heart.</p>
    <p id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[261,484,1145,594]]]'>The Majority Opinion says: “The improperly dismissed employee is protected from financial loss but [is] not to be unjustly enriched.” But since the Majority’s statement specifically declares that the employee was “improperly dismissed” how can there be an unjust enrichment? Even if the municipality paid Vega the entire amount of $5850 due him during the period of improper dismissal, he would still be out of pocket because of the not inconsiderable expense to which he was subjected in litigating his claim now proved to be in accordance with law.</p>
    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[256,1091,1148,762]]]'>The Majority cites the case of <em>Seltzer v. Reading, </em><a href="/pa-super/151/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="151 Pa. Super. 226" data-case-ids="1047346" data-case-paths="/pa-super/151/0226-01">151 Pa. Superior Ct. 226</a>, where “full pay” was also interpreted to mean “part pay.” But if it is wrong today to distort the plain wording of a statute, the distortion is not straightened by showing that on a prior occasion the same deforming manipulation took place. If the Legislature intended that where an improper dismissal occurs the employee should only be paid the difference between what he has earned and what he should have been paid during the dismissal interval, it would have been a very simple matter to have so stated. I believe that it is gratuitous on the part of this Court to read into statutes what is precisely not there and what was undoubtedly purposely omitted.</p>
    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.7",448,[254,1865,1144,488]],["BL_449.1",449,[173,368,1147,430]]]'>It may well be that the Legislature intended to penalize municipalities for improper dismissals by requiring them to pay the innocent and injured employee Ms full pay for the period he was under unjust accusation. It may also be that the Legislature intended by the provision in question to compel the municipality to proceed expeditiously in resolving any dispute between it and the employee. Under the Majority’s ruling the municipality has nothing to lose by an undue <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>prolongation of the controversy (once it knows the employee is employed elsewhere) even though the delay may be subjecting the employee to considerable hardship. In the very case at bar it will be noted that Yega had to leave Burgettstown and work in a town far removed from his home in order to get bread to put on the table for himself and family, while the question of his illegal dismissal was being adjudicated.</p>
    <p id="b449-3" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[168,810,1150,698]]]'>The Majority sees much merit in a distinction attempted to be drawn by the lower Court as follows: “Where the duties of the office are to be exercised for the benefit of the public, for a stipulated compensation to be paid by the public, where the term is definite and the tenure certain, and where the powers, duties and emoluments become vested in a successor when the office becomes vacant, the occupant of such office is a public officer. On the other hand, it is recognized that some officers, although they have some public duties to perform, are not to be considered public officers, when their work in the. main is of a ministerial nature . . .”</p>
    <p id="b449-4" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[164,1530,1151,431]]]'>I fail to see the distinction. The Court says that a chief of police “exercises no public functions, his duties are purely ministerial.” I should think that the functions of a chief of police are quite public and that his duties involve a great deal of discretion. He does not arrest blindly or by chance, he does not establish fire lines and police lines by rote, he does not quell riots and disturbances by mechanical routine.</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.6",449,[162,1973,1149,373]],["BL_450.1",450,[252,372,1144,485]]]'>The Majority quotes from the case of <em>Alworth v. County of Lackawanna, </em><a href="/pa-super/85/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="85 Pa. Super. 349" data-case-ids="665640" data-case-paths="/pa-super/85/0349-01">85 Pa. Superior Ct. 349</a>, 352, which says: “If the officer is chosen by the electorate, or appointed, for a definite and certain tenure in the manner provided by law to an office whose duties are of a grave and important character, involving some of the functions of government, and are to be exercised <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>for the benefit of the public for a fixed compensation paid out of the public treasury, it is safe to say that the incumbent is a public officer.” All these provisions would still apply to a chief of police because he is certainly appointed for a definite and certain tenure and his duties are indeed of a just and important character and they are certainly exercised for the benefit of the public for a fixed compensation paid out of the public treasury.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[249,867,1146,864]]]'>With all respect, I must say that in a case of this kind, the distinction being attempted by the lower Court, and affirmed by this Court, between a public officer and a public employee is illusory and deceptive. Under the rule here announced by this Court a director of public safety would indubitably be regarded as a public officer and if dismissed improperly would, upon reinstatement, be entitled to the full salary of his office even though in the meantime he had been employed by a private corporation at a higher salary than his director’s salary, while a chief of police, for doing the same thing, would lose his salary completely or have it considerably reduced. This is a distinction which does not appeal to my sense of justice and it is a distinction which, as I read the statute, the Legislature never intended to make.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[248,1752,1144,587]]]'>When the Constitution is amended to provide that the Supreme Court shall sit as a super legislative reference bureau to rewrite statutes to conform to its idea of what the law should be, a decision such as the one now being promulgated will be entirely in order. However, until that time arrives, I must assert that we have no right to declare that when the Legislature says “full pay” it must have been unfamiliar with the rudiments of the English language, and meant to say “part pay,” or “full pay less all the money he has earned elsewhere.”</p>
