The Orphans’ Court Act of 1951 enlarged the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court in that it conferred upon that Court the authority to determine title to personalty not only where actual or presumptive possession was in decedent when he died or where such possession was in the personal representative after the death but also where the personalty was <em>registered </em>in the name of decedent or his nominee or where the personal representative <em>alleged </em>that decedent possessed the personalty at the time of his death.
