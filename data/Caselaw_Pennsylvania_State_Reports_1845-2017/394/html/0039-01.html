For example, they provide for life insurance, the title, use and possession of premises 134 Penn Avenue, Collingswood, New Jersey, payment of taxes and insurance on said property and the painting of the outside of the dwelling house on said property. Even with respect to the payment of $50 per wéek “to be paid during the natural life of the petitioner”, it is recited that this is “in lieu of any . . . alimony”. Furthermore, the Supreme Court of New Jersey has recently construed this agreement and characterized it as a property settlement: <em>West Jersey Title &amp; Guaranty Co. v.

In that case Anna Mae Scott and the Executors of the Estate of William H. Scott each claimed the proceeds of the sale of premises 134 Penn Avenue, Collingswood, New Jersey. The Supreme Court of New Jersey awarded the entire proceeds of the sale to Anna Mae Scott, and said: “There can be no doubt as to the quality and integrity of the agreement embodied in the decree <em>nisi; </em>it was a property settlement that to all intents and purposes merged in the decree itself, amenable to the equitable remedy of specific performance for the effectuation of the right or other remedial process.”</p>
