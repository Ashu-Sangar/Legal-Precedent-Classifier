    <p id="b191-7" data-blocks='[["BL_191.6",191,[168,1314,1151,765]]]'>Defendants raise two questions in this appeal: (1) The question of lack of donative intent was not raised by the pleadings and therefore, because of the variance between the pleadings and the proof, no equitable relief should be granted. It was the defendants’ own testimony concerning these savings accounts which raised at the trial the issue of donative intent. Furthermore, no objection was made by defendants to any of this testimony. For this reason defendants cannot successfully claim that they were prejudiced or even surprised by the testimony, and we, therefore, find no merit in this technical contention: <em>Malone v. </em>Melnick, <a href="/pa/378/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="378 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1250869" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0483-01">378 Pa. 483</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.2d%20806" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="106 A.2d 806">106 A. 2d 806</a>; <em>Pennsylvania Raiilroad Co. v. </em>Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/335/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="335 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="1193077" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0449-01">335 Pa. 449</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20907" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 A.2d 907">6 A. 2d 907</a>.</p>

Peter, whose testimony at a previous trial was read into the record, testified that the policy was in his possession. Anna testified that it was in her possession. Peter testified that the proceeds were to be used to pay Stella’s funeral expenses and for masses for the soul of Stella and their mother and father. Anna testified that the proceeds were to be used to pay Stella’s funeral bills. The record shows, prima facie, a valid gift to Peter for very worthy - purposes, and the evidence presented by ■Stella’s guhfdian was’ not legally sufficient to; justify a termination, revocation or nullification by the guardian.
