Nonetheless the court below gave the Act Of 1785 present effect by construing the word “penalty”, used in the Forest Tree Seedling Act, as coming within :the term “forfeiture” in the 1785 statute of limitations. It is, of course, well known that the description “penalty” does not <em>ipso facto </em>connote a penalty in the restricted sense of that term but. may well be a convenient formula for determining damages in particular circumstances.

In other words, the contracts were entered into by the Commonwealth for conservation purposes and were designed to help protect some of the State’s natural resources and advantages. The language of the various contracts makes it plain beyond question that the dominant purpose of the Commonwealth, in entering into the contracts, was to receive conservation benefits.

It would not be possible to estimate the damage from insufficient watershed, from soil erosion, or to the lessening of the future timber supply for wood products. Since the legal benefit for which the Commonwealth had bargained in its transactions with the defendants was clearly far in excess of the sale value of the trees, the treble damage clause must necessarily be respected.

Double the value may not be more than complete indemnity. There are many cases in which a party injured is allowed . to recover in a civil action double or treble damages. Suits for infringement of patents are instances, and in some States a plaintiff recovers double damages for cutting timber upon his land.

Section 3 of the Act of March 27, 1824, •8 Sm., L. 282, provided “That in all cases where any person . . . shall cut down or fell . . . any timber tree or trees, growing upon the lands of another, -without the consent of the owner thereof, he . . . shall be liable to pay to such owner double the value of . such tree .or trees, so cut down or felled; or in case of the conver: sion thereof to the use of such offender or offenders, treble the value thereof, to be recovered with costs of suit, by action of trespass or trover, as the case may bé; and no prosecution by indictment shall-be any. bar to such action.” The concluding proviso was obviously inserted for the reason that by Section 1 of-the Same Act the cutting down or felling of trees by anyone “knowing the same to be growing upon the lands of another person, without, the consent of the owner . -...” was made a .misdemeanor subjecting the offender upon conviction to the payment of the costs of prosecution and such fine as the court in its discretion might think proper to inflict. Thus, the same statute provided- for <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>the penal liability of the offender for the crime and for his civil responsibility to the owner of the trees for the tort. The double or treble damages, as the case might be, were meant to be compensatory to the owner because of the possible extent of the indeterminable injury through the loss of trees beyond what might be appraised as their sale or market value. That actions to recover double or treble amounts under statutes of the type of the Forest Tree Seedling Act are not penal, see <em>Chattanooga Foundry v.

As we have seen, the pending action is really to recover a penalty in damages. . . . Yet in Hare on Discovery, 131, we find that a discovery will <em>not </em>be ordered, “if the answer of the defendant might be evidence tending to subject him to punishment by any judicial or competent authority, or <em>to any penalty </em>or forfeiture.” Then Story’s <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>Equity, §1494: “Courts of equity will not entertain a bill for a discovery to aid the promotion or defence of a suit which is not purely of a civil nature. Thus, for example, they will not compel discovery in aid of a criminal prosecution <em>or a penal </em>actionSo, also, Brightly’s Equity, §480. . . . But the case in hand is to recover the penalty of treble damages for cutting and converting the plaintiff’s timber trees. In such a case, it would appear, <em>a discovery will not lie. </em>The reason for the rule excluding a discovery in actions of a penal character would seem to be in harmony with the policy of our criminal jurisprudence, which will not require the person charged to produce evidence against himself. . . .’</blockquote>
