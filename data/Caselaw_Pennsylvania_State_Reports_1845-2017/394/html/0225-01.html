Due to the number of litigants involved and the variety of legal questions presented, the facts pertinent to each claim and each claimant’s contentions will be discussed, separately, after a brief recital of the factual, background common to all the claims. .</p>

On December 10, 1947, the decedent, and Albright, as a general contractor, entered into a written agreement whereby Albright was to perform certain construction work on a property owned by decedent for a consideration of $42,180. On January 9, 1948, a supplemental agreement was made providing for addi<a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>tional work in the amount of 115,82o.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Both sums were payable by decedent two months after the issuance of the Architect’s Certificate of Final Completion of the work, one Francis Jobson being employed by decedent as the architect. On April 10, 1948, after Albright had acknowledged in writing a default on his part under the above mentioned agreements, another contract was executed by the parties. Albright apparently admitted his default in order to induce decedent to apply for a construction mortgage in the amount of $45,000, the costs of obtaining which Al-bright agreed to assume, together with the payment of interest on the mortgage. It was also contemplated at this time that a permanent mortgage would subsequently be obtained in a larger amount. The consolidated agreement required that Albright perform the same construction work called for in the previous agreements for the same consideration of $58,000, but provided for payments on account of work completed and approved with a twenty per cent retention until two months after final completion of the work. Decedent then applied for a construction mortgage in the amount of $40,000.</p>

On June 4, 1948, settlement was held on the construction mortgage and the $40,000 was made available to decedent. Previous to the date of settlement, Albright had received $18,300 from decedent and he received an additional $26,576.79 from the mortgage fund, or total payments of $44,-<a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>876.79.

Negotiations between decedent, Albright, Jobson and some of the sub-contractors took place during the months of June, July and August of 1948. Appellant Guerrina contends that the result of these negotiations was the personal assumption by decedent of the amount due Guerrina under its contract with Albright and was to be paid from the funds of the permanent mortgage when it was secured. Appellant Parker maintains that a partial assignment was made to him by Albright of the amount that would be due Albright under his contract with decedent, that this represented a valid claim against decedent and should have been paid as' soon as the permanent mortgage was secured.</p>

On September 9, 1949, decedent filed a petition to open the judgment which had been assigned to Hoffman. On January 12, 1950, a permanent mortgage in the amount of $75,000 was obtained. After the construction mortgage had been satisfied a sum of approximately $35,000 remained which was ultimately used to reduce the permanent mortgage. Commencing in February of 1950, a number of attachment executions were issued against decedent and decedent was given notice of claims of other general creditors of Al-bright. These comprise the balance of the claims against the estate.</p>

At the time of the assignment, Hoffman failed to obtain from Boyd a declaration of no setoff or counterclaim. The estate’s defense is an alleged oral agreement entered into at the time of execution of the note upon wMch judgment was entered. Judge C. William Kraft, Jr., win) at that time was decedent’s attorney, testified that at a meeting held subsequent to the execution and delivery of the note Albright, admitted that the note was to be used only for the purpose of-raising sufficient funds to continue operations and was to be considered paid when the amount received by Albright from decedent, particularly from the construction mortgage, equalled the face amount of the note. Judge Kraft’s testimony was substantiated by Joseph Guerrina, a sub-contractor, who testified that Albright admitted to him that the note was given only to insure the granting of the construction mortgage and it was to be paid from the first monies Albright received from decedent. On the other hand, Jobson, the architect, testified that it was his understanding that the note was to be paid at the completion of the job and that he made no record of any pay<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>ments against the note in keeping the accounts between decedent and Albright. If the evidence introduced on behalf of the estate be admissible, it is obvious that the note had been paid at the time judgment was entered and this would constitute a valid defense both as against Albright and his assignee, Hoffman.</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[247,698,1157,1037]]]'>However, appellant Hoffman maintains that the introduction of oral testimony as to the conditions upon which the note was issued and the specification of the mode of payment constitute a violation of the parol evidence rule in that it alters and varies the terms of a written instrument intended by the parties to embody the complete agreement between them. In support of this argument, Hoffman relies primarily upon <em>Speier v. Michelson, </em><a href="/pa/303/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="303 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1130037" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0066-01">303 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20127" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="154 A. 127">154 A. 127</a>, wherein, we stated that an allegation of an oral agreement to restrict the payment of a negotiable instrument to a specific fund would not constitute a sufficient defense to an action on the note because to permit evidence of such oral agreement would contradict the terms of the note bearing on its face an unqualified promise, to pay a specific amount of money. In any event, Hoffman argues that even if the evidence relied upon by the estate was admissible, such evidence is insufficient to establish the purported parol agreement.</p>

(Emphasis supplied). The rule enunciated in the <em>Allinger </em>case governs the present situation. Both <em>Judge </em>Kraft and the subcontractor, Guerrina, testified that Albright admitted that the note was to be considered paid from the first moneys Albright was to, and did, in fact, receive from the decedent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In proceedings to open the judgment entered upon the note — at a time when both parties were living — Albright not only failed to take the stand <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>to deny the agreement between the parties but in his sworn answer substantially admitted such an understanding. Although the record in the present case is not as strong as that in the <em>Allinger </em>case in that therein the assignor himself testified and admitted the terms of the contemporaneous agreement while instantly the admission was proven by testimony found to be clear, precise and convincing by the court below, we believe that the evidence is such as to bring it within the <em>AlVmger </em>rule and that such testimony is not excluded by the parol evidence rule.

The estate, however, contends that the only agreement to pay Guerrina directly from the proceeds of the permanent mortgage was made by the architect, <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>Jobson,. who had no authority to bind decedent. An examination of the correspondence and conferences upon which the purported agreement is based is necessary for a determination of the validity of the claim.</p>
    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.5",268,[224,595,1154,1414]]]'>•' On January 22, 1948, Albright accepted Guerrina’s bid to perform, as a sub-contractor, the masonry work required by the contract between decedent, and.Al-bright. In the early spring of 1948, Guerrina, apparently fearful of Albright’s financial, status, ceased work: and-refused to continue until it received compensation for the portion, of .work it had performed together with a guarantee that interim payments would be made to it as the work progressed, although its contract with Albright called for payment only upon completion. This impasse resulted in a conference on June 21, 1948, between Jobson, Albright, Guerrina and a Mr. Christy, Guerrina’s attorney. As a consequence of-this meeting, Christy forwarded to Jobson a letter dated June 21,1948, prepared for the signature of both Albright and decedent, or his attorney, which purported to reduce to writing the results achieved at the conference. This agreement, which would have imposed direct liability upon decedent for any sums owed or that would be due from Albright to Guerrina, was never signed by any of the parties. On June 23, Job-son replied to Christy’s letter setting forth the conditions upon which the work was to continue and the manner in which Guerrina was to be paid. Upon this letter the claim of Guerrina is in a large measure based.</p>

On July 13, Jobson forwarded to Albright a letter approved by decedent which authorized Jobson to make payments directly to Guerrina from the proposed mortgage fund. This authorization was signed by Albright and subsequently returned to Jobson. In a letter to Guerrina on July 15, Jobson reduced to writing the results of the negotiations between them, namely, that payment would be made from the mortgage funds by vouchers issued by Jobson and authorized by Albright.</p>

Certain additional work not covered by the contract between decedent and Albright was ordered by Jobson and approved by decedent. On the first of five purchase orders authorizing extra work was the statement that: “The above work shall be done and shall be billed as above and to be settled at the completion of the work out of funds to be made available at final settlement in addition to other balances owing, and shall be covered in letter dated June 23, 1948.” Guerrina contends that from this statement and Jobson’s testimony as to what took place at this meeting can be found decedent’s consent to guarantee payment directly to Guerrina for all sums that might be due at the completion of its contract. We are unable to agree with this conclusion.</p>

This letter specifically denied the direct personal liability of Boyd or his attorney to Guerrina and it represented only a partial assignment by Al-bright of the funds that would be due him when final settlement was made. The agreement was consummated by Jobson’s letter of July 15 to Guerrina after he had secured decedent’s approval and Albright’s written authorization to make the assignment.</p>

Albright, however, could only authorize payment from that portion of the fund to which he was entitled by virtue of his completion of the contract.

Rutenberg, Albright’s attorney, was a clear confirmation of what had been agreed upon in the negotiations between the parties in June, July and August of 1948; that is, that decedent would be directly liable for payment to Guerrina out of the mortgage fund. In addition to the fact that we are of the opinion that no such intention was manifested by decedent in these negotiations, an examination of the circumstances under which the letter was written discloses a further reason for the rejection of this contention. This letter was written in an attempt to settle the dispute existing between Albright and decedent <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>in order to complete the contract. At the time it was written, Guerrina had filed suit against decedent and the judgment assigned to Hoffman was still in effect. The obvious intent of the statement in Judge Kraft’s letter was to direct Albright as a condition to final settlement to satisfy the creditors directly from the mortgage in order to relieve decedent from the possibility of further complications. It did not confirm the assumption of personal liability on the part of Boyd for the benefit of the sub-contractors.</p>

A formal assignment was executed January 10, 1950 and was accepted On the same date by Judge Kraft as decedent’s attorney. However, appellant Parker argues that the assignment became effective on July 28, 1948, by virtue of a letter from Jobson to Parker, approved by decedent, setting ■ forth substantially the same guarantee and conditions for payment as contained in the letters of June 23 and July 15 in the Guerrina claim. The letter provided that payment would be made directly to Parker by voucher issued by Jobson on Albright’s authorization against the amount that would be due Al-bright upon completion of the contract.

Since there is no question of Albright’s execution of a valid partial assignment to Parker long prior to the four month period preceding the bankruptcy of Albright, there is no reason to award the sum due Parker to the trustee in bankruptcy. Al-bright, by his assignment to Parker, divested himself of that portion of the final amount that would be due him under the contract and, in the absence of a voidable preference, the trustee in bankruptcy cannot bé placed in any more favorable position than the bankrupt, Albright, would have been. <em>Wood v.

William Kraft (counsel for Boyd) j who testified seven years after the alleged oral agreement (between Boyd and Albright who was the payee in the judgment note) which greatly varied the judgment note, that Albright admitted to him and his client, in a heated conversation ten months after the alleged oral agreement, that he had made an oral agreement prior to the execution of the judgment note and that he did not intend to keep it. This is a strange admission for a man to make to his adversary and his adversary’s attorney. The Chancellor believed Judge Kraft<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">*</a> and found that the parties had made the exact agreement which Judge Kraft testified Albright orally admitted. However, plaintiff’s other witness, Guerrina, testified to a different oral agreement; the testimony of the architect Jobson, who incidentally wrote a confirming letter one day after the alleged oral agreement, as to his understanding was entirely different; and Albright was not called upon to testify in behalf of the plaintiff when it. was his burden to prove by evidence which was clear, precise and convincing a specific oral agreement — if any existed and was admissible — which varied the written agreement. Such testimony, under all the facts and circumstances of this case, certainly does not rise to the test of “clear, precise and convincing” evidence which is necessary — if admissible at all — to justify the material alteration of the subsequent written agreement.
