Appellees’ basic contention, upheld by the court below, .is that the initial written agreement between the <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>corporation and Joseph Marzullo is in contravention of the provision in the Business Corporation Law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that: “A. Shares of a business corporation shall not be issued except for money, labor done, or money or property actually received . . With this contention, we do not agree. In <em>Shannon, Receiver, etc. v.

If the corporation here had paid defendant $1,000 in cash to leave his former situation and undertake its presidency, on condition that he invest the money in its stock, there could be no question of the validity of the transaction, yet it would in substance have been exactly the same . . . The proviso [under the Act of 1874, April 29, P. L. 81, Sec. 17] that no stock shall be issued ‘except for money, labor done, or money or property actually received’ does not prevent payment for labor or services bona fide to be thereafter rendered, any more than it prevents contracts to pay in advance for property to be furnished. A corporation in process of formation and not yet in actual operation may have no other mode of getting the necessary equipment to commence business.” . In the instant case, it is undisputed that there was a written agreement, ratified and approved by all the stockholders, providing for the issuance of stock upon the fulfillment of certain stipulated and expressed conditions in partial exchange for <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>Marzullo’s organization and operation of this small loan business in which he had had such previous experience as would admittedly be beneficial to both the corporation and its stockholders. We find nothing in this provision of the written agreement that offends either the Constitution of Pennsylvania, supra, or the Business Corporation Law, supra. As the court stated in <em>Grafton v. </em>Masteller, <a href="/f2d/232/0773-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="232 F.2d 773" data-case-ids="87620" data-case-paths="/f2d/232/0773-01">232 F. 2d 773</a>, 776: “Moreover, it is noteworthy that this case involves no flouting of the basic policy underlying Pennsylvania’s stricture against issuance of stock without prepayment. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has stated that policy in these terms: ‘. . . The primary object of the constitutional provision was to prevent the jeopardizing of the corporate property and to stop frauds upon stockholders and innocent purchasers, by the issuance of securities not fairly representing money or property received by the corporation and consistent with this purpose, all that is required is that transactions involving the disposition of corporate securities must be bona fide, and not a mere device to evade the law and impose a greater obligation upon the corporation than there is any occasion for it to assume, in order to obtain the consideration received therefor.’ Houghten v.

      <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>Appellees’ next position is that even if the original written agreement is valid, its modification by the board of directors on May 2, 1951 is not enforceable. This modification provided that ten shares of stock would be immediately issued to Marzullo, but that “such shares [would draw] dividend only after $30,-000.00 in profit has been earned as per the contract agreement. . .” Appellees’ argument is two edged: first, that such a modification is <em>per se </em>illegal and invalid, and, second, that even if it be not illegal <em>per se, </em>the minutes of the directors’ meeting at which the motion was purportedly adopted prove conclusively that it lacked the required number of votes for passage. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the motion was properly adopted, we find no merit in appellees’ first contention that the modification was illegal. The motion was adopted by a majority of those delegated by the stockholders to transact the corporation’s business. The financial interests of the original stockholders, as stipulated in the initial written agreement, unanimously approved and ratified by these same stockholders, were adequately protected. It is undisputed that appellant Marzullo performed valuable services on behalf of the corporation and these same stockholders for upwards of a year prior to the issuance of the stock. Furthermore there was no formal objection to the directors’ action until ■almost a year after the transaction had transpired.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>

In a <em>per curiam </em>affirmance of the court below, we stated (p. 45) : “. . . the stock issued to the plaintiff was for services rendered the corporation, the value of which was determined by the directors of the company. The compensation allowed for the services ... is not a matter for our consideration. It is impossible to derive any fraudulent intent on the part of the directors in connection therewith.” In our opinion the resolution providing for the immediate issuance of the stock to Joseph Marzullo and the waiver of the stipulated earnings provision in consideration for his services constituted a valid modi: fieation of the original written agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>Nor is appellees’ contention that the motion was not validly adopted any more efficacious. At the time of the purported adoption of the modification, there were seven directors, exclusive of Joseph Marzullo. The minutes of the meeting state: “Present at the meeting were: Joseph Brinko, J. S. Marzullo, Jacob Ross, S. John Marzullo.” The minutes were signed by Mary D. Ross, the Secretary of the Corporation, who was also a director. Appellees argue that since only three of the directors were recorded as being present, a majority, as set forth in the by-laws as constituting a quorum to transact business, was lacking, and the motion could not have been validly carried. However, appellant Joseph Marzullo (recorded in the minutes as J. S. Marzullo ) when called by appellees as on cross-examination testified on direct examination by appellees’ counsel that five directors<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> attended the meeting, thus contradicting the corporate minutes. This was further amplified when on cross-examination by his own counsel he stated that Mary D. Ross was the director who was present at the meeting but whose presence was not recorded in the minutes.

We know of no rule of law, however, that sanctions the rejection of this authority by the directors, once it has been validly conferred. In addition, the circumstances under which the motion was adopted militates against a conclusion that the directors intended to forestall the issuance of corporate stock indefinitely. Appellees’ own witnesses testified that the purpose of the motion was to maintain the <em>status quo </em>of corporate affairs in contemplation of an immediate sale to another corporation. The evidence also demonstrates that the prospects for such a sale failed shortly thereafter. ’ The reason for the motion having been terminated, it seems reasonable to assume that the motion itself, even if valid, should have lost its efficacy by February 12, 1953, when the first disputed stock was issued, some nine months after the meeting at which the motion was purportedly adopted. In view of the conclusion that we have reached that the corporate stock involved in the present appeal was properly issued, we need not consider the additional arguments advanced by appellants.</p>

      <p id="b594-5" data-blocks='[["BL_594.6",594,[245,1313,1149,1016]]]'> The court below found that “The issuance of stock to the Manager as set forth in Paragraph 7 of these findings was supposedly authorized at a Board of Directors meeting at which, according to the minutes, <em>only four Directors tvere present one of whom was Joseph S. Marzullo, </em>to whom said stock was issued . . .” (Emphasis supplied) However, the court <em>en bane </em>in its opinion stated “. . . we are of the opinion that Joseph S. Marzullo, <em>was never elected as a director of this corporation, that he voted illegally as a dwector and as a shareholder . </em>. .” (Emphasis supplied) Although we do not necessarily agree with this conclusion, we need not consider its validity in order to dispose of the present appeal. Appellees admit in their brief that: “At . . . [the] time, [of the directors’ meeting at which the issuance of. the stock was authorized] , exclusive of the manager who could sit at director’s meetings, there were seven directors of the company.” It would therefore follow that four directors would constitute a majority, three of whom were recorded as being present at the meeting. If Joseph Marzullo is considered as a director, the number of directors would be increased to eight, with five constituting a majority. It is therefore obvious that the significant and determinative question is whether or. not Mary D. Ross was present at the meeting and that issue was not discussed by the court below.</p>
