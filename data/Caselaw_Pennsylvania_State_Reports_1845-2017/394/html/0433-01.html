Edward Sigal, a brother-juror to the plaintiff, testified that on the morning of the accident, January 7, 1953, at 9:45 o’clock, he saw that the wall light between the sixth and fifth floors was unlighted. Since the accident happened at 11:30, this means that for an hour and 45 minutes the City allowed a danger<a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>ous condition to exist on the stairs, for, even without •any liquid on the stairs, one could still sustain a bad fall as the result of lack of illumination in the stairway.</p>
    <p id="b484-4" data-blocks='[["BL_484.5",484,[256,591,1149,918]]]'>Of course, it could be argued that the absence of the electric light at the point of the accident did not create sufficient darkness or gloom to endanger the safety of persons using the stairway. But that was a question for the jury. It certainly cannot be- said that the absence of negligence was so marked that no reasonable person could reasonably assert that the physical condition of the premises could cause harm to pedestrians. We have said as many times as there are steps in all the buildings in which courts sit to do justice that a nonsuit or a judgment n.o.v. may be entered only when it is inconceivable, on any reasonable hypothesis, that a mind desiring solely to reach a just and proper conclusion after viewing the evidence in the light most advantageous to the plaintiff, could determine the issue involved in his favor. What has happened to that rule in this case?</p>
    <p id="b484-5" data-blocks='[["BL_484.6",484,[253,1535,1157,650]]]'>The Majority Opinion, interpreting the defendant’s contention, says that “the absence of light was not the proximate cause, but that even if it were, plaintiff failed to prove constructive notice in view of the size of the building and the short period of time the light was out.” Size of' building certainly has no bearing on the criterion of responsibility for safety. If the owner of a large building is to be excused from keeping it safe because he would need many employees to maintain adequate vigilance, then the owners of a railroad could be excused from maintaining watchmen at the crossings because there were oh so many crossings.</p>

Apropos the cases I will cite on this subject, I would like to quote from Patrick Henry who said: “I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past.” In the law, Courts are supposed to be guided by the past. Lifting, therefore, the lamp of experience over the precedents of this Court, let us see whether an hour and three-quarters’ time is considered too short a period in which to hold that a property-owner must be aware of a peril existing on his property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">*</a>
