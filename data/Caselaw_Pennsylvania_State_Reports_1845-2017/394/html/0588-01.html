Mrs. Bossman’s arms and legs were bound with 2 inch adhesive tape and stockings and her mouth gagged; her death was due to strangulation at the hands of some person or persons and the time of death fixed at approximately 6-7 p.m. Sunday, July 3, 1955. There was evidence of attempted robbery; open handbags were present in the room, a bureau drawer was; open and clothes were laying on a chair beside the body. From that incident stemmed the events which eventually led to the conviction of Baymond P. Wilson, appellant, of murder in the first degree with the penalty affixed at life imprisonment, the conviction which forms the basis of this appeal.</p>

Subsequent to her husband’s death, Mrs. Rossman lived in Overbrook and later at the Adelphia Hotel. An eccentric and somewhat unusual person, usually she had with her, either on her person or in her room, large quantities of money, particularly in new $100 bills.</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[160,697,1150,1536]]]'>In April 1954, while in Florida, Mrs. Rossman met a Reverend Ridgeway and his mother, the former being engaged in evangelistic work on the Island of Jamaica, and Mrs. Rossman became interested in Rev. Ridge-way’s work. She purchased for him a pick-up truck costing $1565, a travelling van costing $4400, a house trailer costing $5700, and contributed $4359 toward his church in Jamaica. Sometime later Mrs. Rossman grew suspicious of Rev. Ridgeway and asserted to various persons that he had taken from her approximately $20,000. Through a Mrs. Coleman, a nurse in the jail at Dade County, Florida, Mrs. Rossman became acquainted with one Paul Huizenga, a Dade County deputy sheriff, in November 1954, and requested his official aid in an investigation of Rev. Ridgeway. Huizenga and one R. W. Thomas, another deputy sheriff, investigated Mrs. Rossman’s claims and, after interrogating Rev. Ridgeway, became convinced that the matter involved no breach of the law. In January or February, 1955, Mrs. Rossman engaged Huizenga in a private capacity to keep Rev. Ridgeway under surveillance and in March or April, 1955 Huizenga turned the matter over to his fellow deputy Thomas. From that time on various telephone calls were made by Mrs. Ross-man, particularly from Philadelphia, to Thomas or Huizenga in Miami and several days before her death she sent a $250 money order to Thomas for the services of both Thomas and Huizenga.</p>

Motivated by a desire to obtain this money, Thomas entered into a conspiracy with one Gus DeMoss, a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, one Frank Ellsworth and the appellant Wilson to rob Mrs. Eossman. In 1948, Thomas, then a Tulsa police officer, with DeMoss had arrested and testified against both Ellsworth and Wilson when they were charged with and convicted of 2nd degree burglary. In pursuance of the conspiracy, the Commonwealth contends, Ellsworth and Wilson went to Philadelphia and in the early evening of July 3, 1955 caused Mrs. Rossman’s death by strangulation and took from her room a considerable amount of money.</p>

Box B-1494 was closed by Mrs. Bossman two months prior to her death; on April 12, 1955 she had taken a safe deposit box in the Fidelity-Philadel<a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>phia Trust Company which she had access to 15 times within less than three months prior to her death.

What the Commonwealth does contend is that it is very significant that so many bills of the same serial sequence were found on Wilson, Ellsworth, in the Dunes Hotel room, in the safe deposit box and in the purse of the victim, and further, that the lowest serial number of any of the “C00323” series was “C00323531A” and the highest number of the same series was “C00323800A” found on any person or in any place relevant to this case, the difference between the highest and lowest serial numbers being 270 $100 bills or the exact amount withdrawn by the victim’s husband on July 21, 1953.</p>

Wilson also discussed his various connections with police officials. According to Nixon, Wilson then tried to arrange for him, Nixon, to raise bail of $2500 so that he, Nixon, could go to Tampa and arrange for a man named Westmoreland and two girls to come to the extradition hearing and testify that Wilson was in Tampa on a certain night in July, 1955, the date of which Nixon was uncertain.
