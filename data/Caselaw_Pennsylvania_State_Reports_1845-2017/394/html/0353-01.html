Assessed damages were $11,400.24, total debt $14,688.95. The appellant bought the properties in tor $11,800, and now avers in its petition that the fair market value was $8,000..</p>
    <p id="b387-5" data-blocks='[["BL_387.8",387,[156,949,1156,527]]]'>The court below fixed the value at $11,800 and the judgment creditor has appealed. Its position is that under Section 6 of the Act “the court shall determine and fix as the fair market value of the property the amount thereof alleged in the petition . . .” when there is an answer denying such value but no evidence to support the denial. Appellant contends that there was no competent countervening evidence and that the averment in the petition, $8000, is the fair market value.</p>
    <p id="b387-6" data-blocks='[["BL_387.9",387,[158,1506,1141,97]]]'>The only question is whether or not there is propev evidence to support the court’s figure.</p>

    <p id="b387-8" data-blocks='[["BL_387.11",387,[155,1741,1148,538]]]'>Appellees offered evidence of a different kind. The&gt; showed that at the execution sale an independent bid was made of $11,000. After bidding in the property for $11,800, appellant then sold it for $11,000. In 1957 the property was assessed for $20,300. Miller, one of the appellees, paid $21,000 for it less than a year before the sheriff’s sale, and he valued it as of the date of the sheriff’s sale at $20,000. Evidence of the deterioration of the neighborhood and of the vandalizing of the property was before the court.</p>
