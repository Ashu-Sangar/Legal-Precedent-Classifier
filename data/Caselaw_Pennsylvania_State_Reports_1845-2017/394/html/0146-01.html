      <em>son </em>decision was an .unfortunate one which created anomalous situations in the law. As .an aftermath of that case, counsel cogently observes that every aetion except for personal injuries survives the period of a minor’s disability. “If a minor’s property, is damaged, his minority tolls the Statute.' If he is falsely im-; prisoned, his minority tolls the Statute, but if his head is broken and his legs are cut off, someone must ... . [bring suit] for him within two years or his rights are lost.” Counsel therefore asks us to. limit the <em>Peterson, </em>case to its own facts and not to carry forward the result reached therein to a cáse involving another class of disabilities — insanity.- “It is absurd that-an insane person’s property , . .

Thus, permitting the deferment of the institution of a personal injury claim until the end of a prospective plaintiff’s period, of disability seriously prejudices the person against whom suit is eventually brought.

On December 21, 1956, he brought suit in trespass against the Mummerts for the injuries sustained on June 29, 1953. The defendants answered and averred that the plaintiff’s cause of action was barred by the Act of 1895 (P.

Of course, there are situations where the law is powerless to remedy a recognized wrong, but this is not this case. As far back as 1713 the Legislature of Pennsylvania provided that where a person of unsound mind is injured, “he shall be at liberty” to bring an action in trespass against the alleged wrongdoer when he shall have recovered his sanity.

Nor would it be in keeping with an enlightened humanity to so legislate.
