Cullen, and Andrew- S. Moscrip, respectively • the Democratic and Republican nominees for the office of Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the 42nd Judicial District (Bradford County) - at the 1957 Municipal Election, there was only the adjudication of- the hearing judge; Honorable Charles G. Webb, of the 4th Judicial District; spe<a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>cially presiding, in a timely instituted recount proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b290-4" data-blocks='[["BL_290.5",290,[234,477,1147,705]]]'>According to the adjudication, Moscrip was credited with having received 7,471 votes and Cullen 7,469 for a difference of two votes in Moscrip’s favor. Both contestants filed exceptions to the court’s rulings for a combined total of forty-four. After argument, the hearing judge sustained five of Cullen’s exceptions and seven of Moscrip’s for a net gain for Moscrip of two votes. The return, as thus established by the corrected adjudication of the hearing judge, showed Moscrip to have received 7,470 votes and Cullen 7,466 for a plurality of four votes for Moscrip. The matter then came on for our review on the above mentioned cross appeals of Cullen and Moscrip (see <a href="/pa/392/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="392 Pa. 602" data-case-ids="8845709" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0602-01">392 Pa. 602</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20389" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="141 A.2d 389">141 A. 2d 389</a>).</p>

Michael J. Eagen of the 45th Judicial District and Hon. Abraham H. Lipez of the 25th Judicial District.</p>

The record, as augmented by the three separate opinions of the judges composing the court <em>en banc </em>and the above mentioned final order, was returned to this court in accordance with our order of remand; reargument of the several appeals by counsel for the respective contestants on the <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>basis of the augmented record has since been <em>had; </em>and we now have the matter for disposition.</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[194,480,1150,533]]]'>The wisdom of our action in remanding the record for review by a court <em>en bane </em>is confirmed by the fact that, of all the contested rulings on ballot markings made by the hearing judge, only five remain concerning which the members of the court <em>en bane </em>have differed. Accordingly, we have accepted such of the rulings of the hearing judge as the court <em>en banc </em>has unanimously confirmed, and have confined our examination to the five ballots with respect to which the members of the court <em>en banc </em>were divided.</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.6",291,[186,1034,1156,1314]],["BL_292.1",292,[264,372,1146,431]]]'>The end result of the division discloses the following situation: Judge Webb found the vote to be 7,470 for Moscrip and 7,468 for Cullen, for a plurality of two for Moscrip; Judge Lipez found it to be 7,469 for Moscrip and 7,468 for Cullen, for a plurality of one for Moscrip; and Judge Eagen found it to be 7,470 for Cullen and 7,467 for Moscrip, 'for a plurality of three for Cullen. The difference of two votes in Moscrip’s plurality as.shown by Judge Webb’s original adjudication, as hearing judge, and his later tabulation, as a member of the court <em>en banc, </em>is due to the fact that he reversed himself with respect to three ballot markings for Cullen and one for Moscrip all of which he had formerly held to be invalid. Judge Webb thus increased Cullen’s total by three votes and Moscrip’s by one vote for a net gain of two for Cullen. We mention this merely in explanation of the two-vote reduction in Moscrip’s plurality according to Judge Webb’s final count and not as any impeachment of his ultimate conclusion. It is hardly necessary to add that the judges who took part in the disposition of this matter in the court below performed the duties of their assignment with painstaking care and notable fairness, and we are grateful for their proficient and helpful services. The <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>final minimal differences between': the members of the court <em>en banc </em>represent understandable varying-points of view with respect to the legal effect of certain markings 'on the five ; disputed ballots. Such differences servé, moreover, to accentuate the difficulty; if not impossibility, of determining with anything approaching reasonable certitude that one contestant rather than the other is the successful candidate.

That is' true, but the extension was relatively so slight as not to deprive the marking of its unmistakable identity as' a six. As Judge Lipez further noted, the Same ballot’s markings for candidates for three other offices “are almost perfect sixes*’ and that “.- it is quite evident that the voter failed to lift his pencil after making the first line, and by keeping the péncil on the paper, the márk<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>ing was given continuity”, which, of course, is not the way a cross (X) is made.</p>
    <p id="b293-4" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[192,481,1152,1198]]]'>With respect to this ballot, Judge Eagen noted,— “In the office voting blocks, there are marks which constitute a perfect 6” and, then correctly added, “This ballot is not marked, with an X or anything akin thereto. By no stretch of the imagination .can it be construed to be an X or a valid cross mark.” He consequently voted to sustain the exception to the allowance of the figure as a vote for Moscrip. He held that the ballot was void by virtue of the express provision of Section 1223(a) of the Pennsylvania Election Code of June 3,1937, P. L. 1333 (25 PS §3063), that “(a) No ballot which is so marked as to be capable, of identification shall be counted. . . . Any ballot marked by any other mark than an (X) in the spaces provided for that purpose shall be void and not counted: Provided, however, That no vote recorded thereon shall be declared void because a cross (X) mark thereon is irregular in form.” The sixes on the ballot in question cannot reasonably be said to qualify as irregular (X) marks. Furthermore, their peculiarly descriptive nature made the ballot readily identifiable. The mark should not, therefore, have been counted as a valid vote.</p>
