If she did then, barring a contrary intent ap<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>pearing in her will, the residuary clause of her will will be considered to be an execution of such a power. This brings us to a consideration of the effect of the release executed by Evetta. The court below in the instant case, and Judge Bolger of the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia in his adjudication in <em>Handy Trust, </em>6 Fiduc. Rep. 385 (1956), have held that, even in face of such a release, the donee of the power (Evetta in the instant case) had at her death the power to appoint in any manner she thought proper. The lower court reasoned that the limitation which resulted from the release could in no way affect or change the inherent quality of the power to make the general power of appointment a special or limited power of appointment requiring its exercise in a special or limited manner. We disagree with this conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[250,1266,1150,1090]],["BL_431.1",431,[173,371,1146,212]]]'>The legislature has specifically given the donee of a power of appointment the privilege of releasing that power in such a manner as to reduce or limit the persons or objects or classes of persons or objects in whose favor such power should otherwise be exercisable. Evetta exercised that privilege in a manner consistent with statutory authority. By doing so she effectively reduced and limited the persons or objects or classes of persons or objects in whose favor the power of appointment given to her would otherwise be exercisable. To say that after such an effective reduction or limitation she, nevertheless, retained the power to appoint in any manner she thought proper is to nullify and negate the legislative enactment. By the execution and delivery of the release she changed the general power to a limited or special power, and the Act of 1947 which permits the execution of a general power by a general residuary clause does not apply to a special or limited power.

Garwood, </em>3 Wh.

The instant case presents no factors other than the residuary clause indicating an intent on the part of the donee to exercise her power of appointment.
