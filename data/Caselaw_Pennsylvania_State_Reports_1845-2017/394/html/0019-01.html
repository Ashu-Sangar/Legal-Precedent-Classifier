Counsel for the present accused so conceded at bar and the Attorney General, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>so argued both orally and by brief. However, a trial court having jurisdiction of an alleged offender possesses discretionary power to permit a defendant, in appropriate circumstances, to examine and inspect in advance of trial physical or documentary evidence in the hands of the prosecution. And, this court’s current action so confirms. Also, see our opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Hoban et al., </em>54 Lackawanna Jurist 213, 218 (not reported in the official State Reports).</p>

In that case, the Supreme Court of New Jersey quoted with approval from the thorough and well-considered opinion of Chief Judge Marbury of the Court of Appeals of Maryland in <em>State v.

But law is a growth and a great many matters, common - place to us now, were not thought of many years ago. . . [T]he tendency in the courts of this country is to permit discretion in the trial judge. The argument made against any such discretion is based upon a fear that the State, which is charged with the prosecution of crime, may be hampered in its duty by the disclosure of its evidence to those charged with offenses. What <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>ever merit that argument has as applied to a situation where it is contended that the accused has a <em>right </em>to inspect the evidence, it has no application, we think, to a situation where the trial judge in each case and on each application, determines what should be done in the interest oJ! justice. There are cases in which it would be clearly unjust to deny such an application and, on the other hand, cases are conceivable in which it might improperly hamper the prosecution to grant such an application. We do not understand that the court below decided that the appellees were entitled to this disclosure as a matter of right.”</p>
    <p id="b55-4" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[184,1031,1150,1309]],["BL_56.1",56,[241,370,1145,310]]]'>Likewise in the instant case, the trial court did not hold that the petitioning defendant was entitled <em>as a matter of right </em>to the disclosure ordered. And, this court in its <em>pro tanto </em>approval of the order entered by the court below is not laying down a new rule. Chief Justice Stern's quotation in <em>Commonwealth v. Wable, </em><a href="/pa/382/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="382 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1259978" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0080-01">382 Pa. 80</a>, 86, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20A.2d%20334" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="114 A.2d 334">114 A. 2d 334</a>, from Wharton’s Criminal Evidence that “ ‘The general rule is that the accused has no right to the inspection or disclosure before trial of evidence in the possession of the prosecution’ ” continues to be the rule in Pennsylvania. The matter of permitting a defendant to examine and inspect evidence in the keeping of the Commonwealth depends upon an exercise of judicial discretion in any instance and our trial courts can be trusted to exercise it wisely. The justification for the discretion so reposed lies, in part, in the concept expressed by Judge Hob an in <em>Commonwealth v. Stepper, </em>54 Lackawanna Jurist 205, 212-213,—“We would rather remove any obstacle to a fair trial, before the trial, rather than have it removed later and double the expense of difficult and protracted proceedings to the Commonwealth.” Like the court in <em>State v. Haas, </em>supra, “We are not impressed by the fear of the prosecuting attor<a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>neys that the exercise of such discretion will change the whole practice of criminal law in this State, or will make the securing of proper convictions more difficult to obtain. It has not apparently had that effect elsewhere and we see no reason why it should have it here.”</p>
    <p id="b56-4" data-blocks='[["BL_56.5",56,[235,700,1149,1089]]]'>The only question before us, then, just as in the <em>Roban </em>case, is whether the court below properly exercised its discretion. The court <em>en bano, </em>composed of the four judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, after reciting that it had reviewed all the evidence at its command, unanimously concluded that “. . . the Commonwealth has impeded and hampered defense counsel’s investigation and preparation for trial by unrestrained and arbitrary power without fair co-operation and is therefore depriving the accused of that due process of law commanded by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.” Neither the record, the printed briefs, m&gt;r the oral argument has presented anything that would justify us in holding that the foregoing considered conclusion of the court below was false. Consequently, it necessarily follows that the court below, acting for the purpose of vitiating the indicated harm, exercised a sound discretion by the entry of its order as restricted by the limitation now put upon it by this court.</p>

However, where an exhibit is one of which the accused is entirely cognizant and <em>already knows </em>whether it could or could not be an item of incrimination against him, he is not entitled to its inspection if such inspection would hamper the Commonwealth in proceeding with its case.</p>
    <p id="b57-4" data-blocks='[["BL_57.5",57,[167,867,1148,652]]]'>The Commonwealth here has in its possession a 32 calibre revolver which, it avers, was the weapon used in the killing of Max Kravitz.

Such a fettering is not to adjust the scales of justice but to destroy them.</p>

    <p id="b59-5" data-blocks='[["BL_59.5",59,[150,766,1148,1086]]]'>This paints a picture too dusky, dismal, and dreary for my eyes. It carries a pigmentation of too much alarm and foreboding, not justified by the decision of the Court. It is true that persons accused of crime have the possibility of fabricating evidence, as Justice <em>Bell </em>points out, but this, unfortunately, is always within the realm of possibility, regardless of what a district attorney may or may not do, with or without specific authorization by a court. In painting his picture, I fear that my brother employs a brush too heavy for the objects he intends to depict. As a consequence, in his descriptive picture, the accused person before trial and the accused person after conviction merge into one amorphous concept. But an indicted person does not become a criminal until and unless the jury finds him guilty. Thus, to say that the action of this Court today will make “the conviction of dangerous criminals far more difficult than ever before” is to place effect before cause and sequence in front of prelude.</p>

This disastrous precedent-shattering decision breaches one of the few barriers which are left to protect peaceable communities and law-abiding ■ citizens from murderers and dangerous Criminals. - -While the order directs the Commonwealth merely to turn over to defendant for examination before' trial nearly all’ of its physical evidence, I believe that <em>the effect </em>of the-order will be to compel the Commonwealth in the near future to turn over or disclose to a defendant in advance of trial <em>all </em>its evidence.

It is difficult to imagine a more untenable argument or a more far-fetched analogy. A criminal trial is as different from a civil trial as day is from night. In civil trials there is pre-trial discovery and a <em>mutual </em>exchange of evidence. In a criminal trial the defendant does not have to inform the Commonwealth before or during trial or at any time his defense or any of his evidence; he does not have to take the witness stand and no unfavorable inference can be drawn therefrom; he can be convicted only if the Commonwealth proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, which is defined to be a doubt which would restrain a reasonable man from acting in a matter of importance to himself; he is presumed to be innocent no matter how many terrible crimes he may have committed; if he has never been convicted of crime he can place in evidence his good reputation and that alone can be sufficient to justify his acquittal; and finally, he cannot be convicted unless all twelve of the jurors unanimously find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
