On July 24, 1957, she was notified, through appropriate agencies of the City of Philadelphia that, according to provisions of the City’s Health Code (Sections 6-402(3) and 6-503), she was required to obtain a city license and introduce certain features into her shop so that it would meet standards of safety and sanitation set up by the City.</p>
    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[274,818,1146,919]]]'>She refused to apply for the city license and declined to carry out the recommendations of the Department, asserting that she was amenable only to the provisions of the Beauty Culture Act of May 3, 1933, P. L. 242, 63 PS §507, under whose aegis she was operating, by virtue of the State license already issued to her. Accordingly she appealed to the Board of License and Inspection Review, claiming that “Sections 6-402, paragraphs 3a to 3h inclusive and section 6-503 of the Code of General Ordinances of the City of Philadelphia and Regulations promulgated thereunder for governing of Beauty Shops and Schools of Beauty Culture are invalid, illegal, and unconstitutional and therefore unenforceable.” The Board rejected her contentions and she appealed to the Court of Common Pleas No. 7 of Philadelphia County which reversed the adjudication of the Board.</p>

Of course, it is obvious that where a statute specifically declares it has planted the flag of preemption in a field, all ordinances on the subject die away as if they did not exist. It is also apparent that, even if the statute is silent on supersession, but proclaims a course of regulation and control which brooks no municipal inter<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>vention, all ordinances touching the topic of exclusive control fade away into the limbo of “innocuous desuetude.” However, where the Act is silent as to monopolistic domination and a municipal ordinance provides for a localized procedure which furthers the salutary scope of the Act, the ordinance is welcomed as an ally, bringing reinforcements into the field of attainment of the statute’s objectives.</p>

Thus, in the silence of the Beauty Culture Act as to municipal supplementation, the court sees prohibition of municipal regulation. It says: “We can perceive this intent in the very silence of the Assembly on this question. There is nothing in the Act which we can point to as indicating what the Assembly intended as to local action. This silence is important. In a similar, companion statute regulating Barber Shops, the Assembly said: ‘Nothing contained in this Act . . . shall be construed as prohibiting any municipality from adopting appropriate ordinances not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act . . .’: Act of June 19, 1931, P. L. 589; 63 P.S. 566. Certainly, if the Assembly in drafting the ‘Barber’ Act spoke out clearly that it welcomed concurrent local action, its very silence in the ‘Beauty Culture’ Act evidences the Assembly’s intention to prevent such action.” But the Barber Act of 1931 did not, as the lower court mistakenly maintains, state that municipal supplementation was not prohibited. It was an <em>amendment </em>to that Act (passed in 1935) which added this explanatory provision. And the reason for the explanation was that a court of common pleas in Delaware County had ruled that an ordinance of the City of Chester which required <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>city registration of barbers was ineffective due to tbe state-wide regulation provided by the Barber Law of 1931. <em>(Chester v. Chouch, </em>19 D. &amp; C. 457) To disavow the assumption of State monopoly of barber shop regulation, the Legislature passed the law of May 9, 1935, which specifically announced: “Nothing contained in this act, or <em>the act to which this is an amendment, </em>shall be construed as prohibiting any municipality from adopting appropriate ordinances, not inconsistent with the provisions of this act or the rules and regulations adopted thereunder, as may be deemed necessary to promote the public health and safety and regulate the conduct of barber shops and schools . . .” ( Act of May 9, 1935, P. L. 158, §2) (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[257,1155,1146,252]]]'>Thus, the Act of 1935 was but a reiteration of the legislative intent pronounced in 1931, namely, that by silence the intention was made clear that local regulation was not only not prohibited but, where necessary, invited.</p>
    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.6",502,[256,1428,1146,653]]]'>The Beauty Culture Act, by a similar silence, mutely spoke the same invitation. The Barber License Law and the Beauty Culture Law are in effect legislative Siamese twins.- It is true they were born two years apart, but in the life of a commonwealth, and certainly in the life of the general welfare of a people, two. years may be but a moment. The kinship between these two creatures of the Legislature was recognized in the Beauty Culture Act by the language: “Nothing in this [Beauty Culture] act is intended to be inconsistent with the [Barber] act . . .” (Act of May 3, 1933, P. L. 242, §17, 63 P.S. §523.)</p>

    <p id="b503-3" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[159,864,1154,931]]]'>The Barber License Law and the Beauty Control Act have but one purpose, and that is the protection of patrons of barber and beauty shops. Prior to the enactment of the Barber License Law, any man could go into business as a barber, even if his lack of training for the vocation was exceeded only by his lack of knowledge and respect for hygiene. There was no way. to prevent an epileptic barber from, wielding a rusty razor over the throat of his helpless customer. What the Legislature placed in the Barber License Act in L931 was not the maximum of regulation which would save prisoners of the barber chair from maladroit and mangy hands, but a level of regulation and control, below which no municipality would be permitted to go. Whatever additional protection cities, boroughs and townships wished to provide for barber shop patrons would be a boon and not a detriment to public welfare.</p>
    <p id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[157,1808,1149,542]],["BL_504.1",504,[243,366,1147,652]]]'>The Legislature could not be expected to itemize the last towel and drop of antiseptic which, for sanitation and cleanliness, would be required in every barber and beauty shop in the State. The size of the municipality, congestion of population, geography of locale, weather and climate prevailing in the area could have a very decided bearing on the extent of the meticulousness of the sanitary supervision required in any particular group of shops. It would not be unnatural to assume that regulations could be stricter and more rigid in <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>large cities where the turnover in clientele would be comparatively rapid as against a village or small rural center where the customers are known by their first name, occupation and frequency of visit. “. . . the preservation of the health, safety, welfare, and comfort of dwellers in urban centers of population requires the enforcement of very different, and usually much more stringent, police regulations . . . than are necessary in a state taken as a whole. Different police regulations may also be required in different municipalities, depending on the density of the population.” (37 Am. Jur., Municipal Corporations, §276 at 898-899)</p>

Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/366/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="366 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="8845589" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0374-01">366 Pa. 374</a>. In 1945 the Pennsylvania Legislature passed a law (May 23, 1945, P. L. 926) “For the protection of the public health by regulating the conduct and operation of public eating and drinking places within this Commonwealth; requiring their licensing; imposing certain duties on the Department of Health of this Commonwealth and on the local health authorities; and providing penalties.” On September 8, 1948, the City of Pittsburgh enacted an ordinance which covered substantially the same ground and aimed at the same objectives as the statute. The Western Pennsylvania Restaurant Association brought á bill of complaint to have the city’s ordinance declared illegal and void on the ground that the State had preempted the field and that some of the provisions of the ordinance were inconsistent with those of the statute. <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>Our Court upheld the legality of the ordinance. In a very able and exceedingly well reasoned opinion, Justice Stern (later Chief Justice) said that the statute did not preempt the field of legislation regarding the regulation of public eating and drinking places. Further, the statute provided that licenses were not to be issued until inspection of the premises established that the facilities and equipment were found to be “not merely in conformity with the requirements of the State statute — but 'adequate to the protection of the public health and comfort of patrons’ thus apparently allowing a wider range of discretion on the part of the local licensing body. Moreover it is obvious, even in the absence of express testimony to that effect, that the. sanitary standards and appropriate regulations in the case of restaurants in a large city such as Pittsburgh might well be, and no doubt are, quite different from those applicable to rural communities, in view, among other conditions of the usually larger numbers of patrons and the congestion of buildings with consequent special problems of their construction and ventilation.”</p>

Hand in hand with the development .of jet propulsion has come the realization that disease organisms may spread from mere skin contact and that a source of contagion may disable large groups of people without physical contact at all. Thus health regulations in large cities may need to change from season to season or even week to week, depending on local conditions and crises. When epidemics strike, there may not be time to summon legislatures to recruit armies of résistance. Thus, aside from the grant of power which may be implied from the provisions of the Beauty Culture Act, the City of Philadelphia, under the Home Rule Charter of 1951, is armed with police power to cope with problems of health. <em>(Warren v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/382/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="382 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="1259926" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0380-01">382 Pa. 380</a>, 384.)

It offers duplication, not fresh regulation.” Apparently the Court below did not compare the broom of the state statute with the broom of the city ordinance. Had it done so, it would have found not only that many of the straws of the statutory broom had been strengthened, but that new ones had been added, all to the end that cleanliness should be served, sanitation enhanced, and health more <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>certainly preserved. For instance, the state statute prohibits the use of any beauty shop for residential purposes; the municipal regulation goes further and requires a solid partition between the shop and any room used for human habitation. The statute says that floors shall be kept “in a clean and sanitary condition”; the ordinance says they shall be free of cracks and holes and so constructed as to admit of rapid cleansing. The State grounds an operator who is knowingly suffering from a contagious or infectious disease; the City takes time by the forelock and requires operators to submit to annual chest x-ray examinations, also to abstain from narcotics, and not to be under the influence of alcohol while administering treatments. The State says that tools shall be cleaned and sterilized, the City specifies the degree of heat and the content of chemical preparations to be used in the sterilizing process; etc., etc. Moreover, the City has added requirements not included in the State statute. Thus, beauty shops must have certain lighting; they must be unhospitable to insects and rodents by the erection of barriers to their visits; operators must not smoke while serving patrons; equipment must be fireproof and asphyxiation-proof because while the price of beauty is unquestionably high it should not be attained at risk to body and limb.</p>
