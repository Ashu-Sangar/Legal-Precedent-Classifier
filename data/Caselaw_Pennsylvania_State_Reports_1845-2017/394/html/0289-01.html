The jury’s verdict determined that the accident happened as a result of the wheel of the scaffold striking against the piece of wood concealed beneath the curing paper. The verdict further determined that the wood was negligently left on the floor when the employes of defendant applied the paper covering. This negligence occasioned the scaffold to fall resulting in plaintiff’s injuries.</p>
