On the night of September 21, 1954, at about 11 o’clock, Joseph Krusinski, then 19 years of age, with his brother Richard, 14, in the front , seat with him, was driving his Oldsmobile automobile westwardly on Irvine Street in Pittsburgh. As he arrived at a point opposite his home on the north side of Irvine Street, he proceeded to make an incomplete U turn which would allow him, facing toward the east, to park in front of his dwelling. He thus drove to. the left or south side of the highway and then cut back sharply, heading for the north curb of Irvine. While doing this he noted that he could not negotiate the complete turn, which would enable him to be facing the east, because of another car. already parked on the north side of Irvine. He stopped, right angularly, to the curb, to contemplate his next, maneuver, particularly , because, he now saw a car coming from the west, and he wished to avoid any movement which could bring him into the path of this eastbound car. While momentarily in this stationary position he saw the lights of another car, only a couple of blocks away, bearing down on him from the east. It was travelling at a speed, later estimated by others, to be from 70 to 75 miles an hour. This speeding car (a Mercury, owned by Joseph J. Chioda) crashed into Joseph’s car, demolishing its right center, and inflicting injuries on both Joseph and Richard.</p>

By the time of the trial, Joseph had attained his majority, so that in all further proceedings he acted in his own name and right. Joseph’s account of the accident was corroborated by the occupants of the car which, driven by Esther Chernotowich, was travelling eastwardly at the time of the collision; Miss Chernotowich and the four passengers all testified that Joseph’s car was at a standstill just before the impact, and Miss Chernotowich testified further that Chioda’s car was proceeding at a speed of from 70 to 75 miles an hour as it crashed into the stationary Oldsmobile. -</p>

His loss of wages and medical expenses amounted to $406.25 so that his out-of-pocket expenses totaled $1159.25.

The trial court ordered a new trial because of inadequacy of verdict. The defendant appealed. In holding that the court had not abused its discretion in making this order, we said: “A trial is a systematized, organized procedure for determining the truth and awarding justice with precision, to the extent that precision can be ascertained through fallible human agencies. A trial' is not to be a mere conscious <em>approximation of reality. </em>It is not the province of a jury to decide <em>generally </em>the issue presented to it for decision, in the spirit of boundless generosity or restrained benevolence. ,. If. Mrs. Todd, was entitled to a verdict from the defendant because of the injuries he inflicted upon hér. as the result of his negligence, she was entitled to <em>all </em>that the law pi*ovides in such a case. And the items, of pain, suffering and inconvenience, as well as loss of wages and impairment of. earning power, are inevitable concomitants with grave injuries when suffered by a wage-earner. A jury may not eliminate pain from wounds when all human experience proves the existence of pain, and it may not withhold lost wages when the evidence in the case uncontradictedly establishes the loss of wages as the result of the negligence which they, the jury, have adjudicated against the responsible defendant. When it is apparent that <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>a jury by its verdict holds the defendant responsible for a whole loaf of bread, it may not then neglectfully, indifferently, or capriciously cut off a portion of that loaf as it hands it to the plaintiff.”</p>
    <p id="b127-4" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[156,601,1154,1543]]]'>The jury in this case sliced away even a larger portion of the loaf it passed over to Richard than the truncated one it handed to Joseph. Richard was sitting on the right-hand side of Joseph’s car and thus received the full impact of the momentum of Chioda’s car which crashed into it at 75 miles an hour. He not only sustained multiple bruises on chest, arms and legs, but his foot was so pinned in the wreckage that for over an hour he could not be extricated, being finally released only when an acetylene torch burned away the imprisoning metal. In the meantime he was suffering the pain and agony of a fractured jaw. The gravity of the fracture is evident from the doctor’s testimony that 12 days were required to prepare the patient for the operation which resulted in the youth’s mouth being wired and clamped for 58 days during which time he could take only liquids. Even at the time of the trial (32 months after the accident) Richard was still suffering from the effects of the broken jaw. The doctor testified: “We felt that there should be some reconstructive work, some prosthetic work done with both the upper and lower jaws, because the teeth had been involved and moved to some degree, and, of course, we are trying all along, and our prime purpose is to re-establish two things, first, the aesthetics or appearance and, second, of course, the function of chewing. We are trying to establish those two things all the time.”</p>

Considering the intense pain and suffering to which he was subjected and will still have to undergo, and the fact that he will need to wear false teeth in the front of his mouth for the rest of his life, it is quite evident that the Court below was eminently justified in concluding that the verdict of $1500 awarded Richard was inadequate. Especially, in view of the fact that the defendant did not dispute the plaintiff’s medical evidence even though a doctor, on behalf of the defendant, examined Richard. This was also true with regard to Joseph.</p>

    <p id="b128-6" data-blocks='[["BL_128.7",128,[249,1816,1145,541]]]'>The Trial Judge said that the jury “could have become confused because of the dual defenses, diametrically opposed to each other, which were submitted to the jury.” And now we come to a rather unique feature of this. case.

      <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>In spite of this unanimous testimony as to how the crash occurred, Chioda called to the witness stand a Joseph S. Doyle who related a completely different story. He said that he was sitting in his 1953 Plymouth station wagon on Tullymet Street overlooking Irvine Street (about 5 or 6 blocks from 93 Irvine Street) when he saw Chioda’s and Joseph’s cars “fly by” on Irvine Street travelling westwardly at 75 miles an hour. They were only an arm’s length from each other and were engaged in a race, hurtling by neck to neck. He decided to follow them. By the time he got his ear turned on to Irvine Street he was a block behind the racing cars which were now tearing ahead at 90 miles an hour over the two car tracks in the middle of Irvine Street. A street car was following Doyle, as he began to close the gap between himself and the two death-defying vehicles, one of which was now emitting sparks. The two motor meteors streaked forward on Irvine Street, with Doyle in hot pursuit, for five or six blocks when the Mercury suddenly swerved at a 15-degree angle toward the south side of the street and the Oldsmobile swerved at a 60-degree angle toward the north side of the street — and they crashed.</p>
    <p id="b129-4" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[159,1655,1150,541]]]'>There was not the slightest intimation or inference in the testimony of any of the admitted eight eyewitnesses of the. unhappy Chioda-Joseph encounter which gave the remotest support to Doyle’s narrative. All the physical facts argued against it: the 90-mile-an-hour velocity over street car tracks, the sudden V-forming convergence, and the fact that despite the abrupt right turning of the Oldsmobile going at least 75 miles an hour, it did not upset. Doyle’s account was, to say the least, in the words of the Bard, “wondrous strange.”</p>

It is not known whether Doyle’s testimony falls into any of such categories, and this Court does not attempt to characterize it in any way, but it is clear that the jury was not ■sufficiently instructed with regard to it. The very able Trial Judge, in speaking of this feature of the case, says in his opinion awarding the new trial that: “No objection was made by counsel for the plaintiffs to the introduction of two separate unreconcilable defenses. Therefore, the trial judge was not called upon to make any ruling.” But even without any objection •by plaintiffs’ counsel or request for specific instruction, it was incumbent on the judge’s part to guide the jury in passing upon so astonishing a variation from the defendant’s own account as to what occurred.</p>

It is just the old desire.” It seemed that “the old desire” was a continuing one with Doyle.

    <p id="b134-7" data-blocks='[["BL_134.7",134,[222,1583,1146,706]]]'>The Superior Court does admit that “the defendant should have seen Joseph’s car in time to stop, and the evidence as a Avhole establishes that he was guilty of negligence under either version,” but that this “does not exonerate Joseph from negligence on his part.” The Court suggests that Joseph could have avoided the accident by “going over the curb onto the sideAvalk, facing his car in the same direction he drove up to his home, or he could have gone further down the street, turned around, and approached his home from the opposite direction in which case he would have been able to enter the driveway without stopping on the highway.”</p>

      <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>Of course, Joseph could have avoided all possibility of accident by not taking his car out that night at all. The criterion of accountability, however, in a negligence case is not what an injured person might have done to avoid mishap, but whether what he did under the circumstances is what a reasonably prudent person would have done. Considering the lateness of the hour and the comparative sparseness of traffic at that time, the unobstructed visibility to all passersby of his car, the short period of time required to complete the maneuver of taking his car to the point where <em>he </em>wanted to have it for the night, one cannot say as a matter of law that he was guilty of contributory negligence. The jury found him free of contributory negligence and, under the circumstances of the case, this finding is final.</p>
    <p id="b135-3" data-blocks='[["BL_135.4",135,[167,1264,1149,536]]]'>Although the Superior Court says that Chioda was “guilty of negligence under either version,” it also says that “the jury could have found Joseph guilty of negligence under either story.” But to find Joseph guilty of negligence under the Doyle story, the jury would have had to find that possibly Joseph not only attempted suicide by suddenly swerving his car right angularly while travelling at some 70 miles per hour, but that he intended to kill his brother Richard, as well.</p>
    <p id="b135-4" data-blocks='[["BL_135.5",135,[166,1820,1149,543]],["BL_136.1",136,[240,375,1144,207]]]'>In support of its statement that the verdict in this case was a “compromise verdict”, the Superior Court cited the case of <em>Carpenelli v. Scranton Bus Company, </em><a href="/pa/350/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="350 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="461148" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0184-01">350 Pa. 184</a>, where the plaintiff had moved for a new trial on the basis of an inadequate verdict. But that case differs monumentally from the one at bar because there, the Trial Court <em>refused </em>the motion for a new trial and this Court sustained the refusal. Here the Trial Court <em>granted </em>the new trial. And in that same <em>GarpeneUi </em>case, this Court reiterated the rule: <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>“When a court grants a new trial on the ground of inadequacy of ■ the verdict an appellate court, in the absence of a gross abuse of discretion, will not . interfere.”</p>
    <p id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[239,599,1145,377]]]'>It is to be noted further. that in the <em>OarpenelU </em>Case, Justice Stern (later Chief Justice) said: “In the number of witnesses, in their disinterestednessj in the clarity of their testimony as to the happening of the accident, in the plausibility of their version of the occurrence, — in all these factors the advantage was markedly on the side of defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[239,985,1144,160]]]'>' In the case at bar, the reverse is true, because the plausibility as to the version of the accident is markedly on the side of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.7",136,[237,1153,1147,369]]]'>The Superior Court opinion also cited <em>Karcesky v. Laria, </em>and quoted from it: “The net result, as every trial judge knows, is that in a large majority of negligence cases where the evidence of negligence is not clear, or where the question of contributory negligence is not free from doubt, the jury brings in a compromise verdict.”</p>
    <p id="b136-7" data-blocks='[["BL_136.8",136,[234,1539,1146,822]],["BL_137.1",137,[178,374,1147,155]]]'>But, again, it must be emphasized that there is nothing of that in the case at bar. If the jury had sympathized with Joseph and Richard because of their injuries but intellectually believed, under the Doyle version, that Chioda was free from fault, the jury would have to believe that Joseph perpetrated a wholly inexcusable and wholly wanton act of jeopardizing his brother’s life and inflicting disfiguring injuries upon him. In that event, why would they award Joseph anything at all? And if the jury accepted the Doyle story and sympathized with Richard, why would they not return a verdict against Joseph in Richard’s case against Joseph? And if, under the reasoning of the <em>OarpenelU </em>case, the jury rendered a compromise verdict favoring the plaintiffs because <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>they were guilty of contributory negligence, on what basis could they find Richard and his mother guilty of contributory negligence?</p>
