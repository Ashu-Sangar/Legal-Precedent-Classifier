On February 2, 1956, at 4:00 P.M., the defendant’s bus, driven by its employee, Andrew Tarapchak, was proceeding easterly from Hazleton on Route 940. It was being driven at a speed of 20 miles an hour. Francis O’Donnell was driving his automobile easterly on Route 940. The plaintiffs were among the bus’s thirty-one passengers. At a point three miles from Hazleton and just beyond the village of ITarleigh, O’Donnell tried to pass the bus; when he was halfway in the middle of the bus or a little ahead of the bus, he saw a car approaching from the opposite direction. There was no evidence how far away the approaching car was, but O’Donnell had a clear vision of approximately 800 feet. O’Donnell then drove his car from the left-hand lane into the right-hand lane, intending to get ahead of the bus. O’Donnell’s right front fender crashed into the left fender of the bus and became hooked at its fender and <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>bumper.

The reasons are presented with such clarity, succinctness, and excellent logic that I will avail myself of the privilege of quoting them: “The bus driver could have and under the law was obliged to yield the right of way to O’Donnell by giving way to the right. <em>This he did not do. </em>The bus driver could have and under the law was obliged to refrain from increasing the speed of the bus after O’Donnell signaled his intention to pass the bus. <em>This he did not do. </em>Considering the weather and road conditions existing, and the highest degree of care owed by a bus company to its passengers, the bus company could have and should have equipped the rear wheels of the bus with tire chains. <em>This was not done. </em>When faced with the emergency to which he had contributed the bus driver could have and should have acted reasonably and prudently. <em>This he did not do. </em>Instead he panicked, turned his head to the rear of the bus and <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>then turned the steering wheel of the bus sharply to the right causing the bus to go over the embankment. The jury was therefore entitled to and duty bound to consider whether failure of the bus driver to give way to the right coupled with action on the bus driver’s part in increasing the speed of the bus created a situation which prevented O’Donnell from successfully passing the bus; whether failure of the bus to be equipped with tire chains made it impossible for the bus driver to control the bus and keep it from ‘veering’ when the collision occurred and made it impossible to brake the bus to a stop before it plunged over the embankment; and whether the action.on the part of the bus driver in turning his head to the rear of the bus and turning the steering wheel sharply to the right prevented the bus driver from retaining control of the bus and preventing it from leaving the highway. Under the evidence the jury would have been warranted in finding against the defendant on all or any of these actions or omissions to act on the part of the bus driver. An inference drawn by the jury in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant on any or all of these matters would have been proper and would find support in the testimony. And inferences from the testimony were for the jury (Ferguson v. Charis, <a href="/pa/314/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="314 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="1154618" data-case-paths="/pa/314/0164-01">314 Pa. 164</a>, (1934)). Therefore it is respectfully submitted that none of the facts lead' unerringly to the conclusion that the defendant was free of negligence, that there is ample evidence in the record to support a finding of negligence on the part of thA defendant, and that a jury would not be'obligated to speculate conjecture or guess in order to impose liability on the defendant.”</p>

    <p id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[166,488,1151,1417]]]'>Why would it be unfair to hold the bus driver responsible because he had to make a split-second decision? That was his job. A good motorist must so have his wits about him that he can make split-second decisions, especially if he is the driver of a passenger bus which, because of its size alone, makes it a target of the road. A split-second decision is by no means an unheard-of thing, nor even unusual. Every ball player at bat must make a split-second decision as to whether he should swing or not each time the ball comes hurtling toward him. For a prize fighter the difference between delivering a knock-out blow and finding himself on the 'canvas floor counting constellations no rocket can ever reach is the matter of a split-second decision. Dynamite engineers in setting off a blast must time their decision by split-seconds. Every airplane pilot is trained to make split-second decisions. Thus, it is not too much to expect of a motorist that he should know what to do when confronted with what was, in this case, a not unusual or even an infrequent situation. A slight movement to the right (perhaps only the matter of a few inches or a foot or two) by Tarapchak would have avoided contact with O’Donnell’s car, and <em>that </em>avoidance would have saved the bus from tumbling over the embankment, imperilling life and limb of every passenger.</p>

But neither can it be said, as a matter of split-second decision, that he was free from negligence. Whether he used the care required under the circumstances was a question peculiarly for the jury. The law should ask many questions of a driver who purposely takes his bus over an embankment, before releasing him of all responsibility. <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>Although Tarapchak was called as of cross-examination by the plaintiffs the scope of that examination, as is always true in such a situation, was necessarily limited. Had the defendant motor transit company been required to present its defense, the field of cross-examination of the driver would have widened considerably and everyone appraising the facts would have been more at ease in making a decision, not in seconds, not in minutes, but in hours, even days, as to whether justice was done under the circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[257,927,1145,308]]]'>As it stands now, enigma enwraps the case, puzzlement confronts the inquirer of truth, and indecision hangs over the Hazleton-Freeland Road as heavily as did the passenger bus after it went over the embankment to the accompaniment of the bus driver’s shout, “What the hell.”</p>
