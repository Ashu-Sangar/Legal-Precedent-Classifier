In <em>Costack v. Pennsylvania R. R.

They may all, perhaps, be divided into two classes. The one class consists of cases holding that such ‘negative’ testimony, as against the ‘positive’, affirmative testimony of witnesses who did hear a warning signal, is but a scintilla of evidence not sufficient to make out a charge of negligence against the railroad company, which, therefore, is entitled to a directed verdict in its favor. [Citing numerous cases in a footnote]. In the other class • are cases where the negative testimony was by-witnesses who, although in such a position that they would have been likely to hear warnings of the approach of a train did not hear any; it was held that under such, circumstances it was for the jury to pass upon the strength of such testimony even though contradicted by other witnesses, this being especially true if the witnesses were paying particular attention and actually listening for such warnings; such testimony was characterized as being of a higher grade than mere negative testimony. [Citing numerous cases in a footnote]. The question is not one merely of form of expression — whether, for example, the witness says that ‘no warning was given’ as distinguished from his saying that ‘he heard no warning’: (Kindt v. Reading Company, <a href="/pa/352/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="352 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="464155" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0419-01">352 Pa. 419</a>, 426, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.2d%20145" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="43 A.2d 145">43 A. 2d 145</a>, 149). Rather <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>it is whether he had acuteness of hearing, sufficient opportunity for hearing, and occasion for listening, <em>and whether all the other circumstances tended to show that if a warning signal had been given he would probably have heard it, </em>and therefore, not having heard it, he could fairly assert that no warning was given. -Such are the factors which must he considered in determining whether or not so-called ‘negative’ testimony amounts to more than a mere scintilla of evidence and therefore entitles submission of the plaintiff’s case to the jury.” The Court held that under the circumstances of the case, the evidence was sufficient to take the case to the jury.</p>

The Court said (page 424) : “It is impossible to lay down any rule by which it can infallibly be determined that a witness’ statement that ‘no whistle was blown and no bell was rung’ is of so positive a character as to support a charge of negligence, or is of such negative character as to ‘amount only to a scintilla’.

The Majority. Opinion says in the case at bar: “The question of whether a statement of a witness, to wit, that he did not hear a sound or that no bell was rung, was negative or positive testimony and was or was not sufficient to take the case to the jury, in the face of strong positive affirmative testimony, that a bell was rung, has vexed and perplexed the Courts.”</p>

The effectiveness of a witness’s testimony should be evaluated according to the physical opportunities he enjoyed to ascertain the facts, the trustworthiness of his senses, and his reliability as an honest man. Whether he replies No or Yes to a given question in Court has nothing to do with positiveness or negativeness. A categorical no is as positive as a shouting yes. If A asks B to lend him ten dollars and B says no, nothing can be more positive to A than that he is not going to get the ten dollars. The negative-, ness of the reply does not alter the positiveness of the fact, that he will need to go elsewhere for the ten dollars he seeks.</p>

This depends upon whether the fire truck sounded its siren or rang its bell. This in turn depends — all parties agree — upon whether plaintiff’s testimony that he did not hear a siren or bell was, under the circumstances here involved, sufficiently positive in form and substance to take the case to the jury.”</p>

And did you hear any siren or bell as you approached this intersection? A. <em>I didn’t sir. </em>Q. And did you hear any bell or siren when you were a block from the intersection? A. <em>No, sir. </em>Q. Did you hear any sound, siren or bell, at any time before this accident? A. <em>No, sir. </em>Q. Did <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>you hear any sound, siren or hell, at the time of the impact? A. <em>No, sir.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.)

Moreover, he testified that if a siren, had been blowing or a bell had been ringing just before the accident, he would have heard the warning.</p>
    <p id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.6",120,[234,808,1156,649]]]'>This Court says that the plaintiffs evidence, was sufficient to take the case to the jury but that the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The plaintiff’s testimony was supported by the testimony of the driver of the truck, Regatuso, and by a disinterested witness, Felix A. Didio, who testified that he heard a bell ringing but that no siren was blowing. The plaintiff also produced an expert witness on fire equipment (John Douglas) who • testified that he examined the fire truck a “few days” after the accident •and that “there was positively no siren on'the truck when I inspected it.”</p>

The Majority cites the case of <em>Nestor v. George, </em><a href="/pa/354/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="354 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="467397" data-case-paths="/pa/354/0019-01">354 Pa. 19</a>, as authority, but the facts in that case were wholly different. There the defendant railway company offered to show that a fare rope was in the same condition five days <em>prior </em>to an accident that it was at the time of the accident. This Court held the offer inadmissible because there was no evidence that the condition of the rope continued until the date of the accident. Here, we are speaking not about the condition of a device (the fire siren) but about its very existence, and not before the accident but' <em>after </em>the accident. The Majority quotes Henry on Trial Evidence: “Whenever the condition of a particular place or thing at a certain time is in question, evidence of its condition at a prior or subsequent <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>time is admissible <em>if accompanied by proof that it has not changed in the </em>meanwhile.” This, of course,, is good law, but how is it authority here? How could the plaintiff show that the fire truck had not undergone some alteration after the accident? The fire truck was in the possession of the City. Once the expert testified that at the time of his inspection the fire truck had no siren, the City had the right to show, if those were the facts, that the truck did have a siren or that it had been removed for some reason. Instead of meeting Douglas’s testimony head-on, it seemed the City was more concerned about , showing, that Douglas had no permission to inspect the truck.</p>
    <p id="b121-3" data-blocks='[["BL_121.4",121,[178,1094,1149,425]]]'>The Majority says: “The evidence produced by the City of Pittsburgh with respect to the happening of the accident conflicted in almost all material respects with that produced by the plaintiff,” This is not unusual. It is conflict in testimony which makes a trial, and it is the province of the jury to decide which side of the conflict predominates in convincing qualities.</p>
    <p id="b121-4" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[180,1539,1147,488]]]'>Moreover, this Court has said more times than there are leaves on the largest tree in Fairmount Park in the summertime that it will not reverse a lower Court’s discretion in the matter of awarding or refusing a new trial where only credibility of witnesses is involved, because the Trial Court is in a better position than an appellate court to pass upon credibility. I do not see anything in the record which justifies this Court in reversing that position in the case at bar.</p>
