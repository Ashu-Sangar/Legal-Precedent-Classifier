There was no evidence or even a contention that he was drunk or intoxicated. He entered the front door of his home and walked into the living room'where his wife, Ruth Markle, aged 37 years, was watching television. According to his son Jack Markle, aged 15 years, he walked over to his wife’s chair and picked up. a cup of coffee which was on the arm of the chair. His wife grabbed back the cup and the coffee spilled on the floor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a>

Markle then got a 12 gauge Stevens shotgun from a closet. He came downstairs. His son Jack had gone into the other half of the double house to tell the owner, Charles Leidy, that his father was going to shoot his mother. Within a minute a shot rang out and Leidy went to see what had happened. Markle <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>met him in the common hallway (used by both families ) and shoved the shotgun muzzle into Leidy’s abdomen and said: “You get the hell over there where you belong. I just shot and killed Ruth.” Leidy went back to his apartment and tried to call a doctor. Another shot rang out and then Markle entered the Leidy living room and handed the shotgun and four unused shells to Leidy and again said, “I just shot and killed Ruth.”</p>

It is merely a plea of guilty of murder generally, and only establishes the felonious killing as murder in the second degree. In order to raise the degree, the burden is upon the Commonwealth to establish the essential elements of first degree murder — in this case a wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, which requires, inter alia, a specific intent to take human life: <em>Commonwealth v.

He told James Barger, a State Policeman, less than two hours after the killing, that he fired the second shot to stop his wife from screaming and moaning. Moreover he told Gus Zanos, the arresting officer, less than thirty minutes after the killing that he had killed his wife and that he, “would do it again if [he] had to.” Less than two hours after the killing, in response to a question of Constable Roy Bruner, he said it was none of’ Bruner’s business why he had killed his wife. He also told Bruner, “It is me [Markle] that is going to get the hotseat.” Finally in his written statement given less than seven hours after the killing, he stated that he remembered getting the gun and shooting his wife.</p>

      <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>’’’ Maride contends that this killing could not rise higher than murder in the second degree because he had a life-long history of emotional instability; he was a heavy drinker; he. was discharged from the Army because of psychoneurosis; he is a constitutional psychopath; from earliest childhood, he was never able to get along with his family; he severely bumped his head during childhood (as does every American boy) ; he attended twenty-seven different schools in eight years and could not finish the Eighth grade; he married a girl who was only fourteen years old; he struck his wife several times; he had great difficulty in keeping a-job and changed jobs frequently. Assuming that all of this is both accurate and true, it would not be legally sufficient to justify a finding by the trial judges of second degree murder. A fortiori it is not legally sufficient to warrant a finding by this Court of abuse of discretion, or error of law, or any error that would justify a reduction of the crime to second degree murder.
