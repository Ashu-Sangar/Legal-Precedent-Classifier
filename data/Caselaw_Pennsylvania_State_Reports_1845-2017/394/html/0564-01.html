The facts are recited in the unanimous opinion of the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Agnew (page 344) : “This is a hard case, but it seems to be without a remedy. An aged couple, husband and wife, having no lineal descendants, and each owning property, determined to make their wills in favor of each other, so that the survivor should have all they possessed. Their wills were drawn precisely alike, mutatis mutandis, and laid down on a table for execution. Each signed a paper, which was duly witnessed by three subscribing witnesses, and the papers were enclosed in separate envelopes, endorsed and sealed up. After the death of George A. Alter, the envelopes were opened and it was found that each had by mistake signed the will of the other. To remedy this error the legislature, by an Act approved the 23rd day of February 1870, conferred authority upon the Register’s Court of this county to take proof of the mistake, and proceed as a court of chancery, to reform the will of George A. Alter and decree accordingly. . . . Was the paper signed by George A. Alter his will? Was it capable of being reformed by the Register’s Court? The paper drawn up for his will was not a will in law, for it was not ‘signed by him at the end thereof,’ as the Wills Act requires. <em>The paper he signed was not his will, for it was drawn tip for the will of his wife and gave the property to himself. It was insensible and absurd. </em>It is clear, therefore, that he had executed no will, and there was nothing to be reformed. There was a mistake, it is true, but that mis<a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>take was the same as if he had signed a blank sheet of paper. He had written his name, but not to his will. He had never signed his will, and the signature where it was, was the same as if he had not written it at all. He therefore died intestate, and his property descended as at law.” The Court further decided that the Legislative Act was void because it had no power to divest estates which were already vested at law on the death of George A. Alter without a will.</p>

He then placed the enclosure in his safe deposit box where it was found after his death. The Court held that the instrument could not be probated as Bryen’s last will because it was not signed at the end thereof in conformity with the statute, nor could any part or pages thereof be probated as his last will. This Court, speaking through Mr. Justice, later Chief Justice, Steen, said (page 128) : “The obvious truth of the matter is that the loose sheet was signed by mistake, ....

They explained to the attorney, whose services they sought, that he should draw two wills which would state that when either of the partners had sailed away, the one remaining ashore would become the owner of the property of the departing voyager. Vasil Pavlinko knew but little English. However, his lawyer, fortunately, was well versed in his clients’ native language, known as Little Russian or Carpathian. The attorney thus discussed the whole matter with his two visitors in their language. He then dictated appropriate wills to his stenographer in English and then, after they had been transcribed, he translated the documents, paragraph by paragraph, to Mr. and Mrs. Pavlinko, who approved of all that he had <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>written.

It did not matter, however, who held the papers since they were complementary óf each other. Mrs. Pavlinko left her property to Mr. Pavlinko and Mr. Pavlinko left his property to Mrs. Pavlinko.

No one disputes this brute fact, no one can dispute this granitic, unbudgeable truth.

But, I respectfully submit, the Majority does not make a serious effort to effectuate that expressed intent. The Majority contents itself with saying that “the facts are unusual and the result very unfortunate.” But the results do not need to be unfortunate. In <em>King Will, </em><a href="/pa/369/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="369 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="1232391" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0523-01">369 Pa. 523</a>, 531, we said that: “What offends against an innate sense of justice, decency and fair play offends against good law.” Certainly the results being affirmed by this Court offend against an innate sense of justice. Elias Martin is being turned out of court when there is no need for such a peremptory eviction. The Majority authorizes the eviction on the basis of a decision <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>rendered by this 'Court in 1878 in the ease of <em>Alter’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/67/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="67 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="1022428" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0341-01">67 Pa. 341</a>. There, wife and husband, also signed wrong papers and the Court in that post-Civil War period, held nothing could be done to correct the error. But even if we say that the <em>Alter </em>decision makes impossible the transferring of the signatures of Vasil Pavlinko to the will written in his name, I still do not see how it prevents this Court from enforcing the provision in the will which <em>was </em>signed by Vasil Pavlinko. In the <em>Alter </em>case an attempt was made to reform the will “by striking off the signature -Catherine Alter,’ and causing the name ‘George A. Alter’ to be signed thereto” so that the paper so signed could be “admitted to probate as the will of George A. Alter.” But in our case here, no such substitution is being sought. What Elias Martin seeks is admission to probate of a testamentary writing <em>actually signed by the testator Vasil Pavlinko. ■</em>
