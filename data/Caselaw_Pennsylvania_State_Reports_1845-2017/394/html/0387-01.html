He is a small man and was seventy-two years old at the time of the accident. He reached the crosswalk at the northwest corner of two Philadelphia streets, Ninth and Shunk, and was facing east in' order to cross Ninth on the north side of Shunk. His home was half a block away on a small street intermediate between Eighth' and Ninth, and a house or two north of Shunk. Both streets carried one-way traffic: Ninth northward and Shunk westward. Cars were parked solidly on all eight sides of the intersecting streets. Shunk is thirty-four feet wide and Ninth twenty-six, both' having sidewalks' twelve feet wide. The only traffic control was a stop sign on Shunk Street' for westbound traffic. The accident happened at noon of a clear, dry day late in April.</p>

They began at a point nine feet south of the north curb of Shunk Street and ten feet east of the west curb of Ninth Street. They ran parallel and straight. Because the wheelbase of defendant’s car was ten feet two inches and so created this much overlap, the car skidded a distance of two inches less than seventeen feet. The marks ended six feet north of the twelve-foot sidewalk, and the front bumper was two feet ten inches beyond that, due to the overhang forward of the front wheels. There was a blood spot in Ninth Street eight feet east of the west curb and twelve feet north of the end of the skid marks. Plaintiff was found lying about ten feet in front of the car and had dust and dirt on him.</p>

At an average rate of walk the jury could infer that defendant was far enough away to see plaintiff and take precautions to avoid him. Judging from where the skid marks began and the distance defendant traveled during a second of reaction time, it follows that defendant must have entered the intersection and then seen plaintiff too late to avoid hitting him. From this the jury could deduce negligence, since they could also find that defendant’s car had not entered the intersection when plaintiff looked for it before leaving the curb. If the tunnel formed by the parked cars on Ninth Street south of Shunk hid the defendant’s car from plaintiff’s view, this was another circumstance for the jury.</p>
