On March 22, 1946, Mrs. Miller, as executrix, and on March 22,1956, Mrs. Miller, as testamentary trustee, entered into a 10 year voting trust agreement which included the Freihofer Estate’s holdings of 10,698 shares of the Freihofer Baking Company and. 1605 additional shares owned, by another person or persons.
