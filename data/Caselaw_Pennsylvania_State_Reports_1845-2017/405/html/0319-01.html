Under the “Lease” heading: (1) Manor agreed to lease to Pine certain coal seams under a 1650 acre tract of land not included in the “Exchange” heading, the lease to be prepared and submitted for execution within 60 days of the exchange of properties between Manor and Pine, i.e., June 30, 1956; (2) the provisions of the contemplated lease were set forth; (3) it was provided that the coal mined and shipped should be routed over lines of the Pennsylvania Railroad.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It is stated by Manor, in its brief, that the principal purpose of this letter “was the development of the Yellow Creek Coal Field and the production of coal for shipment via The Pennsylvania Railroad”.

Finally, the Pittsburgh District Director of Internal Revenue on February 24, 1959, by letter notified Pine that, since the property exchange under the “interim agreement” would be between Heilwood and Manor, who were not Pine’s subsidiaries, approval of the property exchange by the District Director was unnecessary. Four days later, Heilwood’s counsel wrote Pennsylvania, enclosing a copy of the District Director’s letter, stating that, since this was “the only barrier to the completion of the long contemplated exchange of coal and surface”, it, Heilwood, hoped the exchange could be accomplished at an early date. In response to this letter, several days later, Pennsylvania’s counsel wrote to Heilwood’s .counsel stating, inter alia: “As there does not appear to be any further legal impediments, the necessary documents to effect the transfer- will be prepared by Manor toward the end that this exchange may be completed as soon as possible.” Yery significantly, Pennsylvania’s counsel then stated: <em>“In accord with our prior understanding, nothing further will be done at this time in respect to the leasehold </em>interests: (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

Three weeks later Heilwood’s counsel wrote to Manor, under the heading “Exchange of lands between [Heilwood] and [Manor]”, and returned the several deed drafts, stating, “I [Heilwood’s counsel] have endorsed approval of [Heilwood] on the back of the deed form [Manor to Heilwood] . . .” and advised that a blueprint of a certain map should be added to the Heilwood-Manor deed.</p>

Manor, by preliminary objections, attacked Heilwood’s complaint in three respects: (1) that no cause of action was stated; (2) that the complaint shows an agreement between Manor and Pine, not between Manor and Heilwood; (3) that the agreement was entire and not severable and Heilwood cannot seek specific performance of only part of the agreement, i.e., the exchange of properties, and not the lease portion of the agreement. On February 27, 1961, the court en banc dismissed Heilwood’s complaint on the ground that “the exchange of properties and the leasing provisions of the agreement are interdependent and not severable [and that Heilwood] is not entitled to specific performance of one phase of the agreement, the property exchange provisions, and completely OArerlook the proAÚsions relating to the leasing of properties” and, therefore, Heil<a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>wood failed to state a cause of action.

In such consideration two rules must guide us: First, in the posture in which this litigation is presented — preliminary objections to an equity complaint —we must accept as true all facts, as distinguished from conclusions of law, which are well pleaded in the complaint; second, we can sustain the preliminary objections and thus dismiss Heilwood’s claim <em>only </em>if the complaint <em>clearly </em>fails to set forth a cause of action: <em>Savitz v. Weinstein, </em><a href="/pa/395/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="395 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1282795" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0173-01">395 Pa. 173</a>, 174, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20A.2d%20110" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="149 A.2d 110">149 A. 2d 110</a>; <em>Gardner v.

    <p id="b361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_361.6",361,[148,1577,1150,743]]]'>On its face the “interim agreement” purports to be a contract <em>only </em>between Manor and Pine. However, it is clear from Pine’s letter of transmittal of the approved “interim agreement” to Manor that Manor <em>knew </em>that the property to be traded to it was owned not by Pine but by Heilwood and that Pine was <em>“in a position” </em>to guarantee that Heilwood was exchanging its property. Such knowledge must have brought notice to Manor that there was <em>some </em>relationship between Pine and Heilwood; otherwise, Heilwood would turn over its property to Manor and Manor would turn over its property to Pine and Heilwood would receive nothing out of the arrangement, a bizarre and unrealistic result.</p>

      <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>Furthermore, the complaint alleged that Heilwood was “an allied<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> company” of Pine and avers that, immediately after approval by Pine of the “interim agreement”, it was Heilwood, not Pine, which, with Manor’s knowledge and consent, took possession of Manor’s property. Is it likely that Manor, if it was dealing with Pine in a nonrepresentative capacity, would have permitted Heilwood, a stranger eo nominee to the agreement, to enter into and remain in possession of its property for upwards of four years? In addition, the correspondence attached to the complaint clearly shows that Manor construed the agreement as contemplating an exchange of property between Manor and Heilwood, not Manor and Pine, and Manor’s counsel dealt directly with Heilwood’s counsel in connection with that portion of the agreement providing for the property exchange. While perhaps the relationship between Pine and Heilwood could have been more artistically pleaded, on the posture of this record there is sufficient pleaded to indicate that Pine was acting for Heilwood in the exchange portion of the agreement. If Heilwood can prove the facts averred and that Pine was acting for it in the exchange provisions of the agreement, then, either as a disclosed or undisclosed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> principal, Heilwood could sue for specific performance of the exchange provisions of the agreement. Although not a party eo nominee to the agreement, if Heilwood’s averments <em>can </em>be proven, then Manor knew or should have known Pine was acting for Heilwood in making this agreement, at least the exchange provisions thereof.</p>

It is often most difficult to determine whether a contract is entire or severable. The primary inquiry in resolving this question is whether the language employed in the contract clearly indicates the intention of the parties that the contract be considered entire or severable <em>(Easton v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/193/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="193 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="910346" data-case-paths="/pa/193/0147-01">193 Pa. 147</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%20264" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="44 A.2d 264">44 A. 2d 264</a>); only in the absence of a clear indication of the parties’ intention from the language of the contract may resort be had to rules of construction <em>(Producers Coke v.

    <p id="b363-4" data-blocks='[["BL_363.4",363,[139,995,1153,861]]]'>We must, therefore, look to the language of the agreement as such may or may not illuminate the parties’ intention. In the recital to the agreement, Manor states it has acquired a certain coal field and that “[c]ertain areas on this coal field have been the subject of negotiations, both exchange and lease, between [Pine] and [Manor]” and that Manor is advised that Pine has “plans for early development of some of the coal which would be <em>leased or traded </em>to [Pine].” The agreement then contemplates <em>both </em>an exchange of certain lands between Pine and Manor (lands which Manor knew Pine did not own) and a lease of certain coal seams under another 1650 acre tract of land. The lease was not to be prepared and submitted for examination until <em>after </em>the exchange of lands and then within sixty days of that date.</p>
    <p id="b363-5" data-blocks='[["BL_363.5",363,[142,1869,1150,475]],["BL_364.1",364,[247,347,1150,531]]]'>The agreement makes a sharp division between the “Exchange” provisions and the “Lease” provisions; the consideration for the property exchange lies in the mutuality of the trading, while the consideration for the lease is the payment of the stated royalty; while Manor clearly seeks the early development of the coal lands to be leased <em>or </em>traded it is to be noted that, as to the lands to be traded, nothing is stated as to the requirement of mining the coal under said lands, while, as to the <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>lands to be leased, lessee is under an obligation to strip and mine 12,000 tons per month; while coneededly the principal purpose of the agreement was to enhance coal traffic on the Pennsylvania Railroad it is only the lease which provides for the shipment of coal over Pennsylvania Railroad lines. Unlike the court below we find nothing in the <em>language </em>of this agreement which clearly reveals the intention of the parties that the agreement was entire, not severable; in fact, the language of the agreement is ambiguous in this respect.</p>

First, without any lease of the coal under the 1650 acre tract or an attempt toward compliance with the lease provisions and, in fact, long before such lease was to be submitted for execution, Heilwood entered into possession of Manor’s land and sold off timber and Manor entered into possession of Heilwood’s land and permitted its lessee to use part of surface and to mine coal. In the second place, Pennsylvania’s counsel, acting for Manor, notified Heilwood’s counsel that “nothing will be done at this time in respect of the leasehold interests”. Third, the present posture of the record indicates nothing which could be construed as a “no lease, no exchange” attitude on Manor’s part, but just the contrary. The conduct of the parties certainly indicates a severability of the exchange and lease provisions of the agreement.

Certainly the instant record is not so clear and free from doubt as to justify dismissal of this complaint and deprive Heilwood of its right to be heard. The order of the court, subject of appeal, No. 148, is reversed.</p>

      <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>In view of our disposition of appeal No. 148, it might be unnecessary to consider the subject of appeal No. 157 which seeks, on another ground, reversal of the same order. However, for the sake of clarification of this phase of the litigation and perhaps avoid subsequent appeal once this matter reaches final conclusion in the court below, we shall briefly consider the question raised by Manor as to the court’s order.</p>
    <p id="b366-4" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[254,769,1149,578]]]'>Manor’s appeal is based on an amendment made by the court to its original order. In its original order, the court below, under the impression that Heilwood’s complaint sought damages for the cutting of timber on its land, directed submission of that question to the law side of the court. On a motion for reconsideration of this phase of the order, the court, realizing the complaint did not seek damages for the cutting of timber, amended its order and deleted that portion thereof relating to the certification of the claim for damages to the law side of the court.</p>
    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[250,1374,1151,479]]]'>Manor argues that the original order was by the court en banc, that the argument on the motion to amend was before Judge Bkosicy alone and that Judge Brosky, a single member of the court en banc, amended the order. <em>Such argument lacks factual support on this record. </em>The opinion upon which the amended order is based indicates it was handed down for the <em>entire </em>court en banc — Judges Ellenbogen, Weir and Brosky — by Judge Brosky. We find no merit in Manor’s appeal.</p>

Heilwood, taking the position it had <em>not </em>asked for damages, moved to amend the order and, on March 17, 1961, the court amended the order and struck out the provisions as to certification to the law side of the court. Manor contends the amended order is invalid inasmuch as it was made by one judge and not the court en banc.</p>
