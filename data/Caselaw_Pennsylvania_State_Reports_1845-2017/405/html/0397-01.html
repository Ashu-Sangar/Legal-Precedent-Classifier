On September 26, 1956, the Company acquired the steam heat service facilities of the plant from Power &amp; Light for $250,000. The property acquired consisted of (a) a production system<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> used by Electric and Power <em>&amp; </em>Light both to produce steam used in the generation of electricity <em>and </em>to supply steam heat; (b) a distribution system;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (c) general property,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> (b) and (c) being employed <em>exclusively </em>in steam heat service.

Here, the steam heating company utilized the by-product of a plant previously devoted <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>primarily to the generation of electricity. Very few (if any) instances exist where a plant was originally devoted solely to the production of steam for a steam heating utility. Since this formerly was a by-product plant which is now for the first time solely devoted to the production of steam, the Commission’s treatment of this utility’s plant as an original acquisition with no historical original cost and with a reproduction cost evidenced only by the arm’s length acquisition cost is justified. The employment of any other concept in arriving at fair value under these facts, requires that we resort to fantastic, unrealistic and uneconomical valuations.</p>

The Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Company could not conceive that as a steam heating plant alone the fair value for rate purposes Avould be determined by such egregious formulae as original cost and reproduction cost. The Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Company knew the true and fair value of the steam plant facilities devoted to the service of steam heating customers and, apparently being satisfied with the rate of return, did not seek increased rates for the services now under consideration. These fantastic and unrealistic values of original cost and reproduction cost should on remand he given only passing consideration by the Commission. I feel, under the circumstances of this case, the Commission was justified in ignoring them completely. <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>Hence, I would reverse the action of the Superior Court and affirm the order of the Commission.</p>
