On June 9, 1924, Mr. Catherwood created an inter vivos trust under which the First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company was named trustee. To this trust Mr. Catherwood transferred 1896.72 shares of the common stock of American Gas and Electric Company, now American Electric Power Company. The trust provided that the trustee hold the res, collect the income and distribute the net income in equal <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>shares to Mr. Catherwood’s two children for life and remainder over at their death to their descendants per stirpes.

When sold, the <em>book value </em>(i.e., <em>intact </em>value) of these 200 shares was $2352.94 and the proceeds of the sale were $7808.18 ($39.04 per share). The proceeds of the sale ($7808.18) exceeded the <em>intact value </em>($2352.94) by $5455.24. However, the sale of this stock resulted in an actual loss to the trust of $6546.90, i.e., $14,355.08 (the <em>carrying value </em>at $71.77 per share) less $7808.18 (the proceeds of the sale).

In <em>Crawford, </em>a testator, who died in 1985, placed his residuary estate in trust to pay the income, under spendthrift provisions, to his daughter for life and provision was made for distribution of the corpus after the daughter’s death. <em>The testator directed that all stoch dividends should constitute principal. </em>After the effective date of the 1945 Act. but prior to the effective date of the 1947 Act, the trustees received stock dividends from three corporations and sold other corporate stock and subscription rights.

This Court held that the decisional law embodied in the Pennsylvania Rule established in the life ténant a <em>vested property right </em>and that the* provisions of the 1945 Act providing for its retroactive’ <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>application to trusts created prior to tbe Act were constitutionally inhibited by Article I, § §1 and 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the 14th Amendment to the U.

In <em>Palairet, </em>we held that a statute which provided for the extinguishment of ground rents effected a deprivation of vested property rights for a nonpublic use and was, therefore, invalid.

The complexities, the uncertainties, and the difficulties which are inherent in the application and administration of the Eule have too often in these modern times created confusion, injustices and glaring inconsistencies. The essential fairness and equity of the Pennsylvania Eule was beyond question. The basis for its rejection and abandonment by legislation is the fact that changes in corporate practice have, in many instances, rendered unworkable the Eule. In recent years the ingenuity of corporate management, seeking to achieve various ends such as broadening or enhancing the market for its stock, effect tax savings, etc., has produced a complexity of corporate transactions which involve the transfer on corporate books of earnings, earned surplus, etc., from one account to another. Earnings, under modern corporate practice, no longer retain the simplicity of meaning of the earnings considered by this Court in Earp’s Appeal, supra, and other decisions.” Other reasons, such as the prevalence of common stocks in trust portfolios, the unprecedented boom during the last decade which resulted in the issuance of “more stock dividends and offerings than our economy has ever experienced before”, etc., have added to the practical difficulty of applying the Eule.</p>

Because of recent amendments to our laws permitting fiduciaries to invest in common stocks, most estates, even the smaller ones, now have shares of the nation’s largest corporations in their portfolios. The apportionment problems which confront trustees today, as the result of such holdings, create administrative problems of such complexity as to make the management of trust estates a truly nightmarish experience. It is utterly unrealistic to expect trustees to be compelled to analyze the intricate financial statements of mammoth multi-million dollar corporations, every time a stock dividend is declared, or a share of stock sold.

The rationale of the majority decision — “convenience”—is something I cannot appreciate or approve. The majority not only repudiate the 100 year old Pennsylvania rule of appor<a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>tionment which was unanimously reaffirmed approximately one year ago, but they further declare that what this Court repeatedly said was unconstitutional, was constitutional and vice versa. The Pennsylvania rule of apportionment which often is difficult to work out or apply practically, has always been an equitable rule intended to favor the life tenant (widow or children) who are almost always the primary objects of the testator’s bounty. The rule says, in substance, that when an <em>extraordinary </em>stock dividend is paid or a <em>sale </em>is made which represents, in part, earnings which had accumulated from the time the stock was acquired— the earnings, no matter in what form they are giveu by a corporation or are hidden in a sale, belong to the life tenant. Every year, since <em>Crawford Estate </em>was decided in 362 Pa. (1949) the Supreme Court has been asked to overrule it, and every year the Supreme Court has rejected all such pleas, arguments.and contentions. It rejected it in <em>Steele Estate, </em><a href="/pa/377/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="377 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="1249593" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0250-01">377 Pa. 250</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.2d%20409" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="103 A.2d 409">103 A. 2d 409</a>; it rejected it in <em>Warden Trust, </em><a href="/pa/382/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="382 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1259938" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0311-01">382 Pa. 311</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20A.2d%20159" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="115 A.2d 159">115 A. 2d 159</a>; it rejected it in <em>Jones Estate, </em><a href="/pa/377/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="377 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="1249643" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0473-01">377 Pa. 473</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.2d%20353" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="105 A.2d 353">105 A. 2d 353</a>; and within the last two years it again rejected it in <em>Cunningham Estate, </em>395 Pa., supra. Each of these cases, as well as many others which were cited or quoted in my <em>Cunningham </em>Opinion, reaffirmed the equitable rule of apportionment which, I repeat, has been the law of Pennsylvania for over 100 years. Every member of the present Court (except the recently elected Justice Eagen) who is now voting to repudiate <em>Cunningham Estate, </em>voted in that recent case in favor of the Pennsylvania rule of- apportionment and rejected all pleas to' change the rule and overrule the prior decisions of this Court. Justice Benjamin. R. Jones, speaking.for the majority, and on this.point for the entire Court, decreed that <em>there should be an apportionment </em>between principal and income in the following four situations:</p>

When stock is sold, as here, at a loss in its carried (market) value, the life tenant is entitled to the earnings which he can prove have.accumulated.since acquisition .and are applicable and includable in the sale price, i.e., the'difference between the book value (called intact value) <em>at date of acquisition </em>($11.76 per share), <em>and at date of sale. </em>In determining earnings it is ridiculous to compare book value on the one hand with market value on the other hand. With one exception, i.e., <em>Arrott Estate, </em>
        <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a><a href="/pa/383/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="383 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1261930" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0228-01">383 Pa. 228</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.2d%20187" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="118 A.2d 187">118 A. 2d 187</a>, which everyone agrees was a hasty error and should be overruled, all authorities for countless years .have agreed that <em>market value is not </em>the correct test for or the equivalent of intact value. The fact that the stock was sold at a loss in its market value does not and should not affect the equitable rule of apportionment which, as above stated, has no connection with market value; nor should it deprive the life tenant of the accumulated earnings to which, all cases agree, he is entitled. For example, in a salvage operation where a mortgage is foreclosed and the real estate is bought in by the trustee and the land is subsequently sold at a loss, the life tenant is entitled out of the proceeds of the sale to the income which has been received or accrued. It is ridiculous to attempt to deduct an orange from an apple or a banana, you deduct an orange from two oranges, etc., but if you attempt to deduct an orange from a banana all you get is a squash. The true rule in determining whether and what a life tenant is entitled to out of the proceeds of sale is that he is entitled to what he can prove are the earnings which had accumulated since the acquisition of the stock and are applicable and includable in the sale price, namely, the difference between the book value (called intact value) at date of acquisition and the (adjusted) book value at date qf sale. See Cunningham Estate, at page 40. Unfortunately, the latter is not disclosed in the instant case.</p>
      <p id="AKV" data-blocks='[["BL_117.2",117,[124,2014,1150,316]]]'>The parties agreed to the following stipulation: “If gain is determined to be the difference between intact value and proceeds of sale, $2,322.80 will be apportioned to income; [but if] the carrying (market) value is used- no part of the proceeds go to income.” Since its meaning is neither clear nor sufficient with respect to the question in issue, I believe the case should be remanded for further proof on this point.</p>
