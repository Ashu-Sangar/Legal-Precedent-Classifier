The Governor, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, was authorized to and did appoint the three members of that Commission. The Commission has been given broad <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>supervisory and regulatory powers over all harness racing in the State at which pari-mutuel betting is permitted or conducted and, subject to provisions not presently relevant, is authorized to license no more than four corporations in any one year to conduct harness racing at tracks where pari-mutuel betting will take place.</p>

Thereafter, each applicant was separately and informally interviewed by the Executive Secretary of the Commission. The Commission’s counsel was also present at 12 of the 13 interviews while the chairman of the Commission was present at 9 of them. The remaining two members of the Commission attended none of the interviews. However, phonographic recordings were made of the interviews.
