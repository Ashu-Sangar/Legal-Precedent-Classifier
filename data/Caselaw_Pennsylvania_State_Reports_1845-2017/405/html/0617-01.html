Yet this nurse proceeded to diagnose Baur’s illness as the continuance of a virus condition. The nurse in charge of the dispensary was not an inexperienced nurse. He became a registered nurse in 1928. He was aware of the fact that a nurse does not have the right to diagnose. “Q. When you were dealing with Mr. Baur in the first aid room and before 4:15 and about 6 or 6:15 when he left, did you take into consideration the possibility that Mr. Baur might have had heart trouble of some sort?

Only when Baur asked for something to settle his stomach, after vonliting again, was any attention paid to him. He was given a teaspoon of citrus carbonate. No effort was made to call Baur’s own physician, or the plant physician. Had a physician examined Baur the seriousness of his condition would have resulted in a proper diagnosis of heart involvement.

Doctor Gordon, may I ask are those symptoms which I have recited, are they the symptoms of a coronary occlusion? A.

A. Well, I would say the man was treated with a great deal of neglect in not having a doctor. It wasn’t proper to ask a nurse, or any nurse, to make a diagnosis and prescribe treatment for as sick as he must have been. <em>And, to be there for one and one-half hours or two hours and not have a doctor see him is certainly neglectful </em>in my opinion as was sending him home in a taxicab with practically no diagnosis or treatment having been made.

Our statistics indicate that in a coronary occlusion eighty per cent of those who have a first attack recover. The twenty per cent who die are made up largely of such cases as Mr. Baur, cases who received inadequate or late care or no care. . . .
