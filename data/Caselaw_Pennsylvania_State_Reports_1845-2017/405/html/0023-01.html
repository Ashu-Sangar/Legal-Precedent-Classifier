The jury fixed the penalty at death.

L. 759 (placing upon the jury the duty of fixing the penalty between death and life imprisonment upon a conviction of first degree murder), the Commonwealth was precluded from introducing in a criminal trial evidence of the defendant’s prior convictions of dissociated crimes. Until the passage of the Act of 1925, supra, a conviction of first degree murder had automatically carried with it the death penalty. In interpreting the Act of 1925, this court announced in <em>Commonwealth v.

Although the ruling has been severely criticized from time to time by members of the bench, the bar, law reviews and text writers on the ground that it is impossible by a mere cautionary <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>instruction to the jury to obliterate from the minds of its members the prejudicial impressions registered by the introduction of evidence concerning prior dissociated criminal conduct of the defendant, the decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

The purpose of the Act is to insure that the defendant in a murder case will be tried on the issue of his guilt or innocence of the crime charged, free from any possible prejudicial effect which might arise from the introduction in evidence of his past unrelated criminal record. This was to be achieved by postponing the introduction of such record in evidence until after the jury has determined, in case it did so, that he is guilty of murder in the first degree. That is what the Act of 1959 was intended to effect and that is what it has accomplished.</p>

It is plain enough that the subject of evidence is not only not “clearly expressed” in tbe Act’s title, as required by Article III, §3, of tbe State Constitution, but it is not even hinted at. Tbe title in full reads as follows: “An Act Amending tbe act of June 24, 1939 (P.

All that tbe amendment was designed to effect was to change tbe <em>method </em>for determining tbe penalty by having tbe evidence of tbe defendant’s prior convictions for unassociated crimes excluded at trial until tbe jury’s verdict on tbe question of tbe defendant’s guilt or innocence was rendered and, upon tbe jury’s finding tbe defendant guilty of murder in tbe first degree, tbe evidence of bis prior convictions would then be offered as an aid to tbe jury in fixing tbe penalty.</p>

But, such is, in reality, the clear meaning of the language employed by the legislature. The Act provides that “After such verdict [guilty of murder in the first degree] is recorded and before the jury is permitted to separate, the court shall proceed to receive such additional evidence not previously received in the trial as may be relevant and admissible upon the question of the penalty to be imposed upon the defendant. . . .” The “additional evidence”, contemplated by the statute, is such as, prior to the passage of the Act, would have been received during the trial of the issue of the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charge of murder.</p>

As to that, the appellant makes no objection. What he does complain of is that the district attorney called the victim of the unassociated prior robbery and had him relate the circumstances attending its perpetration and the force and violence to which the defendant had subjected him in the course of the robbery. This testimony was, of course, improper and should not have been admitted. The introduction of such evidence, if approved, would lead to the injection of collateral and diverting issues, and be bound to produce confusion which could deprive an accused of the orderly trial to which he is entitled and which the Commonwealth should be alert to assure him.</p>

As testified to by the two close-up witnesses at the scene of the crime, both employees of the store, viz., Marie Lawson, the bookkeeper, and Grace Capasso, typist-clerk, Sabelli, who had just entered the store from the rear, seeing what was going on, had raised his hands in surrender, inquiring “What is this, a holdup?” when McCoy, without provocation of any kind, aimed his gun at 'Sabelli’s face and shot him at a range of about 18 inches, killing him “without a chance,” as the eyewitnesses testified. It would require a stretch of the imagination beyond all reason to say that the testimony of the victim of the prior unassociated robbery played any essential part in the fixing of the penalty by a jury which had just heard all of the Commonwealth’s evidence against the defend<a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>ant at the trial on the question of his guilt or innocence of the murder and which had found him guilty of that murder in the first degree.

The appellant now assigns this as error on the attenuated theory that the instruction “could only suggest to the jury that if life imprisonment were the punishment, the defendant might be returned to society before the expiration of his natural life.” The contention is as fanciful as it is specious.</p>

    <p id="b72-4" data-blocks='[["BL_72.4",72,[256,444,1150,818]]]'>It requires no “stretch” of my “imagination” whatsoever to say that the testimony of the victim of the prior unassociated robbery played an essential part in the fixing of the penalty by the jury in the present case. Such testimony is so foreign to my concept of due process and fair play that I cannot gloss over it by dismissing it with the questionable phrase “harmless error.” In fact, the whole proceeding indulged in by the Commonwealth in the fixing of the penalty under the “Split-Verdict Act” was erroneous and deprived the defendant of the proper hearing to which he was entitled. Under the circumstances I would treat the errors as if the jury had not been able to arrive at a decision as to the penalty, and would impose life imprisonment as provided for in the Act.</p>
