Appellant and her daughter were seated on a long seat located lengthwise in the extreme right front portion of the streetcar. According to appellant, the streetcar ride was "rough” and the car "was jerking just as though he [the motorman] was playing with the pedal” and, as the streetcar approached the so-called Bloomfield stop, passengers expecting to alight at that stop came forward and “he [the motorman] jerked that streetcar again” and a man, standing near where appellant was seated, was thrown off balance by the jolt and "the heel of his foot just stomped right down on the great toe of [appellant’s] left foot” causing severe injuries.

    <p id="AL7" data-blocks='[["BL_379.8",379,[94,1106,1156,918]]]'>On January 28, 1957, the motorman of the Pittsburgh Railways Company streetcar involved in this litigation, who was apparently angry with himself and the world in general, picked up passengers on the north-side of Pittsburgh and then furiously headed across the Allegheny River into downtown Pittsburgh and out to Bloomfield. His speed was such that from time to time the trolley pole jumped the overhead high voltage wire, whereupon he would jerk the car to a stop, leap off to re-engage the trolley, swearing all the while and intermixing with his profanity a variety of indelicate and indecent phrases. As he bounded over the rails he applied the power in fits and starts as if playing the pedals of a pipe organ and thereby shaking up the passengers to such a degree that one of them exclaimed: “This is the roughest ride we have ever had.” Other passengers described the rough trip as a “terrible ride.”</p>
    <p id="At8" data-blocks='[["BL_379.9",379,[94,2030,1150,317]]]'>As the car approached the Bloomfield stop, the motorman slowed down and the alighting passengers prepared to disembark.

    <p id="b380-3" data-blocks='[["BL_380.3",380,[281,332,1146,259]]]'>

    <p id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[275,611,1151,584]]]'>Still another passenger, a large, heavy six-foot gentleman, went into an involuntary jig to maintain equilibrium and balance. He executed a few steps backwards and then eventually braked his anticipatory fall by anchoring one foot firmly to what he thought was the floor. It turned out to be the foot of another passenger. The weight of his body and the violence with which he bore down fractured the big toe of the left foot of the startled passenger, who is the plaintiff in this lawsuit which terminated with a jolt in the court below in a court-imposed nonsuit.</p>
    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[268,1216,1153,637]]]'>This Court has affirmed that nonsuit in an opinion which would suggest that the Court assumes that the ride of the momentous streetcar was as smooth and tranquil as that of a gondola moving over the Grand Canal of Venice. The Majority Opinion states: “An examination of the testimony produced by appellant fails to show that the movement of this streetcar was so unusual and extraordinary as to be beyond the reasonable anticipation of the passengers therein and it is clear that the evidence falls far short of the standard of proof required to fasten liability upon appellee [the streetcar company].”</p>

Are they to foresee that an angry and mysteriously infuriated motor' man will do a dance on the power pedal?

Even the attorney for the streetcar company admitted the jolt, of which the plaintiff complains, was a <em>“violent </em>jolt.” Is violence now so much a part of our daily existence that it no longer arouses surprise and cannot stir the law into enforcing redress for injuries suffered as the result of violence?</p>
    <p id="b381-3" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[120,838,1153,917]]]'>The personal characteristics of the motorman in this case would have no bearing, generally speaking, on the manner in which he operated his car. However, since the whole streetcar was under his absolute domination and control, his conduct may help the legal observer to determine whether he did operate the car in a manner to cause the results suffered by the plaintiff. In describing the motorman, the plaintiff employed a phraseology of her own which would not be without meaning to the jury. She said that the motorman was “snotty.” The dictionary defines this colloquial and slangy word as meaning contemptible, dirty, offensive, nasty, snooty, offish and supercilious. A motorman who could be nasty and snooty would be just the kind of a motorman who would slam on his brakes and precipitately throw on his power regardless of what happened to his passengers.</p>

The dictionary defines “snippy” as being short-tempered, tart, and snappish. It would not be too much to assume that a motorman who is nasty, snooty, snappish, short-tempered, and supercilious would be just the kind of motorman who would operate his car with such angry abandon and unconcern over the safety of his passengers that he would lose his trolley three or four <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>times in a short run and then slam on his brakes with such instantaneous violence as to produce the toe-smashing event heretofore narrated.</p>

The motorman acknowledged the signal and began to slow down. As the plaintiff, however, rose from his seat and took hold of the handle of the door, the motorman suddenly increased the speed of the car, causing the plaintiff to be thrown to the platform. Verdict for the plaintiff was sustained.</p>

The Superior Court affirmed the verdict, stating: “In this connection there can be no doubt that proof of the sudden and unusual jolt in the operation of the bus made out a prima facie case and raised a presumption of negligence. This is the law even in street car cases. ... A carrier is bound to exercise the highest practical degree <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>of care, and if a passenger is injured as the result of the manner of operation of the carrier, the burden is upon the carrier to show that the injury could not have been prevented by such care.”</p>
