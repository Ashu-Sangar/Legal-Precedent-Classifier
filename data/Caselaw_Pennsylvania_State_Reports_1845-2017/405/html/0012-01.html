In answer to the contention of the corporation that service was invalid since the alleged negligent act occurred in Oregon and there was no . act cognizable, by the statute occurring in Pennsylvania, Chief Judge Biggs, after concluding that the Pennsylvania legislature, did not intend to abandon the line of authority which localizes the tort to the place where the 'cause of action arose, stated (p. 374) : “We-must conclude, in the absence of legislative history to the contrary, that it was the intent of the Pennsylvania Legislature to regard an injury flowing from the careless manufacture of an instrumentality as the <em>act </em>veritably contemplated by subsection B [citing cases and authority]. To place the narrow construction on the amendments sought by [the foreign corporation] would defeat their purpose.

This conflict-of-law rule disregards the law of the place of the negligent act or omission and, instead, uses the law of the place where the injury was sustained. The Pennsylvania legislature was no more bound by this conflict-of-law rule than the Congress of the United States was when it enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act (Act of June 25, 1948, c. 646, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Stat.%20933" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="62 Stat. 933">62 Stat. 933</a>, as. amended, 28 U.S.C., .§1346(b)), and, in disregard of the conflict-of-law rule, provided that the Government should be liable in accord with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.

The basis of the assumpsit action is that the Company breached certain implied warranties. The record reflects that the valve was manufactured by the Company in Illinois and sold in Illinois, approximately six years prior to the accident, to a New Jersey Corporation. Sometime later by some unknown party the valve was attached to the cylinder marked as the property of the Natural Gas Company of Philadelphia.
