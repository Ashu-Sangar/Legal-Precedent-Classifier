Following the taking of testimony and negotiations, a <em>consent decree </em>was entered which provided, inter alia: “. . .

Thereafter, on February 3, 1961, North Hills, not then a party to the proceedings, petitioned for a stay of execution and prayed for a rule on Universal to show cause why it, Universal, should not be required to accept the sum of $29,000 plus interest and costs in satisfaction of the judgment. Universal responded to the petition denying that North Hills had any standing to assail the execution and further alleging that, under the consent decree, Universal was free to proceed on its mortgage and was not required to accept the $29,000 in satisfaction thereof.</p>

This action of the court was premised on its conclusion that, under <em>Cochrane v. Szpahowski, </em><a href="/pa/355/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="355 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="468914" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0357-01">355 Pa. 357</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20692" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="49 A.2d 692">49 A. 2d </a><a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a><a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20692" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="49 A.2d 692">692</a>, it had the power to extend the time for performance provided in the consent decree and that under the authority of <em>Sinking Fund Commissioners of Phila. v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/324/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="324 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1171384" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0129-01">324 Pa. 129</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20314" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="188 A. 314">188 A. 314</a>, it had the power to modify the consent decree. Believing it possessed such power and concluding further that it would be unconscionable to permit Universal to receive a $40,-000 bonus where it had advanced but $18,978.95, the court modified the consent decree and required Universal to accept the compromise sum of $29,000 even though the time specified for payment in the decree had expired or passed. This order is the subject of Appeal No. 185.</p>
    <p id="b299-3" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[133,1066,1152,905]]]'>On the same date the court endorsed upon its order granting the rule on Universal to show cause why the judgment should not be opened, a notation to see the opinion and order filed in the matter of North Hills’ petition to stay the execution. The reason for this action of the court is explained in the court’s opinion: “The same facts are made the basis for relief in the latter petition, and the same reasons for granting or refusing the relief requested are equally applicable in the two matters. Since Shaler has now directly attached the judgment entered, the question as to whether or not North Hills is a proper party in interest is moot. The opinion disposing of the petition filed by North Hills will likewise determine the issues raised by Shaler.” Prom this somewhat informal order disposing of Shaler’s petition and rule, Universal has taken Appeal No. 227.</p>

    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.4",300,[253,601,1149,642]]]'>It has been stated that before one, not a party of record, can be heard to challenge the execution process issued on a judgment, he must obtain leave to become a party by application based, on sufficient grounds: <em>Lietha v. Hambersky, </em><a href="/pa-super/167/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="167 Pa. Super. 304" data-case-ids="470564" data-case-paths="/pa-super/167/0304-01">167 Pa.

It is obvious that this procedure was not followed in the instant case. However, the record does reveal that North Hills was permitted to intervene nunc pro tunc, and while we do not approve of such practice, the facts reveal that North Hills did have an interest in the subject matter and also that the judgment had been attacked directly by Shaler.</p>
    <p id="b300-5" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[253,1255,1146,94]]]'>Under these facts and circumstances we find no reversible error in this respect.</p>
    <p id="b300-6" data-blocks='[["BL_300.6",300,[244,1367,1152,912]]]'>We turn now to Universal’s principal contention, i.e., that the court below had neither the power or authority to modify the consent decree. The consent decree provided that Universal was to have the right to proceed on its mortgage without further delay if the sum of $29,000 was not paid by Shaler within sixty days. The record reveals that, while the court below recognized that the $29,000 figure was a compromise sum and that as such the decree did not permanently fix the amount due Universal, it extended the time limit specified in the decree for the tender of payment. This extension granted by the court was based on its conclusion that (1) the parties or the court could have just as well inserted ninety days as sixty days in the original decree, and (2) that there was neither a manifestation or implication in the decree that time was of the essence. In this respect the court erred.</p>
    <p id="b301-2" data-blocks='[["BL_301.3",301,[125,326,1149,1028]]]'>
      <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>The consent decree in the instant case was, as the court below recognized, a compromise agreement. As such it bound Universal to accept the sum specified in satisfaction of the judgment <em>if payment were made within sixty days. </em>The fact that the parties or the court could or originally might have made the time limit ninety days rather than sixty days is immaterial — the contract and the agreement between the parties specified sixty days. The compromise agreement was the entire agreement of the parties and it was not divisible. It required satisfaction of the judgment not only upon payment of the $29,000 but also if, and only if, paid within the specified time. The time specified for payment was as integral and important a part of the compromise as was the specified amount. Examined in this light it becomes evident that time was of the essence of the agreement and the court had no power to extend it. Indeed, the court had no power or authority to modify the consent decree in any manner.</p>
    <p id="b301-3" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[124,1364,1149,316]]]'>Neither the provisions of Pa. R. C. P. 3183(c), which permits the court in an order staying execution to impose such terms or conditions as it deems appropriate nor the general or inherent powers of a court to control its process confer authority upon a court to modify a consent decree.</p>
    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[123,1692,1151,531]]]'>A consent decree is not a legal determination by the court of the matters in controversy but is merely an agreement between the parties — a contract binding the parties thereto to the terms thereof: <em>Dulles v. Dulles, </em><a href="/pa/369/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="369 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1232380" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0101-01">369 Pa. 101</a>, 107, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20134" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="85 A.2d 134">85 A. 2d 134</a>. As a contract, the court, in the absence of fraud, accident or mistake, had neither the power nor the authority to modify or vary the terms set forth.

Subsequently a consent decree was entered providing for a private sale of the <em>assets </em>of the partnership. Plaiutiff, outbidding the defendant, then purchased the partnership assets at the sale. Defendant then petitioned to set the sale aside on the grounds that there was a misunderstanding as to the terms of the sale — contending, in this regard, that he understood that the purchaser was to assume the liabilities of the partnership. The lower court set aside the sale and ordered a resale in which the purchaser would assume the liabilities of the partnership. On plaintiff’s appeal, following the court’s refusal to set aside its order for a resale, this Court declared that the consent decree was a contract which provided for the sale of the assets and not the liabilities, and that, after the sale, title was to be passed “without further order of court”, and that the court below was without authority to set aside the sale and modify the decree agreed to by the parties and approved by the court itself.</p>
    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[234,1409,1151,582]]]'>North Hills seeks to distinguish <em>Buffington </em>on the ground that there the petition was not filed until after the sale was completed and urges that, if the petition had been filed prior to the sale, the result might have been different. The error in this contention is that the determination in <em>Buffington </em>was premised upon the fact that this decree was a contract. It was the same contract before and after the sale. We see nothing to merit the assumption that, if the petition had been filed prior to the sale, the court would have modified the decree.</p>

First, in that case the court did not in fact modify the decree and, second, it erroneously analogized the right of a court to modify a consent decree with the right of a court to open judgment. This is <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>not the law in Pennsylvania. Cf: <em>Winter v.
