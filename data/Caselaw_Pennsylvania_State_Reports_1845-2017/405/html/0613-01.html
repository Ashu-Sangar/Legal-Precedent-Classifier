However, plaintiff overlooks, inter alia, the fact that the Martins might recover a verdict against Dykes in excess of the limits of plaintiff’s policy, in which case the right of either of the Martins to recover from the defendant would not be precluded by any decision rendered in this case where they are not parties, (2) plaintiff or defendant might become <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>bankrupt, or (3) the Martins might elect to sue either insurance company.</p>
