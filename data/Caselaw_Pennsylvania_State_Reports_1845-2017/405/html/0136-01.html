They were also variously indicted for conspiracy to extort and extortion, of which charges they were acquitted at their criminal trial. They were then given a hearing by the Civil Service Commission, and no one contends that this hearing lacked due process or that the Commission lacked jurisdiction. The Commission upheld the Police Commissioner and dismissed the officers’ appeals. They then appealed to the court below, which reversed the decision of the Civil Service Commission and ordered the men restored to duty with full pay. The City has appealed.</p>

To the contrary, the City’s complaint is that the court went beyond them and considered the merits. This is what the court said: “In our view of the record, a grave jurisdictional question is involved. The Civil Service Commission patently failed to assume and carry out its responsibility of reviewing the case and deciding it upon the facts disclosed by the testimony before it. Instead, it based its decision upon the opinion of the appointing power as to the credibility of the sole accusing witness. It ascribed no weight to the jury’s verdict of not guilty; it did not consider the effect of the voluminous reputation testimony; on the contrary it constituted itself an appellate body to reverse the action of the jury. If the Civil Service Commission had found appellants guilty upon any one or more of the other charges filed against them, its action might be unimpeachable. But it forfeited and surrendered its jurisdiction to hear and decide the appeals on the merits as disclosed before it. Such a disposition of appeals is completely destructive of the letter and the spirit of civil service, and is an abandonment of merit employees to the whim of the appointing power, who may, by reason of physical infirmity, emotional distress, personal animosity, or other legally insufficient reason, he totally incapable of forming a calm, deliberate and fair judgment.</p>

    <p id="b176-4" data-blocks='[["BL_176.4",176,[250,877,1148,199]]]'>Merely calling such matters jurisdictional and procedural does not make them so. It is obvious from simply reading the above portions of the court’s opinion that it considered the merits.</p>
    <p id="b176-5" data-blocks='[["BL_176.5",176,[246,1097,1148,362]]]'>Even if the foregoing were not so, there could not possibly be error in failing to take into account the outcome of the criminal trial or the character testimony produced there. The levels of proof of guilt are quite different: <em>Caldwell v.

If the Commission overrules the appeal of the employe, it shall confirm the action of the appointing authority which shall be final as of the date it was taken.”</p>

She testified that Mr. Stein, a business associate and friend, told her that the appellants had demanded $200 to <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>‘save her license’. She testified that she placed $200 in an envelope and met the appellants and Mr. Stein at the police headquarters at 19th and Oxford Streets on July 5, 1958, where she gave the envelope to Mr. Stein who in turn dropped it into appellant Deal’s lap. She testified that Deal then put the envelope in his pocket. Other than the appellants’ denials there is nothing in the record that directly refutes this testimony.</p>
    <p id="b177-4" data-blocks='[["BL_177.5",177,[121,770,1150,588]]]'>“We are charged solely with deciding whether or not the appointing authority, after considering all the relevant facts, had just cause to dismiss these appellants and did not act arbitrarily or capriciously. This has been the policy forming the basis of all our decisions in disciplinary matters. Since we cannot say that the Police Commissioner did not have just cause to dismiss appellants if he believed Mrs. Jaron’s statements we are compelled to sustain his action and, therefore, we deny the appeals, sustain the dismissals and so certify to the Personnel Director.”</p>
    <p id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.6",177,[121,1377,1152,815]]]'>While this is not as incisive an adjudication as one might like, under the Act of June 4, 1945, supra, (71 PS §1710.34), which requires adjudications to contain findings and reasons, we regard it as tantamount to saying that Mrs. Jaron’s evidence was competent for the appointing authority to pass upon and, if believed, to act upon. Appellees complain that a telephone call, which was ruled out at the hearing, forms the basis for the sentence in the opinion above: “She testified that Mr. Stein . . . told her that the appellants had demanded $200 to ‘save her license’.” That is true enough, but if such use of excluded testimony was error it was harmless, since there is ample evidence, not objected to, of what was done when Mrs. Jaron and Stein reached the police station and handed over the money.</p>

There <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>is no balm of Gilead in it for them, for the factual position is utterly different. We said there, at page 541: “We are not here reviewing a case where an administrative tribunal merely received some evidence which was hearsay but a case where evidence was secretly received and acted upon in clear defiance of the requirements of the statute. ... A hearing necessarily requires notice and an opportunity to defend.”</p>
    <p id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[255,760,1149,482]]]'>The appellees’ final position is that the Commission failed to consider certain evidence properly of record, namely, their evidence. Not mentioning it and not considering it are different things, and saying that there was nothing in the record that refuted Mrs. Jaron’s evidence means that the Commission either did not regard it as refutational or didn’t believe it outright. These are not matters for the court below or this court to pass upon on narrow certiorari.</p>
