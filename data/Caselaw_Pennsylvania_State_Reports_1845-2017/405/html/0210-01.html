Expressed in other words, defendant’s principal contention is that he borrowed the gun and the shell to shoot squirrels, and that he was so goaded and blinded by his wife’s heartless insulting remark that he shot her without fully realizing whether he was shooting at her or over her head and without intending to kill her. He conveniently forgets (1) his prior threats to kill his wife, (2) several of his incriminating confessions, (B) that he admitted on cross-examination that shortly before the murder he said to his wife’s sister Grace “ ‘If I had the guts I’d shoot Blanche,’ or something pertaining to that”, and (4) that actions often speak louder than words.</p>

He described his examination as “Listening to him, watching his mannerisms, watching his affect, his no sense of feeling when he described anything connected with love or death, his behavior, his running away pattern.
