The lower Court held, “that on the death of the testator an equal and therefore one-half remainder interest in the trust established by his will vested in Minnie B.

Under this language, testator’s brother and sister took a vested interest at testator’s death and if testator had used the same language in the Fifth paragraph his brother and sister would have taken a vested interest at his death, even though their possession and enjoyment was postponed until the death of the last surviving life tenant. We believe it is clear that when testator used different words of gift, namely, “equally to my brother and sister <em>or </em>their heirs”, he meant and intended to create a different gift.</p>

It is reasonable to believe — indeed it is almost a certainty — that testator believed his brother and sister would <em>not </em>survive <em>all </em>of these 5 young life tenants, and he therefore meant and intended his gift of the principal of his residuary estate to “. . . <em>or </em>their heirs”, to be an alternative substitutionary gift to the heirs of his brother and sister as purchasers, using his brother and sister as the line of inheritance, with the heirs of testator’s brother taking one-half of the residuary principal through the brother’s line, and the heirs of testator’s sister taking a one-half share through her line.</p>
