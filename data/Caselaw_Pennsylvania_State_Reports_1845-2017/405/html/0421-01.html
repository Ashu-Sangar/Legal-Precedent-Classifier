The board of assessors followed this policy. The lower court ruled this to be correct. As a result, foundations supporting, and structures enclosing, coal bins, conveyor systems, magnetic separators, bucket line elevators, coke ovens, blast furnaces, convertors and other similar heavy machinery incident to a steel mill, as well as the machinery itself, were classified as excluded from real estate taxation. Hence, the substantial reduction in the assessed valuation. The basic reasoning was that the foundations and structures were vital and necessary to the operation of the machinery; that they constituted an integral part thereof and added nothing to the value of the real estate itself, regardless of the fact that, in most instances, the structure and foundations were permanently affixed to the land and could not be removed without material damage thereto.</p>

We stated at 385, “That, has been found impracticable, no rule at all, and has, therefore, long since been abandoned.” Again in <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Philadelphia, </em>supra, at 108, 109, we said, “The criteria that nothing is machinery unless it ‘applies force or involves the quality of motion’ and that anything in which chemical processes take place even though these processes are mechanically induced cannot be adjudged machinery, is likewise not adapted ‘to the business and improvements of the age.’ ” Similarly, in our opinion, a criteria that says nothing is “machinery, tools, appliances and other equipment” but is real estate because the said object requires a massive foundation to prevent vibration caused by its operation and an enclosure to prevent deterioration, is a totally unrealistic view and cannot be imputed to the legislature’s intention in enacting the amendments of 1953. As stated by all of the experts for both sides and correctly found by the lower court, the foundations and structures in question are absolutely essential integral parts of each machine, appliance or piece of equipment, without which its operation would be rendered impossible. In short, it is all one and the same.</p>

Today most states and communities in this country are engaged in a fight to encourage new industry to move into that state or community and to retain the industries they already have. In the early 1940’s many Pennsylvania communities, such as the City <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>of Scranton, founded nonprofit corporations to achieve the before-mentioned purposes. Recently, the state government, through a newly formed Pennsylvania Industrial Development Corporation, has delved into this expanding tussle over jobs and industry by granting loans to the community corporations to aid them in this fight. It is obvious that the legislature was aware of these activities since it has been appropriating large sums of money to the industrial development corporation. But the legislature also realized that building new factories at low interest rates wasn’t enough to compete with other states which also offer low tax rates to industry, and therefore, it gave needed tax relief to industry in Pennsylvania. This effort has taken several forms: (a) For example, corporations organized for manufacturing purposes were declared exempt from the annual tax on their capital stock: Capital Stock Tax Act of June 1, 1889, P. L. 420, §21, as amended, March 15, 1956, P. L. (1955) 1285, §1, 72 PS §1871; (b) Again, no taxes have been permitted under the general mercantile tax “on any privilege, act or transaction related to the business of manufacturing . . . .” Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145, §1, 53 PS §6851; (c) Again, in 1911, “machinery of all kinds” was excluded from real estate taxation in Pittsburgh.. Act of May 12,1911, P. L. 287, §1, 53 PS §23104; (d) In 1915, a similar exclusion was passed to exclude from taxation in Philadelphia County “the machinery and tools used in manufacturing in any mill or manufactory.” Act of June 3, 1915, P. L. 787, No. 346, §1, 53 PS §15976; (e) and finally, the 1953 amendments to The Fourth to Eighth Class County Assessment Law. As we stated in interpreting the Act of June 3, 1915, in <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Philadelphia, </em>supra, at 119, “Article IV, section 51, of the Statutory Construction Act states that ‘the intention of the Legislature may be ascertained by considering, among other matters — (1); (2); (3); <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>(4) the object to be attained.’ The ‘object’ of the Act of 1915 was to attract to this state manufactories and to retain those whose owners might be tempted to move them to states with more liberal tax policies.” Therefore, it is self-evident from a study of the history of tax legislation in Pennsylvania that the “object to be obtained” by the 1953 amendments was to provide tax relief for Pennsylvania industries by removing all integrated “machinery, tools, appliances and other equipment” from the real estate tax.</p>
    <p id="b467-4" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[100,867,1150,754]]]'>The Act of 1915, supra, construed in <em>Gulf Oil Corporation v.

As pointed out before, in the latter act “machinery . . . used in manufacturing” were the key words, while in the 1953 amendment, “machinery, tools, appliances and other equipment contained in any . . . industrial establishment” are the words in question. The legislature was obviously aware of this Court’s decision interpreting the word “machinery” in the Act of 1915. See, <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Phil</em>adelphia., supra. “In ascertaining the intention of the Legislature in the enactment of a law, the courts may be guided by the following presumptions among others: . . .

IX, § §1 and 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution in that they exempt property from taxation and permit lack of uniformity in taxation. The pertinent part of Section 1 provides: “All taxes shall be uniform, upon the <em>same </em>class<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">7</a> of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax . . . .” Section 2 provides: “All laws exempting<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">8</a> property from taxation, other than the property above enumerated shall be void.”</p>
    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[130,1056,1150,805]]]'>What is overlooked in this argument is that the Act of 1953 doesn’t create an <em>exemption </em>but creates an <em>exclusion </em>— that being excluded is the concept of the assembled industrial plant doctrine as a determining factor in The Fourth to Eighth Class County Assessment Law. The legislature clearly stated that it was creating an exclusion. The Act of July 17, 1953, P. L. 455, states that these items “shall not be considered or included.” The Act of July 28, 1953, P. L. 703, states that the “exclusion<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">9</a> of such machinery, tools, appliances and other equipment . . . shall be postponed . . . .” Therefore, it is obvious that the legislature, by this act, merely moved “machinery, tools, appliances and other equipment”, which had by judicial interpretation been classified with real estate, into a separate class.</p>

Classification for the purpose of taxation may be based on the existence of differences recognized in the business world, on the want of adaptability of the subjects to the same method of taxation, upon the impracticability of applying to them the same methods so as to produce justice and reasonably uniform results, or upon well grounded considerations of public policy.

In the aforesaid case the Supreme Court quoted with approval from White on the Constitution of Pennsylvania, p. 379-380, as follows: ‘In short, the Constitution having delegated to the legislature the power to classify persons and property for purposes of taxation it may select any reasonable basis upon which to make the classification, and may create as many classes as it may in its discretion decide upon, subject always to the limitation that it must exercise good faith and must not make arbitrary and unjust distinctions.’ ” Then, at 537, Judge Wood side summarized some recognized distinctions in taxation as follows: “It was argued that land is land, ice is ice, gas is gas and coal is coal, but the legislature was permitted to tax differently seated and unseated land, natural ice and artificial ice, natural gas and manufactured gas, anthracite coal and bituminous coal.
