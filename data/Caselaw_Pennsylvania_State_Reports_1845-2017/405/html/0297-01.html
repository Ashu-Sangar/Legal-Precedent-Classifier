    <p id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.6",335,[104,1428,1151,804]]]'>The Institute began to acquire its present property in the year 1912. It consists of approximately 420 acres, including 175 acres of cultivated farm land, and 120 acres of timberland. All of the farm work is performed by students of the Institute and its personnel. The farm products are used principally to provide maintenance for students and others associated in the work of the Institute. A portion is used to supplement the maintenance of the Buelah Home, Bellevue, Pennsylvania, a residence for returned missionaries. Buildings, including men’s and women’s dormitories, an administration building and a chapel are erected on a portion of the land and consume the use of approximately 10 acres. Construction of other facilities is contemplated in the future.</p>

Therein the following definition was approved: “ ‘A charity, in the legal sense, may be more fully defined as a gift, to be applied consistently with existing laws, for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons, either by bringing their minds or hearts under the influence of education or religion, by relieving their bodies from disease, suffering or constraint, by assisting them to establish themselves in life, or by erecting or maintaining public buildings or works or otherwise lessening the burdens of government.’ ’’Again at page 25, the Court said: “ ‘ “The word ‘charitable’, in a legal sense, includes every gift for a general public use, to be applied, consistent with existing laws, for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons, and designed to benefit them from an educational, religious, moral, physical or social standpoint. In its broadest meaning it is understood ‘to refer to something done or given for the benefit of our fellows or the public.’ ”: Taylor v.

There is no fixed standard to determine what purposes are of such social interest to the community ; the interests of the community vary with time and place. ... As to what other purposes are of such interest to the community as to be charitable, no definite rule can be laid down.” ’: Restatement, Trusts, §368, comment b.” ’ ” Also on page 26, the Court said: “The word ‘purely’ as used in the Constitution in the phrase ‘purely public charity’ means that the institution must be entirely free from private profit motive. In The Burd Orphan Asylum v. The School District, supra, we said, p. 35: ‘ “. . . when the charity is public, the exclusion of all idea of private gain or profit is equivalent in effect to the force of ‘purely,’ as applied to public charity in the constitution.” ’ ” See also, <em>West Indies Mission Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/387/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="387 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="1270980" data-case-paths="/pa/387/0534-01">387 Pa. 534</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20A.2d%20773" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="128 A.2d 773">128 A. 2d 773</a> (1957) and <em>Salvation Army v.
