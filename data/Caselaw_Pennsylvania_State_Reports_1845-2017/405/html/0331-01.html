About a year before the minor’s eighteenth birthday, her guardian was notified by the Veterans’ Administration and Social Security Administration that all benefits payable in her behalf by those agencies would cease as of her eighteenth birthday. The guardian, Pittsburgh National Bank, appealed from this decision to the agencies involved. Counsel was engaged to press the claims of the ward. The appeals were successful. and counsel charged a fee of $1100 for his services. The guardian paid the amount, but at the audit of its account in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County the Veterans’ Administration, as an interested party under the Act of April 24, 1929, P. L. 647, 20 PS §788, filed exceptions to payment of the $1100 fee, asserting that the maximum amount payable to attorneys in the circumstances indicated was $10, as specified by the Act of Congress of September 2, 1958, P. L. 85-857, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20Stat.%201238" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="72 Stat. 1238">72 Stat. 1238</a>-1239, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A73404" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="38 U.S.C. §§3404">38 U.S.C.A. §§3404</a>, 3405.</p>
    <p id="b368-5" data-blocks='[["BL_368.8",368,[233,1524,1146,258]]]'>The Court sustained the position of the Veterans’ Administration and surcharged the guardian in the amount of $1090, giving the guardian credit for the $10 allowed by the Act of Congress. The guardian appealed.</p>
    <p id="b368-6" data-blocks='[["BL_368.9",368,[229,1804,1162,530]],["BL_369.1",369,[92,329,1149,210]]]'>Section 3404 of the Act of 1958 above referred to provides in part: “(a) The administrator may recognize any individual as an agent or attorney for the. preparation, presentation, and prosecution of claims under laws administered by the Veterans’ Administration . .'. (c) The Administrator shall determine and pay fees to agents or attorneys recognized under this section, in allowed claims for monetary benefits under laws administered by the Veterans’ Administration. Such fees (1) shall be determined and paid as pre<a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>gcribed by the Administrator; (2) <em>shall not exceed $10 with respect to any one claim; </em>and (3) shall be deducted from monetary benefits claimed and allowed.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.4",369,[91,550,1150,755]]]'>The appellant contends that this statutory provision was not binding on counsel because he did not apply to be recognized under Section 3404 and that, therefore, not being recognized, the limitation under (c) (2) cannot influence his standing. The interpretation asked for by counsel would lead to the absurdity that attorneys not formally recognized could obtain a greater amount of compensation than those recognized by the Veterans’ Administration. This would mean that by remaining without the walls of protection erected for the disabled veteran, one could obtain a larger fee than those who enter by the gate and submit themselves to Congressional regulation and direction. Certainly Congress never intended such stultification.</p>
    <p id="b369-5" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[90,1315,1150,260]]]'>Nor could the effect of the Congressional Act under consideration be avoided by the fact that counsel employed “the services of the Disabled American Veterans’ representative to conduct the questioning at the Veterans’ Administration hearing.”</p>

But, without attributing any moral or ethical impropriety to counsel, it is clear that the circuitous route followed by counsel did not achieve the result desired, because the statute prohibits such circuity. Section 3405 provides that: <em>“Whoever </em>(1) directly or indirectly solicits, contracts for, charges, or receives, or attempts to solicit, contract for, charge, or receive, <em>any fee or compensation except as provided in sections 8404 or 784 of this title . </em>. . shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned at hard labor for not more than two years, or both.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

The appellant argues that counsel could have been paid from moneys other than those obtained through his efforts in the Veterans’ Administration. In support of this contention counsel cites a lower Court’s decision <em>(Taggart Estate, </em>11 Fiduc. Rep. 271), where the court held that money once paid over to the state-appointed guardian has “inured wholly to the benefit of the guardian,” and, after having been invested by him, “lost the impress of government money.”</p>

While, of course, government money does not retain its individuality forever and cannot, unlike the Gulf Stream, be traced at all times across the vast ocean of daily preoccupations, neither can it be said that the wallet of protection within which the money is handed to the beneficiary disintegrates immediately after it leaves the hands of the government agent. What an attorney may not charge (because of statutory prohibition) while the fund is still in the treasury of the United States he. may not collect the moment the money reaches the pocket of the beneficiary. It is to be noted that subsection (c) contains no limitation such as that, contended for. It provides that “The Administrator shall determine and pay fees to agents or attorneys” and that “Such fees . . . shall not exceed flO with respect to any one claim . . .”. It does not say that such fees <em>from the amount received </em>shall not exceed flO or that the Administrator shall determine and pay fees <em>from the fund received. </em>In construing the public pur<a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>pose of the Act, we may not interpret it to have limitations which are clearly not there and certainly not intended, having in view the obviously broad humanitarian purposes of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b371-4" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[89,562,1150,415]]]'>While it would seem to be unquestioned that counsel’s efforts in this case brought good results to the ward, and that those efforts in the open forum of wholesome professional activity would entitle him to a fee exceeding $10, we are here concerned not with the reasonable value of an attorney’s services but with an Act of Congress which definitively spells out what the fee shall be.</p>

S. 85</a>, the Supreme Court of the United States passed upon Section 500 of the World War Veterans’ Act which also contained a limit of $10 for counsel fee, as provided in the Act of 1958. The attorney there performed valuable services for the guardian of an insane veteran and he was paid $1500 by the guardian. The Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs protested the payment of this fee and the ensuing litigation reached the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the fee could not exceed $10: “The history of section 500 manifests beyond doubt the clear establishment of a public policy against the payment of fees for prosecution of veterans’ claims in excess of those fixed by statute. <em>Collection of a greater fee than that fixed in the statute is made a crime, and this Court has sustained a conviction under the statute. </em>Contracts for the colléction of fees in excess of valid statutory limitations and for services validly prohibited by statute cannot stand, <em>whether made with a competent veteran or the guardian of an incompetent veteran. Nor can any court having jurisdiction over an incompetent award a fee in violation of a valid statute. Congress clearly intended to protect all veterans, competent and incompetent, in all courts, state and federal, against the imposition or payment </em>

At the oral argument, however, counsel said that the <em>Lowery </em>and the <em>Stein </em>cases were contradictory of each other and that it wa.s up to this Court to decide which of these two authorities to follow. We do not see that the decision is a matter of seesawing between <em>Hines v. Lowery </em>and <em>Hines v. Stein. </em>These cases not only individually cover different sets of circumstances but where they meet in a common circle of comparison the Supreme Court in the <em>Lowery </em>case specifically distinguishes <em>Stein </em>from <em>Lowery </em>as follows: ''Respondent seeks to sustain the $1,500 fee upon the theory that the general power of the New <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>York court to fix fees for services rendered an incompetent under that court’s jurisdiction is not subject to the limitation of $10 for fees as provided in section 500.
