It turned out to be John Simon, the appellant in this case. The telltale hóód was found on his person. Police investigation, plus investigation by victims pointed quite specifically to him as the person responsible for the Overbrook crimes. He was taken before a magistrate for a preliminary hearing and eventually was brought to court for trial.</p>

After a full hearing, the petition was discharged. At that hearing it developed that the asserted rape of Janet Major had not been consummated. The charge was accordingly changed to <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>attempted rape and the sentence on the covering indictment was reduced from 3-6 years to 2%-5 years.</p>

    <p id="b600-6" data-blocks='[["BL_600.6",600,[240,1153,1151,468]]]'>Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution guarantees to every accused the right to counsel. In capital cases this provision is mandatory. Whether the defendant desires or does not desire to be represented by counsel, an attorney must be provided in murder cases. However, where noncapital charges are involved, the defendant himself determines whether he wishes to proceed without the benefit of a lawyer’s advice and assistance.</p>

It is true that decisions of this and of the Superior Court support this position, but such a view is not supportable if the facts in any particular case reveal that the circumstances surrounding the trial or hearing were such that the fundamentals of a fair trial were vitiated because of absence of counsel. For instance, if the defendant were deaf or blind, or otherwise so disabled that he could not adequately understand or follow the court proceedings, it would be a sheer mockery of law and justice to assume that he had had a fair trial in <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>the absence of counsel, even though he did not ask for one.</p>
    <p id="b601-3" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[98,445,1151,528]]]'>Constitutional guarantees are intended to achieve human justice and not merely to erect academic fences which may or may not keep out flagrant inequities which no civilized government would condone. Thus, it may not be argued that since the Constitution says only that the accused “hath a right to be heard by himself and his counsel,” the Commonwealth is not required to supply counsel where the circumstances dictate the need for an attorney, even if the defendant does not ask for one.</p>
    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[98,994,1151,1128]]]'>And that brings us to the crucial issue in this case. The defendant was not wholly a normal person, using the word <em>normal </em>not in the criminological sense (because it could be argued that every criminal is non-normal) but strictly from a mental point of view. A behavior clinic study made of the defendant shortly after his arrest revealed him to be a high grade moron with an intelligence quotient of 59. Counsel for the defendant therefore, argues in this appeal that since the defendant was young and of low mentality the absence of counsel constituted a denial of due process which entitles him to release from custody. In this connection he cites the case of <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Swieczkowski v. Burke, </em><a href="/pa-super/173/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="173 Pa. Super. 363" data-case-ids="1067207" data-case-paths="/pa-super/173/0363-01">173 Pa. Superior Ct. 363</a>, 366, where the Superior Court said: “Youth, lack of education, inexperience with the intricacies of criminal procedure, improper conduct on the part of the court or prosecuting officials, and the complicated nature of the offense charged may, in some combination, constitute the ‘ingredient of unfairness’ which renders the absence of counsel at sentencing a denial of due process.”</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.6",601,[103,2135,1148,208]],["BL_602.1",602,[257,335,1147,260]]]'>But the hypotheses enumerated in that case do not concatenate in the case at bar. There were no “intricacies of criminal procedure,” no “improper conduct on the part of the court or prosecuting officials,” and <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>nothing complicated about the charges of robbery and rape. We dismiss without comment the statement of defendant’s counsel at the oral argument that he (counsel) did not know the meaning of robbery and rape until he came to those subjects in law school!</p>
    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[244,616,1159,637]]]'>In the Federal criminal courts, the employment of counsel for defendants is imperative. By virtue of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, “counsel must be furnished to an indigent defendant ■prosecuted in a federal court in every case, whatever the circumstances.” <em>(Foster v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/332/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="332 U.S. 134" data-case-ids="365492" data-case-paths="/us/332/0134-01">332 U. S. 134</a>.) However, the Supreme Court of the United States held in that case, that “Prosecutions in State courts are not subject to this fixed requirement.” But there is this modification, “process of law in order to be ‘due’ does require that a State give a defendant ample opportunity to meet an accusation.”</p>
    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[249,1274,1147,313]]]'>What is the criterion for determination of “dueness” in process of law? Justice Frankfurter declared that if, because of absence of counsel, “an ingredient of unfairness actively operated in the process that resulted in his [the defendant’s] confinement,” then there; has been lack of due process.</p>
    <p id="b602-6" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[242,1607,1149,693]]]'>The touchstone, therefore, to apply in the case at bar is the rule of “ingredient of unfairness.” The Supreme Court said in the <em>Foster </em>case that the mere fact that the record did not show that the defendant had been offered the benefit of counsel did not of itself prove absence of due process: “We thus have in effect the bald claim that, merely because the record does not disclose an offer of counsel to a defendant upon a plea of guilty, although the court before accepting the plea duly advised him of his ‘rights of Trial’ and of the consequences of such a plea, he is ‘deprived of rights essential to a fair hearing under the Federal Constitution.’ . . . We reject such a claim.”</p>

      <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>Was there any “ingredient of unfairness” in the disposition of John Simon’s case on June 18, 1942? Although the behavior clinic report showed the 18-year-old defendant to have had a mental age of only nine at the time of the commission of the offenses imputed to him, this did not mean that in conducting himself in the exigencies of life he had only the mental and physical equipment of a nine-year-old child. As stated by the lower court: “while tests showed that Simon’s mental age was about nine years, we understand that a person with a chronological age of eighteen and a mental age of nine is a far different person from one both physically and mentally aged nine. The fund of knowledge and experiences acquired during the years increases the capabilities and understanding of such a person far beyond that of a nine year old child.

    <p id="b603-3" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[118,1268,1149,484]]]'>The transcript of the court hearing shows that Simon was entirely aware of what was taking place.

Do you understand what you have signed?” His reply was: “Yes, but I only had five.”</p>

Some of the victims of his violence were in court and described the manner in which he treated them. The judge who presided at the habeas corpus hearing was the same judge who presided when the defendant pleaded guilty. He said: “After reading the transcript here the writer of this opinion generally remembers the case, and is satisfied that the defendant not only knew he was in a courtroom but understood what was involved in the charges and that he was pleading guilty to them.”</p>

He related how he had been discharged from his job, but that he did not want his mother to know this. Since he would have to display money in order to carry out the appearance that he was still gainfully employed, he resorted to robbing and stealing to get the money which he could pass off as wages.</p>

The description of this procedure was given by the assistant district attorney who had been on duty in 1942, and his testimony was not controverted. Moreover, the defendant himself admitted that one of his fellow-prisoners <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>had told him the court would appoint an attorney to represent him, but he did not request an attorney.</p>

When he appeared before the behavior clinic he related in detail the manner in which he accomplished his numerous offenses. At the hearing in court he voluntarily signed the pleas of guilty.

Nor does the record suggest any inability on the part of the defendant to understand the long series of questions put to him in direct and cross-examination.

No one can read the transcript of the record without concluding that Simon’s story was manufactured in the laboratory of desperation and embellished in the workshop of self-gain. In the first place, there was no written confession in the case. In the second place, the spuriousness of the beating story vividly proclaims itself in the fact that Simon waited eighteen years before making the charge of police brutality. The only description he could give of the police who were supposed to have beaten him was that one was a “big fat guy” and the other “wore a straw hat.” Common sense repels and fundamental logic rejects the proposition that one hurt by the police in the manner stated by the defendant would not at once tell what had happened at the first opportunity to do so.

This clinic, after a psychiatric, psychological, physical and social study of John Simon, submitted to Judge McNaugher a 25-page report in which it recommended: “Inasmuch as we feel that he is a potentially dangerous individual and will repeat similar offenses in the future, we would recommend prolonged or indefinite institutionalization such as the School for Defective Delinquents at Huntingdon.

In the <em>Uveges </em>case the relator petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus and was <em>denied </em>a hearing. In the <em>Simon </em>case the petitioner received not one but two hearings on the identical issue. At the second hearing in this case the Commonwealth could have pleaded res judicata but, out of an excess of con<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>sideration for the defendant, did not do so. In the <em>Uveges </em>case the petitioner alleged that “ ‘ frightened by threats of dire consequences if he dared to stand trial, relator pleaded guilty under the direction of an assistant district attorney, with the understanding that a sentence to Huntingdon Reformatory would be imposed.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[269,718,1146,367]]]'>In the <em>Simon </em>case there were no threats of dire circumstances if the defendant stood trial, nor was the defendant directed to plead guilty and there was no promise as to the sentence which would be imposed. Simon did, at the second hearing, as already stated, speak of police abuse but he did not even charge such abuse in his petition for the writ.</p>

Others of us think that when a crime subject to capital punishment is not involved, each case depends on its own facts . . . Where the gravity of the crime and other factors — such as the age and education of the defendant, the conduct of the court or the prosecuting officials, and the complicated nature of the offense charged and the possible defenses thereto — render criminal proceedings without counsel <em>so apt to result in injustice as to be fundamentally unfair, </em>the latter group holds that the accused must have legal assistance under the Amendment whether he pleads guilty or elects to stand trial, whether he requests counsel or not.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

      <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>The controlling phraseology of this direction is that where the factors enumerated “render criminal proceedings without counsel so apt to result in injustice as to be fundamentally unfair,” the furnishing of counsel is imperative. But we have seen that in this case the proceedings not only did not result in injustice but there was not the slightest approximation to what might be considered “fundamentally unfair.”</p>
    <p id="b611-4" data-blocks='[["BL_611.4",611,[102,777,1153,1505]]]'>The <em>Herman </em>case is also distantly removed authoritatively from the <em>Simon </em>case. There, the relator charged “that his pleas of guilty were the result of coercion and threats by state officers and . . . that at no stage of the proceedings was he either advised of his right to or given the benefit of counsel.” <em>A hearing was refused. </em>The Court pointed out that the relator asserted that “a state trooper grabbed him by the neck and threatened to choke him if he did not confess and there were threats against the safety of his wife and daughter. Petitioner finally confessed after 72 hours of intermittent questioning and was taken to a justice of the peace ... he was taken before the Court of Common Pleas and charged with some 30 offenses. The assistant prosecuting attorney demanded that petitioner sign a plea of guilty to all the charges. When petitioner asked what he was signing, the assistant prosecuting attorney said ‘Sign your name and forget it.’ Petitioner was not informed of the seriousness of the charges by the prosecutor or the judge; he did not know that his plea of guilty could result in a maximum sentence of some 315 years; he did not know nor was he informed that he could have counsel. . . . The District Attorney did not deny that petitioner had been told in the courtroom to ‘Sign your name and forget it,’ but denied only ‘that the statements were made by the Assistant District Attorney in order to obtain pleas to the charges involved.’ ”</p>

He admitted his guilt in open court, he admitted it before committing magistrates, he admitted it when examined at the behavior clinic, he told his mother of some of his crimes, when he arrived at the penitentiary he related what he had done. He made four applications to the Pardon Board for commutation of sentence and in each instance he acknowledged his guilt. Indeed in his petition for the writ of habeas corpus he does not even allege innocence. His counsel goes further and says that in these proceedings the question of innocence or guilt is irrelevant.</p>

Since he admits the crimes attributed to him, the inference may arise (in the absence of any evidence to the contrary) that he did not ask for counsel because he believed that with a plea of guilt he did not need counsel. This would strengthen the position of the Commonwealth that Simon knew he could have counsel but that, reflectively, decided to dispense with counsel.</p>

For instance, there is nothing in the record to justify the appellant’s claim that “public hysteria” influenced the case. There was no public hysteria. As stated by the hearing judge, “there was considerable publicity, as would be expected from the type of crimes and the number committed in the same geographical area within such a short period, but the police investigation and the plea hearing were conducted in a routine manner.”</p>

Furthermore, the latest examinations, conducted recently by the Penitentiary authorities and the Behavior Clinic, as well as previous ones, indicate that the prisoner has undergone little if any change for the better in the eighteen years since the sentences were imposed. Had there been marked improvement, the Pardon Board at one or another of the four separate applications for clemency might have been led to grant commutation.”</p>

There is no justification, however, for that release on any alleged basis that there was any “ingredient of unfairness” in the proceedings which resulted in his incarceration. The order of the court below, therefore, is affirmed.</p>
