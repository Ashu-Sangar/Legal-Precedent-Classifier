Higbee owned a large tract of land in Philadelphia County which he carved into lots and sold to various purchasers, the deed in each instance carrying a restrictive covenant as follows: “Under and subject nevertheless to the express condition and restriction that no tavern or building for the sale or manufacture of beer or liquor of any kind or description, no court house, currier establishment, blacksmith, <em>machine shop, </em>livery stable, slaughter house, coal yard, piggery, white lead works, poudrette neats foot oil, lampblack, gunpowder, glue, starch, soap or candle manufactury, tallow chandlery, bone boiling establishment, chemical laboratories or establishment where steam power is used or any building for offensive occupation whatsoever shall at any time <em>he erected, used, or occupied thereon or any part thereof . . </em>.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

Dierwechter, his wife, acquired from this tract a lot located at 4517 Higbee Street. On August 13, 1930, Gordon H. and Isabella E. Null, his wife, purchased lots located at 4514-15-16 Benner Street. On January <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>29, 1951, Martin J. and Beatrice Kajowski, his wife, bought the land at 4515 Higbee Street.

This latter structure, from all descriptions, was a neglected stepchild in the family of buildings in the area. It was old, dilapidated, run-down, unsightly, unpainted, without glass for the windows and lacking electricity) heat or plumbing. On a part-time basis and in a very modified form the Nulls used this ramshackle structure as a screw machine shop from 1930 to 1940. The structure progressively deteriorated with the passing of the years. Windows were boarded up, holes appeared in the roof, exposing the interior to the elements, the floors and steps creaked, birds and cats visited the premises without tidying up the place before they left, and rats made a holiday of the debris-strewn location.</p>

The Kajowskis and the Dierwechters, whose properties adjoined the land of the Nulls in the rear, as well as other neighboring residents, opposed the granting of the permit. The zoning board rejected the application, but the Court of Common Pleas No. 4 of Philadelphia County, on appeal by the Nulls, reversed the zoning board’s action, and the Kajowskis and the Dierwechters appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed the action of the court of common pleas.</p>

The Kajowskis <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>and the Dierwechters warned the Nulls that the building they were racing to finish violated the provisions of the restrictive covenant common to the neighborhood and that they were going ahead at their own risk. The Nulls were apparently willing to so proceed and rushed the building to completion, moved, in with machinery, equipment and materials,, and began to operate at full blast a full-fledged machine shop with ten workers, in spite of the covenant which specifically forbade the use of the property as a machine shop, and such other strangely associated establishments as, for instance, a tallow chandlery, a slaughterhouse, a bone-boiling factory, a piggery, or a courthouse.</p>

This order was really superfluous because the court, in addition to what has just been stated, ordered the demolition of the building which, if done, would certainly of itself bring the machine shop to a full and permanent stop. The Nulls appealed.</p>

This.is one of those rare cases where both sides will win, but .at. the same time, necessarily, both will lose something. .For the Nulls to. expect to continue operating a machine shop, in the face .of the specific prohibition in. their- deed , against machine shops is excessive, expectation.- . For the Kajowskis and the Dierwechters' to expect the demolition of an excellent, useful, good-looking building in the face of the money invested and the labor- expended, is also excessive expectation where <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>the building can be devoted to uses consistent with the restrictive covenant.</p>
    <p id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[122,437,1154,1082]]]'>The plaintiffs complain that the defendants’ machine shop has destroyed the peace of the neighborhood which is residential. All day long one hears issuing from- the cinder block building unbearable noises of hissing, grinding, hammering and tapping, trucks and automobiles making use of the establishment raise clouds of dirt and dust, the revolving machinery emits gaseous and nauseating odors, at night glaring lights in and outside the building inundate the area with vexing illumination. The plaintiffs assert also that they are annoyed by “blaring radio playing and conversation at all hours of the day and night,”, which suggests that the occupants of the building must shout rather loudly if they can be heard above the grinding, hissing, hammering and tapping, plus the blaring radio. Because of all this, the plaintiffs assert that the running of the machine shop constitutes a nuisance in fact and per se. The chancellor did find as a fact that operation of the machine shop did interfere with the “quiet enjoyment of neighboring property owners.”</p>
    <p id="b629-6" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[120,1529,1152,584]]]'>But if the hissing is stilled, the grinding, tapping and hammering eliminated, the extraordinary glare dimmed, the radio blaring silenced, the truck traffic stopped and the loud conversation gagged, why is it necessary to destroy the building? The building in itself, emptied of the machine shop and the phenomena which make it an aural and olfactory nuisance, can do no more harm than a self-contained well-behaved maple or hemlock tree. It would be as if the building had been originally constructed for a purpose consistent with the restrictive covenant.</p>

    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.4",630,[254,614,1147,478]]]'>But it is to be noted in that case that the emphasis is on the business and not on the structure. The building which was once a machine shop, and is now no longer a machine shop, produces no hissing, hammering or hullabaloo, which is what the plaintiffs are really complaining about, not the actual building itself. Even a cannon, when it ceases to speak with fire and flame becomes a tranquil part of the landscape, even somehow hushing the surrounding atmosphere.</p>
    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[249,1111,1151,523]]]'>This same type of restriction against erection and use involved in this case was considered in <em>Hibberd v. </em>Edwards, <a href="/pa/235/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="235 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="984903" data-case-paths="/pa/235/0454-01">235 Pa. 454</a>, and we there affirmed per curiam the lower court’s conclusion that: “The restriction above quoted is not a residential restriction — limiting the property to residential uses, nor is it intended to be, but to guard and protect residences and inoffensive business places from the annoyance, discomfort and inconvenience of offensive establishments, such as are enumerated and others of like character.”</p>

Superior Ct. 248</a>, but that case cannot control here for the reason that the offending building there, a garage, cut off the plaintiffs view, light and air. The Court held that the restriction prohibiting the erection of any building within five feet of the side lines of a lot constituted the creation by contract of an easement to light and air. The defendants’ building interfered with that easement and continued as a breach of the restriction so long as it remained. But in the instant case, if the building is given over to a use consistent with the restriction, there <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>is no further breach of the restriction; the building could have been erected originally for such a purpose without any question of violating the restriction.. ■ As already stated, the intent of the restriction was to avoid offensive uses. .</p>

Therefore, we are taking necessary legal action and advise you to desist from further construction. Any further continuance to build will be at your own risk and expense.”</p>
    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.6",631,[112,1102,1150,742]]]'>At that time the appeal taken from the common pleas court to the Supreme Court was pending. The plaintiffs now argue that since the defendants ignored their warning and went ahead in the face of the restriction and ■ while litigation was pending, they should be required to tear down the new building since they had been notified they were proceeding at their own risk and expense. Controversies in court, however, are not decided simply on warnings and portents. Even if it were to be assumed that the defendants were premature and hasty in erecting their building while the question of approval of the building permit was still pending, they are not to be penalized simply because the plaintiffs warned them.</p>

Justice repels, reason abhors, logic condemns and fundamental equity principles reject that a . new building should be destroyed when its demolition accomplishes no more than satisfy one of the parties that he had correctly foretold the state of the legal weather. In the <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>case of <em>Haig Corp. v. Thomas S.

In opposition, they argue that they have the right to continue operating as in the past on the thesis that the plaintiffs have acquiesced in what they, the defendants, have done. This proposition can hardly be advanced seriously because if there is one thing of which the plaintiffs cannot be justly accused it is that they have acquiesced in the activities of the defendants. When the defendants in 1933 applied for a permit to operate a screw machine factory in the controverted building, on the basis of nonconforming use, the Dierwechters and the predecessor in title of the Kajowskis, opposed the granting of the permit. When the defendants obtained a permit to demolish the building in dispute, the plaintiffs appealed to the zoning board of adjustment which sustained the appeal and directed the zoning division of the department of licenses and inspections to revoke the permit. Then, when the defendants appealed to the court of common pleas, which reinstated the permit, the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, as already stated. When the defendants, while this appeal was pending, began to build the cinder block machine shop, the plaintiffs notified them to desist, and when fhijü notice proved ineffective, they applied in equity for a mandatory injunction. In the light of these events it is difficult to see what the plaintiffs could have done, <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>short of physically restraining the defendants, which they did not do, to prevent the defendants from treating the restriction in the deed as a dead letter.</p>
    <p id="b633-4" data-blocks='[["BL_633.5",633,[124,512,1153,690]]]'>Then the defendants argue that the plaintiffs were guilty of laches because they did not bring their equity action in 1954 when the zoning permit was granted. Even though the plaintiffs filed an appeal from the granting of the permit, the defendants insist that the plaintiffs were lax in pursuing their rights by not initiating an equity action at the time. This suggests that the plaintiffs should have been, like a juggler with several balls in the air, pursuing two different remedies in the courts to cure the one same ailment. The courts are already overly congested with lawsuits without inviting multiplicity of actions arising out of one and the same transaction.</p>
    <p id="b633-5" data-blocks='[["BL_633.6",633,[118,1230,1153,754]]]'>Even so, the plaintiffs asked for equitable intervention on November 26, 1956, although the zoning matter was not finally adjudicated until January 6, 1958. Instead of being charged with laches, the plaintiffs might be subject to reproof for having moved with undue celerity because, had the Supreme Court reversed the court of common pleas in the zoning matter, there would have been no need for equity action at all. It must be said in behalf of the plaintiffs, however, that they were confronted with a condition and not a theory because the defendants, ignoring admonitions and appeals, were driving apace with the erection of the new building for the purpose of conducting a business precisely forbidden by their deed to the property.</p>
