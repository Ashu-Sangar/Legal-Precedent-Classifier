The Bank, having had appellant’s four minor children joined as parties in the action and a guardian ad litem appointed for them, filed preliminary objections to the complaint filed by appellant. The basis of these objections was that appellant’s complaint was (1) barred by laches and (2) failed to aver a cause of action.

    <p id="b308-4" data-blocks='[["BL_308.4",308,[254,831,1152,1337]]]'>At the outset our attention must be given to the question of laches and, in so doing, we bear in mind that laches is not dependent on the lapse of a certain definite time after a cause of action arises but “whether under the circumstances of the particular case, plaintiff is chargeable with want of due diligence in seeking redress”: <em>Stimson v. Stimson, </em><a href="/pa/346/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="346 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1216412" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0068-01">346 Pa. 68</a>, 72, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%20679" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="29 A.2d 679">29 A. 2d 679</a>. From the complaint it appears that the instruments attacked in this action were executed on April 30, 1951 and the action to set the instruments aside was instituted August 1, 1960, nine years and four months later. However, the complaint pleads as facts that during at least three years and eleven months of this period appellant was addicted to the excessive use of both alcohol and drugs and that during this period she was declared an incompetent and unable to handle her affairs by the court of one state and an inebriate by the court of another state. In charging a person with lack of due diligence in seeking to redress an alleged wrong it is of paramount importance to ascertain whether such person was under any legal disability which would negative lack of diligence because, obviously, laches should not be imputed to a person suffering a legal disability until such time as the disability has ceased to exist.</p>

Eleven months prior thereto, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County had found appellant to be an inebriate and a subject for detention in a hospital. Seven months prior to April 30, 1951 the Court, <em>without finding she was cured of her condition, </em>simply released appellant to give her an opportunity to complete her rehabilitation with Alcoholics Anonymous. The complaint avers, and for the purpose of this appeal we must accept such averment as true, that before the end of 1950 she continued to excessively use alcohol. Twenty-one months after the instruments were executed, the father petitioned to have appellant declared incompetent. In that petition the father alleged appellant was incapable of caring for herself, likely to harm herself or others and was mentally and morally irresponsible.. In its order thé court, after hearing, found; inter alia, that “her judgment- was impaired” and that -her condition had existed over a “protracted period óf time.” In interpreting this order, the Florida court found that appellant from March 30,1950 to February 4, 1951 was an inebriate, her judgment impaired and that she had <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>poor insight about personal matters. We, therefore, have, on the face of this complaint, averments alleging that courts before and after April 30, 1950 had found appellant incompetent as an inebriate, one court finding she had been such for a protracted period of time and an official record in Allegheny County which indicates that, even though appellant was discharged from custody for rehabilitation purposes, <em>she was never declared competent ~by that court. </em>Under such circumstances, the complaint sufficiently avers facts which well raise the question of her mental competency on April 30, 1951, at least to the extent she be given an opportunity to have her day in court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

No doubt, as averred, both appellant’s father and her first husband stood in confidential relationship to appellant and it may well be that their importunities to appellant were in an attempt to save appellant and her property from herself and her own irresponsibility arising from the use of alcohol and drugs. However, in view of the averments, which, for the purpose of this appeal, we are bound to accept as true, that from 1943 to 1954 appellant was suffering from alcoholism to the extent that, time after time, it was necessary to hospitalize her and on three occasions to have appellant declared an inebriate and to commit her involuntarily to institutions, we are convinced that the court below erred in <em>summarily </em>dismissing the complaint.</p>

This is not to be understood as indicating that appellant can or should prevail; on the contrary, it simply means that appellant should have her “day in court”.</p>
