The court decree, which established Thomas’ claim was entered against Mutter Company alone and not against Mutter or any other executive officer. That decree did not establish any indebtedness owing to Thomas by Mutter or the other executive officers. Under such circumstances, ne exeat did not lie against Mutter or any of the other executive officers.</p>

    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[242,729,1152,1021]]]'>Accepting the court’s finding that Mutter committed the fraudulent acts which led the Court to enter the decree against Mutter Company, the fact remains that Mutter and any, or all, of the other corporate officers could have been held personally liable for any fraud which he or they committed in matters concerning the corporation and a direct action against him or them could have been maintained by the party defrauded: <em>Vierling v. Baxter et al., </em><a href="/pa/293/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="293 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1111125" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0052-01">293 Pa. 52</a>, 55, 56, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.%20728" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="141 A. 728">141 A. 728</a>; <em>Jamestown Iron &amp; Metal Co. v.

However, no claim was presented against Mutter or any of these corporate officers, they are not parties to the equitable action to which this ne exeat is ancillary and no decree has been entered against Mutter or any of them. In determining whether ne exeat was available it was of no moment that Mutter’s actions — fraudulent as they may have been — constituted the efficient cause of the entry of the decree against the Mutter Company.</p>

The prevention or restraint of corporate officers from interference with the application of the corporate assets to the satisfaction of a decree entered against the corporation is not and has never been within the purview of ne exeat. The purpose of ne exeat is to confine a person — against whom there is a claim equitable in nature for a sum certain presently payable — within the limits of the court’s jurisdiction until satisfaction of that claim or until a bond is given for that purpose. In the absence of any claim whatsoever against Mutter <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>or any of the other corporate officers in the equity action or any decree entered against Mutter or. any of the corporate officers, ne exeat will, not lie and should not have been issued against such officers, or any of them.</p>
    <p id="A5S" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[105,556,1151,1570]]]'>Moreover, on the posture of this record — where a threatened departure from the jurisdiction is averred but such is denied — ne exeat should not have been issued without having established <em>at a hearing </em>that the person or persons against whom the writ was sought had threatened to depart the court’s jurisdiction with the intent to defraud the claimant of his rights. When the petition was presented, ne exeat, on the basis of Thomas’ <em>belief, </em>was issued ex parte; that ne exeat may be, and usually is, issued ex parte is well established: <em>Elkay, </em>supra, p. 444, and cases therein cited. However, when the pleadings squarely raised, as in the case at bar, a question of fact as to whether the person or persons against whom the writ was to be issued or, if issued, to be continued were planning to depart the court’s jurisdiction with intent to defraud, it then became the duty of the court to resolve that question of fact by the taking of testimony. The burden was on Thomas to prove to the satisfaction of the court that there was a “probable or threatened departure of the defendant from the state . . . with intent to evade jurisdiction” : <em>Elkay, </em>supra, pp. 447, 448, and cases therein cited. Such proof could only be produced at a hearing wherein both parties would be given full opportunity to present their respective testimony: the law requires no more but certainly no less. <em>No sueh hearing was held; </em>in view of the disputed question of fact on a matter vital to the writ of ne exeat, the failure to. hold such hearing is fatal to the continuance of this writ.</p>
