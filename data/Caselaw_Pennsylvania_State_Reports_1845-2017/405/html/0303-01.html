However, delivery is not accomplished by the mere handing of the executed deed to a stranger. Likewise, the mere handing of the executed deed, without more, to a third person who is an agent of the grantee is ineffective. In order for the delivery to be effectual and to result in a culmination of the transition of the title, <em>there must be an express and definite instruction </em>that the deed is to be given to the grantee then or at some future time: <em>Swartz v.

    <p id="b343-5" data-blocks='[["BL_343.6",343,[118,663,1154,1286]]]'>The attorney, who prepared the deed, testified that he did so at the personal request of the grantor for the purpose of conveying title to the wife. The wife-grantee was not present and had no inkling of the transaction until more than seventeen years later. In recalling the details of the transaction, the attorney did not testify that he received from the grantor any instructions to deliver the deed to the grantee then, or at any time in the future. Nor did he say that he received instructions to record it, or that he received any directions to make known the existence of the deed to the grantee. On the other hand, he did say that it was his impression that the deed was under the control of the grantor at all times while he lived, and that if the grantor had requested its return or destruction, he would have complied with the request. While it may be argued that this merely represents the conception of the attorney as to the legal effect of the deed, and that his duty would be measured not by what he thought but rather by what the law required him to do (See, <em>Rynier Estate, </em>supra), still it is important testimony in determining whether or not the grantor intended to completely divest himself of ownership of the property on the occasion involved.</p>
    <p id="b343-6" data-blocks='[["BL_343.7",343,[118,1978,1150,259]],["BL_344.1",344,[253,326,1146,311]]]'>As noted before, the deed was not recorded for more than seventeen years after its execution and more than fifteen years subsequent to the grantor’s death. The attorney explains this fact by saying “that probably<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> it should have been recorded years before” and that at <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>the time of the execution of the deed the property was so heavily encumbered, that the recording would have been an “idle gesture.” In the meantime, the deed became lost and finally in November 1957 was rediscovered, and recorded after the attorney notified the grantee of its existence and collected $200 for his services.</p>
    <p id="b344-4" data-blocks='[["BL_344.4",344,[248,657,1150,1072]]]'>Further facts in the record shed light upon the truth. Following the execution of the deed, the grantor continued his complete control over the property until his death. At no time did he tell the grantee in the deed, or any members of his family, that he had deeded over his interest to the defendant. He made no inquiry to see if the deed had been recorded or effort to accomplish such. Following the grantor’s death, the plaintiff, a son, assumed full responsibility of clearing up serious clouds existing on the title and of maintaining the property over the years. He secured a quit claim deed in favor of the heirs of his deceased father from a Tennessee corporation, which apparently owned an undivided one-half interest in the property as evidenced by the records of the recorder of deeds. He resisted foreclosure against the property on an existing recorded mortgage, caused an investigation resulting in the disclosure that the mortgage had been overpaid, and obtained the payment of a refund to the estate of his father in the sum of $2000.</p>
    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[247,1751,1146,258]]]'>It, therefore, seems clear to us that when the deed in question was executed, the grantor did not intend to vest title then and there in the grantee, and that the evidence is of sufficient quality to overcome the presumption of delivery.</p>
