In order to provide land upon which the railroad could relocate and re-establish its facilities, the Commonwealth condemned properties of others in the city. Deeds of conveyance were also obtained by the <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>Commonwealth from the latter landowners. The litigated assessments are levied against the land upon which the new facilities are located or under construction, and for the purpose of identification, it is designated in the record as Parcel 2-j-288. Upon all dates material, the record fee title has remained in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[136,725,1152,805]]]'>In connection with the relocation of the railroad facilities, the Commonwealth and the B. &amp; O. Railroad entered into a written agreement on May 29, 1952. Therein, the Commonwealth agreed, inter alia, to pay all of the costs incident to the relocation; to furnish whatever land was necessary to effectuate the relocation and to deed in fee simple title to said land to the railroad. From a reading of the agreement, it is quite evident that the land upon which the railroad facilities were then proposed to be relocated had previously been approved by the parties to the agreement, and that it is the specific land involved in this issue. No date for the execution and delivery of the deed incident to the transition of the recorded title was specifically fixed and as yet such has not been effected.</p>

As of January 1, 1958, the property was assessed in the amount of $1,160,300, the records indicating that, other facilities were in the process of construction on the property. The amount .of the assessment for 1959 was the same as for 1958. In the 1957, 1958, and 1959 assessments, the owners were listed as B. &amp; O. Bailroad and/or Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The property was also listed as taxable for city and school purposes.</p>

Tbe legal correctness of tbe lower court’s ruling is now before us on this appeal. No complaint is made as to the correctness of tbe valuation.

We cannot subscribe fully to this position.</p>
    <p id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[124,1098,1151,910]]]'>In tbe first place, under tbe facts presented, it is tbe B. &amp; O. Railroad which is the actual and real owner of tbe property. Any other conclusion would belie tbe facts. Tbe railroad became the equitable owner thereof under tbe agreement of May 29, 1952. It took exclusive possession in tbe middle of tbe year 1955 and, then and there, assumed complete use for its own purposes, including tbe erection of buildings thereon. Its right to occupancy and use is unquestioned. Tbe mere formality of executing and delivering tbe deed is all that is necessary to make tbe records conform to tbe facts. No antecedent conditions remained unperformed as to tbe conveyance of tbe fee. Tbe Commonwealth has no actual estate in tbe property. It bolds a mere naked title. Under its agreement, it is legally bound to convey tbe fee to tbe appellant. Why tbe latter has not insisted upon this formality does not appear.</p>

Tbe Commonwealth appropriated and took record title to <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>the land involved in order to carry out this legal obligation and solely for the use and benefit of the railroad.</p>
    <p id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[246,500,1151,1563]]]'>The General County Assessment Law of May 22, 1933, P. L. 853, as amended, 72 PS §5020-201 et seq., is the statutory basis for the assessment of all real estate subject to taxation. There is nothing contained therein that requires that real estate taxes be levied only against the recorded owner of the fee. In general, taxes are determined by ownership. It has long been the policy of the law that the real owner should be taxed: <em>No. Phila,. Trust Co. v. Heinel Bros., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/315/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="315 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1156669" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0385-01">315 Pa. 385</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.%20692" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="172 A. 692">172 Atl. 692</a> (1934). The actual owner, who is not the record owner, may be assessed unless exempt from taxation: <em>Pennsylvania Stave Company’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/236/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="236 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="986618" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0097-01">236 Pa. 97</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20761" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="84 A. 761">84 Atl. 761</a> (1912) and <em>Bemis v.

The right of the taxing authority to collect unpaid taxes from the registered owner is not exclusive and may be exercised against the real or beneficial owner: <em>No. Phila. Trust Co. v.

Also, an equitable interest in real estate is subject to taxation: <em>City of Philadelphia v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa-super/102/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="102 Pa.
