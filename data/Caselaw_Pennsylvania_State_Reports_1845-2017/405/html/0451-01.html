This was contrary to the bequest she made for her three other children, and as everyone knows a gift of principal is more advantageous and far more desirable for living expenses and enjoyment than is a gift of income from the same amount of principal.</p>
    <p id="b490-4" data-blocks='[["BL_490.4",490,[233,738,1151,905]]]'>Testatrix then gave “the three remaining equal fourth parts or shares” in trust to pay the income equally among her children William, Louisa and Gertrude, for their respective lives and at their respective deaths to pay the principal of such child’s share to the then living children and issue of such deceased child per stirpes. There then follows the crucial clause: “but should any of my said three children die leaving no children or other issue, living at the time of such child’s death, I direct that the portion of the principal share of any such deceased child of mine [shall not be paid outright but] shall continue to constitute a part of my residuary estate <em>for the benefit of the remaining cestui que trustent </em>in the trusts in this will mentioned <em>and in the proportion hereinabove designated, </em>subject, nevertheless, to the trusts conditions and limitations <em>hereinabove </em>declared.”</p>

George was not a cestui que trust. He received his share (as above noted) outright, absolutely and in fee simple. Moreover, testatrix added the words “and <em>in the proportion hereinabove designated” </em>meaning, thereby, a division among the survivors of William, Louisa and Gertrude, because Géorge was indisputably not a cestui que trust (ent), and, in addition, neither George nor his Children or issue were subject “to the <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>trusts conditions and limitations <em>hereinabove </em>declared.” George, and necessarily Ms cMldren, had received the benefit of a far greater gift, namely, the principal of testatrix’s one fourth share outright, and (we repeat) George’s share did not constitute, within testatrix’s language, meaning and intent, a part of her residuary estate “for the benefit of the remaining<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> cestui que trustent”, whom testatrix had already named, to wit, her children, William, Louisa and Gertrude.
