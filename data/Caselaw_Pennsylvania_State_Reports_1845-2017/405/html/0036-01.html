In April 1959, he was confined under this sentence in the State Correctional Institution in Pittsburgh. He presented a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the courts of Northumberland County alleging irregularities in his conviction and sentence. A hearing on this petition being ordered, the defendant was returned to that county to permit his attendance. The petition was then withdrawn upon the advice of counsel, who concluded the factual assertions therein were not true. On the following day, while being returned to the institution in Pittsburgh by James R. Lauer, the Sheriff of Northumberland County, in an automobile operated by an aide, one Martin Diehl, Butler shot and killed the sheriff. He escaped and was apprehended the following day.</p>
    <p id="b76-4" data-blocks='[["BL_76.4",76,[255,1147,1147,371]]]'>Immediately before the shooting, the defendant was in the back seat of the automobile, restrained by handcuffs, which were fastened to a leather belt.

It was raining very hard and visibility was poor. After inquiry, they turned around and were headed back in the direction of the institution, when suddenly the defendant, “lurched” over the front seat and grabbed the gun. The sheriff, jumped into the back seat and tried to seize the defendant, yelling, “John, don’t do it.” The defendant said, “Let me go Jim or I’ll kill you.” The driver, Diehl, hurriedly pulled the car over to the side of the road, jumped out and opened the rear door. The sheriff was then lying on his side on the floor between the seats, with his head raised in the corner on the driver’s side of the car. The defendant was on the back seat, crouched in the op<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>posite corner of tbe car.

Tbe sole defense was insanity and tbe testimony offered in support of this was that of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jacobs, who first examined tbe defendant one year after tbe offense was committed. This witness also studied and considered tbe results of tests given by a psychologist; tbe reports and evaluations of both tbe Behavior Clinic of Allegheny County and tbe Diagnostic Clinic of tbe penitentiary; and, tbe defendant’s case history. He opinionated that tbe defendant manifested “a personality pattern disturbance, schizoid personality, with sociopatbic features.” He further expressed tbe belief that, at tbe exact moment tbe shooting occurred, tbe defendant was in a temporary state of confusion and panic and unable to understand tbe value and conse<a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>quence of his acts or to distinguish right from wrong.

The admission of this latter testimony is vigorously urged to be prejudicial error.</p>

It is staffed with specially trained professional personnel, who examine individuals arrested and charged with crimes of a certain nature (including murder) and prepare psychological and psychiatric evaluations.

When the defendant, Butler, was first arrested, upon the advice of counsel, he repeatedly <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>refused such an examination. Dr. Davis discussed with his counsel the advisability of conducting an examination of the defendant and her wishes in regard thereto. She stated she desired the matter deferred. Later on, counsel informed Dr. Davis that the examination met with her approval, and it was subsequent to this (January 5, 1960) that the examination began.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The defendant admitted in his testimony at the hearing on the penalty that, on advice of counsel, he submitted to the examination voluntarily and willingly.</p>

In addition, the nature of Dr. Davis’ testimony was well known to both sides, having been disclosed in a preliminary proceeding, wherein counsel for the defendant sought court to appoint a psychiatrist and psychologist at county expense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The law has one objective and that is the ascertainment of the truth. The fact that Dr. Davis and Dr. Grove were employees of a clinic, established to aid the court in the ascertainment of true and helpful facts, did not affect the relevance or value of their testimony. It was not a denial of due process. The evidence was made available before trial to both the defendant and the Commonwealth. The jury was completely conversant with its background. The modern tendency to utilize the services and testimony of specially trained professional people designated by the court itself, particularly in criminal trials where insanity is pleaded, is generally recognized as a progressive step which brightens the light of truth and reduces immeasurably the darkness of uncertainty.

It is said that the fact that the experts are appointed by the Court, which fact is made known to the jury, necessarily leads the jury to give a sanctity and a weight to their testimony which is not accorded to other witnesses. ... If any limitations are imposed by this constitutional provision upon the character of the trial to which the accused is entitled other than those specifically mentioned, such limitations cannot be greater than those existing at the common law.

    <p id="b83-4" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[134,997,1150,1314]]]'>This rule of evidence is founded on common sense and logic. If a defendant offers himself as a person worthy of belief, the jury has the right to know what kind of man he is — to aid in assessing his credibility. His previous record is admissible for this purpose just the same as testimony of prior reputation for veracity is evidence for the jury’s consideration. The “Split-Verdict Act” of 1959, supra, did not intend to, nor did it, change this long established rule. The sin and unfairness which this legislation aimed to obliviate was that which crept into the law after the passage of the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 759, §1, placing with the jury the responsibility of fixing guilt and punishment in one verdict. It concerned itself only with the procedure to be followed in determining the punishment for those convicted of first degree murder. It did not deal with the rules of evidence incident to the impeachment of witnesses. The title to the act renders this crystally clear. It is as follows: “Amending the act of June 24, 1939 (P. L. 872) entitled ‘An act to consolidate, amend and revise the penal laws of the Commonwealth’, <em>changing the method for determining the penalty to be imposed for the crime of murder in the first </em>degree.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

      <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>There are other compelling reasons why no prejudicial error was committed herein in this regard. The previous serious criminal record of the defendant was placed affirmatively béfore the jury by the defendant’s own witness, Dr. Jacobs. The past activities of the defendant were considered of prime importance by the doctor in assisting him in arriving at his conclusions. This history of the. defendant was relevant in determining mental capacity. See <em>Commonwealth v. Wil</em>liams, <a href="/pa/307/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="307 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1138139" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0134-01">307 Pa. 134</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.%20602" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="160 A. 602">160 Atl. 602</a> (1932). May we add too, that if the defendant were insane and that was the only defense offered, evidence of his prior record would probably benefit, rather than harm him. A final word before we leave this particular assignment of error— as pointed out before, the statement is made that the court’s attitude in respect to the admission of this evidence influenced the thinking and conclusion to keep the defendant off the stand. A close examination of the record raises great doubt as to the correctness of this allegation. The defendant did take the stand in the supplemental proceeding, wherein the punishment was fixed. He then told his story as to how the shooting occurred. He said that he didn’t intend to kill Sheriff Lauer; that he didn’t know whether he pulled the trigger; and attempted to depict a set of circumstances which could lead to the conclusion that the gun was accidently fired in his attempt to escape. He said he grabbed the gun, in the first place, in order to save himself from being -shot while running away. But, all of this was given to the jury by Dr. Jacobs, in reciting the defendant’s version of the shooting as given to him. In short, the defendant’s version of the occurrence was cleverly placed before the jury without calling him as a witness, in an indirect manner through the direct testimony of defendant’s psychiatrist. This device also saved the defendant from the ordeal and possible consequences of cross-examination during the main portion of the trial.</p>

Thus, it is advanced that this constituted a suppression of this testimony during tbe main portion of tbe trial, and deprived tbe defendant of strong corroborative evidence that tbe shooting was an accident. However, tbe defensé to tbe crime was not accidental killing. It was excusable homicide as a result of insanity. Needless to say, such are miles apart. More importantly, a reading of the record discloses no significant variance as alleged. In Diehl’s statement given immediately after <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>the occurrence, as quoted in the cross-examination of the defendant, he said,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> “The sheriff got into the back seat and there was a struggle while I was trying to get the car stopped on the side of the road.” During his testimony on the stand, Diehl did not use the word “struggle” but he did say that almost immediately as the defendant gained possession of the gun, the sheriff “grabbed him” and went over the seat before the car was brought to a stop. Certainly, this clearly indicates a struggle took place. But when the fatal shot was fired after the car had been stopped, Diehl testified that Lauer was then lying on the floor and the defendant was sitting on the seat on the opposite side of the car. There is nothing in Diehl’s first statement, as disclosed in the record, that is at variance in the slightest degree with this testimony. Further, defense counsel was given every opportunity to elicit every possible fact and flaw in the testimony through extended cross-examination.</p>

Two points submitted were refused on the ground that they had been adequately covered in the charge. They were as follows: (1) “If you find that the firing of the shot which killed Sheriff Lauer occurred in the course of a struggle between him and the defendant, and that the shot was fired unintentionally and accidentally and without any specific intent to take the Sheriff’s life, then you cannot find him guilty of first degree murder. You may, however, find him •guilty of murder in the second degree because even ah accidental killing occurring in the commission of the crime of escape is murder in the second degree, pro<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>vided however, that you are convinced that defendant is sane.” (2) “Murder in the first degree requires a specific intent to kill, and if, under all of the evidence, you are convinced that this defendant, by reason of his mental illness or disorder, was incapable of forming a wilful, deliberate and premeditated design to kill, then he cannot be found guilty of first degree murder.”</p>
    <p id="b87-3" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[118,718,1153,1588]]]'>In regard to the first mentioned request for charge, we note that during the main part of the trial, there was not any substantive evidence on either side indicating the shooting was accidental. The details of the shooting as given by Diehl, the only eyewitness who testified, established a cold-blooded first degree killing. It precluded any conclusion that the shooting was accidental. Further, the court did charge correctly and adequately on the two classes of murder. He defined murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. He made very clear the distinction and the differentiating ingredients. He reiterated repeatedly the necessity that the killing had to be wilful, deliberate, intentional and premeditated in order to sustain a first degree murder charge. He explained that to be intentional, it had to be a conscious and intelligent act. He charged “to be deliberate it must be done under such circumstances as establish a mind fully conscious of its purpose and design; and to be premeditated sufficient time must elapse between the original thought and the deed as to allow the mind to select the weapon or instrument and then carry the intention into execution.” He emphasized the duty of the Commonwealth to prove the vital essentials of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. He also gave comprehensive instructions on the issue of insanity as affecting the capacity of the defendant to commit the crime charged. The entire charge was fair, understandable and complete in these important respects.</p>

It concerned the reasons behind the defendant’s decision to abandon the writ of habeas corpus referred to in the early part of this opinion.

During this portion of the trial, the Commonwealth offered in evidence the records of a series of prior convictions of grave criminal offenses by the defendant. They began in the year 1931 and included: robbery, carrying concealed weapons, armed robbery on two separate instances and in different jurisdictions and assault in the third degree. Two of these convictions resulted from pleas of guilty on separate occasions in the courts of Bronx County in the State of New York. The particular crimes involved were assault in the third degree and armed robbery committed in different years. The <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>entire record of these proceedings, certified under the Triplicate Seal of the State of New York, was offered in evidence <em>without any objection voiced thereto. </em>This included not only the record of the plea, conviction and sentence, and in addition, the statements and plea made by defendant’s counsel on his behalf, the court’s comments before imposition of sentence, and also a complete classification summary of the defendant’s early home life and difficult environment. The statements made by defendant’s counsel on these occasions and the data included in the classification summary were of such a nature as to be beneficial to the defendant. The history of his crimes, of course, was not. Also, the presiding judge’s comments were not helpful. In one instance, the court described the defendant as “a coldblooded stick-up man and a menace to society.” While the reaction of the presiding judge is understandable in view of the defendant’s history, these comments should have been deleted for the purposes of this case. See, <em>Commonwealth v. McCoy, </em><a href="/pa/405/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="405 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1303571" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0023-01">405 Pa. 23</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.2d%20795" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="172 A.2d 795">172 A. 2d 795</a> (1961). However, we repeat, no objections to the records as offered were made by counsel, who is considered a thorough, discerning lawyer of extensive experience ; nor was any motion to strike out entered. It is a reasonable inference that defendant’s counsel at that time wished to have everything in connection therewith heard by the jury and concluded that this procedure might well help the defendant’s cause and possibly save his life. The trial judge, in his opinion written for the court en banc, quotes counsel for the defendant as saying at sidebar the following: “I have no objections to Mr. Strauss reading the Judge’s remarks providing he reads the entire statement including the remarks of the District Attorney.” This is corroborated by the statement of the prosecuting attorney in this ease made in open court that he had been requested to read the entire colloquy that occurred in the <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>New York proceedings.
