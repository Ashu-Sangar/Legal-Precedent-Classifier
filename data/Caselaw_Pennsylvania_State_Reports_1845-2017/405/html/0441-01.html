On that date the decedent went to the bank with the defendant and said she wanted to add his name to the account but reserving the right^of withdrawal to herself. She further stated that on death she would leave it to the defendant. The teller transferred the balance to a new account, No. 32,315, and wrote on the ledger sheet “Regina Supsinski or Leonard Supsinski.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> Withdrawals by Mrs. Supsinski only.
