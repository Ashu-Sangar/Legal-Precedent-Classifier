Two or three days later the alleged will of 1957, hereinafter referred to as the second will, was found in a leather pouch (envelope) in the general safe of decedent’s bank. It had been delivered by decedent to his son, Steve Kadilak, to keep for him; a couple of months later and a month before decedent’s death, Steve delivered the pouch to a girl employee of the bank and it was thereafter kept in the general safe of the bank.
