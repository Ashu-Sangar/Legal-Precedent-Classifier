      <em> </em>file with the board an application for retirement requesting retirement to become effective as of the time of death and electing one of the four options and naming a beneficiary. The Board held, that absent such applications by Miss Rockwell, no right to retirement benefits arose. With this contention we cannot agree. From an examination of the Act in its entirety it is clear that Sections 12 and 13.1 provide simply methods whereby a member of the retirément system, having attained superannuation age (age 60), <em>may </em>give notice to the Board and select an appropriate option for the payment of benefits. It was not the legislative purpose, in the case of a member who dies before giving such <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>notice, to deprive such member’s estate of retirement benefits. In fact, Section 4 of tbe Act, as amended,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> provides that any “contributor who ... by reason of having reached superannuation retirement age, and who shall die while in county service before filing with the retirement board a written application for retirement . . . shall be considered as having elected Option One, . . . as of the date of . . . her death”. In such event, payment under Option One shall be made to “[either] the beneficiary designated [or] legal representative of said contributor.” Under Option One payment is made of the balance of the value of the <em>member’s annuity and county annuity. </em>The Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> further provides: “In computing the length of service of a contributor for retirement purposes, full credit shall be given to each original member for each year of service rendered to the county prior to the time the system became effective”. Had Miss Rockwell retired on January 8, 1960, even though she had only made one contribution to the fund, in the computation of the benefits to which she was entitled, she would have been credited with her prior years of service; her estate is entitled to no less.</p>

On December 10, 1937, Montgomery County established a retirement system to become effective January 1, 1938. Haldeman, who had been prothonotary of the county since 1922 and whose term expired on January 3, 1938, immediately notified the retirement board of his intention to become a member of the system. On January 1, 1938 he mailed his personal check, as his contribution to the funds, to the board which declined to accept either the check or application of membership. In a mandamus proceeding we held that Haldeman was entitled to the retirement benefits. The real objection to payment to Haldeman, as in the case at bar, lay in the fact that by a single payment to the annuity reserve account and his employment for such a short time after the effective date of the act, he became a member of the system entitled to credit for his past years of service. This Court fully answered that objection (pp. 385, 386) : “Appellees’ real objection to paying appellant adjusted compensation, or retirement pay, lies in the fact that by a single payment to the annuity reservé account, and his em<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>ployment for such a short time after the effective date of the Act, he becomes a beneficiary-member. We endeavored in Retirement Board v.

This is in effect an acknowledgment by the legislature of prior service, and a recognition by it that long and faithful public employment should be compensated, emphasizing the purpose and scope of the provisions for retirement pay or delayed compensation .... The various retirement acts adopted in this Commonwealth, including the present act, have as their purpose, not the bestowal of a gratuity upon governmental officeholders, but compensation for extended and faithful services performed, and to be performed, on behalf of the governmental body and the public.”</p>

Such is clearly a matter for the legislature, not this Court. Until the legislature sees fit to act, the employees of second class counties, in respect to retirement allowances, are, as compared to employees of all other political subdivisions, second class citizens.</p>
