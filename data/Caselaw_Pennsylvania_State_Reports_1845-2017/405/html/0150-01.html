To the east of the Expressway lie approximately 44 acres of the land sought to be annexed: this unimproved acreage adjoins the Borough, is owned practically in toto by Philadelphia Electric Company and, by reason of the Expressway, is inaccessible to and isolated from the rest of the land sought to be annexed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> To the west of the Expressway lies the balance — approximately 64 acres — of the land sought to be annexed. It consists of a wooded mountainous ridge, running generally north and south, entirely unimproved, except at its base, and is known as Rebel Hill. At its base are some private homes and property owned by Philadelphia Electric Company. The top of Rebel Hill — approximately 45% acres — is owned by “The Easttown Co. and/or John S. Trinsey, Jr.” (Trinsey).</p>

Although no definite plans for such development appear of record and no assurance is given the Borough that the development will be completed, it is a fact that Trinsey’s approach to the Borough to annex Rebel Hill was made after the Township had refused to rezone this area — an R-2 Residential district — so as to permit this development.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

A copy of that petition was served on the Township. On February 4, 1960 the first and second reading of the Borough ordinance of annexation took place and on February 10, 1960, after a third reading, the ordinance was passed by the unanimous vote of the councilmen then present. On February 22, 1960 — at a special council meeting— the burgess of the Borough expressed his intent to veto the ordinance. On March 2, 1960, council, by a 7-2 vote, overrode the burgess’ veto and enacted the ordinance. Thereafter, on March 5, 1960, the ordinance was advertised and, on March 11, 1960, a copy of the ordinance, maps, etc. were certified to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Montgomery County.</p>

However, the Township contends: (1) the instant proceedings are under the 1953 Act not The Borough Code and (2) that, even though this proceeding was under The Borough Code, the annexation ordinance, because it was not <em>recorded </em>in the ordinance book within 30 days of its passage, never became effective.</p>

Having committed itself so definitely to the annexation procedure under the 1953 Act, it is incomprehensible how the Borough can now take the position that it proceeded under another act. The Borough’s hindsight cannot avail it in this instance; its commitments have been made and the 1953 Act controls the present annexation procedure.</p>

In the case at bar, the Borough certified the annexation ordinance to the court on March 11, 1960, the complaints were filed on April 8, 1960, and, therefore, the complaints were timely filed.</p>

The legislature has indicated printing, typewriting, photostating or microfilming are permissible methods of recordation or transcription; it has not indicated that the <em>affixation </em>or <em>attachment </em>of ordinances so reproduced meet the legislative mandate and that <em>stapling </em>of such ordinance is to be countenanced.</p>

Undoubtedly, the nature of the terrain, its drainage pattern, lack of public sewage facilities, absence of adequate access roads, inadequacy of existing state highways, and division of the tract by the Expressway, raise difficult planning problems. Nevertheless, the testimony is equally clear that the members of Borough Council whose affirmative votes approved the annexation petition gave next to no consideration to any of these vital problems.</p>

Indeed, all that Council did consider seems to have been that existing Borough revenue of about $34,000 would be augmented by a projected increase of $168,000, if the property were developed as proposed.</p>

Access to the tract, drainage from it, and even the projected location of principal sewer lines aré and must remain through Upper Merion Township. Indeed, Belfont Avenue, the street forming the approximate southern boundary of the area to be annexed, would be partially in West Conshohocken and partially in the township.
