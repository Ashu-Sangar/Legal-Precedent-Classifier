History supports this view. After the demise in 1694 of the last of the infamous English Licensing Acts, freedom of the press, at least freedom from administrative censorship, began in England, and later in the Colonies, to assume the status of a “common law or <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>natural right.” See <em>State v. Jackson, </em><a href="/or/224/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="224 Or. 337" data-case-ids="5019715" data-case-paths="/or/224/0337-01">224 Ore. 337</a>, <a href="/or/224/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="224 Or. 337" data-case-ids="5019715" data-case-paths="/or/224/0337-01">356 P. 2d 495</a>, 499 (1960). Blackstone so recognized (circa 1767) when he wrote, “The liberty of the press is indeed essential to the nature of a free state; but this consists in laying no previous restraints upon publications, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published. Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public; to forbid this is to destroy the freedom of the press; but if he publishes what is improper, mischievous, or illegal, he must take the consequence of his own temerity. To subject the press to the restrictive power of a licenser, as was formerly done, both before and since the revolution, is to subject all freedom of sentiment to the prejudices of one man, and make him the arbitrary and infallible judge of all controverted points in learning, religion, and government. But to punish (as the law does at present) any dangerous or offensive writings, which, when published, shall on a fair and impartial trial be adjudged of a pernicious tendency, is necessary for the preservation of peace and good order, of government and religion, the only solid foundations of civil liberty. Thus the will of individuals is still left free; the abuse only of that free will is the object of legal punishment. Neither is any restraint hereby laid upon freedom of thought or inquiry: liberty of private sentiment is still left; the disseminating or making public of bad sentiments, destructive of the ends of society, is the crime which society corrects,”: 4 Bl. Comm. 151-152, (footnote omitted).</p>

A criminal proceeding ordinarily means a trial by jury of the vicinage. The members of the jury represent a cross-section of the community in which the allegedly obscene utterance was made. The jury naturally possesses a special aptitude for reflecting the view of the “average person” of the community. A determination of whether or not a particular utterance is obscene requires, by the Act’s own definition, an appraisal of its <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>quality according to the average person’s application of contemporary community standards.</p>

The contention is patently specious. A “community” in relation to standards of morality is a regional, and not a political, entity.

The only qualification for membership on the Board of Censors is that the appointees be “residents of Pennsylvania.” No minimum requirements of academic education or sociological training is necessary. Indeed, it is possible under this statute to have uneducated, or even illiterate, persons ruling upon whether or not motion pictures of published and easily obtainable literary works are obscene.

Holding that such procedure contravened constitutionally protected freedom of speech, the Supreme Court said (at pp. 526 and 529): “The vice of the present procedure is that, where particular speech falls close to the line separating the lawful and the unlawful, the possibility of mistaken fact finding — inherent in all litigation — will create the danger that the legitimate utterance will be penalized.

How can a claimant whose declaration is rejected possibly sustain the burden of proving the negative of these complex factual elements? In practical operation, therefore, this procedural device must necessarily produce a result which the State could not command directly. It can only result in a deterrence of speech which the Constitution makes free. ‘It is apparent that a constitutional prohibition cannot be transgressed indirectly by the creation of a statutory presumption any more than it can be violated by direct enactment.

Yet a right to appeal from the Board’s ruling is granted only to persons who have in the past exhibited, sold, lent, leased or used the film, reel or view. Even a person who has advertised the showing of the film, reel or view, but who has not yet exhibited, sold, lent or used it, has no right of appeal.

    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[241,376,1146,266]]]'>During the last five years this Court has dismantled the three most formidable dikes constructed by the people of Pennsylvania, through their representatives in Harrisburg, against the flood of cinematic filth always pounding at the borders of our Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.6",140,[236,652,1148,592]]]'>In 1956, in the <em>Hallmark </em>case, <a href="/pa/384/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="384 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1263154" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0348-01">384 Pa. 348</a>, this Court, by declaring an Act of 1915 unconstitutional, dissolved the Motion Picture Censorship Board which, for forty-one years, had faithfully served the people by keeping the theatres wholesome and clean of obscenity, vulgarity, blasphemy and profanity. At the time of that decision, the Majority of this Court said that although its decision eliminated motion picture censorship this did not mean that objectionable films could not be suppressed since offending exhibitors could be prosecuted under the criminal code.</p>
    <p id="b140-6" data-blocks='[["BL_140.7",140,[232,1256,1150,483]]]'>Then, in 1959, in <em>Commonwealth v. Blumenstein, </em><a href="/pa/396/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="396 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1284918" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0417-01">396 Pa. 417</a>, this Court proceeded to strike down that section of the criminal code under which exhibitors of immoral pictures could be prosecuted, by declaring it unconstitutional. The parent law of that section of the code (§528, The Penal Code of 1939), had been the Act of April 13, 1911, P. L. 64, so that this legislation which the Court invalidated had served the people of Pennsylvania faithfully for forty-eight years.</p>

Blanc, </em><a href="/pa/396/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="396 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="1284907" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0448-01">396 Pa. 448</a>, ruled that a district attorney could be enjoined from seizing a film which he regarded as violating the laws of Pennsylvania, because of obscenity. I wrote a dissenting opinion in that case, as I did in the previous ones, and ended that dissent as follows: “Unless the General Assembly comes to the aid of the people with renewed legislation and William Penn comes down from his pedestal atop City Hall to protect the State he founded, against the forces of im<a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>morality at our borders, far more damaging to the welfare of the people than the Indians he encountered, the fair Commonwealth which he dedicated to religious freedom, civic liberties and moral purity, may well be on the way to a cinematic Gomorrah.”</p>
    <p id="b141-3" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[122,620,1150,539]]]'>The General Assembly was, of course, well aware of its responsibilities to the people, and, thus, in September, 1959, it enacted the Motion Picture Control Act, which is the subject of this appeal. That the representatives were acting under a mandate of the people is well evidenced by the fact that the House of Representatives passed the measure by a near unanimous vote of 163 to 1, and the Senate approved it by the overwhelming majority of 47 to 3. The bill was, of course, approved and signed by the Governor.</p>
    <p id="b141-4" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[124,1171,1147,208]]]'>Today this Court again, through its powers of interpretation and absolute decision, reduces another statute of the sovereign body of the 'Commonwealth to shreds of paper by declaring it unconstitutional.</p>

Dealers may traffic in pictures on subjects of the utmost depravity, pictures which cannot help but corrupt morals and weaken the will of immature minds, pictures which would make an ancient Pompeiian blush with shame — dealers may engage in this type of revolting merchandise and not be restrained.</p>

Officials charged with standing guard over the moral health of the people have been disarmed. Every weapon which they could employ to stop the wicked and nefarious business of immoral films has been torn from their grasp. The armory in this field has been stripped bare.</p>

    <p id="b142-5" data-blocks='[["BL_142.5",142,[246,890,1148,374]]]'>Does the Constitution of Pennsylvania demand what this Court has done? In <em>Com. ex rel. Shumaker v. N. Y. &amp; Pa.

    <p id="b142-6" data-blocks='[["BL_142.6",142,[239,1282,1153,807]]]'>Would it be difficult for this Court to presume that the General Assembly of Pennsylvania intended to favor the public which certainly is interested in protecting children from the contamination of visual and auditory contact with immoral exhibitions? In the <em>Blumenstein </em>case, supra, I said in my Dissenting Opinion, and I repeat it here: “Who can doubt that many juvenile delinquents have been consciously or unconsciously urged into lurid crime because of being repeatedly exposed to lurid and immoral motion pictures? Children are by nature imitative and when they see immorality being practiced on so extensive and expansive a medium of expression as the motion picture screen, is it strange if they conclude that there is nothing wrong about doing what is being publicly glorified?”</p>

It says that the Act violates the constitutional provision protecting free speech and freedom of the press. But freedom Of <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>speech is not involved in the Act; much less freedom of the press.</p>
    <p id="AMT" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[106,440,1149,432]]]'>Those who fear that motion picture regulation may lead to press censorship conjure up a wholly unnecessary fear. The American people would never stand for press censorship because the freedom of the press is one of the strongest bulwarks of our independence and well-being and has been so recognized by statutes and decisions of the nation’s highest court. Here we stand unanimously as at Armageddon.</p>
    <p id="b143-4" data-blocks='[["BL_143.5",143,[104,889,1150,532]]]'>But, I repeat, freedom of the press and freedom of speech are wholly extraneous to what is before us in this lawsuit. To equate motion pictures with speech offends against logic and what is palpably demonstrable. The performance of speech involves only one person. And all that occurs is the formation of words. However, in motion pictures many persons participate. The audience watches these persons engaging in panto-mine, gesture, gesticulations, postures, and movements which tell what words could never describe.</p>
    <p id="b143-5" data-blocks='[["BL_143.6",143,[105,1448,1148,212]]]'>The Majority Opinion says: “Apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, the guarantee of free communication of thought and opinion is independently protected by our State Constitution of 1874.”</p>
    <p id="b143-6" data-blocks='[["BL_143.7",143,[104,1668,1148,432]]]'>But in motion pictures we are not dealing with the mere “communication of thought and opinion.” Motion pictures certainly go beyond the communication of thought and opinion. Motion pictures may appeal to the senses, to the passions. Further comparison between mere words and the panorama, parade, and performance of motion pictures is not only bizarre but might even become unseemly.</p>

It recalls the Constitutional Convention of 1790 where the members of the Convention “were undoubtedly fully cognizant of the vicissitudes and outright suppressions <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>to which printing had theretofore been subjected in this very Colony.” But what has printing in 1790 to do with the malignance of filthy motion pictures?</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[245,498,1149,855]]]'>No one with the slightest awareness of what is happening in the world can fail to know that many motion picture producers have gone entirely too far in pandering to the baser passions. J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has said: “As a law enforcement officer and as an American citizen, I feel duty-bound to speak out against a dangerous trend which is manifesting itself in the field of film and television entertainment. In the face of the nation’s terrifying juvenile crime wave, we are threatened with a flood of movies and television presentations which flout decency and applaud lawlessness. Not since the days when thousands filed past the bier of the infamous John Dillinger and made his home a virtual shrine have we witnessed such a brazen afront to our national conscience.”</p>
    <p id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[241,1374,1148,373]]]'>The well-known, popular and able columnist Bob Considine wrote of motion pictures in 1960 as follows: “So many of its current heroines are prostitutes, so many of its heroes wallow in a bed of neuroses, that churchmen interested in the morality of their flocks note that the number of objectional films has risen from 14 per cent in 1959 to '24 per cent this year.”</p>

There can be no real doubt that public exhibitions .of sadism tend to excite sadistic desires and to teach the audience how to gratify sadistic desires. Nor can there be any real doubt that there is a close connection between the suddenness of the increase in sadistic crimes and the new vogue of sadism among the mass media of entertainment. . . For my own part, believing as I do in freedom of speech and thought, I see no objection in principle to censorship of the mass entertainment of the young. <em>Until some more refined way is worked out of controlling this evil thing, the risks to our liberties are, I believe, decidedly less than the risks of unmanageable </em>violence.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

No one who is engaged in the business of motion pictures has the right, under the Constitution, to contaminate the mind of youth, just as no one, under the Constitutional guarantee of free speech, has the right to slander or libel his neighbor.</p>

The Majority Opinion shows how, once the majority of the board disapprove of a film, the exhibitor may be prosecuted for showing the condemned picture. In this the Majority Opinion sees a violation of the Constitutional right of trial by jury. I do not follow this argument. When State milk inspectors turn down a farmer’s milk as being unfit for consumption, the farmer may not demand a jury to pass upon the quality of the milk. When <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>meat inspectors condemn certain meat as tainted, the batcher may not ask for a jury to smell the meat and count the organisms in it before the government may act.

In the second place, the insignificant fees mentioned are paid for a very important service rendered to the exhibitor by the State, namely, the ascertainment of what is obscene so that the exhibitor is relieved of that responsibility.</p>

Prior restraint is thus distinguished from subsequent punishment, which is a penalty imposed after the communication has been made as a punishment for having made it. Again, speaking generally, a system of prior restraint would prevent communication from occurring <em>at all; </em>a system of subsequent punishment allows the communication but imposes a penalty after the event. Of course, the deterrent effect of a later penalty may operate to prevent a communication from ever being made. Nevertheless, for a variety of reasons, the impact upon freedom of expression may he quite different, depending upon whether the system of control is designed to block publication in advance or deter it by subsequent punishment.” (Emphasis supplied.)

The Majority makes this deduction based on the fact that Article I, §7, directly originated from the Constitution of 1790, and that, therefore, “The members of the Convention which drafted that Constitution were undoubtedly fully cognizant of the vicissitudes and outright suppressions to which printing had theretofore been subjected in this very Colony.” But, what they neglect to state is that the members of the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of 1790 were fully cognizant of the United States Constitution, which was adopted on September 17, 1787, by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, in which <em>eight </em>of the forty members were from Pennsylvania.

City of Chicago </em>(June 20, 1961), misinterprets the facts and holding of the case with reference to our present case. The Mayor of Chicago, who under the ordinance, was entrusted with the power of de novo review failed to view the film as a whole. Under this statute and the <em>Both </em>case, and contrary to the <em>logic </em>of the Majority in arriving at the conclusion of its syllogism, the Board must and will view the film as a <em>whole. </em>Further, in the <em>Zenith </em>case, the censors and the Mayor failed to give a hearing to Zenith and an opportunity to show that the movie did not violate contemporary community standards, which our Board under a trial-type hearing will do. Also, the Chicago Board didn’t state why the permit was refused. Our Board will give a detailed explanation in the event of a refusal. Furthermore, the make-up and the method of selection of the Chicago Board is completely different from that of the Pennsylvania Board. Therefore, there is no possible comparison between the <em>Zenith </em>case and our present statute with the exception of standards. The standards of 'Section 155-4 of the Municipal Code of the City of Chicago are as follows: “If a picture or series of pictures, for the showing or exhibition of which an application for a permit is made, is immoral or <em>obscene, </em>or portrays, depravity, criminality, or lack of virtue of a class of citizens of any race, color, creed, or religion and exposes them to contempt, derision, or obloquy, or tends to produce a breach of the peace or riots, or purports to represent any hanging, lynching, or burning of a human be<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>ing, . . .” (Emphasis supplied.) That these standards are more far reaching in scope than those of the Act in question is plain. Our very narrow standards are “obscene” and “incite to crime”, the latter applying only to children. But the important thing to bear in mind is that the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals did not question the standards in Section 155-4, and stated that, “The relief requested by plaintiff shall be granted unless the city provides a hearing consistent with the <em>standards </em>set out herein within a reasonable time after Zenith’s resubmission of the film to proper city authorities. If the film is found <em>obscene </em>or otherwise objectionable after a proper procedural determination by the city authorities, plaintiff may then challenge before the district court <em>such finding </em>of <em>obscenity ” </em>(Emphasis supplied.)
