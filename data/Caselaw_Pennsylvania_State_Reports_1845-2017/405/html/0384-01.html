It is claimed that the requisition pa<a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>pers do not satisfy the requirements of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act of July 8, 1941, P. L. 288, 19 PS §191.1 et seq.</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[244,491,1150,480]]]'>On July 14, 1959 the appellant Crist pleaded guilty in Tennessee to burglary and was sentenced to three years, the sentence to begin on the expiration of a sentence he was then serving in Leavenworth. Upon his release from Leavenworth he was returned to Pittsburgh on a prior hold order for trial on a pending case. A verdict of not guilty was found. He was detained on a warrant of extradition to Tennessee which he now attacks in a habeas corpus proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[240,992,1150,628]]]'>The Tennessee extradition papers contain the request of the Governor of that State for extradition alleging that appellant is a fugitive, the request by the district attorney general to the Governor of Tennessee setting forth all the relevant facts, including the allegation that appellant is a fugitive, and asking that a requisition be issued to the Governor of Pennsylvania. Included in the extradition papers are the indictment, certified copies of the guilty plea of Crist to a burglary charge, and the sentence of three years imposed by the jury. The Governor of Pennsylvania issued an extradition warrant.</p>

He claims he is not a fugitive who is extraditable under Section 3 because the requisition papers sent up from Tennessee contain no date for the alleged crime other than the month and year: “-day of August, 1958.” He relies on Section 3 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, 1941, July 8, P. L. 288, §3, 19 PS §191.3, which provides in part: “No demand for the extradition of a person charged with crime in another state shall be recognized by the Governor unless in writing, alleging, except in cases arising under section 6, that the accused was present in the demanding <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>state at the time of the commission of the alleged crime and that thereafter he fled from the state . . .”</p>
    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[117,449,1151,580]]]'>His claim is that there was no allegation he was present in the demanding state at the time of the crime. The appellant chooses, to ignore the fact that the certified record of sentence from Tennessee showed that he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years by a jury, thus admitting his presence in Tennessee at the time of the offense. At the very least, by his plea of guilty and sentence he has admitted his implication in this crime and thus could be extradited under Section 6, as a principal outside the demanding state at the time of the commission of the crime.</p>
    <p id="b423-6" data-blocks='[["BL_423.6",423,[117,1049,1152,361]]]'>Section 6 gives the Governor discretion to extradite where the person was not in the demanding state at the time of the offense but could be held criminally responsible there.

The extradition warrant is prima facie evidence of the existence of every fact which the executive authority was obliged to determine before issuing it: [Citing cases]. The burden was upon relator to come forward with evidence to overcome the prima facie case of validity of the warrant upon its introduction. This he failed to do. . . .</p>
    <p id="b424-4" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[258,936,1149,966]]]'>“Nor are we satisfied that the requisition and supporting papers failed to allege that relator was in Virginia at the time of the alleged crime. The requisition alleged that he stands charged with breaking and entering, certified that this is a crime in Virginia, ‘committed in the County of Arlington in . . . [Virginia]/ and that relator fled from ‘the justice’ of Virginia. The copy of the indictment found, referred to and annexed to the requisition, charged that relator ‘did, while in said county [Arlington County, Virginia] . . . feloniously break and enter.’ There can be no doubt that these, averments charge that relator committed a crime, that he was present in Virginia at the time of its commission, and that he fled therefrom. ' Although not in the words of the Act, we cannot but hold that the averments are a substantial compliance with its provisions and sufficient upon which to base the warrant.” (Italics supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[254,1915,1150,358]]]'>The case at bar is even stronger. Not only does the indictment say “then and there with force and arms feloniously and forcibly did commit burglary by breaking and entering a certain house of Herman D.

    <p id="b425-6" data-blocks='[["BL_425.6",425,[135,1097,1149,262]]]'>2. Appellant argues further that Section 5 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, 19 PS §191.5, providing that there may be extradition in the manner provided in §23, if such person left the demanding state involuntarily, will not permit his extradition.</p>

Section 23 (II) applies to a convict who “has escaped from confinement”. This section was never intended by the Legislature to prevent the extradition of persons convicted of crime in several jurisdictions.</p>
