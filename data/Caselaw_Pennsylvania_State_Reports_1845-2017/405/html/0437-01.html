Bulletin”, the official publication of the Philadelphia Association of Retail Druggists. Defendant Elkins wrote an article, with the knowledge and approval of defendant Ominsky, which was published in the February, 1960 edition of “Pharmacy Speaks”. Plaintiff charged that the following paragraphs in the article libeled him. “Mr. Hyman C. Bogash, Secretary of P.A.R.D. . . . stalled and maneuvered . . . and finally got the P.A. R.D. Executive Committee to withdraw the promised cooperation. As a result I could not use the P.A.R.D. Emblem or its Bulletin. Something of great value and due the members was denied You because of one individual, Mr. Bogash.”</p>

The net result was that it [the program presented to the pharmacists entitled ‘Today’s Prescription is the Biggest Bargain in History’] was tabled without due consideration for the merit of the program. What is worse: is that anything this man says or does is sufficient to put the Mss of death on anything presented, unless he places his stamp of approval.
