        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal by the City Commissioners of Philadelphia from an Order in mandamus by the Court of Common Pleas No. 4 to enforce a decree, of the Court of Quarter Sessions. The actions of the lower Courts in connection with a division of the 22nd Ward have produced a comedy of confusion, but the relevant facts may be briefly summarized as follows:\nOn September 13, 1957, Judge Milner in Court of Quarter Sessions appointed a commission to investigate division of the 22nd Ward under tbe Act of June 25, 1937, P. L. 2080.\nOn November 12, 1957, Judge Milner in Court of Quarter Sessions ordered an election on the division of the Ward at the May 20, 1958, primary and stated the boundary to be, inter alia, Wissahiclcon Avenue.\nOn December 20, 1957, President Judge Bok in Court of Quarter Sessions ordered a relocation of the boundary between the 22nd and 21st Wards in the Andorra Section from Wissahiclcon Avenue to Wissahickon Creek under the Act of July 9, 1897, P. L. 217, effective upon the division of the 22nd Ward. This resulted in the Andorra section, which was formerly in the 22nd Ward, becoming a part of the 21st Ward.\nOn May 22,1958, Judge Milner in Court of Quarter Sessions decreed a division of the 22nd Ward into the 22nd and 59th Wards and fixed the boundaries between the 59th Ward and 21st Ward at Wissahiclcon Avenue. Under this decree the Andorra section remained in the 59th Ward which, as we have seen, was formerly part of the 22nd Ward.\nOn August 8, 1958, Judge Milner, in Court of Quarter Sessions, decreed the establishment of the Andorra section as the 43rd Election District of the 59th Ward (formerly part of the 22nd Ward).\nOn October 21, 1958, Judge Waters in Court of Quarter Sessions, set aside the Order of President Judge Bok relocating fhe boundary between the 21st and 22nd Wards in the Andorra section without prejudice to proceed according to law after the election of November, 1958.\nOn March 9, 1959, the appellees filed a Complaint in Mandamus with the Court of Common Pleas No. 4 to enforce President Judge Bok\u2019s Order of December 20, 1951. After appellants answered, appellees joined and moved for judgment on the pleadings, which motion was granted on November 14, 1959. This was affirmed by the Court en banc and the City has taken this appeal.\nOf the many contentions raised by appellants only one need be considered. We hold that the Court of Quarter Sessions has exclusive jurisdiction of the subject matter and the Court of Common Pleas does not have jurisdiction or power to issue an Order in Mandamus to enforce an Order of a Court of Quarter Sessions! Commonwealth ex rel. v. Holland, 153 Pa. 233, 25 A. 1123.\nOrder reversed.",
