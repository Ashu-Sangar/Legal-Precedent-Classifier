The material facts incident to this issue are recited in an opinion in a companion case filed herewith (Fitch Appeal (No. 1), 405 Pa. 169, 174 A. 2d 232) and need no repetition.\nThe requested review herein concerns an order of the common pleas court in an' appeal from a decision of the county election board under Section 1407 of the Election Code. This section expressly states that \u201cNo appeal shall be allowed . . . from any order or decree of the court of common pleas made in pursuance of this section.\u201d An examination of this section and interrelated sections of the Code clearly indicates that orders and decisions- of the court of common pleas in this type of proceeding shall be deemed final and conclusive.\nHence, the appeal comes before us on narrow certiorari and the inquiry is limited to a question of jurisdiction; the regularity of the proceedings; whether or not the lower court exceeded its power and authority and whether or not there was a violation of constitutional rights: DeVito v. Civil Service Commission, 404 Pa. 354, 172 A. 2d 161; Dauphin Deposit Trust Company v. Myers, 388 Pa. 444, 460, 130 A. 2d 686; Chase Appeal, 389 Pa. 538, 133 A. 2d 824 (1957), and Cullen Appeal, 392 Pa. 602, 141 A. 2d 389 (1958). We cannot on this appeal consider the validity of individual votes: Focht\u2019s Appeal, 275 Pa. 449, 119 A. 494 (1923).\nThe record discloses no jurisdictional defects or irregularity in the proceedings. That the lower court\u2019s adjudication was judicial action is beyond doubt. There was no violation of constitutional rights.\nOrder affirmed. Costs to be paid by appellant.",
