The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review and the Superior Court of Pennsylvania answered this question affirmatively.</p>
    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.9",248,[240,833,1149,695]]]'>Perkins Dawkins, claimant, was employed by the Sun Shipbuilding <em>&amp; </em>Dry Dock Company, Chester, Pa., as a third-class sheet metal worker from October 20, 1942 until August 4, 1945, when he left appellant company’s employ in order to engage in business for himself as a roofer. Claimant noted the following reason on his official separation slip: “Quit, going into business for myself.” Prom the date of his separation, claimant conducted a business as a roofing contractor, making about $35 per week, and he continued his private business until November 1945, when he was forced to give it up because he could no longer secure necessary materials for carrying on his work.</p>
    <p id="b248-6" data-blocks='[["BL_248.10",248,[241,1548,1150,806]]]'>The record establishes that on August 30,1945, Daw-kins filed a claim for unemployment benefits with his local unemployment compensation office. On that date claimant’s “benefit year” began, his “base year” being the calendar year of 1944. The Bureau of Unemployment Compensation rendered a decision on December 7,1945, declaring that claimant met all the requirements of the Unemployment Compensation Law and was therefore eligible to receive benefits. The Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., Dawkins’ base year employer, appealed from this decision and the case was referred to a Bureau Referee, who on February 27,1946, conducted a hearing. In testifying at that time, Dawkins told how he had reached a decision to resign from his employment with appellant company, as follows:</p>

After the war was over I considered two things, first, my age and I figured I would probably be one of the first ones to go because I was 57 so I took that into consideration and between time I built up myself a nice little business.” ■ '</blockquote>

    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[254,1177,1148,485]]]'>In his “Reasoning”, the Referee made the following statements: “The Referee believes that this business of claimant’s was a legitimate business and its failure' to succeed was no fault of the claimant’s and his separation therefrom can be construed as unemployed due to lack of work.

The Board of Review stated: “On the basis of these Findings [which are “supported by the evidence”], the Referee properly concluded that the claimant .cannot be disqualified under the provisions of Section 402(b) , of the Law. The unemployment for which claimant seeks benefits was due to the failure of a business enterprise and not to voluntarily leaving work, and for this reason he <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>must be found eligible for benefits with respect to tlie provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Law.”</p>

A review was granted. The Superior Court sustained the decision of the Board of Review, saying, inter alia: “Under the definition, claimant clearly was <em>not </em>unemployed until his business failed. In the interim, between the date when he left his employment and the failure of his business, he was employed since he received <em>remuneration </em>for services rendered in his business.”</p>

This rationale Ave do not accept. The initial question is: Was Dawkins an “employe” within the purview of the Unemployment Compensation Law? The Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Act defines “employe” as follows: “ ‘Employe’ means every individual, whether male, female, citizen, alien or minor, who is performing or subsequent to January first, one thousand nine hundred thirty-six, has performed services for an employer in an employment subject to this act.” 43 PS Supp. 753 (i). ;</p>

If an employe left his work to fight for his country on the field of battle his act would be praiseworthy but his patriotic motive and his willingness to sacrifice his life would not constitute the good cause which as a motive for leaving his ■ work would maintain his eligibility for compensation benefits after-wards. By “good cause” as used in the Act is obviously meant such a cause as justifies an employe’s voluntarily leaving the ranks of the employed and joining the ranks of the unemployed. For example, if an employe was compelled to work in a position where his life was constantly menaced by a heavy object over his head which .was suspended from the ceiling by a palpably inadequate or defective chain, he could successfully plead “good cause” for voluntarily leaving his employment. The same would.be true if he was- compelled to work under inexcusable conditions which were palpably, detrimental to his health, such as working in a mine or a factory where the supply of fresh air was obviously insufficient to sustain life.</p>

Five members of the Court declared that the claimant in leaving her job in order to be with her husband left her work “with good cause”. ■ This latter conclusion was not necessary to a decision of the case. We express no agreement with the dictum that such a “humanly justifiable cause” as “the impulse which induces a devoted wife to spend with a husband, who is a member of the Armed Forces in time of war, what may prove to be the last days they shall ever be together on earth” (as the Superior Court expressed it) constitutes a “good cause” for leaving a job, within the meaning of the Act.</p>

Without consulting his employer and without seeking any information as to his probable employment tenure he decided that he would leave the ranks of wage earners and become a business man, and so on August 4,1945 he became “customarily engaged in an independent business”, that of roofing. He continued “on his own” from August until November, when he discovered that by his change of <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>status be bad worsened his economic position.

Claimant can be restored to his former status of an employe only by <em>again </em>performing as an employe “services for an employer in any employment subject to this Act”. The “good cause” which compelled claimant to terminate his career as an individual contractor cannot be used as a substitute for the not-good cause which impelled him to leave the employ of the Shipbuilding Company.</p>

He is still an employe, though out of work, if (1) his being out of work was not willed by himself, or (2) if his being out of work was voluntary but was based on a “good cause” within the meaning of the Act. The “good cause” which justifies an employe’s terminating his relations with his employer must, other than in those exceptional cases where <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>reasons “personal to the employe” may nnder a certain state of facts be adjudged “good”, be one connected with Ms employment. He certainly is not within the “good cause” provision if he quits his employment in order to comply with the wishes of his wife, or in order to marry a girl who made his quitting his employment a condition precedent to the marriage, or because of some whimsical desire or fancy or ambition of his own.

L. (1937) 2897, as amended, was enacted “for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.” In that case we also said (p. 48) : “It is impossible to give a general definition of ‘good .cause’. The meaning of those words must be determined in each case from the facts of that case.” We added: “‘good cause’ must be so interpreted that the fundamental purpose of the legislation shall not be destroyed.” Even in matters connected with his employment there must be some limit to the legally approved list of “good causes” for quitting employment. The quitting must be for such a cause as would reasonably motivate in a similar situation the average able-bodied and qualified worker to give up his or her employment with its certain wage rewards in order to enter the ranks of the “compensated unemployed”.</p>

If every reason which appeals to an employe’s bead or his heart is to be accepted as a “good cause” for his or her voluntarily leaving a job in a locality where there is no other work available, the Unemployment Compensation Law will become in many instances an invitation to a compensated rest.</p>

When his private venture failed he did not ipso facto become an unemployed employe— he became an unemployed <em>businessman.</em>
