      <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>At about six o’clock on a December evening one Brice was driving a truck on the business of his employers, Staats Oil Company, wéstwardly in Paoli upon the Lincoln Highway which there consists of a. concrete four lane roadway forty feet wide with paved shoulders four feet in width. As Brice approached the point where Chestnut Road comes in at a dead-end from the south he Vas driving with the headlights of his truck On high beam, at a speed of 30 to 35 miles an hour, in the inner of the two lanes for west-bound traffic. The weather was clear and admittedly there was nothing to obstruct his view for a distance of 200 feet as he came toward the intersection. Pie there saw “a dark object” in his lane of traffic at a distance ahead of less than twenty feet; whereupon he swerved to the left but the right front fender of his truck carné into contact with the “object”, which turned out to be plaintiff’s decedent Brooks. After striking Brooks the truck “slid” forward and across the east-bound lanes of the highway a distance of about 100 feet and crashed into a telephone pole to the south of the road with such force that the front bumper, the grill, the headlights, the radiator and the fenders were badly damaged. Brooks sustained a fractured skull; was rendered unconscious, and died within a few minutes of the impact; his body was found lying upon the highway at about the dividing line between the two west-bound traffic lanes a few feet west of the Chestnut Road intersection.

Defendants rely upon well-known principles of law, namely, (1) that the mere fact that a collision has occurred between a pedestrian and a motor vehicle, in the absence of evidence as to the manner of its occurrence, affords no basis for inferring that one party rather than the other was at fault <em>(Balducci v.

Speer, </em><a href="/pa/323/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="323 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="1169574" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0443-01">323 Pa. 443</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20618" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="185 A. 618">185 A. 618</a>; <em>Skrutski v.

But it is elementary (1) that it is the duty of the driver of a motor vehicle to have his car at all times under such control as to be able to stop it before injuring a person in any situation reasonably likely to arise under the circumstances <em>(Galliano v.

The testimony, however, does not give sanction to such a conclusion, but, on the contrary; warrants an <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>inference that Brice was not sufficiently attentive to the pathway ahead of him. He admitted that when he first saw Brooks the latter was in the center of the lane in which the truck was traveling; if Brooks was <em>standing </em>there, or if he was in the act of walking <em>longitudinally </em>along the highway, Brice was bound to have seen him had he been properly on the lookout; on the other hand, if Brooks was <em>crossing </em>the highway he must have traversed, even from the nearest side, a distance of at least nineteen feet, and, when it is borne in mind that he was a man 75 years of age and not a child or young lad apt to dart out or spring across, it would certainly be for a jury to determine whether Brice, with a clear vision ahead furnished by the headlights of his truck, and considering the care which the law required of him in approaching the Chestnut Road intersection, was negligent in failing to see Brooks during the period of time necessarily consumed by him in coming to the center of the inner lane on which the truck was proceeding. There was some vague testimony as to the presence of another vehicle traveling in the outer, of the west-bound traffic lanes at some undisclosed distance ahead of the truck, but there is nothing whatever to connect it with the happening of the accident; it is not necessary for a plaintiff to eliminate all possible causes of an accident other than that on which he relies but only such as are fairly suggested by the evidence: <em>Saganowich v.

As the case is being remanded for retrial it may not be amiss at this time to declare that by the term “expenses of administration” in that Act the legislature could scarcely have intended the recovery of such items as those thus claimed, but only the cost of obtaining letters testamentary or of administration in order to qualify the plaintiff for the purpose of bringing suit. The term “expenses of administration” is employed in conjunction with hospital, nursing, medical and funeral expenses, and it would seem clear that all these items are intended to cover only such expenses as are <em>immediately </em>attendant upon, and related to, the decedent’s injuries and death.</p>
