The will and first codicil were probated and are not contested. The disputed second codicil appoints a brother and a former employee (appellees) as executors and trustees in the place of decedent’s attorney and friend (appellant).

An issue <em>devisavit vel non </em>was awarded to determine four questions (1) Was the disputed document executed by decedent? (2) At .the time of the execution was [decedent] of sound and disposing mind, memory and understanding? (3) Was the execution of the instrument produced by, or the result of, undue influence exerted upon the testator at the time of the making thereof?

He testified that Mr. Worrall had stated that if decedent wanted that done the decedent must give Mr. Worrall personal direction to that effect. In Mr. Worrall’s presence, and with his permission, Palermo then telephoned decedent, advising him of Mr. Worrall’s statement, and received instructions to return to decedent’s office. Upon returning to the office, at decedent’s request, Mr. Palermo telephoned David R. Griffith, Jr., a lawyer and brother of decedent, and informed him that decedent desired to see him. Within a day or two thereafter, appellee David Griffith called at decedent’s office and in Mr. Palermo’s presence was told by decedent that he wished to change his will by substituting Mr. Griffith and Mr. Palermo as the executors. Mr. Griffith thereupon prepared the disputed document in decedent’s office on -his billing machine. David Griffith testified that he wrote the disputed paper <em>as a form </em>to show his brother what a codicil would look like; that the co-fiduciary’s name was incorrectly spelled <em>Pauumbo </em>instead of <em>Palermo; </em>that decedent handed the paper back to Mr. Griffith and asked him: “Where did you get that spelling from?” David Griffith testified that he informed decedent he would prepare a new codicil, free from errors, on Mr. Griffith’s <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>own typewriter; that on or abont March 1941, David Griffith prepared a codicil (original and carbon copy) in his own office, containing in substance the same provisions as in the disputed codicil and took it to decedent at the decedent’s office where the original was duly executed in the presence of subscribing witnesses Riley and Hughes.

In that case testator wrote his will by filling in a blank printed form in his own handwriting. He wrote his name in three blank spaces in the paper, first at the top, then in the testimonium clause and then in the attestation clause. He did not <em>sign </em>his name at the end of the paper. It is apparent that in writing his name in the three blank spaces in the form, decedent did not intend Ms name <em>as a signature. </em>A writing in of a name, in those circumstances, was not a signature and did not constitute an execution of a will in conformity with section 6 of the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249, re-enacted by section 2 of the Wills Act of 1917, supra. This Court has repeatedly said that the end of the will is the logical end of the disposition in its obvious inherent sense. The place chosen by this decedent to affix his signature was at the point where the appointment of his executors and trustees was consummated. It was at the logical and sequential end of the instrument although not at the physical or spatial end. <em>Brown Estate, </em><a href="/pa/347/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="347 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="1217351" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0244-01">347 Pa. 244</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%2022" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="32 A.2d 22">32 A. 2d 22</a>; <em>Coyne Will, </em><a href="/pa/349/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="349 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="458395" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0331-01">349 Pa. 331</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.2d%20509" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="37 A.2d 509">37 A. 2d </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.2d%20509" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="37 A.2d 509">509</a>; Brown, Admr., v.

These words formed no part of decedent’s testamentary dispositions. A handwriting-expert testified that the impress of the word “copy” was in the handwriting of Mr. Palermo. It was not maintained that decedent had written the word copy or the initials. It was not affirmatively established who wrote the words or who had erased them. The alteration— writing and its erasure — was immaterial. If made by Mr. Palermo, it was made by a stranger. If made by decedent, the result would be the same. Being an immaterial alteration, the validity of the instrument would not be affected: <em>Grubbs et al. v.
