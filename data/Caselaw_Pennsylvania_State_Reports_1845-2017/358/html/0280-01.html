While judicial interpretation of a will is aimed to ascertain the intention of the testator and may therefore, in some instances, lead to the conclusion that a bequest, though not formally expressed in the will, is nevertheless implied, such an inference is justified only if the testator’s intention to that effect is so clear as to be beyond reasonable <em>doubt;</em>

Since a surviving wife is a statutory heir of her deceased husband <em>(Barnard Estate, </em><a href="/pa/351/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="351 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="462716" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0313-01">351 Pa. 313</a>, 315, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20578" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="41 A.2d 578">41 A. 2d 578</a>, 579) it follows that the court was right in recognizing the widows of Joseph H.

If it did, <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>then, unquestionably, Sec. 15(c) of tlie Wills Act of 1917 became operative to determine the disposition to be made of the property embraced by the bequest, once freed from the trust. However, this Court now holds otherwise; and I fail to see how it can possibly be said that the bequest in question did not fail. If it didn’t, then what became of it? Certainly, no effect is being given to it. Yet, it was fully capable of endowing the “children and heirs at law” of J. Arthur Lindsay with one-fourth of the residual trust fund in remainder had he died leaving issue surviving. But, since he died without leaving issue surviving, the bequest to his children and heirs at law (which otherwise would have been effectual) necessarily failed but <em>only </em>because of a want of the beneficiaries so designated. The property, now in controversy, undeniably constituted <em>a part of the general residuary estate </em>which the testatrix placed in trust by her will for the duration of certain lives. Furthermore, in like testamentary manner, she plainly attempted to make ultimate and final disposition in remainder of the whole of the residual corpus. Had J. Arthur Lindsay died in the lifetime of the testatrix, not leaving issue surviving, and had the testatrix thereafter not made any change in her will, would it be contended that the bequest of one-fourth of the residue to J. Arthur Lindsay’s “children and heirs at law” did not lapse? The situation can be no different because J. Arthur Lindsay happened to survive the testatrix but died (five years later) without leaving issue surviving.</p>

The <em>Rickenbach </em>case, itself citing <em>Know’s Estate, </em>supra, does contain the statement that Sec. 15(c) “does not affect an undisposed of share”.

      <em>Knox’s Estate </em>has no bearing'on'the question here involved. <em>There was no legacy to lapse in Know’s' Estate </em>and, therefore, none lapsed.' It so happens that Sec. 15(c) was urged upon this Court in that case, but, in the very nature of the circumstances there present, Sec. 15(c) was not' properly invoked. Consequently, the decision in the Kno* case does not, nor could it have been intended to, constitute a' construction or application of Sec. 15(c).- It is true that, in answering the fallacious contention there made, that’ there was a béquest to Hugh which was “otherwise incapable of taking effect” and which accordingly failed, this Court did say that “. . . <em>this bequest does take effect; it passes to distrib-utees designated by the intestate law, </em>and therefore does not go to the [testator’s] three surviving children alone; it is not a lapsed legacy”. (Emphasis supplied.) Of course, that statement could not have' been intended to <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>mean that there was a bequest under, the <em>Knox </em>will of a lapsed legacy which -took effect <em>as a testamentary disposition </em>“to distributees designated by the intestate law”. The intestate law, ■ as is well known, -operates wholly independently of and never in relation, to a testation. Consequently, a testamentary distribution by virtue of an intestacy could hardly have been contemplated as having prevented a legacy from lapsing. This Court’s meritorious answer to the contention made in the <em>Knox </em>case was that there was <em>neither a devise nor a bequest </em>to Hugh or to any one of his line after his death. In short, there was no bequest to lapse. What was said in that case is, therefore, not presently in point in any event.</p>

Viola died without leaving children but left surviving a husband who took her share as her devisee. Obviously, Sec. 15(c) was of no bearing in that situation, and the statement in <em>the Riekenbach </em>case that “It [i. e., Sec. 15(c)] does not affect an undisposed of share” was but <em>obiter </em>gratuitously laid upon <em>Knox’s Estate. </em>True enough, Sec. 15(c) “does not affect an undisposed of share”. That is necessarily and uniformly so. Sec. 15(c) is applicable only to cases of failed or void devises or bequests' <em>of parts of the residuary estate </em>and you never have an undisposed-of share in the case of a will containing a general residuary clause. Why a failed or void bequest of <em>a share in the residue </em>was formerly distributed according to the intestate law was because of the peculiar English rule which thé second sentence of Sec. 15(c) was specifically inserted to offset as we shall hereinafter see.</p>

The rule of law that will work such a result under the new Wills Act is that portion of Sec. 14(10) which carries forward <em>unchanged </em>the pertinent provision of Sec. 15(c) of the Wills Act of 1917. In other words, if the surviving residuary remaindermen would take the J. Arthur Lindsay share in the trust estate under the present will (assuming the testatrix died after January 1, 1948) by virtue of Sec. 14(10) of the new Wills Act, as the majority opinion implies would be the case, then, on a parity of reasoning, the residuary <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>remaindermen should now take the same interest under Sec. 15(c) of the Wills Act of 1917.

(Italics supplied for identification later.) The comment at page 56 of the report of the Joint State Government Commission (1947) states that Sec. 14(10), as above quoted, “replaces the second sentence of Sec. 15(c) of the 1917 act, . . .”. The comment then states that the added words (“shall not be available” etc. under the “favored relative” clause) “give statutory recognition to the conclusion of Desh’s Est., <a href="/pa/321/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="321 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="1165818" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0286-01">321 Pa. 286</a>, which held that other residuary shares are not increased so long as issue of the favored relative survive the testator”. But, the “favored relative” clause is not material to the facts of the instant case, so the first added clause furnishes no pertinent argument even by implication. Again, the other words of Sec. 14(10) which also are new (viz., “if the disposition shall not be otherwise expressly provided for by law”) merely specify a contingency in the event whereof Sec. 14(10) will not become operative.* And, by like token, that clause adds nothing materially dispositive to what the existing law (Sec. 15(c)) already contains. Eliminating, therefore, the specified new clauses of Sec. 14(10) (which have no bearing on our present question), it will be seen that the new Wills Act (Sec. 14(10)) provides what in material regard the above-italicized portions embrace, viz., <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>“When a devise or bequest [lapsed or void] . . . shall be included in a .residuary clause of the will . •. . , it shall pass to the other residuary devisees or legatees, if any there be, in proportion to their respective shares or interests in the residue”, which is precisely the same as the second sentence of Sec. 15(c). of the Wills Act of 1917 now provides, viz., “In any case where such devise or bequest which shall fail or be void, or shall be revoked as aforesaid, shall be contained in the residuary clause of such will, it shall pass to and be divided among the other residuary devisees or legatees, if any. there be, in proportion to their respective interests in such residue”.</p>

While, ordinarily,. a lapsed, legacy has always fallen into the residuary estate, the English rule, formerly followed in this State, was- to other effect where the legacy which failed <em>was itself a part of the residue. </em>In such event, an intestacy <em>pro tanto </em>occurred and the quantum of the legacy went to the next of kin. The rationale of the English rule, which Mr. Justice Mitchell . characterized “as wrong in principle and subversive of the great canon of construction, the carrying out of the intent of the testator”, lay in the sophism that residuary legatees aré “given specific: portions of the residuum, and [can] not take more, by the intent of the will . . .”. As to that, the same learned Justice said (p. 74), — ^“The rule thus established does not commend itself to sound reasoning, and is a sacrifice of the settled presumption that a testator does not mean, to die intestate as to any portion of <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>his estate, and' also of Ms plain actual intent, shown in the appointment of general residuary legatees, that his next of ldn shall' not participate in' the distribution at all”.</p>

Here, the testatrix, after cutting off her brother and his line of descent with a five dollar bequest to him, gave one-half of the residue of her considerable estate outright to her two sisters in equal shares. The remaining one-half of the residue she placed in trust with the directions to the trustee to pay the income therefrom to her two sisters or the survivor of them for life and,, upon the death of the survivor, then to her four nephews (being the sons of the same two sisters) for their lives with the provision that one-fourth of the corpus of the trust estate should be distributed among the children and heirs at law of a nephew upon his dying “leaving lawful issue surviving”. Thus, the testatrix clearly indicated her testamentary intent that the residuary trust estate should ultimately be distributed among the children and heirs at law of persons in the line of descent from her two sisters and, on the other hand, demonstrated an equally clear intent that her brother and those claiming under him should not participate in the distribution of the residue of her estate. The vice of this Court’s present decision lies not only in the fact that the children and heirs at law of the testatrix’s nephews will not receive aggregately in remainder the .entire residuary trust corpus but also in the further fact that the estate of the deliberately excised brother will receive under the intestate law an inheritance of more than ten thousand dollars from the estate of the testatrix. It would be difficult to imagine a more classical illustration of the kind of situation which Sec. 15(c). of the Wills Act of 1917 was designed to correct: cf. <em>Thompson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/304/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="304 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1132416" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0349-01">304 Pa. 349</a>, 355, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.%20925" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="155 A. 925">155 A. 925</a>.</p>
