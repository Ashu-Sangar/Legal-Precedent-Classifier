    <p id="b416-10" data-blocks='[["BL_416.17",416,[267,1185,1146,592]]]'>This case grows out of a suit and counterclaim for damages due to injuries to person and property suffered in a collision at a right-angle highway intersection in open country between a Ford sedan owned and driven by the plaintiff and a truck owned and operated by the defendant. At the conclusion of the plaintiff’s case, the learned trial judge, on the defendant’s motion, entered a compulsory nonsuit which the court en banc later refused to take off and entered a judgment in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff for costs. It is from that judgment that the plaintiff brings this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b416-11" data-blocks='[["BL_416.18",416,[263,1796,1148,541]]]'>The sole question here involved is whether the evidence adduced by the plaintiff convicts him of contributory negligence as a matter of law. In considering that question, we necessarily view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, giving him the benefit of all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom and resolving every doubt or obscure fact in his favor: <em>McCreery v.

Berwick Turnpike runs north and south, and the Springfield-Smithfield Road, east and west. The countryside in the vicinity is slightly rolling, but, at the intersection, the highways are on a substantially level or even grade. There were no stop signs on either road at or near the intersection.</p>
    <p id="b417-4" data-blocks='[["BL_417.5",417,[194,813,1145,811]]]'>About 7 A.M. on November 4, 1941, a bright, clear, dry day, Sargeant, the plaintiff, was driving his Ford sedan along Berwick Turnpike in a northerly direction toward Ayers Corners. As he was proceeding through the intersection his automobile collided with the defendant’s truck which, loaded with milk cans, was travelling eastwardly on the Springfield-Smithfield Road. As a result of the collision, the direction of travel of the plaintiff’s automobile was changed so that, while it remained in an upright position, i. e., on its four wheels, it was pushed or propelled to a point along the north side of the Springfield-Smithfield Road about ninety feet east of the intersection. The defendant’s truck was completely overturned, also along the north side of the same road and east of, but closer to, the intersection.</p>

At the time in question a bread-delivery truck was parked in front of the service station. Several shade trees, spaced a considerable distance apart, were along the south side of the road just west of the intersection. The service station, bread-delivery truck and trees constituted the only obstructions to the views the two drivers respectively had of each other’s vehicle as they approached the intersection. At a distance of about forty feet along the Ber-wick Turnpike, south of the intersection, the view of the <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>Springfield-Smithfield Road to tbe west (i.e., the direction from which the defendant’s truck was approaching) was-clear and unobstructed; and, as-both roads were straight for-a distance,of approximately six hundred feet at Ayers Corners and as there were no continuous obstructions to. a clear view,, each' driver had a fair and unobstructed view of the- other,’ as the undeniable physical circumstances show, for equal, and substantial distances as they approached the intersection.'</p>

The plaintiff’s admitted failure to see the approaching truck is explainable only on the ground that he was inattentive; and inattention in such a situation is negligence: see <em>Sweet v.
