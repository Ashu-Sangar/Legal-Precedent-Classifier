A life tenant who takes possession of the assets without giving bond is not a trustee for the remaindermen but is a debtor to them the same as if she had given a bond: Gillett’s Est., supra; Strawbridge’s Est., 14 D. &amp; C. 703, (Gest, J.); see also Kirkpatrick’s Est., supra.

What shall be its penalty and conditions? Any bond that could be devised would limit her discretion, in a way never intended by her husband. He permitted her to decide for herself how much she should spend. If we put her under an obligation to consume none, or only a part, we take away her clear right. He gave to those in remainder nothing, in case she left nothing. If we secure them any particular sum, we award to them what they have no title for. It is argued, that she ought to give bond to use it providently, and to leave at her death, all that she does not need during her life. I repeat, that she alone is to be the judge of-her wants. The testator gave her the <em>full </em>use of the money. He trusted her, and we must do the same.’ ”</p>

Justice Kephart (later Chief Justice) said, p. 587: “. . . This decree did not, however, fasten a trusteeship on the life tenant with respect to that property; to say ‘in trust’ was purely a gratuitous and voluntary statement on the part of the judge who made the decree, for there was no controversy on such a question, or on any other question, before the court at that time.
