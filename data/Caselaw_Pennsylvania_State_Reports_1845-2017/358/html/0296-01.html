Shortly after midnight on July 5,1946, appellant entered a taproom on the northwest corner of 21st and Norris Streets for the purpose of buying a quart of beer. During the preceding day he had been drinking. The taproom was crowded; Holley went up to the bar where one Earl Kent asked a friend, Albert Rowlings, to buy Kent a drink, whereupon appellant said: “You don’t have to <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>buy Mm a drink. I’ll buy Mm a drink.” A quarrel ensued whereupon someone said: “Kill that nigger.” Appellant immediately drew a pistol, pulled up Ms coat, backed off towards the door, and upon reacMng the doorway, fired two shots into the crowded barroom. He then went around the corner to another entrance a few feet distant and fired a third shot through the door. Ella Wiggins was seated in a booth on the east side of the taproom, and the third shot pierced her heart. She died shortly thereafter. Appellant had lived in an apartment in the same house in which the deceased and her sister resided. She had remonstrated with appellant for gambling with one Floyd Hoskins who, on several occasions, had visited him and who was also her friend.</p>

Thereafter he made a statement to the police in which he said on this night he was going around to various taprooms carrying a pistol stuck in his belt; that the crowd in the taproom had threatened him; and, because they said, “Let’s kill him” he had pulled the gun out and told one of the men in particular to stop coming towards him, whereupon he started to fire.</p>

L. 158, 19 PS Section 631, is untenable. The portion of the charge reads: “Introduced in evidence on the part of the Commonwealth was a statement made by the defendant when he was apprehended two or three months after the occurrence, having fled the jurisdiction in the meanwhile, in which he confessed to the shooting and killing, and in which he gave his version of it. You will have to decide which version to accept, although I must point out to you that the defendant’s version of that killing was not given from the witness stand, but it was included in the statement which he gave to the police. Ho you believe that is an accurate statement, or do you believe, since he was charged with the crime, he was giving a statement of the facts calculated to sort of clear him somewhat? You see, he is the defendant here and you have to study his version of it in the light of his position in the case. He does not have to take the stand to testify on his own behalf if he does not want to, and the fact that he does not is not to be taken as an admission of guilt of any particular degree of crime. It was frankly stated that the question of guilt as to the fact of the deed committed is not litigated here, and the case was tried, as I followed the arguments, on the question of the degree of crime of which the defendant is guilty.”</p>
