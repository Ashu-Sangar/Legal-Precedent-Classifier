L. 1019, section 58, 46 PS 558. We all agree that the undisputed facts present a case that is not within the terms of the Act for unless defendant’s acts are clearly prohibited, there is no violation of the statute. An important fact is that defendant does “not hold itself out to the public as willing, able or authorized to do any business except title insurance business.” The other important fact is: defendant prepares “deeds, mortgages, assignments of mortgages, agreements (but relating solely to real estate matters), releases of real estate and declarations of no set-off and no other legal instruments, but we have prepared the foregoing instruments only for persons to or for whom applications for title insurance had been issued or were contemplated to be issued by [defendant] and then only in situations, instances, and circumstances in which such instruments were incidental to the insuring by [defendant] of titles to real estate.” In considering those facts it is well to have in mind that the statute <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>under which defendant was incorporated expressly conferred “power and right to make, execute, and perfect such and so many contracts, agreements, policies, and other instruments as may be required therefor.”</p>

    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[206,838,1164,964]]]'>I All the acts in question have to do with the transfer 'of title, that is, with conveyances and conveyancing. In ‘order to decide whether defendant will insure a title, defendant must first examine and pass upon the instrument or instruments evidencing the transfer. Its charter authorizes all steps necessary for the enjoyment of its corporate franchise.. If examination of the instrument discloses defects that the insurer thinks must be corrected before the title can be insured, it must of course be redrawn in the interest of both insurer and insured. Drawing the ■ instrument correctly in the first place is no more unauthorized practice of law than examining or approving it after it has been drawn, or returning it for correction after it has been found to have been erro-niously drawn. To examine and pass on the provisions of the instrument can therefore not be held to be unauthorized practice of law; on the contrary, it is authorized.</p>

The legislature in the Building &amp; Loan Code of 1933, P. L. 457, 15 PS 1074, recognized con-veyancers among the officers of such associations: sec. 410, P. L. 479, 15 PS 1074. From the earliest days in this Commonwealth, justices of the peace, aldermen and local magistrates have drawn and still continue to draw leases, deeds and mortgages without holding themselves out as lawyers or engaging in the practice of law in the sense condemned by the statute. Real estate brokers <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>perform the same acts as incidents of their business.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> All this the legislature must have known when it passed the Act of 1899 and its amendments, but notwithstanding such knowledge, it is significant that the legislature gave no expression of intention to prohibit those practices.

If such condemnation had been intended by the legislature we think that intention ivould have been expressed.

With respect to real estate brokers,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> the court said at page 14, “There can be no objection to the preparation of deeds and mortgages or other contracts by such brokers so long as the papers involved pertain to and grow out of their business transactions and are intimately connected therewith. The drafting and execution of legal instruments is a necessary concomitant of many businesses and cannot be considered unlawful. Such practice only falls within the prohibition of the act when the documents are drawn in relation to matters in no manner connected with the immediate business of the person preparing them, and when the person so drafting them is not a member of <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>the bar and holds himself out as specially qualified and competent to do that type of work.
