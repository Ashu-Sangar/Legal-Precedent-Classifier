Over a door, which was closed, was hung a black and white painted sign marked “Ladies”. Plaintiff went through the doorway, closed the door and proceeded along a partially illuminated corridor, at the end of which were piled nearly to the ceiling boxes and barrels. She testified: “I heard dishes rattling, and I just thought that [the end of the hall] was the kitchen, and I didn’t go back that far, and the only other doorway in the hallway was the one I went into on the left, about, oh, I guess, about three yards, down the hallway on the left. So I thought it was there; so I went in there, I opened the door, looked in and saw it was dark, and I stepped in to reach for.the light, and I went down a hole.” Plaintiff stated she advanced about a foot into the room when she was precipitated into the cavity in the floor and fell “at least four feet”. The room was completely empty. After plaintiff extricated herself from the hole, she went to the counter where her husband was sitting, informed him of the accident, and requested that she be taken to the hospital. She was in the hospital 25 days. Upon her return home she was bedridden and required the attendance of a nurse. She claims she still suffers great pain, and is unable to attend to her household duties. ,</p>

This decision is without precedent in this Commonwealth, and ivill add another exception to the salutary rule that one who proceeds when he cannot see, cannot recover for injuries received as a result thereof because he himself is negligent as á matter of law. No decided case has permitted a jury to determine the question of contributory negligence where the plaintiff has admitted that he entered a totally dark room and that he could not see where he was going. The issue is not whether appellant was invited into the corridor or whether she reasonably believed the sounds of rattling dishes emanated from a kitchen at the end of a corridor. It is whether appellant exercised due care for her own safety under the circumstances — whether being unfamiliar with the premises she exercised that care when she opened a door not in any way identified as an entrance to a lavatory and being unable to see beyond the door, she nevertheless stepped forward into the room and stepped into an opening in the floor.</p>
