After a hearing, the chancellor concluded that: (1) the contract specifically provided for termination by vendor upon receipt of a higher offer; (2) the obligations contained in the contract were joint; (3) vendor was not estopped to assert the termination clause in the contract; and (4) the bill be dismissed and costs imposed evenly upon the parties. This appeal is from the decree of the court <em>en ’banc </em>dismissing exceptions to the chancellor’s adjudication.</p>

Twenty-five hundred (.$2500) dollars was paid to vendor upon execution of the agreement and the balance to be <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>paid at tlie time of settlement within 90 days from the execution of the agreement. On or about April 15,1946, appellant, pursuant to the agreement of sale, delivered to vendor a prepared deed to be executed by the respective grantors. The deed was sent to St. Ignatius Church, Portland, Oregon, on May 7,1946, for execution and was returned without a court certificate attached to a notarial acknowledgment. On May 21, it was returned to Portland by air mail for proper certification. On June 10, it was sent to the Philadelphia Protectory for Boys for execution, then to St. Joseph’s Hospital, and sent off again on June 17.</p>

On that day it was extended by mutual agreement for 30 days, or until June 11. On June 25, appellant’s agent advised Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, vendor, that he, appellant, was prepared to make settlement and had arranged the saíne for 4:00 P. M. on Wednesday, June 26, at the office of Commonwealth Title Company. The following day, appellant was notified that vendor would not be in a position to complete settlement by reason of the fact that the deed had not yet been fully executed by all parties and further, that vendor had received a higher and more advantageous offer for the property, regarding which appellant would be more fully advised. On June 21, vendor had received an offer of $35,000 cash, which was accepted and an agreement entered on June 26, 1946.</p>

These, contentions cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[221,444,1150,974]]]'>Whether the exception stated in <em>Kane v. Girard Trust Company, </em>supra, and relied upon by appellant is applicable to contracts executed after the Act of 1945, P. L. 944, 20 PS section 818, et seq., permitting fiduciaries to reserve to themselves the right to terminate an agreement of sale upon receipt of a higher offer need not now be determined. It is sufficient that there is no evidence which would support a finding of “the fiduciaries’ arbitrary tardiness.” The record is devoid of proof of acts, representations or promises of any sort intentionally or recklessly made for the purpose of inducing appellant to refrain from asserting any legal rights which he might have had. Cf. <em>Northwestern National Bank v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/345/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="345 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="1213333" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0192-01">345 Pa. 192</a>, 196, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20A.2d%2020" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="27 A.2d 20">27 A. 2d 20</a>; <em>Fried v.

The intention of the parties must be determined from the language used in the instrument under consideration. In the instant case, the agreement of sale, considered in its entirety, clearly reveals that the promises were intended to be joint and not joint and several. No words from which joint or several liability could, properly be inferred are contained therein. Appellant’s contention, if sustained, would create an absurd result. Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company could not accept a higher offer or be permitted to refuse to convey to him, nor to execute the original contract or a second contract at a higher offer because the original vendee would be bound by his contract. Intention to effect an absurd result will <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>never be imputed to the parties to a contract.

The agreement was held to be joint only.</p>
