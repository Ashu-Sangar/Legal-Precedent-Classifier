Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, pursuant to Section 1104 of the Fiscal Code, Act of 1929, P. L. 343, 72 PS Section 1104, appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County from the order of the Board of Finance and Revenue refusing a resettlement of tax liability. The day preceding the hearing, the Attorney General, without the knowledge or acquiescence of the taxpayer, filed Avhat purported to be a confession of judgment. The court below made absolute a rule to show cause why the judgment so entered should not be stricken off for the reason that the Attorney General did not possess authority to enter the same.</p>

See Act of 1889, P. L. 420, Section 23, as amended by Act of 1937, B. L. 245, 72 PS Section 2181. The settlement, including tax on an amount representing gross receipts derived from interstate transportation of passengers, baggage and freight, was duly approved by the Department of the Auditor General on June 5, 1939. Appellee, on June 29, 1939, pursuant to Section 1102 of the Fiscal Code, supra, 72 PS Section 1102, presented its petition for resettlement to the Department of Revenue asserting that the above-mentioned portion of gross receipts was not subject to taxation. On March 20, 1940, said petition was refused. Appellee, <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>pursuant to Section 1103 of the Fiscal Code, supra, 72 PS 1103, filed its petition for review with the Board of Finance and Revenue on May 15, 1940, and on August 7, 1940, the petition was denied. Pursuant to Section 1104 of the Fiscal Code, supra, 72 PS 1104, appellee appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, again asserting that the gross receipts from the interstate transportation were not taxable. On December 18, 1944, the Department of Justice issued an opinion . advising the Secretary of Revenue that the gross receipts tax could not be applied to gross receipts from transportation from a point in Pennsylvania through an adjoining state to a point in Pennsylvania.</p>

On October 22, 1945, a Deputy Attorney General filed in the office of the prothonotary what purported to be a confession and consent to judgment against the Commonwealth and in favor of appellee in amount of $953.31, and directed the prothonotary to forthwith enter said judgment. On November 9, 1945, the taxpayer, appellee, filed its petition for a rule on the Commonwealth to show cause why said judgment should not be stricken off, alleging that: (1) the Attorney General was without authority to enter the judgment; and (2) appellee did not acquiesce in, consent to or ratify entry of the judgment. The rule was granted and on November 17, the Commonwealth filed its answer denying want of authority. This appeal is from the decree of the court below making the rule absolute and directing that the judgment be stricken off. .</p>

The statutes relied upon are contained in the Administrative Code, Act of 1929, P.

Section 512, 71 PS Section 192, requires department beads to secure and follow advice from the Department of Justice. Section 704, 71 PS Section 244, designates tbe Attorney General as legal advisor of the Governor and chief law officer of tbe Commonwealth and provides, <em>inter alia: </em>“He shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as may now or hereafter he vested in or imposed upon him by the Constitution and laws of this Commonwealth.” Sections 901, 902, and 903, 71 PS Sections 291, 292, and 293, provide that the Department of Justice shall “supervise, direct and control all of the legal business of every administrative department, board, and commission of the State Government” and represent the Commonwealth or any department, board or commission “in any litigation to which the Commonwealth or such department, board, commission, or officer, may be a party, or in which the Commonwealth or such department, board, commission, or officer, is permitted or required by law to intervene or interplead.”</p>

Admittedly, if taxpayer did not pay, the action would be by the Commonwealth against the taxpayer. It is none the less so when the taxpayer appeals under and pursuant to the provisions of the Fiscal Code. The language of Section 1108 of the Fiscal Code, supra, which provides “whenever the principal amount, due upon the final judgment entered on any appeal ...” can only mean that the judgment is to be entered against the taxpayer for the principal amount due and that the Department of Revenue shall then “enter a credit ... to the account of such . . . corporation . . .” in the amount of the difference between the sum due and amount paid. Any judgment entered must be in favor of the Commonwealth for the amount of tax due and not against the Commonwealth for the refund of over-payments by the taxpiayer.

Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Law of England, Book III, pages 395-396, refers to four types of judgment: “First, where the facts are confessed by the parties, and the law determined by the court; as in case of judgment upon <em>demurrer: </em>secondly, where the law is admitted by the parties and the facts disputed; as in case of judgment on a <em>verdict: </em>thirdly, where both the fact and the law arising thereon are admitted by the defendant; which is the case of judgments by <em>confession </em>or <em>default: </em>or, lastly, where the plaintiff is convinced that either fact, or law, or both, are insufficient to support his action, and therefore abandons or withdraws his prosecution; which is the case in judgments upon a <em>non-suit </em>or <em>retratrix </em>Blackstone further discusses confession of judgments as follows (397) : “. . . it is very usual, in order to strengthen a creditor’s security, for the debtor to execute a warrant of attorney to some attorney named by the creditor, empowering him to confess a judgment by either of the ways just now mentioned (by <em>nihil dicit, cognovit actionem, </em>or <em>non sum informatus) </em>in an action of debt to be brought by the creditor against the debtor for the specific sum due: which judgment, when confessed, is absolutely complete and binding . . .” <em>Nihil dicit </em>is where a defendant suffers judgment to go against him by default for the reason that no plea is entered to the plaintiff’s declaration. Confession or <em>cognovit actionem </em>acknowledges the plaintiff’s demand to be <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>just. <em>Non sum informatus </em>is where defendant’s attorney declares be bas no instruction to answer to the plaintiff or say anything in defense of his client. In reality, there was but one judgment by confession at common law and that was judgment by <em>cognovit actio-nem. </em>A second is sometimes said to be a judgment by confession <em>relicta verificatione. </em>See 31 Am. Jur. Judgments, Section 465; 34 Corpus Juris 97. This is, however, defined as “a <em>cognovit actionem </em>accompanied by a withdraAval of the plea”: Black’s Law Dictionary.</p>
