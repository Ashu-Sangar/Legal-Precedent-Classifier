He has paid for utility services, repairs, fire insurance, interest on a mortgage and other indebtedness owed by him totaling $23,960, carries at least $35,000 life insurance and has expended approximately $1,700 per year for necessaries of life and for clothing for the wife and children.</p>

To secure an indebtedness of $15,000 to the Barelay-Westmoreland Bank, he has a mortgage on the home, and to secure $8,960 to the First National Bank he has pledged considerable stock. The main portion of his income is derived through the Haekey Estate which includes income from Kroger’s store, based on a percentage of business done, for which reason George insisted his wife purchase from that store. He contends that the wife has continually run up store bills and has no regard for the value of money, and that he has been attempting to pay all outstanding bills and would do so if given a chance. He has reduced the mortgage $3,000 in 1946 and intends to pay it off as soon as possible. Appellant’s estimated income and disbursements were not challenged and, without including an item for income taxes, revealed expenditures of $15,469.66 against an income of $13,109.78.</p>

In answer to a question by the court whether she was asking for money to take care of items of food and clothing for herself and children and spending money for herself and the children, she replied: “Definitely. I think it is up to me to handle it without having to go . to him and ask for fifty cents. I think I should have the money. <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>I think it is my obligation to pay.” On cross-examination, she admitted that he provided well for her and that they lived in a fine home. In. answer to the question : “You have had food, groceries, meats, butter eggs?” she stated, “Yes; we live very nice.” She admitted that he provided maid service for her and that he never prevented her from inviting guests to the home , and serving whatever she. desired. In answer to the question, “Your only complaint is that you feel he doesn’t give you enough money to handle yourself?” she stated, “I would like to have money for when I need anything I can go and get it.” She complained that the bills were not paid promptly, not that they were not paid; that he would give money directly to the children instead of to her so that she could give it to them; that he differed with her as to the necessities for certain dental expenditures; that she used $500 given to her as a gift by her mother to pay off certain charges which she had made in the name of one of the children; that appellant insisted too strenuously upon installment buying; and, that he objected to her joining a country club.</p>

It presents conflicting concepts of family financial management. Prosecutrix does not suggest that appellant cease his present performance, but desires to secure in addition thereto a monthly allowance for herself of $300. Her charges pf “neglect to maintain” are general and their weight greatly lessened, by her testimony in cross-examination. . That the wife is not receiving that degree of control over her husband’s income to which she feels entitled does not establish “neglect” within the meaning of the law.</p>

The statute was never intended to constitute a court a sounding board for domestic financial disagreements, nor a board of arbitration to determine the extent to which a husband is required to recognize the budget suggested by the wife or. her demands for control, over the purse strings. The legislature intended Section 733, and prior statutes from which it was derived, to provide the method by which a wife who has been wrongfully deserted by the husband or who has been deprived of support by the neglect of the husband, could seek judicial assistance in securing a reasonable allowance for the support of herself and family: <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
