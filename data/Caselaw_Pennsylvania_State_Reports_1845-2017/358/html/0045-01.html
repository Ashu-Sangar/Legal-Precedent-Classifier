The defendants who were elected school directors, acting on behalf of the school district of Robinson Township, by resolution, imposed the tax on coal produced between August 27, 1947 and July 1, 1948.

The opinioti stated: “It is admitted that the Legislature has the right and power to-delegate to the City Council the authority by ordinance to levy, assess and collect taxes for general revenue purposes. Such a delegation of the taxing power is expressly sanctioned by Section 1 of Article XV of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, which provides in part that ‘Cities . . . may' be given the right and power ... to exercise the powers and authority of local self-government, subject, however, to such'restrictions, limitations and regulations, as may be imposed by the Legislature.’ This Court has ruled that the legislative taxing power may be lawfully delegated to an elective City Council.

Generally, the form of the prayer of their petitions was “to intervene in the above proceeding and to appear and be heard by counsel and submit a printed brief and make oral argument , at the. hearing of said Bill of Complaint.” The orders are substantially in the form that petitioner “is. permitted to intervene in the above proceeding and to appear and be heard by counsel and submit a printed brief and make oral argument....” But in a brief filed on behalf of intervenors it is argued that the ordinances described in the “petitions for leave to intervene violate the uniformity clause of Article IX, section.!.” The orders granting leave to intervene for the purposes specified do not go so far as to put in issue in this case the validity of ordinances passed by political subdivisions other than the school district of Robinson Township, challenged by the plaintiffs.

Defendant school district’s power is not unlimited. Section 1 contains the following provision: “The aggregate amount of taxes annually imposed by enactment of an ordinance or resolution by any political subdivision under this section shall not exceed an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total assessed valuation of real estate in such political subdivision at the time of the said enactment by the maximum millage tax thereon allowed by law.” Section 32 of the Statutory Construction Act provides that the singular may include the plural: 1937, P.

Under Article III, section 34, adopted in 1923, school districts have been classified. The school.boards <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>of districts of the same class may tax at different rates without infringing the provision against local or special legislation: <em>Moore v. Pittsburgh School District, </em><a href="/pa/338/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="338 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="1199920" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0466-01">338 Pa. 466</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.2d%2029" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="13 A.2d 29">13 A. 2d 29</a>. This is further illustrated by decisions under the Act of 1874, P. L. 230, as amended by the Act of May 23, 1889, P. L. 277, classifying cities. In <em>Clouser v. Reading City, </em><a href="/pa/270/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="270 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1066072" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0092-01">270 Pa. 92</a>, 95, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.%20188" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="113 A. 188">113 A. 188</a>, we said: “The ordinance in question treats all the grocers in Reading alike, and the fact that other grocers, in other municipal divisions of the State, may be taxed differently, or not at all, makes no difference in legislating for the class of cities to which Reading belongs. The argument that the act in question is local, because some cities of the named class may tax grocers, while others of the class may not, was met and disposed of in Jermyn v. Scranton, <a href="/pa/186/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="186 Pa. 595" data-case-ids="989662" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0595-01">186 Pa. 595</a>, wherein it was said, answering a like contention there made, ‘But this difference is not radical or fundamental to the existence of the power, it relates only to the difference in the existing conditions in the different cities.’ The same argument could be made against the levy of general taxation if the rates differed in the different cities as they do.” See also <em>Allentown v. Gross, </em><a href="/pa/132/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="132 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="970502" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0319-01">132 Pa. 319</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.%20269" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="19 A. 269">19 A. 269</a>; <em>Williamsport v.

School districts may tax only for school purposes within the constitutional sense and the words “for general revenue purposes” mean the general revenue purposes <em>so permitted by law. </em>It must be remembered that statutes are presumptively constitutional and that courts must interpret them in that sense if possible; there is no difficulty in this case. Section 52, Statutory Con<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>struction Act 1937, P. L. 1019; <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b77-3" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[264,373,1151,1258]]]'>We mast also reject tlie suggestion based on Article I, sections 1 and 9, and on section 1 of the 14th Amendment, that plaintiffs’ property is taken withoue due process. There is no doubt of the state’s right to tax, and, as the cases cited show, there is no doubt of the state’s right to confer on the school district, as its agent, the power to levy and collect the tax. The courts are open to the taxable to challenge the tax, as the plaintiffs are doing in this suit. The fact that the right of appeal against the resolution or ordinance before the date at which it becomes effective provided for in section 3 of the statute is limited is immaterial; due process does not require such a privilege; indeed, if there were any basis for the argument of unconstitutionality based on this provision of the statute the result would be merely to strike it out of the act pursuant to the severability provision contained in Section 8. Due process is not wanting in this case because it has long been settled in this Commonwealth that a plaintiff may go into equity to restrain attempted taxation for want of power to tax: <em>Dougherty, Trustee, v. Philadelphia et al., </em><a href="/pa/314/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="314 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1154722" data-case-paths="/pa/314/0298-01">314 Pa. 298</a>, 301, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.%20583" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="171 A. 583">171 A. 583</a>. In such circumstances there is no want of due process.</p>
