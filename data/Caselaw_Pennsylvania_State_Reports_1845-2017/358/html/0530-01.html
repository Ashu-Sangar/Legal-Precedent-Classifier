On October 4,1946, the transfer inheritance tax appraisement was filed in the Office of the Register of Wills of Lancaster County, based on the assets in the hands of trustee under the <em>inter vivos </em>deed of trust. The Conestoga National Bank of Lancaster and Mary Ellen Todd, as executors of the estate of Robert B. Todd, deceased, and as trustees and individually as beneficiaries respectively under both the deed of trust and decedent’s will, the Lancaster General Hospital of Lancaster and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Holy Trinity of Lancaster, residuary beneficiaries under the deed of trust, appealed to the orphans’ court to have the above appraisement stricken from the record <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>averring that tbe fund was not subject to transfer inheritance tax. Tbe court below, relying upon <em>Dolan’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/279/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="279 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="1083564" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0582-01">279 Pa. 582</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.%20176" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="124 A. 176">124 A. 176</a>, sustained tbe appeals. Tbe Commonwealth has appealed, contending that tbe assessment was properly made for (1) settlor retained tbe power of complete revocation, and (2) settlor reserved such interest in tbe property that upon .his death, there was a “transfer” within the meaning of the Act. The basic issue in this appeal is whether reservation by the settlor of the income for life after the death of his wife constitutes retention of an interest in the property so that upon his death, without regard to whether the life estate vested in possession, there was a transfer “of any property, real or personal, or of any interest therein . . . intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after (his) death.”</p>

(c) When the transfer is of property made by a resident ... by deed, grant, bargain, sale, or gift, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor, vendor, or donor, or intended to take effect in possession or'enjoyment at or after such death.” In <em>Lines’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/155/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="155 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="983262" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0378-01">155 Pa. 378</a>, 393, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20A.%20728" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="26 A. 728">26 A. 728</a>, this Court, in construing the Act of April 7, 1826, Section 1, a similar statute said: “The manifest purpose of our collateral inheritance tax law is to subject property, limited by deed in the manner stated in the statute, to taxation, because it is still substantially the property of the grantor, and does not actually pass, nor is it intended to pass to the collateral beneficiaries until his death, and hence it is essentially similar in that respect to a devolution of property by testacy or intestacy upon the death of the owner.” In <em>Reish, Administrator, v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/106/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="106 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="455546" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0521-01">106 Pa. 521</a>, 526, it was said: “The commonwealth’s right to collateral inheri<a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>tance tax is, therefore, not defeated by a conveyance of the title, nor by possession taken under it, if the enjoyment is intended to take effect ■ at the death of the grantor; The enjoyment of real estafé is not the exact equivalent of possession, nor is it so used in this statute; . ■. ; One certainly cannot be considered, as in the actual enjoyment of an estate, who.has no right to the profits or incomes arising or accruing therefrom . . . The policy of the law will not permit the owner of an estate, to defeat the plain provisions of - the collateral inheritance law, by any device which' secures ■ to him, for life, the income, profits, and enjoyment thereof; it must be by such a conveyance as parts with the possession, the title, and the enjoyment in the grantor’s life time.” The test to be used in determining when a transfer is to be regarded as effective in possession or enjoyment was restated in <em>Glosser Trust, </em><a href="/pa/355/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="355 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="468949" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0210-01">355 Pa. 210</a>, 215, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20401" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="49 A.2d 401">49 A. 2d 401</a>: “The criterion is not whether.the beneficiaries are to acquire actual possession or enjoyment at or after the death of the donor but whether the latter has irrevocably parted with .all his interest, title, possession and enjoyment in his lifetime.” See cases -therein cited in footnote 3.</p>
    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[233,1541,1148,634]]]'>Robert B. Todd, settlor, did not completely divest himself of all “interest” in the property. Instead, he reserved therein a vested right to the income for life, subject to being divested by his decease in the lifetime of his wife whose life interest was vested in possession. As executed, the deed provided for the income to the wife for life, remainder- to settlor for his life, remainder to designated charities. His death was, therefore, contemplated to be an event which vested possession and enjoyment of the ultimate remainder interest. - The court below was in error in directing that the appraisement be stricken from the record.</p>
