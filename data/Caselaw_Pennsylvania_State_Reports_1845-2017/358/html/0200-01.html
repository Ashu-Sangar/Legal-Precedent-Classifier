The residue was devised and bequeathed for religious uses, which, however, was void because of the death of testator within 30 days. An intestacy resulted as to the residue. Testator’s heirs were Marie Fernandez, a daughter (who had been given an annuity of $25 a month), and a granddaughter, Mary Neville, child of a deceased son (who was given a legacy of $25).</p>
    <p id="b223-4" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[235,1129,1145,254]]]'>The executors filed a first and partial account. Upon exceptions the matter was referred to an auditor.

    <p id="b223-5" data-blocks='[["BL_223.6",223,[236,1410,1145,369]]]'>The residuary estate was shown to have amounted to $32,831.44. One half of this amount was awarded to the daughter and the other half to the granddaughter. Such distribution was stated to be <em>“Subject to items mentioned in Auditor’s Report.” </em>Such items were principally the annuity to the daughter and the fund for college expenses.</p>

She desired <em>immediate </em>payment of her <em>entire </em>undivided share. She maintains that the testamentary directions concerning payment of the annuity to the daughter <em>merged </em>with such daughter’s intestate share of the residue. To raise this question the granddaughter, the appellant, filed a petition <em>for an order to </em>pay, to which answers were filed. Thé Orphans’ Court dismissed the petition, and in the opinion decreed the method of distribution. The court determined that the amount necessary to be retained to insure compliance with the testa<a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>mentary directions was $12,831.44. Tbe balance, or $20,000, was directed to be distributed equally between the daughter and granddaughter. The court further decreed that if in the future it became apparent that the retained fund was more than sufficient to meet the testamentary requirements, the excess, on appropriate application to the court, would be distributed to the heirs.</p>

There is no merit in appellant’s contention that the annuity of the daughter merged with her intestate share of <em>residue. </em>Where interests have been held to merge, the beneficiary possessed a life estate <em>in the whole </em>and also a vested interest in remainder. When thus possessed of an entire interest <em>in the whole </em>there is a merger of the composite parts into a fee simple: <em>Kane’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/185/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="185 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="897951" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0544-01">185 Pa. 544</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20A.%2090" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="40 A. 90">40 A. 90</a>; <em>Conley’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/197/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="197 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="918690" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0291-01">197 Pa. 291</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20A.%20238" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="47 A. 238">47 A. 238</a>; <em>Moore v.

We need not consider whether merger in this case is a matter of intention of the persons in whom interests are united: <em>Waldron v.

In the instant case there was an intestacy <em>only as to residue. </em>The residue of an estate is that which is left after the gifts specified or designated have been paid or satisfied: <em>Wood’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/209/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="209 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="936225" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0016-01">209 Pa. 16</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.%201103" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="57 A. 1103">57 A. 1103</a>; <em>Haak’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/342/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="342 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1206933" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0093-01">342 Pa. 93</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.2d%20671" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="18 A.2d 671">18 A. 2d 671</a>; <em>Carson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/130/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="130 Pa.

Among the specified testamentary gifts was the $25 monthly annuity to the daughter. It. is by the <em>will </em>that the daughter is entitled to her annuity and <em>by law </em>she acquires an intestate share in <em>the residue. </em>There can be no question of merger. The daughter, the appellee, is entitled to both interests. The learned court below correctly set apart a suitable <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>sum to insure payment of the annuity and for postponed legacies: see Fiduciaries Act of 1917, P.

    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.5",225,[212,459,1149,975]]]'>While we are in accord with the distribution decreed, we do not approve of the procedure adopted. What the appellant objected to was the distribution decreed by the auditor. She sought clarification and amendment of the auditor’s decree of distribution by means of a petition to the Orphans’ Court <em>for an order to </em>pay. This was an inappropriate method of procedure. The auditor should have more accurately complied with section 8, rule 3, and the court with section 6, rule 11, of the Orphans’ Court Rules promulgated December 30, 1942: 345 Pa. lvii. There should have been a definitive decree of distribution entered, from which an appeal could have then been taken. No appeal lies from an order to pay where no exception is taken to the decree of distribution: <em>Boning’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/217/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="217 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="953671" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0306-01">217 Pa. 306</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20525" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="66 A. 525">66 A. 525</a>; <em>Jenning’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/38/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="38 Pa.

The error in procedure, however, has done no harm, and we deem it unnecessary to remit the record for the purpose of correction.</p>
