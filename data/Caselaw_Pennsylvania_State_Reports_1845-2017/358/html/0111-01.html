Kerl, </em><a href="/pa/334/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="334 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1190787" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0441-01">334 Pa. 441</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20275" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 A.2d 275">6 A. 2d 275</a>. Title to real estate was there held in the name of “Caroline C. Kerl” and a judgment was entered against her in that name, but a previous judgment had been filed by another creditor against “Caroline Kerl”, who was admittedly the same person. It was held that this judgment was entitled to priority because the testimony revealed that there was no other person by the name of Kerl living in the county, that the Miss Kerl in question was known more or less indiscriminately as “Caroline” or “Caroline. C.”, that sometimes she wrote her name the one way and sometimes the other, and that in her business transactions she. had not been-accustomed to use her middle initial. The question was whether, under those circumstances, the omission of that initial in the indexing of the judgment was absolutely fatal so far as its function of affording constructive notice was concerned, or whether the entry was sufficient to safeguard the priority of the lien. This court adopted the latter view, saying (p. 447, A. p. 278) : “It is not necessary that the name of the judgment debtor as docketed and indexed should be letter-perfect, nor do the cases hold that the omission of the middle initial in the entry of a judgment automatically and inevitably vitiates the entry and subordinates it to subsequent judgments more accurately docketed. Each case must depend upon concomitant circumstances. The freedom with which persons use their names in various forms demands a corresponding flexibility in the law if it is to conform to the habits and usages of life rather than be unduly technical. The sole function of a name is to identify the person whom it is intended to designate, and therefore all that is legally necessary in the docketing and indexing of judgments is that the defendant should be individuated with <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>a degree of accuracy sufficient either to lead a reasonably careful searcher to conclude that he is the-person who is the object of the search, or to suggest to the searcher the wisdom of inquiry to ascertain the fact. Where there is enough to put an ordinarily prudent person upon guard, inquiry becomes a duty, and if an investigation, reasonably pursued, would disclose the identity of the judgment debtor, the subsequent lienor is bound by notice of the previous judgment even though inaccurately recorded.” The rule thus adopted would-seem to be in harmony with that which prevails in other jurisdictions; it protects property rights against'the carelessness or wilful blindness of those whose duty it is to search the records- The law is clear that if a person is confronted with circumstances, ’wholly <em>outside </em>the record, which, in the exercise of common prudence, ought to put a reasonable man upon inquiry, he will be charged with notice of the facts that such inquiry, properly pursued, would have .disclosed. Surely, it would be altogether inconsistent and illogical if he were not similarly to be put upon inquiry by facts and circumstances reasonably disclosed <em>by the record itself.</em>

Marshall Street to fail to realize that the judgment of the Department of Public Assistance against Rosie Reustle was a lien upon that property. A reasonably careful inquirer searching an index for records affecting a person of a given name and finding an entry of the correct surname and the correct Christian or baptismal name, would not ordinarily allow the omission of a middle initial to divert his inquiry until he had satisfied himself that such entry did not relate to the person as to whom he was making the search. In the present case, apart from the obvious rarity, not to say uniqueness, of the name “Rosie Reustle” (there were only four “Reustles” in the Philadelphia telephone directory and none of them “Rosie” Reustle), when the <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>searcher saw, as be was bound to see, the judgment indexed under that name, he necessarily saw also the accompanying notation of the court, term and number under which the judgment'had been entered, and all that he would then have been obliged to do was to glance at the judgment note itself which had been filed in that court and under that term and number, an inspection of which would have revealed not only the place of residence of Rosie Reustle, namely, 1337 Bleigh Street, <em>but that she was the owner- of the property 3850 N. Marshall Street which the DiPaolas toere purchasing from Rosie G. Reustle, </em>and therefore that the Rosie C. Reustle with the middle initial and the Rosie Reustle without the middle initial were one and the same person and the individual against whom his searching was directed.</p>

The earlier cases upon which appelleés rely and 'which are all discussed in the <em>Coral Gables </em>opinion, so far from being at variance therewith, are really in accord with that decision, for in each of them the surrounding facts were set forth in order to show why the omission of the middle initial was there' Misleading or harmful. Appellees seek to distinguish the <em>Coral' Gables </em>decision because of a statement in the opinion to the effect that different principles are applicable where the controversy is between a mortgagee and a purchaser at sheriff’s sale. The reasons which make that differentiation necessary are set forth in <em>Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities v. Halpern, </em><a href="/pa/273/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="273 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1070873" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0451-01">273 Pa. 451</a>, 454, 455, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.%20197" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="117 A. 197">117 <em>A. </em>197</a>, 198, 199, and <em>Colonial Trust Co., Trustee, v.

Bergold”. The court said (p. 471, A. p. 140) : “When, in examining the mortgage index for mortgages against Herman Bergold, the name of Herman A. Bergold was found, ordinary prudence would at once have required a reference to the mortgage itself, from which it would have appeared that it covered the same interest which was being purchased from Herman Bergold. This fact would at once have put the examiner upon inquiry as to whether Herman A. Bergold and Herman Bergold were not one and the same person, . . . It is always easy to ascertain whether or not a mortgage affects the property under examination, so that the prudent rule in examining a mortgage index is to note everything appearing against the náine in question, with or without a middle initial. In the present case the name Herman A. Bergold of course included the name Herman Bergold, and a search against all the Hermans would have disclosed the mortgage executed by Herman A.”</p>
    <p id="b139-3" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[233,1567,1148,608]]]'>Under the findings of fact of the court below it is clear that it was the duty of the searcher of the records in the instant case, upon examining the judgment index, to take note there of the name Rosie Reustle and thereupon to make the slight additional inquiry which would have resulted in his ascertaining from the face of the plaintiff’s judgment note itself .that; the Rosiq Beustle who confessed that, judgment was the Rosie C. Reustle who was selling the property to the DiPaolas and that therefore the latter could hot obtairi' a title free from the lién of the Department of Public' Assistarice.</p>
    <p id="b139-4" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[234,2195,1147,158]]]'>The finding of the court below is reversed, and the record is remanded with direction to enter judgment in favor of plaintiff arid against defendants.</p>
