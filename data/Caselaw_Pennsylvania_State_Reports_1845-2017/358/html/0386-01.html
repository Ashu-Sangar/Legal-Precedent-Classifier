      <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>On January 22, 1947, Charles Strohmeyer, Jr. and Myrtle Anna Strohmeyer, his wife (appellees), petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Berks County for the adoption of Robert Choate Southard, III, a six year old child. The boy’s father is Robert Choate Southard, Jr. (appellant), the divorced husband of Mrs. Strohmeyer. By the seventh paragraph of the petition for adoption, it is averred that the natural father abandoned the child. The father of the child refuses to consent to the adoption. Appellant and his former wife, at the time of marriage on March 17, 1939, lived in Jacksonville, Florida. Appellant’s occupation at that time was that of a commercial philatelist. The child was born on March 31, 1941. The couple later moved to Washington, D. C., where appellant worked as a railroad clerk for over three years prior to the divorce. On March 4, 1944, a separation occurred in Washington. The wife and child returned to her parents’ home in Jacksonville, Florida, and the husband remained in Washington. On November 25, 1944, the wife obtained a divorce in Florida, under which decree she was awarded the permanent care, custody and control of the child, but the father was given: “. . . the right to visit said child and have said child visit him at reasonable times and under reasonable circumstances, such visits being at times convenient to the plaintiff and they shall not interrupt or interfere with her control of the physical, educational or moral welfare of said child.” By the decree it was also ordered that the husband should pay the wife !|¡&gt;30 a month for the support of the child.</p>

C., for the support of his wife and son until the decree of divorce was entered. On or about December 15, 1944, appellant returned to the home of his parents in Jacksonville, Florida. From December 1944 to May 5, 1945, appellant was out of employment. He resided with his parents while waiting, entry into the United States Maritime Service. During this period of unemployment the <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>child stayed mostly with appellant at bis parents’ residence. Appellant’s mother went after the child on Monday of each week. The child was kept by appellant until each Friday evening when he was returned to his mother so that he could spend the week-ends with her. During this period the parents of appellant fed, clothed and cared for the child, and appellant performed the normal duties of- a parent. Appellant entered the Maritime Service on May 5, 1945 and remained in that service until August 20, 1945. At the conclusion of his service, appellant returned to Jacksonville for a few days, and in September 1945 went back to his railroad clerkship in Washington, D. C., where he remained until March 1946. Appellant then returned to Jacksonville and entered the employ of an automobile company at $200 a month and was employed by said company when the proceedings in adoption were instituted.</p>

Charles Strohmeyer, Jr., was then in the United States Navy and stationed in Florida. He was discharged from the Navy on April 3, 1946. <em>On the same day, </em>the mother, accompanied by the child, and without notice to appellant, removed from Jacksonville and was joined by her husband on the following day. They took the child to Reading, Pennsylvania, where Mr. Strohmeyer obtained employment. They are presently residing in a township near that city.</p>

An offer was made orally and in writing by petitioners’ attorney that all delinquent and future support payments would be cancelled if the appellant consented to the adoption. Appellant refused the offer,</p>

From November 18,1945 to June 22,1946', appellant sent his wife seven checks aggregating in amount $240. Only $90 was realized from the checks.

Appellant explained his stopping payment of certain ■ checks and restricting the date of payment of others. Some of the checks had been held by his former wife for -five or six months .before being presented for payment. The reason assigned by appellees for. holding, the checks, was their fear that cashing, them might jeopardize the . desired adoption.</p>

It was further testified that although appellant possessed a stamp collection valued at from $1,200 to $1,500, he did not dispose of it to make the support payments because to do so would have resulted in a loss. What value appellant’s automobile possessed was not shown. The situation concerning the stoppage of payment and restriction of other checks to payment within sixty days, after appellant was discharged from the Maritime Service, has been related. We note that it was the appellees who took the ehild from Jacksonville to Reading, Pennsylvania, without the knowledge of, or notice to, appellant and without advising him of the child’s whereabouts. And, it was the former wife who refused to allow the child to visit appellant in Florida. Appellant’s conduct reveals no settled intention to abandon the child.</p>

We do not condone appellant’s neglect or refusal to comply with the support order. By appropriate legal action, compliance with the divorce decree may yet be enforced against either or both parents. There is no substantial impelling evidence of <em>abandonment </em>within the meaning of the adoption statutes. We can appreciate the unwillingness of a father to relinquish all parental rights, especially in favor of his successor. Such parental rights should not be forfeited except in a clear case.</p>
