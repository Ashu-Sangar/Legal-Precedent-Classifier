In his bill plaintiff averred that certain classes of business transactions which the defendant proposed to conduct in Pennsylvania would be ultra vires and therefore harmful to him and other policy-holders. He asked that defendant be restrained from engaging in such transactions in Pennsylvania on the ground that they were prohibited by Article XVI, section 6, of the constitution providing, “No corporation shall engage in any business other than that expressly authorized in its charter, nor shall it take or hold any real estate except such as may be necessary and proper for its legitimate business.”</p>

The defendant is engaged in the life insurance business, which,' as the record states, is the business it is expressly authorized by the law of New York to transact. We: may assume, for present purposes,- that everybody understands in a general way what is meant by the term life insurance business. Plaintiff’s principal suggestion seems to be that defendant, by engaging in the proposed transactions, would cease to be an insurance company and would become a real estate company. We must' reject-the-suggestion-which appears to result from an: inadmissible view of the use and meaning of- words, a misunderstanding which we' may not attribute to the legislature. It is common knowledge that the-life insurance business is necessarily concerned with innumerable transactions involving every conceivable kind of property and interests in property; these' may all be.-dealt with in'their necessary and proper relation-to life insurance business within the - limitation : specifically<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> stated in the statute without crossing the line separating a life insurance from a real estate business. The legislature’s definition of what may constitute the life insurance business is not to be lightly set aside as repugnant to the constitution: compare <em>York Haven W. &amp; P. Co. v. Pub. Ser. Com., </em><a href="/pa/287/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="287 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1099621" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0241-01">287 Pa. 241</a>, 248, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.%20419" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="134 A. 419">134 A. 419</a>.</p>

It requires no argument to show that investment is an essential part of the business of a life insurance company<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and that the <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>investment of such large sums requires a wide field of possible choice. The legislature could properly conclude that unless insurance companies were granted larger fields of investment the life insurance business could not be properly carried on.</p>

The argument that these statutes are special laws granting to corporations special or exclusive privileges or immunities has nothing to support it when considered in the light of familiar rules authorizing classification : compare <em>Equitable Credit etc. Co. v.

For many years the subject of insurance has so been dealt with; Acts Nos. 93 and 92 are mere amendments to the Insurance Company Law of 1921, P. L. 682, 40 P. S. 341 et seq. We all agree that by enlarging the investment powers of such companies, the legislature acted within its legislative power.</p>
