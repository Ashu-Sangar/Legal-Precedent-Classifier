Exceptions followed, but before they were disposed of, plaintiff, on November 13, 1946, filed a petition for rehearing pursuant to Equity Rule 78. The petition set forth that, since the entry of the decree nisi, information of additional facts, not theretofore ascertainable together with the result of experience, materially affecting the decision, had been obtained which should be considered by the court. The petition was granted and a rehearing<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> was held and additional witnesses were heard. This evidence was considered with the exceptions to the adjudication. The parties presented requests for additional findings and conclusions and on August 18, 1947, a supplementary opinion was filed considering this evidence and disposing of the exceptions and entering a final decree dismissing the bill.

Appellant contends the Act violates Article III, section 7, of the Constitution, prohibiting the enactment of any local or special law “regulating labor, trade, mining or manufacturing.” He states the objection to be “that the bituminous coal stripping business may not be classified to regulate the conservation of land.” We can find no sound basis for plaintiff’s objection to the classification made by the Act. The facts in the record, supported by evidence, clearly bring the classification within <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>the well established rule stated by Mr. Justice Mitchell in <em>Seabolt v.

If the distinctions are genuine, the courts cannot declare the classification void, though they may not consider it to be on a sound basis. The test is, not wisdom, but good faith in the classification.”</p>

The pit mining method produces a spoil bank over all of the surface, mined. It creates an irregular surface which affécts -its utility for the production of fruits of the soil. In many, cases the spoil bank contains material which is not only unsuitable for agricultural use, but which washes into streams and upon adjoining property. This method is also invariably used in the vicinity of deep mines.. There is danger of flooding such mines, which either causes them to be abandoned or necessitates the pumping of the water therefrom. This water is invariably acid, and when it reaches the streams óf the Commonwealth it is destructive to fish and various aquatic life, and in some cases ruins sources of water supply utilized by individuals and communities. There is also a danger of cutting into a deep mine and thereby interrupting the ventilating system, with attendant danger to the miners there employed. Also, this method of producing bituminous coal always leaves exposed, at the foot of the high wall, a vein of coal. This coal may be ignited by intent or carelessness and burn into a deep mine, causing great expense, loss and destruction of natural re<a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>sources. The mining of other materials by the stripping method does not produce all of these results. It does produce a spoil pile, but no evidence has been produced of any case where there was water in a cut, where the operation adjoined a deep mine, or where a vein of coal was left exposed at the bottom of the cut. Consequently in this type of mining there is not the same danger of fire, flooding or interruption of ventilating systems of deep mines, as exists in the strip mining of bituminous coal. Also, anthracite coal has a higher combustion point than bituminous coal. These are substantial and real differences which, in our opinion, justify the classification made by the act. It may be true, that other evils exist in the strip mining of other products which should be corrected by the legislature. However, a. start has been made, and there is authority for the proposition that when an evil is conspicuously in need of correction, action may be taken, although other evils exist which are not corrected.”</p>

Notwithstanding plaintiff’s complaint of the cost, we gather from the evidence that his stripping operation promises handsome profits. The plaintiff with his two sons do the work. While he testified that his 65 acres of land, including the seam of coal, were worth only $150.00 in all, the evidence supports the 54th finding, “54. Plaintiff estimated that he would strip not more than two acres in a year, but such two acres of coal twenty-four inches thick would produce a total of 3,400 tons which, at $3.10 per ton, would produce $13,800.00 a year.” There is no showing whatever that the Act imposes an undue burden on the. industry, without now attempting to define what would be an undue burden or what the legal effect of it would <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>be.

In the latter the legislative power to classify subjects of taxation is expressly recognized; in the, former the legislature is specifically enjoined from passing any local or special law. In <em>Heisler v.

Here the classification is challenged for the reason that those persons engaged in the stripping of <em>bituminous coal </em>have been singled out from all who are similarly engaged in the open pit or strip mining of minerals. The Act does not apply to all within the class, i. e., to all persons engaged in open pit or strip mining, but only to those engaged in the mining of bituminous coal. Cf. <em>Chalmers v.

Consequently there are differences as regards danger from fire, flooding, or interrupting ventilating systems of deep mine, and a higher combustion point of anthracite coal. The majority opinion <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>estates: “These are substantial and real differences wbicb, in our opinion, justify the classification made by the Act.” Appellant’s points for charge, which were affirmed by the hearing judge, would establish the following facts: There is a seam of bituminous coal above fireclay; the latter is recovered by open pit or stripping methods identical to that employed in the stripping of bituminous coal; spoil pits resulting from clay stripping are wider and bituminous coal found above the clay is usually mixed with the spoil pile; spontaneous combustion may occur in spoil piles but there is no evidence that spontaneous combusion has occurred in an exposed vein of bituminous coal anywhere in the United States. “Ganister, employed in the manufacture of silica brick, shale from which is manufactured sewer pipe, flint clay, limestone, iron ore and cannel coal are all mined in the State of Pennsylvania by the open pit or strip mining method identical to that employed in the stripping of bituminous coal, all of which operations are productive of spoil banks.”</p>

This Court said (p. 26) : “Here the evil sought to be prevented is the practice of carrying an automobile over the cab of a vehicle. The legislature by enacting Section 1033(c) has efficiently directed its effort toward the prohibition of that practice. That other persons in the trucking business may continue to engage in practices not prohibited by Section 1033(c), but equally and similarly dangerous, is not enough to render the Section in question unconstitutional, because the right of the legislature to classify with reference to the particular evil sought to be prevented is undoubted. An act designed to remedy an existing ill may not be declared invalid because it leaves other ills unremedied. It is not required that the entire field of possible abuses be covered: Patsone v. Com. of Pa., <a href="/us/232/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="232 U.S. 138" data-case-ids="3671937" data-case-paths="/us/232/0138-01">232 U.S. 138</a>; Keokee Consolidated Coke Co. v.
