Gorgas, deceased, instituted this action in trespass against the Pittsburgh Railways Company, appellant, under the Survival Act of 1937, P. L. 2755, 20 PS 772, and under the Act of 1851, P. L. 669, Section 19, 12 PS 1601, and Act of 1855, P. L. 309, 12 PS 1602, as amended. The action arose out of a collision between appellant’s trolley and the automobile driven by decedent, at the intersection of Bennett and Oak-wood Streets, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After appellee presented its case, a voluntary nonsuit was taken with regard to the death action. A jury returned a verdict in the survival action in amount of $8,721.65. Appellant’s motions for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>and for a new trial were dismissed by the court <em>en banc. </em>This appeal is from the dismissal of the motion for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto.</em>

      <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>Charles A. Gorgas, on October 20, 1944, about 3:00 P.M. drove Ms four door sedan eastwardly on the southerly side of Bennett Street, a through highway running east and west. Oakwood Street, which runs north and south, crosses Bennett Street almost at a right angle. There is a double set of car tracks running north and south. Oakwood Street is 30 feet 3 inches wide while Bennett Street is 40 feet from curb to curb on the westerly side and 36 feet from curb to curb on the easterly side. The curb is rounded at the northwest corner and, therefore, a larger open space exists. There are traffic lights at the intersection which intermittently flash a red light, on Oakwood Street and an amber light on Bennett Street.</p>
    <p id="b57-3" data-blocks='[["BL_57.4",57,[269,1054,1150,694]]]'>A collision occurred with appellant’s street car and decedent’s sedan on the outbound track on the intersection, as a result of which Gorgas’ vehicle was damaged on the left side, back of the hood, the two doors on the left side, the frame, running board and steering assembly were bent, and the seat was telescoped and pulled off its anchoring screws. Gorgas was found dazed and half out of his automobile. He suffered fractures of the ribs, injuries to the lumbar regions of the spine, numerous contusions and abrasions and severe shock. On May 8,1945, he took his own life. His suicide did not result because of injuries sustained in the collision.</p>
    <p id="b57-4" data-blocks='[["BL_57.5",57,[272,1769,1150,589]],["BL_58.1",58,[226,281,1148,96]]]'>Appellee sought to establish appellant’s negligence by circumstantial evidence. There were no eye witnesses to the actual collision and the point of collision is not established. One John I. Matoney, operator of an Esso gasoline station situate at the southeast intersection of Bennett and Oakwood Streets, heard a crash and looked out upon the intersection. He first saw the sedan skidding into his driveway, practically off the street, 40 or 45 feet from the track on which the collision occurred. He saw the street car travel 20 to 25 feet and stop, the front just passing the southern curb line of Bennett <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>Street and the rear end of the ear remaining in the intersection. . .</p>
    <p id="b58-4" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[224,394,1152,1132]]]'>The court below concluded, that the eyidence warranted “a finding by the jury that the Gorgas' automobile, while driving eastward on Bennett Street, approached and' entered the intersection; that the Gorgas automobile had a qualified- right of way given by the flashing yellow signal; that when the automobile had gotten on the southbound, street car tracks it was. struck in the middle of the left side by the street car. The force of the impact, as evidenced by the loud crash, the destructive damage tp the automobile and the . distance the automobile and the street, car moved after the accident along with the other evidence, warrant the jury in finding that the street car had not stopped at the intersection as it was required to do by the flashing red signal. Insofar as the finding of these facts rests upon circumstantial evidence, they are ‘so strong as to preclude the possibility of injury in any other way and provide as the only reasonable inference the conclusion for which the contention is made . .. .’ See: Giordano v. Clement Martin &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/347/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="347 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="1217406" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0061-01">347 Pa. 61</a>; Wenhold v.

    <p id="b58-5" data-blocks='[["BL_58.6",58,[223,1538,1150,643]]]'>Appellee has proved a collision between a trolley car and an automobile and the property damage and personal injuries occasioned thereby. .Although the collision occurred on the southbound track in a 36-foot wide intersection, the precise point is not shown. The place of contact was at least 18 feet from the northeast corner and at least. 3 feet from the curb line of. Oakwood Street. Precisely what occurred is. not so described, pictured or visualized that the fact-finding .body could reasonably conclude that appellant was the culpable party. See <em>Ashhy v.

      <em>Giordano v. Clement Martin, Inc., </em>supra, relied upon by appellee and the court below, is factually dissimilar.

Conrad testified that when he looked up, at the moment <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>of tlie occurrence, the end of the plank held by the colored man was <em>right in the open space where the stone had been before it fell, </em>and, while no one actually saw the plank touch the stone, the conclusion is not only possible . . . but almost irresistible, that the fall of the stone was caused by the plank coming in contact with it.
