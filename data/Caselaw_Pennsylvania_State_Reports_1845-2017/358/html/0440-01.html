It was organized in 1886 and operated on the “lodge system” with subordinate lodges affiliated with it. In 1886 it granted a charter to Oley Castle No. 119. Under its Constitution, plaintiff as the parent organization was vested with control and management over subordinate organizations. The latter were bound by its provisions. In 1895 plaintiff incorporated under the General Corporation Law of April 29,1874, P. L. 73, and continued as a legal entity until September 15,1941 when it dissolved and reverted to its original unincorporated status. During its corporate existence, it continued to operate on the lodge system, exercising rights of superiority over and requiring fealty from subordinate lodges, including <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>Oley Castle No. 119, in direct violation of its charter prohibitions and statutory provisions.

The purpose of the new association was to provide “ á home for members of Oley Castle No. 119, Knights of the Golden Eagle, Oley, Pennsylvania, as well as to entertain the members and families of the proposed corporation and members of Oley Castle No. 119, Knights of the Golden Eagle” and also to provide a “fund by regular initiation fees, monthly dues, fines and assessments from its members and by voluntary donations, for the regular payment of sick, disability and death benefits to the members or their beneficiaries”. Sick and death benefits were provided for in amounts similar to those previously paid by Oley Castle No. 119. The articles were approved on February 5, 1940. From the time of the formation of Oley Castle No. 119 (hereinafter referred to as Oley) and Oley Home Fraternal Association and subsequent thereto, no new members were admitted to either organization.</p>

The charges consisted of the following: (a) It failed to pay its per capita tax for the term ending June 30, 1941; (.b) It failed to pay. its per capita tax for the term ending June 30, 1942; (c) It failed to render the required reports for the term ending December <em>31,1941; </em>(d) It failed to render the required reports for the term ending June 30,, 1942.

These conclusions of law were vacated by the court en banc. After granting a rehearing to defendant, the court affirmed the decision of the court en banc, stating in its opinion. . we cannot agree with the plaintiff, the exceptant, that the transfer by Oley Castle No. 119 was a breach of trust . . . From the foregoing, coupled with the already established facts that the assets in question were all contributed by the members of Oley Castle for the purpose of providing for sick and death benefits for themselves and the expenses of their organization, it is now made clear that the original owners and beneficiaries of the assets are still the owners and beneficiaries of the same; that the members by their subsequent conduct have approved the transfer to Oley Home Fraternal Association; and that said assets are still being held for the same purposes; in other words, that there has been no breach of trust.” It sustained that part of the Chancellor’s order directing defendant, First <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>National Bank of Oley to turn oyer to plaintiff tbe sum of $88.46, being tbe balance outstanding in the account of Oley Castle No. 119.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Nor does it allege maladministration of defendant’s assets. Instead, plaintiff avers that the transfers were unlawful and in violation of the trust then existing in favor of all the members of Oley Castle. Plaintiff’s objections relate to the course of action voted upon by the six members of Oley Castle who were present at the February 19,1940 meeting, since no notice of the meeting was given to Castle members other than a printed post card stating that some financial affairs would be taken up. It contends that the majority of defendant’s members had no authority to divert Castle assets from its trust purposes and any non-assenting members had the right to invalidate the transfers immediately after their consummation and to pursue the assets in the hands of Oley Home Fraternal Association.</p>

In that case the majority severed relationships with the parent organization, taking with them all the paraphernalia and assets. This was done without the approval of the minority: The court compelled the majority to surrender the property appropriated. In the instant case, no member complained of the <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>transfers and all became affiliated, with the new association. The only parties who could complain of an alleged breach of trust would be non-assenting members injured by the transfers, but, there were no such members. We agree with .the court’s, statement:1 “There is no good and equitable reason why the property in question should be taken.away from the people by find for whom it was contributed or why those people should be compelled to re-associate with the plaintiff.”</p>
    <p id="b468-4" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[244,779,1147,852]]]'>By virtue of the prohibitions of the Act of April 29, 1874, plaintiff after its incorporation in .1895, divested itself of the right to act as a parent organization over subservient- bodies. For this reason it was powerless to attack defendant’s’ actions executed prior to the liquidation of plaintiff’s status, nor could it assert any form of authority over defendant. Plaintiff resumed its suzerainty over Oley Castle only when the latter- became reaffiliated with.it in September 1941. Whatever assets defendant possessed at that time and accumulated prior to the revocation of its charter, were properly within plaintiff’s jurisdiction. The powers which plaintiff regained as a result of its reversion- to an unincorporated association were not retroactive. Consequently, the transfers , made, by Oley Castle prior thereto were none of its affair.</p>

There Ave stated: “The incorporation of the Grand Castle in 1895 created a legal entity with certain powers. But nowhere among these- powers is' found the right to 'procreate’ subordinate lodges. . . . Commonwealth of Pennsylvania denies to this appellee any right to operate as a 'supreme lodge’, for a corporation has no powers except such as are bestowed by the grant' contained in its charter. . '. . If the appellee had no rights to institute other lodges, it has no right to appropriate their property. . . . Whatever relationships it may have had <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>with the appellant as a ‘subordinate lodge’ were extralegal and impart no validity to its demand.”. Insofar as our decision with respect to the challenged transfers is concerned, the fact that plaintiff was an unincorporated association at the time this action was filed is of no materiality. The transfers in question occurred at a time when plaintiff had no say in the matter. In addition, there is no law which prohibits defendant from disassociating itself from the control of the parent organization. See <em>Grand Lodge of Knights of Pythias v. Samson Lodge, </em><a href="/pa/355/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="355 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="468961" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0571-01">355 Pa. 571</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.2d%20363" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="50 A.2d 363">50 A. 2d 363</a>. In that case we also held that . . neither plaintiff nor court may assume that defendant will fail in the performance of its fiduciary duties to its members.” The following statement from 1 Bacon on Benefit Societies (1904), sec. 116, is quoted with approval by this Court in <em>State Council Junior Order of United Am. Mech's v. Emery, </em><a href="/pa/219/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="219 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1002749" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0461-01">219 Pa. 461</a>, 467-68, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20A.%201023" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="68 A. 1023">68 A. 1023</a>: “ ‘. . .
