The ordinance provided for reports to the Department of Public Works, Bureau of Highways, by the operators of such lots and for the payment and collection of the taxes, with interest and specified penalties for default. Section 4 provided: “All such taxes shall be recoverable by the City Solicitor as other debts of like amount are now by law recoverable.”</p>

These returns should show the amount of <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>taxes admitted to be owing from time to time by' the respective parties. The complaint ■ avers that' “On or about the 31st day of May, 1941<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> an oral agreement was entered into by and between the said three individual defendants, on behalf of themselves and the corporation, and Abraham L. Shapiro and Abraham Wernick, Assistant City Solicitors, that if the City of Philadelphia would withhold any legal proceedings for the collection of the entire indebtedness due from all the individual defendants and the said corporate defendant and take no steps to terminate the permit for the operation of the said parking lots, the said individual defendants, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the corporate defendant, would pay the entire indebtedness of $9,464.58, due from all the defendants at that time, in the following manner: .</p>

It is also averred that on October 15, 1941, the sum of $250.00 was paid and a similar receipt was issued by the Receiver of Taxes. Copies of both papers are made part of the complaint. This suit is for the balance unpaid with interest and penalties.</p>

Their promise to pay was for the benefit of all the taxpayers of the city, not for the accommodation "of the assistant city solicitor or the receiver of taxes. The case is not within the general rule prohibiting recovery for breach of an illegal, contract as in <em>Kuhn v. </em>Buhl, <a href="/pa/251/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="251 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1019785" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0348-01">251 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20A.%20977" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="96 A. 977">96 A. 977</a>, and cases of that class. Section 601, Restatement, Contracts, provides: “If refusal to enforce or to rescind an illegál bargain would produce <em>a </em>harmful effect on parties for <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>whose protection the law making the bargain illegal exists, enforcement or rescission, Avhichever is appropriate, is allowed.” To protect the taxpayers the court would refuse to enforce this contract against the city. But the operation of the rule stops when the reason for the rule no longer exists. A different question is presented when the protection and the benefit of the taxpayers of the City requires the enforcement of the promise from which the promisor asks relief on the ground of illegality. Then the defaulting party may not have the benefit of the rule. The application of the principle is shown in illustration 2 to section 601. “A, a municipality, enters into a bargain with B, a corporation in which the official of A who enters into the bargain on A’s behalf is a shareholder. The formation of such bargains is made criminal by statute. B gives a bond to A to secure performance of the bargain. The bargain is defectively performed. A can get judgment on the bond.” The principle is also illustrated in our cases, among them: <em>First National Bank of Greencastle v.
