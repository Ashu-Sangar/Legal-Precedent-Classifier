Edgar J. Hull, one Of the heirs of George M. Hull, the original owner of the land involved, was'permitted to. intervene as-a party plaintiff. The answer to the bill denied the existence of the easement. After a hearing, the chancellor concluded that appellants failed to satisfactorily prove the existence of .an easement and dismissed the bill. This, appeal is from the .decree of the court below- dismissing exceptions to the adjudication. .</p>

All of the deeds to land here involved-refer to a plan'of Hull’s Addition recorded in the Office for the Recording of'Deeds in and for the County, of Lackawanna.: The;plan shows Hull Avenue extending from Lackawanna Street to the Lackawanna <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>River.' By reason- of the -recitation of tlie -plan in - the deed of ’ conveyance to appellants, they became owners] of an easement upon all-streets and alleys- shown- thereon, arid theré arose implied-covenants that'streets and alleys thereon set forth should be forever open: to' their "use. Isadore Kaplan and-Frieda Kaplan,’appellees,, in complete disregard of "the aforesaid rights of appellants, commenced the' erection across Hull Avenue of a concrete block building intended to bé used as a slaughter house. The bill concluded with -a prayer that appellees be enjoined'from further proceeding’with the erection of the building and be compelled to remove the same insofar as it encroached upon Hull Avenue. ■■</p>

Those deeds were not, hoivever, to the land here involved. The description in appellees’ deed does not use Hull Avenue as a boundary. Reference is made therein to a plan of record which was appellants’ Exhibit No. 1. Examination of this exhibit does not show Hull Avenue extending to the Lackawanna River as appellants assert. Brinley Lewis, engineer.for: the Borough’of Olyphant, and a witness for appellants, testified with regard thereto: “Q.'On that niap is Hull Avenue shown? A. Yes, sir. Q. Extending beyond the Westerly corner of Lot No. 1, Block 3, and the Southerly corner, of Lot No.,6, Block.4?. A,.Np., sir.” -There was also credible evidence that because of si-lt.deposits-from the river and dumping -of ashes,- the land in question had extended into the river.'</p>
