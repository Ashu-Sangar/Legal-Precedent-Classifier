    <p id="b172-9" data-blocks='[["BL_172.12",172,[252,976,1148,90]]]'>This is an appeal from an order entering judgment n. o. y. for defendant.</p>
    <p id="b172-10" data-blocks='[["BL_172.13",172,[251,1094,1148,587]]]'>Plaintiff, a longshoreman employed by Dugan &amp; McNamara Company, recovered a verdict for $2,800 for personal injuries sustained on December 8,1944, at 8:30 P. M. while unloading froiñ a gondola “knocked down railroad equipment”, consisting of very heavy wheels, trucks, floors and sides of railroad cars which were being shipped to France for the Army of Occupation. The car, which was being unloaded at Pier 100, South Wharves, Philadelphia, was one of several belonging to defendant company and was on tracks operated by defendant company.</p>
    <p id="b172-11" data-blocks='[["BL_172.14",172,[247,1703,1150,643]],["BL_173.1",173,[234,267,1145,158]]]'>While plaintiff and Harry Stillman were standing on top of some cases of cargo at one end of the car, they received a signal to alight because of an impending switching movement. The warning required all men stationed on freight cars to get off immediately and seek a place of safety. Plaintiff, who was not near enough to the ladder to climb off the piled cases and descend the side of the car, jumped from the top of the crates to the floor of the car. In doing so one foot went through a hole in the bottom of the car which was twenty to twenty-five inches in diameter, with allegedly “jagged edges of rotten wood.” Plaintiff delayed reporting the accident to <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>his employer until six months after its occurrence and first gave notice to defendant company upon filing suit, approximately eleven months later.</p>
    <p id="b173-5" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[234,432,1146,313]]]'>The car in which the accident occurred was one of five on the pier. It was received by defendant at Kear-ney’s Junction, New Jersey, on December 4th and was brought by the defendant to the pier for unloading. The shipment in none of the cars originated on defendant’s railroad line.</p>
    <p id="b173-6" data-blocks='[["BL_173.6",173,[235,764,1149,703]]]'>Plaintiff alleges that defendant’s failure to inspect the car before placing it on the pier is prima facie proof of negligence. Defendant in disclaiming liability, contends that since the shipment of each car originated on the line of another railroad company and the cars were already loaded with heavy equipment when received by it, a reasonable inspection of the loaded cars would have failed to disclose the hole in the bottom of any of them. It also contends that inspections on Pier 100 were made by its employees only when specially requested by the consignee and were normally limited to the condition of the lading or the safety appliances. No such request was made by the consignee of the cars in question.</p>
    <p id="b173-7" data-blocks='[["BL_173.7",173,[238,1487,1150,862]],["BL_174.1",174,[238,268,1145,97]]]'>Appellant contends that, “A reasonable inspection of the car beforehand would have included an examination of the under structure, the flooring and bracing, and certainly would have disclosed a hole of the dimensions and character described.” We cannot agree that any such exacting duty was imposed on the defendant as is thus set forth. All the five cars on the pier contained large crates filled with heavy railroad equipment. If we assume that the hole was in the bottom of the car when it arrived on the pier “an examination of the under structure, the flooring and bracing” which would have revealed the hole’s existence would have had to be of such a minute and painstaking character as to exceed the limits of what is ordinarily considered “reasonable inspection”. Defendant’s failure to make the painstaking examination plaintiff specifies cannot reasonably be ad<a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>judged to amount to such want of care under the circumstances as to constitute negligence.</p>
