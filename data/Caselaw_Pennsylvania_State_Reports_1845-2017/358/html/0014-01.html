The latter Company, after 1938, restricted its operations to the Eastern part of Pennsylvania. The complainant conducted its business from 1938 to 1943 in the Western part of Pennsylvania, establishing its main office in Pittsburgh and branch offices, with branch managers in charge thereof, at Kittanning, <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>Johnstown, Altoona,.

Prom April 21 to July 15 the defendant, as an individual under the registered fictitious name of “Armstrong Home Furnishings Company”, operated the business of selling items of merchandise similar to those sold by the plaintiff on the installment plan by house to house canvassing in the same area and territory formerly served by the plaintiff. His office was maintained in the same location formerly occupied by plaintiff’s Kittanning office.

In both cases the courts of equity administer relief without regard to the existence of a technical trade-mark!” Justice Mitchell cites the case of <em>North Cheshire &amp; Manchester Brewery Co. v.
