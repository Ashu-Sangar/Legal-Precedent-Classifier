Plaintiff claims that the defendant by using the results of its work was legally obligated to pay for it.</p>
    <p id="b590-4" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[252,618,1148,967]]]'>In its affidavit of defense, defendant alleges plaintiff breached its contract by failing to maintain a sufficient number of masons and other employees on the job; that it did not use the mixture for mortar required under the specifications; that it employed dirty and poorly shaped stones and set many of them in an unworkman-like manner; and that the joints of the face stone were not properly “raked out” as called for by the contract. Defendant filed a counterclaim for $2,846.04 to cover the additional expense which he incurred in correcting the allegedly unsatisfactory work of the plaintiff; and, also, for the excess cost of completion of the plaintiff’s work as called for under the contract and as computed at the time of the trial. Defendant also contends that he is an improper party to the action, that G-leeson, and Mul-rooney, Architects, were the proper party defendants in an action for an alleged wrongful termination of plaintiff’s sub-contract.</p>

In its letter of acceptance, dated October 30, 1945, defendant specified that plaintiff was to start work at once and complete it as rapidly as possible without unnecessary delays or interruptions. Under the specifications, the Architect reserved the right to terminate the employment of any objectionable sub-contractor upon three days written notice to the Contractor and have the work continued by others with the costs thereof deductible <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>from tbe contract. It was also provided that “All work must be made satisfactory to the Architect before any payments on ivork will be allowed.” “Satisfactory” is defined under the terms of the contract as follows: “When the words ‘Approved, Satisfactory . . . are used: They shall be taken to mean as decided by the Architect.”</p>

Plaintiff averred that it at all times had a sufficient number of skilled stone masons and laborers on the job and that, owing to defendant’s failure to complete the required excavation and to erect steel columns, commencement of its work under the contract was necessarily delayed until January 17, 1946.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It was not until receipt of the June 17,1946 communication that plaintiff finally stopped its work. Prior to that time, defendant endeavored to assist plaintiff in prosecuting its operations in a prompt, satisfactory and acceptable manner. At the trial the chief criticisms directed against plaintiff’s work were that the cement and lime content in the mortar mixture was deficient and not up to specifications. This resulted in “one-half the strength requirement and less than one-fourth of <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>the waterprofing .requirement”. By buttressing and waterproofing the walls, these conditions could be remedied. Mr. Kennard Seitz, superintendent on the job, when testifying as to the non-necessity of removing the portion of wall erected by plaintiff, said: “If I thought there was. it would have come down.” He stated: “. . . the factor of safety, in this case I will say, will take care of it, but we didn’t want to use up all the factor of safety in one place.” He also added that there was no need “for buttressing the wall.”</p>

Plaintiff alleges only that its. discharge was ‘wrongful’ and directed its evidence solely to the purpose of showing that it was not in fact an objectionable sub-contractor. Whether it. was or not, whether it ;was too slow or provided enough masons, and whether the defendant caused the trouble by. holding, up the work and delaying the plaintiff — these were all questions for the Architects to decide, and their decision was final. There was nothing for- the jury to pass upon.”</p>

It is also contended that defendant’s failure to tear down the wall constructed by plaintiff constitutes an “acceptance” of the work.</p>

If they, [the work and materials] met the approval of the architects, that was the end of the controversy .... That is to say, the architects on reference to themselves having determined. that they were not satisfied with the walls, on appeal it might be decided by others for them that they were satisfied, notwithstanding they themselves thought and said they were not. . . . Such a provision as lhis, requiring the work and materials to meet the satisfaction of the architects, is neither unusual nor unreasonable. . . , Notwithstanding all we have said, however, and wholly independent of the reference clause, the plaintiffs would still have the right to maintain an action on the contract, if they could show that the dissatisfaction expressed by the architects, was brought about through collusion between the latter and the owner, in order to disturb and defeat the plaintiff in the lawful .exercise of their work. ... we fail to see anything in it [the testimony] that would warrant even reasonable supposition of bad faith on the part of the architects. Without this, on their part, neither persistent opposition-by the owner to the contractors, nor his repeated and continued remonstrances and arguments addressed to the.architects, could establish the combination, and collusion necessary to avoid the finding of the latter,” . ,</p>
