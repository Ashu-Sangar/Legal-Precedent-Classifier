It will suffice to state that friction developed between the daughter and mother. There was litigation over testator’s alleged liability on a bond and mortgage indebtedness. The daughter orally employed Walter C.

During the course of administration a corporate fiduciary was substituted. Mr. Montgomery and the widow’s lawyer jointly represented the substituted fiduciary. David M. Harrison, Esq. was then brought into professional association with Mr. Montgomery, the other appellant. Mr. Harrison alone represented the daughter in matters pertaining to the <em>personal estate </em>but acted in' conjunction with Mr. Montgomery in <em>real estate </em>transactions. Mr. Harrison secured from the daughter a written letter of attorney which provided that Mr. Harrison should- “. . . receive 40% of all that is received or recovered by suit or settlement after, payment of fees of Walter C.

They settled ali matters in dispute; the daughter conveyed to the widow real estate reacquired from the county after tax sale, and assigned to Thomas R.

It was said by Justice Kephart in Love, Receiver <em>v. Clayton et al., </em><a href="/pa/287/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="287 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="1099648" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0205-01">287 Pa. 205</a>, 211, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.%2022" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="134 A. 22">134 A. 22</a>, that a legal assignment is “. . . ‘a transfer or setting over of property, or of some right or interest therein, from one person to another, and, unless in some way qualified, it is properly the transfer of one whole interest in an estate, chattel or other thing’: Griffey v. New York Cent. Ins. Co., <a href="/ny/100/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="100 N.Y. 417" data-case-ids="2199683" data-case-paths="/ny/100/0417-01">100 N.

J. S. 1045, section 1; 4 Amer. Jur. 229, section 2. On the other hand, an equitable assignment is “Any order, writing, or act by the assignor which makes an absolute appropriation of a chose in action or fund to the use of the assignee with the intention to transfer a present interest, although not amountíñ^’io^iri^pdt’lásá^iünettí. . . See: 6 C. J. S. 1101, section 58. In such a situation, the assignor must not retain any control over the fund, any authority to collect, or any power of revocation: 4 Amer. "'J'hr. 288, section 76. The test of whether an agreement to pay or appropriate amounts to an equitable assignment is whether the transfer was of such a character that the fund holder could safely pay, or be compelled to do so, even though he is forbidden to do so by the assignor. In the instant case, Mr. Montgomery merely had an oral contract with the distributee as to his employment. This was not an assignment. Mr. Harrison secured a letter of attorney from his client which constituted him her attorney and fixed his compensation. But here again this did not purport to <em>assign </em>the distributive share. The letter of attorney does not show tosücfi"San intention to make an assignment on the part of I the distributee as would constitute an equitable assign¡ment. No such intention is revealed by the testimony. <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>The distributee maintained control oyer the fund insofar as she was able to assign her interest in the personal estate to Thomas B. Purman and convey her interest in the realty to the widow, even though such action was taken without the knowledge and consent of her attorney. See: <em>Wahl v. Strom et al., </em><a href="/pa/344/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="344 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1211013" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0402-01">344 Pa. 402</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.2d%20820" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="25 A.2d 820">25 A. 2d 820</a>; 7 C.

    <p id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[244,728,1146,420]]]'>Ordinarily the orphans’ court has no jurisdiction to determine fees between a distributee and his attorney. Such a situation arises between living parties which can only be settled in an action at law where either party has a constitutional right to trial by jury: <em>Murphy’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/258/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="258 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="1035120" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0038-01">258 Pa. 38</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.%20935" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="101 A. 935">101 A. 935</a>.

J. S. 1141, section 210 et seq.; 5 Amer. Jur. 387, section 208 et seq. The present distributive share was at no time in the <em>possession </em>of either of the attorneys, wherefore no question arises as to their right to <em>retwin. </em>A <em>charging </em>lien of an attorney (where he does not have possession) upon a fund in court is based upon the equitable principle that the attorney primarily aided in producing the fund and to which, by agreement with his client, he is to look for compensation: <em>Jones et al. v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa-super/157/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="157 Pa. Super. 528" data-case-ids="1061445" data-case-paths="/pa-super/157/0528-01">157 Pa.

In the instant case the attorneys procured no fund for their client. True, they represented her interest and cooperated with the fiduciary in collecting assets and resisting improper claims against the estate.

In that case an attorney* represented the <em>owner </em>in collecting damages-in am eminent domain'case :and he was allowed fees over the objection of the mortgagee who greatly benefited by the litigation.
