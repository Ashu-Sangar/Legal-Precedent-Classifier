At a point about a quarter of a mile north of the bridge which crosses the Ohio River between Aliquippa and Ambridge a huge rock, of a weight estimated at eight tons, fell from a hillside adjoining the highway, struck the side of this bus with tremendous force, pushed it across to the outer edge of the road, and left it partly hanging over the embankment above the tracks of the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad which there parallel the highway. The fall was from a point on the cliff about 25 to 40 feet above the level of the highway and was followed by a larger slide of other rocks, boulders, mud and debris, amounting in all to approximately 3000 cubic feet in volume and 240 tons in weight. Of the persons in <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>the bus 20 were killed and 3 seriously injured. One of tbe latter, a passenger, was John A. McCarthy, the present plaintiff, who is now seeking to recover damages for his injuries from the Coach Company, the Woodlawn Land Company and the Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation. As the result of a trial by jury he recovered a verdict against the two latter defendants in the amount of $35,000, subsequently reduced by the court to $25,000; motions for a new trial and for judgments n.o.v. were overruled. The jury found in favor of the Coach Company and it may be stated at the outset that this was eminently proper because there Avas no evidence of any negligence on the part of the operator of the bus, who was himself killed in the accident; the rock started to fall at a time when the bus was only some 30 to 40 feet distant and when it was running so near the base of the hill that it would have been quite impossible for the operator to have seen, much less avoided, the impending danger.</p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[247,1327,1149,424]]]'>The action was brought against the Land Company because it held title to the portion of the hillside from which the rock fell and against the Steel Corporation because it not only owned all the stock of the Land Company but allegedly was in complete control of it and had created it as a mere departmental unit of its OAvn operations. The present appeals to this Court are by these two corporate bodies.</p>

Meandering through the plant site and roughly paralleling the river was originally an unimproved country road, known as the Phillipsburg and Saw Mill Run Road, which ran from the former village of Phillipsburg, now the Borough of Monaca, to the Borough of South Heights at or near the Allegheny County line. Further to the west, skirting the base of the hillside, is the four-track system of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. The hill <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>itself extends, with some breaks, for a distance of several miles in a generally northerly and southerly direction ; at the place where the accident occurred its height is about 200 feet.</p>

It was similarly the desire of the Steel Corporation to rid itself of the interference of the Phillipsburg Road running through the heart of its plant site and, incidentally, to capture the land occupied by it, amounting to 240,000 square feet, for its own industrial uses. Accordingly, in 1909, the two corporations entered into an agreement which provided that, as soon as it proved advisable, they would, at their joint expense, endeavor to change the location of this road to the hillside on the west of the railroad tracks. In 1925 they entered into an agreement with Beaver County, wherein these intentions took definite shape; they agreed to build a new highway from a point west of the Aliquippa-Ambridge Bridge, the construction of which was then in contemplation, northwardly to Station Street in the Borough of Aliquippa, a distance of some 8000 feet, to dedicate this highway to public use, and to take action to have the old road vacated; the County, on its part, agreed to pave 18 feet of the new highway with concrete. In 1926 tbe Steel Corporation and the Railroad Company entered into another agreement which-provided that the Railroad Company would give out the contracts in its own name for building the highway and for paving 6 feet of its width so as to make a total paved width of 24 feet; the Steel Corporation agreed that it would, with the co-operation of the Railroad Company, conduct the necessary legal proceedings for vacating the old Phillipsburg Road and for obtaining permission of the Public Service Commission to remove the grade crossings; the Steel Corporation and the Railroad Company were to bea.r the cost of <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>the operation in equal shares and all contracts were to be approved by the'respective engineers of both companies. All these plans were carried out at an eventual cost to each of the corporations of about one-quarter of a million dollars, and the appropriate legal actions were taken by all the authorities concerned; the old road was vacated and the approval of the Public Service Commission was obtained in response to a petition filed by the Railroad Company. In May, 1928, the highway having meanwhile been constructed and opened for public travel, the Steel Corporation tendered to the Borough a dedication (dated June 21, 1926) by Woodlawn Land Company and other abutting property owners of a 50 foot right-of-way, together with a bill of sale of all the Steel Corporation’s -right, title and interest in the highway as constructed, it not then having title in its own name to any of the land out of which the highway was built; at the same time the Railroad Company, which did oavu a substantial portion of that land, dedicated all its right, title and interest in the 50' foot strip. The Borough, by ordinance of May 21, 1928, accepted the dedication of the highway for public use as one of the streets of the Borough; by an ordinance of the same date it vacated the old road and relocated it so as to be within the lines of the new highway,- — an action approved, on petition, by the Court of' Quarter Sessions of the County.- Oh January 1, 1936 the Secretary of Highways, in pursuance of the Act of July 12,1935, P. L. 746, adopted Constitution Boulevard as a state highway, and thereafter the State Highway Department assumed its maintenance, at least from curb to curb, the Borough continuing to maintain the sidewalks and the gutter.</p>

There was also expert testimony to the effect that rain, snow and surface water were bound to seep into the Assures of the rock, that when the temperature would drop from 36 to 32 degrees the water, in freezing, would expand one-seventh or one-eighth of its volunte and that the pressure so created would cause the crevicés to Aviden so that portions of the rock, becoming overbalanced and no longer receiving support from the slope of t-lie hill, wotild topple down the cut and onto the road below — in short, that because of Aveathering and resulting processes of disintegration of the rock and the underlying strata, and in view of the fact that the condition of repose had been disturbed, an accident such as that Avhich finally occurred was constantly imminent. Warnings Avere numerous. A multitude of Avitnesses testified that from 1928 when the road Avas opened until 1942 when the accident happened there Avere numerous land slides and falls of rock upon the highway, some comparatively slight in volume but others of sufficient magnitude to require the temporary closing of the road to traffic in Avholé or in part, and, while the Avitnesses could not always identify the exact months or even years Avhen the ■ particular falls occurred,- they did state that they usually took place in the springtime following freezing and thaAvs and from one end of the highway to the other; indeed they Avere so regular in their recurrence that the street obtained a notorious reputation as a dan<a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>gerous highway. This condition became marked to such a degree that in 1936 the walk which had been constructed on the west side of the road was barricaded to travel at both ends and the Borough constructed a new 4 foot walk on the east <em>side; </em>at the same time numerous danger signs were posted reading “Falling rock. Travel at your own risk”. Moreover a public petition was presented to the State Highway Department urging that the boulevard be made safe for public travel, in response to which the Department arranged for workers of the Public Works Administration to go up the hillside for the purpose of removing weathered and loose stone and earth, if necessary cutting away a portion of the hill, and taking other measures to obviate the threatened danger. The Department procured the appropriate equipment and apparatus and then attempted to get from the abutting landowners permission to enter upon their lands and releases of liability for any damage resulting from the proposed operations, but the Land Company, or the Steel Corporation, or both of them, (the evidence is not entirely clear), Avithheld their consent, so that the State Highway Department and the Public Works Administration, frustrated in their efforts, had to abandon the project.</p>

But what plaintiff does claim is that, since the construction of the road changed the natural slope of the hillside which had theretofore been stable and in repose, there was thereby created a duty on the part of the Land Company and the Steel Corporation, which, in dedicating the 50 foot roadway, had retained ownership, possession, dominion and control over the slope, of subsequent watchful inspection and proper maintenance, of their land abutting oh the highway, and that, by their negligence in failing to conduct such inspections and to undertake the measures the necessity of which such inspections would undoubtedly have disclosed, they became liable for the injuries caused by the accident which resulted.</p>

There the state, <em>which owned a mountainside adjacent to a highway, </em>was held liable for injury and death caused by rock from the mountain falling upon persons traveling on the highway. It was shown that during the thawing period each spring rock had fallen on the road; therefore the State was charged with notice of the dangerous condition and, <em>as the abutting owner </em>(as well as because of its governmental obligation to maintain the highway in a reasonably safe condition for travel), had the duty of constructing necessary barriers to prevent such an accident.</p>

The Steel Corporation had joined with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad Company in the project of cutting the hillside, thereby disturbing its stability and repose. Any reasonable periodic or even occasional inspections would have revealed the resulting probability of danger, to say nothing of the warnings given by the falls themselves which occurred with comparative frequency from 1928 on. Defendants complain of the admission of the testimony relating to these previous falls because they were not in the immediate area of the present accident and not from land owned by the Woodlawn Land Company, nor <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>was it expressly shown that they resulted from identical conditions. However, they were all from the one stretch of hillside paralleling the boulevard and were quite obviously due to the same natural causes, so that such evidence was clearly admissible: <em>Ringelheim v.

It is true that the State Highway Commissioner, with the consent of the local authorities, was empowered, under the Act of May 31, 1911, P.

The duty of a municipality or of the Commonwealth itself to provide for the-safety of the travelers on a public road is something wholly distinct from the-duty of the adjacent landowners not to impair such safety by negligence in the maintenance of their own lands beyond the highway limits where such lands had been artificially changed from their natural state.

In pursuance of the decision in the <em>SlivJca </em>case the Railroad Company’s affidavits of defense raising questions of law to the original defendants’ complaints in the present case were sustained and judgment entered for the Railroad Company. Appellants now argue that that judgment operated as a conclusive adjudication that they also are not subject to any liability, but they overlook the fact, which was emphasized in both the <em>Hair </em>case and the <em>Slivlca </em>case, that the Railroad Company had no ownership of the property adjacent to the highway nor any control or duty to maintain or assist in maintaining either the highway or the slopes, nor did it have any right whatsoever to go upon the land on which the hillside was located for any purpose. It must once more be pointed out that the liability presently asserted by plaintiff is based upon negligence, not in the original location and construction of the highway, but in the failure of appellants as abutting landowners to perform their duty of properly inspecting and maintaining their <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>property in such condition as not to be likely to cause danger to those traveling on the highway.

However, we are of opinion that the verdict, even as reduced by the court below, is excessive. Unquestionably plaintiff suffered a severe injury. At the time of the accident he was 26 years of age and was employed by the Steel Corporation in a clerical capacity. He had compound comminuted fractures of both bones of the left lower leg and a compound fracture of the right femur; he was in the hospital for five months following the accident and for shorter periods intermittently thereafter and was subjected to several operations in order to reduce the fracture of the femur and for the grafting of bone and skin. Fortunately there has been excellent union at the site of the fracture of the femur although there is a shortening of the right leg from a half inch to an inch; motion of the left ankle and flexion of the right knee are slightly limited. Notwithstanding these impairments there is nothing in plaintiff’s present physical condition to interfere with the performance of his regular work, and, as already stated, there is no claim for diminution !of earning capacity. His loss of wages was $1750 and his medical expenses were $3512.60. The award in excess of $5262.60 represented, therefore, the items of pain, suffering and permanent deformity. On the whole, we are of opinion that the verdict should be further reduced to $20,000;</p>
