One thing, however, is unquestionable ; the Constitution must have referred to a system of law coextensive with, and operating uniformly in, the whole country. It certainly could not have been intended to place the rules, and limits- of maritime law under the disposal and -regulation of the several States, as that would have defeated the uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the intercourse of the states with. each other or with foreign states.’ ” Congress, in the exercise of its power over admiralty and maritime law, has directed that “in cases of wages or effects of deceased seamen or apprentices received by the circuit ¡courts (now district courts), to which -no claim is substantiated within six years after the receipt thereof . . . each of the respective courts shall, from time to time, pay any moneys arising from the unclaimed wages and effects of deceased seamen . . . into the treasury of the United States, which moneys shall form a fund for, and be appropriated to, the relief of sick and disabled and destitute seamen belonging to the United States merchant-marine service.” The supremacy of the exercise of Congressional power regarding a given subject-matter , effectively negatives the reserved power of the Commonwealth with regard thereto. The Act of 1889, P. L. 66, Section 5, as amended, supra, must be held inapplicable. To hold otherwise would effect an unconstitutional interference with congressional power.</p>

That function performed, it now retains jurisdiction for the sole purpose of making disposition of the fund under its control, by ordering payment of it to the persons entitled as directed by the federal statute. Beyond whatever is needful and appropriate to the accomplishment of that end, the jurisdiction and possession of the federal district court does not operate to curtail the power which the state may constitutionally exercise over persons and property within its territory.” In the instant case, the federal statute directs that the moneys be paid to the United States Treasury and there retained in a fund. In the former case, the federal district court retained power to award the moneys to the person properly claiming the same. Here, the statute does not permit such award.</p>
