On the contrary, all the provisions of Article XVIII of. the Code indicate that the boards of school directors were to have full latitude in arranging all the terms and conditions of the joinder. Section 1801 provides that the cost of constructing, equipping and maintaining such a school should be paid by the districts “in such manner and in such proportion as they may agree upon.” Section 1802 provides that title to the real estate <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>should be held in the name of one or more of the districts as they may agree. 'Section 1803 provides that no such school should be established unless the districts first entered into a written agreement “that such proposed joint school ". . . shall be established and maintained by the several districts, in such manner and proportion, <em>and upon such terms </em>as the several districts may then agree upon.” Certainly the permission" to fix by agreement the terms upon which a "joint school should be established and maintained includes the right to determine by such agreement the period of its duration. It is true that section 1808 provides that the school districts establishing a joint school may at any time by a majority vote of the school directors of their respéctive districts discontinue the school, but such method of discontinuance is permissive, not mandatory or exclusive, and is preserved in the present agreement by a provision in practically the same language as the statute, the term of thirty years being designated merely as the <em>maximum </em>period that the agreement should continue.. Indeed it would seem to be a wise policy of the law to permit school districts to agree on .the maintenance of a joint school for only a limited or experimental period since a district might be reluctant to enter into an agreement which it must suffer to exist in perpetuity unless the other district should be willing at some future time to consent to a cancellation; changes of population or other circumstances might make it advantageous to the one and correspondingly disadvantageous to the other district to discontinue the school, with a resulting impasse detrimental to the best interests "of all concerned. It may be pointed out that' an agréement for a designated period is, after all, nothing but an <em>advance </em>consent by both parties to "the discontinuance of the school at the end of that period, nor does this encroach upon the freedom of' action of future boards since the latter would have the power, at the end of the period named in the agreement, to continue the joint school if the boards of both districts should so desire.</p>

      <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>The Borough School District contends — and with justification — that the notice of termination given by the Township School Board on February 12, 1946 was ineffective because, according to the phraseology of the resolution of February 12, 1945, there could not be any termination until July 1, 1947. The resolution provided for the continuation of the thirty year agreement until July 1, 1946, and <em>“thereafter from year to </em>year. . . . Either board shall have the right to terminate the <em>year to year contract </em>by giving ninety days written notice of its intention so to do prior to the beginning of the next contract year.” Under this provision the “year to year contract” began July 1,1946, and — giving the word “terminate” its ordinary meaning — the parties could scarcely have meant that it should be subject to “termination” before it had begun. But the Township Board gave a second notice on March 24, 1947 declaring a termination as of July 1, 1947, and certainly to that notice there can be no valid objection. The right to terminate was not dependent upon a failure to agree on a building program; it was absolute and unconditional except for the obligation to give the required notice.</p>

The agreement wisely provided for an amicable settlement in. regard to the disposition of the joint property, and, since the parties were,, in good faith, uncertain as to, the validity of the attempted cancellation of the agreement, they should now have the benefit of the ninety day period therein stipulated in which to negotiate a settlement as to the property .jointly owned by them and to adjust all the other problems arising from the liquidation of the joint project; if, unfortunately, they fail to achieve harmony within that period, then, as the agree<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>ment provides, there must be a public sale of the property, the proceeds, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement and section 1808 of the School Code, to be divided between the districts in the proportions in which they contributed to the original cost.</p>

The question arises under an agreement of February 6,1915, between the plaintiff and defendant school districts for the establishment and maintenance of a joint high school. Paragraph “Twelfth” of the agreement provides, in part here material, that “This agreement shall be and remain in force for a period of thirty years from the date of the execution thereof, . . .”. The paragraph contains a-further clause that “the [agreement] may be cancelled and the said High School discontinued at any time by the majority vote of the directors of each of the said districts”, as, of course, it manifestly could be. Does not Sec. 1808 of the Code, itself, direct that “The several school districts establishing any joint school . . . may, at any time by a majority vote of the school directors of their respective districts, discontinue any such joint school . . .”? How, then, can any <em>inter partes </em>arrangement in. such connection validly add to or transgress the relevant provisions of the Code?</p>

From that provision, the. majority óf this court forthwith infer that one of. the permissible terms of the agreement for a joint school is the fixing of a period of years for the duration of; the agreement. Thus the majority concludes,v — “Certainly the permission to fix by agreement the terms upon which a joint , school should be established and maintained includes the right to determine by such agreement the period of its duration”. But, that does not logically follow by any means. In reality, the inference amounts to judicial interpolation in Sec. 1803 of a wholly non-germane matter.' What Sec. 1803 deals with is the <em>establishment and maintenance </em>and <em>not-with the discontinuance of a joint school. </em>For the latter eventuality Sec. 1808.is the competent enactment which prescribes the means for discontinuing a joint school once it is established and maintained in accordance with the written agreement provided ■ for by Sec. 1803.</p>

L. 1019, Art. IV, See. 51, 46 PS §551. And, that means <em>full </em>effect. The presumption is “That the Legislature intends the entire statute to be effective and certain”: Statutory Construction Act, cit. supra, Art. IY, See. 52,.-46. PS §552. -If school districts are to be permitted to prescribe a fixed period for the maximum duration of an agreement for the establishment and maintenance of a joint school, then the intendment of Sec. 1808 will be effectively circumvented to a large extent.

But, the answer to that suggestion is that any question of policy concerning the maintenance or operation of the public schools is primarily and peculiarly a matter for the legislature. It is not to be overlooked that the parties'litigant in this case are coordinate agencies of the Commonwealth within their respective districts for public school purposes and that their present controversy arises out of their agreement for the establishment and maintenance of a joint high school, — a matter fully qualifying as the concern and responsibility, of the General .Assembly-, by virtue of specific constitutional mandateArticle X, Section 1, of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In <em>Wilson v. Philadelphia School </em>District, <a href="/pa/328/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="328 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1179655" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0225-01">328 Pa. 225</a>, 231, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2090" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="195 A. 90">195 A. 90</a>, this court noted that “The Constitution of 1874 <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>. . . directed <em>the legislature </em>to maintain <em>‘a, </em>thorough and efficient system of public schools’: Article X, Section 1. The school system, or <em>the school districts, </em>then,- <em>are hut agencies of the state legislature </em>to administer this constitutional duty”. (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[257,565,1150,1299]]]'>Indeed, it is not easy to understand why, in a case such as this, we do not, by rule, require notice to the Superintendent of Public Instruction with leave to him to appear and be heard. Compare the amendment of May 13, 1925, P. L. 634, Sec. 2, 24 PS §1633, which provides that “The State Council of Education is hereby authorized and directed to investigate and to aid in the establishment of consolidated and joint consolidated schools, and to inspect and approve such schools, as hereinafter provided”. It will hardly be disputed that the State’s interest in the matter is both evident and extensive and may be seriously affected in its absence. Because of the constitutionally imposed burden in respect of the public schools, as above shown, the legislature’s duty in the premises is by no means at an end upon the enactment of a statute relating to the public schools. Any thought, therefore, that the reciprocal obligations and commitments of school districts, duly assumed and made under direct legislative authority for the establishment and maintenance of joint schools (Art. XVIII of the School Code) j are to be judicially contemplated as private rights are contemplated and dealt with as the Law Merchant might ordain for private individuals is to my mind a patent misconception.</p>

But, why should the school directors of one generation act conclusively in an important school matter many years in advance of the time that such action is designed to become effective? Contrary to the view of the majority, to so determine the discontinuance of a joint school at some definite date in the remote future does “. . . encroach upon the freedom of action of future boards”, for, while . . the latter would have the power, at the end of the period named in the agreement, to continue the joint school”, the continuance would occur only “. . . if the boards of both districts should so desire”, — a situation which is diametrically the reverse of the intendment of Sec. 1808. Thus, instead of majority action of the directors of the respective districts for the discontinuance of a joint school, as Sec. 1808 contemplates, under the construction now placed by this court upon the provisions of Article XVIII of the School Code, it will require majority action of the directors of the respective districts to <em>contimie </em>a joint school after a specified period of years when, in nine out of ten of such cases, the joint school will very likely be more to the advantage of one of the participant districts than to the other. But, that furnishes no real justification for an <em>ex parte </em>discontinuance of a joint school. The supposedly disproportionate burdens and benefits to the respective districts after a period of operation is a foreseeable possibility from the day a joint school is established. That contingency is outweighed by the advantages to be had by the pupils of both districts from the joint school. And, if they are to be maintained, when once established, without disruption, then their discontinuance should be judicially discountenanced except when that is accomplished in the manner specified by the legislature in Sec'. 1808 of the School Code. Neither board of respective contracting districts can properly be elevated to the position of exclusive agent of the State for determining whether a <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>joint school should be discontinued: cf. <em>Walker’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/332/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="332 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1186584" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0488-01">332 Pa. 488</a>, 492, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20770" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 A.2d 770">2 A. 2d 770</a>.</p>
