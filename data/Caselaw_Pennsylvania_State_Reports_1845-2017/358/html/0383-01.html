Graham (decedent), two aged maiden ladies, lived together in appellant’s home in Bethlehem. Decedent was the housekeeper while appellant conducted an insurance and real estate business. Appellant invested savings in United States Defense Bonds consisting of Series D and E and United States Treasury Bonds, the total maturity value of which is $15,000. The bonds were registered in the names of “Mildred Graham <em>or </em>Elizabeth J. Graham.” Appellant acquired a safe deposit box in a bank, in both names, giving each full access. The bonds were placed in the safe deposit box.</p>

The portion of the property taxed is determined by ascertaining the fractional portion passing at the death of a joint tenant. We decided in <em>Commonwealth v.

Mr. Justice Horace Stern said, p. 548: “Whether this appropriation be designated an inheritance tax, an estate tax, a succession tax, a death duty, or otherwise howsoever, it is not, in its essence, a tax on the decedent’s property or any component part of it, or on the transaction of transferring it as in the case of a transmission of possession or title inter vivos, but an excise on the privilege of inheritance. It is really not a tax at all in the ordinary meaning of the word, but rather a distributive share of the estate which the State retains for itself.” and on p. 552: “The cases in the Supreme Court of the United States analyze the nature of inheritance tax legislation in much the same manner as the courts of our own State. Thus it was held in <em>Plummer v. Coler, </em><a href="/us/178/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="178 U.S. 115" data-case-ids="3612310" data-case-paths="/us/178/0115-01">178 U.
