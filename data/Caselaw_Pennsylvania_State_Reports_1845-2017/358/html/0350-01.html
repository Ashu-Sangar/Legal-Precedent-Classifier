Clarence Lofton remained in front of the establishment as “look-out”. Turner, who was armed with an iron sash'-weight, entered the premises first. There he’ and Johnson met Frank Endres, a factory employee. Turner twice struck Endres over the head with the iron, felling him and Johnson “got his wallet from him.” The proprietor, Charles Simmons, who was in the rear of the store, upon hearing the scuffle came to the front. When he appeared he was hit “a couple of times and he went down”. Turner “went into his pockets” and took the <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>wallet containing “over $100”. The two felons left the building, joined Lofton, divided the loot and went to a taproom at “8th and Callowhill and had a few drinks”. A policeman passing the premises discovered that the door was open and entered the place. He found the victims lying in “pools of blood and beaten about the head”. He had them removed to the hospital. Two days later Endres died. Simmons died seven days later. There were no witnesses to the crime except its victims and perpetrators.</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[222,836,1149,480]]]'>Defendant was arrested without warrant at 11 a.m., June 3, 1946, six months after the commission of the crime. Information leading to his arrest was volunteered by Lofton, who was apprehended on May 25,1946 in connection with an investigation conducted into a series of crimes. Johnson was arrested on June 3, 1946 about four-thirty in the afternoon. Turner was held in police custody until June 8, 1946 when he was brought before a magistrate.</p>

No threats were made against him and no promises were given him. He was questioned a few hours every day until June 7th, when Turner said he wished to tell the truth, that what the other two men had told about him was true and that he would tell all about it. Turner said: “I was at the broom factory and I struck two men with a piece of iron”. On the first day of his arrest Turner was interrogated for about three hours and on the next day for about three hours. This continued for five days until the admission of guilt was made. Detective Fisher also questioned the defendant in O’Mahoney’s presence. “Sometimes Detective Carey Avas there and sometimes Detective Lennon was there and Sergeant Riccardi was there and Detective Thompson was there and Lieutenant Kelly took an active part in the questioning of this man.” Sometimes the question<a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>ing was done in Turner’s cell and sometimes in a room about 12 feet square at police headquarters. He said that during this period Turner never asked us “to get in touch with his friends or relatives”. He was asked: “Did you ever tell Turner anything he might say coxild be used against him?” He said that he did so “on the night that he said he wanted to tell the truth. That is the 7th of June”.</p>

Turner signed each of the sheets of the transcript containing the questions and answers. Turner described the weapon he used in the killing as “a piece of iron, about 11 inches long, 2% inches wide, % inch thick, with a hole in the end.” He was asked: “How many times did you hit the white men over the head when you entered the premises at 355 North 2nd Street on December 15,1945, at about 5:00 p.m. ?” He answered: “I hit the first man twice and I seen Fats get his wallet from him. Q. How many times did you hit the second man? A. I only hit him a couple of times and he went down and I went into his pockets and his wallet and took the wallet and went out with it. There was something over $100.00. I don’t know how much. I threw it away while walking out Callow-hill Street. Q. How much money did you give Clarence Lofton? A. $87.00. Q. How much money did you give Jasper Johnson, alias Fats? A. I didn’t give him any money. He said he got $50.00. Q. How much money did Jasper Johnson give you? A. I don’t know how much he gave me but I gave Clarence $87.00, out of it and I kept $75.00.”</p>

      <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>At the trial Turner denied the truth of his confession and asserted that it had been procured from him by fear and physical abuse. In submitting to the jury the question whether or not the confession was voluntary and uncoerced the trial judge correctly said: “Then, before the confession may be admitted in evidence, the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession has been a free and voluntary one, not induced by fear, coercion, or promise held out, or inducement held out to the defendant. You must first find that the confession was a voluntary statement made by the defendant of his own free will. That seems to me to be the crhx of this case.</p>

As. to the confession the court well said in its opinion refusing a new trial: “. . . the defendant is. not a poor negro of a low degree of intelligence. From , an observation of him and listening to his testimony, it is apparent that he is a smart, clever individual. It is apparent that his confession was not concocted by others, and it .is clear that it is not a fabrication created by another mind or minds. The statement as given by the defendant is logical and only consistent with his guilt and that of his confederates. It shows that the defendant had this broom factory under observation two days before the murders and that he and his confederates went to the factory on that Saturday afternoon after the close of the business day, for the purpose of robbery. . . . The confession of the defendant and the confessions of his confederates stated what each <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>gave to the other in the way of cash after they had fled from the scene of their crimes. The confession of the defendant shows that in going out Callowhill Street, he threw the sash weight away; that the three confederates then went to saloons where they had some drinks, and that they then parted, promising each other that they would say nothing about the crime. A reading of the confession shows that the defendant was asked whether he had been threatened or harmed and whether he had been promised anything, and it also contains the caution that anything he might say, might be used against him. The defendant was asked if he knew, when he was arrested, what the charge was and he said, ‘yes, sir, for the murdering of those two men in the broom factory.’ ”</p>

The teller of the gruesome story of this double murder was obviously drawing on his memory and not on a fear-fired imagination. His narrative. dovetailed so accurately with the physical facts surrounding the crime and with the story told by his accomplices that there can be no reasonable doubt of the story’s truthfulness.</p>

No eye has seen him, no ear has heard him. The secret is his own, and it is safe! Ah! Gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a secret can be safe nowhere. . . . the guilty soul cannot keep its own secret. It is false to itself; or rather it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be true to itself.

It finds itself preyed on by a torment, which it dares not acknowledge to God or man. A vulture is devouring it, and it can ask no sympathy or assistance, either from heaven or from earth.

He feels it beating at his heart, rising to his throat, and demanding disclosure. He thinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in his eyes, and hears its workings in the very silence of his thoughts. It has become his master. It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his courage, it conquers his prudence.
