      <em>Tucker v. Binenstock, </em><a href="/pa/310/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="310 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1144243" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0254-01">310 Pa. 254</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%20247" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="165 A. 247">165 A. 247</a> (1933) was a proceeding in equity by Tucker for an accounting from Binenstock, the present defendant, of money received by him in transactions considered in that case. We held that the transactions were illegal and on that account equity would not aid Tucker in collecting from Binenstock any part of the unlawful gain. It appeared that Tucker and Binenstock had caused New Century Realty Company to be incorporated in 1923 and that it <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>bad taken title to a brewery; that they had caused Atlantic Brewing Company to be incorporated and that the realty company had leased the brewery to the brewing company, and that the brewing company had made and sold beer containing more alcohol than allowed by law. The illegal business had been conducted from September, 1923, to November, 1926, the period for which Tucker desired the accounting. It appeared in that proceeding that the brewing company had made large profits in the manufacture and sale of illegal beer and had become indebted to the realty company for rent. In the opinion of this Court disposing of the case it was said, “So here the fact that the illegal profits were received by the realty company in the form of rent will not be permitted to disguise the fact that both corporations were owned by the same individuals, who cannot, by reliance upon the fiction of corporate entity, convert illegal gains into legal rents.” From that litigation it was clear that Binenstock had received money to which he was not entitled as owner. We decided that the money had been unlawfully acquired; neither Tucker nor Binen-stoek was the lawful owner. The Commonwealth thereafter claimed the money.</p>

He filed preliminary objections which the court sustained on the ground that the petition was directed against a number of funds said to have belonged to two different corporations and a partnership instead of against a fund which had belonged to a single owner. We were required to reverse that judgment for'the reason stated in the opinion reported in <a href="/pa/348/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="348 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="1220319" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0610-01">348 Pa. 610</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20A.2d%20333" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="36 A.2d 333">36 A. 2d 333</a>, to the effect that the petition stated a prima facie case within the Act of May 2, 1889, P.

L. 281, 27 PS 333. Section 3 of the amended Act reads as follows: “That whensoever any trustee or other person is or shall be seized of any property or estate, real or personal, in a fiduciary capacity, and shall file an account of the same in any court of this Commonwealth and whensoever it shall appear that the cestui que trust, or beneficial owner, of said property or effects, or any part thereof, has been unknown for a period of seven years, and still remains unknown, then and in such case so much of said property or effects as belonged to said unknown cestui que trust, or beneficial owner, shall escheat to the.

Section 190, Restatement, Restitution, provides : “Where a person in a fiduciary relation to another acquires property and the acquisition or retention of the property is in violation of his duty as fiduciary he holds it upon a constructive trust for the other.”</p>

Petitioners offered no other evidence and defendant offered none.</p>

It may aid in understanding petitioners’ first contention that the learned court erred in excluding as admissions, inadequately answered averments in the petition, if we quote a typical paragraph and the answer to it. The third paragraph of the petition avers: “3. That the moneys sought to be escheated as hereinafter set forth were received and retained by the said Joseph Binenstock, as agent or trustee for the Standard Brewing Company, the Atlantic Brewing Company, and the New Century Realty Company, out of the proceeds of the business of the Standard Brewing Company and the Atlantic Brewing Company and out of rents which were paid to him for the New Century Realty Company out of proceeds of said business. The Standard Brewing Company was a partnership and the Atlantic Brewing Company and the New Century Realty Company were corporations organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. Said moneys were derived and received from illegal business and illegal transactions in violation of the Prohibition Laws of the United States and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as hereinafter <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>more particularly set forth, and are without rightful or lawful owners.”</p>
    <p id="b671-3" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[205,384,1146,803]]]'>The third paragraph of the answer stated: “3. It is denied that the respondent ever received any moneys as agent or trustee for the Standard Brewing Company, The Atlantic Brewing Company and the New Century Realty Company, either out of the proceeds of any business carried on by any of the foregoing organizations or otherwise. It is denied that any partnership existed under the name of the Standard Brewing Company. It is admitted that the Atlantic Brewing Company and the New Century Realty Company were corporations organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. It is denied that any moneys were received by respondent as agent or trustee for any of the foregoing organizations, whether said moneys were derived from illegal business transactions or otherwise.”</p>
    <p id="b671-4" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[205,1215,1145,363]]]'>It will be observed that paragraph 3 averred a number of facts, inter alia: 1. defendant (a) received and (b) retained money; 2. he did so as agent or trustee for named parties; 3. the money was the proceeds (a) of the brewing business and (b) of rents; 4. an illegal business and 5. therefore the money was without a rightful or lawful owner.</p>

He should have denied specifically every fact to be put in issue, this is, every fact he did not wish to be taken as an admission by him. He does not deny that he received and retained the money; those facts are therefore admitted. He denies the capacity in which he received and retained it without specifying, as he should have done, the circumstances in which it was received and retained, so that the circumstances might be ascertained by the trial. That he received money in the ap<a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>parently illegal transaction appears in the following statement of counsel for defendant made during the trial, “There isn’t the slightest doubt that this man received in his position as treasurer of the New Century Realty Company certain sums of money. That is not receiving it as agent or trustee for this corporation. It is receiving rents in the due course of business as treasurer of the New Century Realty Company and they used that rent to pay taxes, mortgage interest, insurance and repairs. He will testify to that. There isn’t any doubt about it.” Why was that fact not set forth in the answer in response to paragraph 3 of the petition?</p>

All the considerations which support the rule in either of those two classes of action require that the same rule be applied in this class of proceeding. It has long been the rule that a general denial is not sufficient in an affidavit of defense. In equity the practice is governed by rule 52 which provides: “It shall not be sufficient for defendant in his answer to deny generally any of the averments of the bill; he must specifically admit, deny or qualify, — in the latter event particularly setting forth of what the qualification consists, — each and every allegation of the bill, in paragraphs corresponding to the numbers thereof. Averments of the bill (other than those of value or amount of damages), not substantially answered, shall be taken as admitted, by all those who were served or appeared in the suit, except infants, lunatics or other persons non compos and not under guardianship. . . While Pa. R. C. P. No. 1029 was not in effect when the answer in this case was filed, it may be noted that the <a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>rules referred to aboye have been carried into Eule 1029 which provides: “Éule 1029. Denials. Demand of Proof. Effect of Failure to Deny or Demand Proof, (a) A responsive pleading shall admit or deny the averments of fact in the preceding pleading or part thereof to which it is responsive. Admissions and denials in a responsive pleading shall refer specifically to the paragraph in which the averment admitted or denied is set forth, (b) Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required are admitted when not denied specifically or by necessary implication. A general denial or a demand for proof, except as provided by subdivision (c) of this rule, shall have the effect of an admission.”</p>
    <p id="b673-3" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[243,999,1149,1197]]]'>The learned trial judge sustained defendant’s objections to a number of petitioners’ offers of proof of facts that were not sufficiently denied by the answer. We are of opinion that the averment, for example, that defendant as agent or trustee for the parties mentioned received and retained money is not adequately answered by the general denial that he “received no moneys as agent or trustee for” the parties. If he received money for the account of any of them (as his counsel admitted at the trial) he should have stated the fact, leaving it to be determined in the trial in what capacity and with what effect the money was received. The learned trial judge erroneously sustained the objections: compare <em>Buehler v. U. S.

At the top of page 29a plaintiffs’ counsel said, “I haven’t offered that part in which I allege that the moneys are escheatable. I omitted that from my offer because that is a conclusion of law in paragraph 2 and it is denied.” Apparently the entire paragraph was read.
