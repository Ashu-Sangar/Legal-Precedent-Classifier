Barnsley, appellant, instituted proceedings in equity to set aside her deed conveying premises 3802 Bonsall Avenue, Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, to Ray Arnold Shaffer and Doris Sophie Shaffer, his wife, appel-lees, alleging that the transfer was induced and effected by fraudulent misrepresentations and promises assuring her retention of the free use thereof for her life. This appeal is from the final decree of the court <em>en bane </em>dismissing appellant’s exceptions to the decree of the chancellor dismissing the bill.</p>

This- lease was subsequently amended to provide for a term of. one, year.</p>

Department of Justice v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/352/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="352 Pa. 527" data-case-ids="464125" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0527-01">352 Pa. 527</a>, 528, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.2d%2098" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="43 A.2d 98">43 A. 2d 98</a>. The chancellor properly found that appellant, age 57, was mentally alert and well able to read and write; that after preliminary negotiations she signed the agreement of sale, the deed, and the lease; that when she signed the agreement of sale, and the deed she knew neither secured to her the free use of the premises for her life; and, that she knew the lease provided for the payment of rent. She testified she was aware that: “There was nothing to protect me in the deed at all.” Nevertheless, she signed the same. 'With regard to the lease which she signed two days thereafter, she stated that she did not read the lease until she got home and that she had “very foolishly signed”.</p>

She knew what she was signing and cannot now be heard to say that she did not know the contents thereof at that time. Where parties to a transaction have, without fraud, accident or mistake, deliberately reduced their engagements to writing, that writing is not only the best, but the only evidence of their agreement: <em>Gianni v. Russell &amp; Co., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/281/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="281 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1086994" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0320-01">281 Pa. 320</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.%20791" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="126 A. 791">126 A. 791</a>. “Any parol agreement that subjects the obligation on the instrument to any condition or contingency, whether in person, time or amount, is ineffective, and the instrument is unconditional, unless fraud, accident, or mistake was the means through which the instrument was procured”: <em>Speier v. Michelson, </em><a href="/pa/303/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="303 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1130037" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0066-01">303 Pa. 66</a>, 72, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20127" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="154 A. 127">154 A. 127</a>. Appellant not only conveyed the premises to appellees, but also reduced the terms and conditions of her occupancy to writing by signing the written lease of January 2, 1946. She cannot now, by parol evidence, set aside the writing and negative the effect of covenants therein contained. The writings represent the agreements of <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>the parties and their terms cannot be added to nor subtracted from by parol evidence of the quality contained in this record. The purported oral agreement and that evidenced by the writing relate to the same subject-matter and are so interrelated that both would ordinarily and normally be executed at the same time and in the same contract. The scope of the subsidiary agreement must be deemed covered by the written.</p>
