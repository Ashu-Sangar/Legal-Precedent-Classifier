The defendant, having presented a point for binding instructions which had been overruled, duly filed a motion with the trial court, pursuant to the Act of April 20,1911, P. L. 70,12 PS §684, for judgment upon <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>the whole record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The court en banc subsequently overruled the motion and the defendant took this appeal. The question involved, <em>in limine, </em>is whether there is a right of appeal under the Act of 1911, cit. supra, from the refusal of a motion for judgment upon the whole record. That question has been exhaustively argued before a full bench upon a reargument on our own motion. In the view we take of this question, it becomes unnecessary for us to go into the merits of the case.</p>

Consequently, we are without jurisdiction to entertain the instant appeal. Such properly comports with this Court’s ruling in <em>Lipsky v.

In that case, the question was directly raised on a motion to quash and was as directly answered. Mr. Justice Mestbezat, speaking for the Court, clearly and cogently reasoned from the plain words of the statute that it is only where <em>a judgment </em>is entered on a motion, appropriately made <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>pursuant to the Act of 1911, that a right of appeal to the Supreme or Superior Court (as the case may be) exist? <em>in favor of the party against whom, such judgment is rendered </em>and, further, that an order denying a motion for judgment upon the whole record (e.g., “motion dismissed” as in the <em>Lipsky </em>case) is not a judgment within the contemplation of the Act and, therefore, is not appealable. What the <em>Lipsky </em>case thus definitely and conclusively settled was evidently so thoroughly understood by the bar at large that, throughout the succeeding twenty-four years, no one ever attempted to appeal to this Court from an order dismissing or refusing a motion for judgment upon the whole record under the Act of 1911.</p>

In neither case was the question of the right to appeal raised or argued. In the earlier case (W. <em>H. Buck et al. v. McArthur, </em><a href="/pa-super/86/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="86 Pa. Super. 49" data-case-ids="569619" data-case-paths="/pa-super/86/0049-01">86 Pa. Superior Ct. 49</a>, 1925), the Act of 1911 was merely cited (p. 52) as the authority for the motions made <em>by both sides </em>in that case for judgment upon the whole record. Plainly enough, therefore, no question, as to whether there was appellate jurisdiction, was or could have been raised by either party in the circumstances indicated. In the other case, <em>O’Kane v. Murray, </em><a href="/pa-super/89/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="89 Pa. Super. 11" data-case-ids="671325" data-case-paths="/pa-super/89/0011-01">89 Pa.

L. 221 (an amendment of the Judgment Non Obstante Yeredicto Act of April 22, 1905, P.

Act of 1905, referred to in the opinion for the Superior Court in the <em>O’Kane </em>case, supra, had been made quite evident by this Court’s opinion in <em>Sloan v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/275/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="275 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="1075633" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0452-01">275 Pa. 452</a>, 455, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.%20556" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="119 A. 556">119 A. 556</a> (1923). In the latter case, it was held that “. . . the [N. O..V.] Act of April 22, 1905, P. L. 286, affords a right of appeal <em>only when a final judgment is entered </em>on the whole record”. (Emphasis supplied). Consequently, the refusal of a motion for judgment n.o.v., where the. court contemporaneously set aside the verdict by granting a new trial, was held not appealable because there was no judgment. The only appeal possible in such circumstances was., from the grant of the new trial which action is . never reverse^] unless it clearly appears the trial court abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily or under a plain mistake of law’ ”, as quoted in the <em>Sloan </em>case, supra, from <em>Hess v.

As a direct result of the ruling in the <em>Sloan </em>case, the legislature, at its very next session, enacted the amendment of April 9, 1925, P.

If that be not so, then, why did the legislature act affirmatively by the amendment of 1925 to confer a right of appeal from the refusal <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>of a motion for judgment n.o.v. <em>under the Act of 1905 </em>and not do likewise with relation to the refusal- of -a motion for judgment upon the whole record under the Act of 1911 except for a controlling legislative intent that the law- with respect to appeals under the Act of 1911 should remain as the <em>Lipslcy </em>case had construed it to he, viz., that “until a judgment is entered [under the Act of 1911] there can be, of course, no appeal'to this court” ? The question furnishes its own. answer; and, the pertinent rules of statutory construction confirm the validity of the answer: cf. <em>March v. Philadelphia &amp; West Chester Traction Co., </em><a href="/pa/285/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="285 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="1095089" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0413-01">285 Pa. 413</a>, 415, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20A.%20355" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="132 A. 355">132 A. 355</a>. Nor can it reasonably be argued that the Act. of 1925 in any way altered the restrictions in the Act of 1911 that an appeal thereunder be solely from “the judgment thus entered”, i.e., on a motion for judgment upon the whole record following a disagreement of the jury, or that the right of appeal thereby conferred run <em>only </em>in favor of “the party against whom it [i.e., the judgment] is entered ... .”. In the <em>March </em>case, supra, which was this Court’s first construction of the amendatory Act of 1925, it was said that “What the' statute [1925] does, and wisely does” is to supply a deficiency in the Act of 1905 (as had theretofore been judicially ascertained in the <em>Sloan </em>case). But, the Act of 1925 in no way affected, nor was it intended to affect, the Act of 1911: cf. also Title to the Act of April 9, 1925, P. L. 221.</p>

Upon treating with the defendant’s motion to quash, the <em>Conley </em>opinion did little more, if anything, than mention <em>Lipsky v. Stolzer </em>and did that in the relatively brief last paragraph of a lengthy opinion devoted almost entirely to a discussion of the trial court’s error in restricting cross-examination by the defendant. In fact, the <em>Lipsky </em>case was mentioned in the <em>Conley </em>case just twice, once narratively, merely to identify it as the authority cited by the defendant in support of his motion to quash, and the second time in the following statement, viz., “If there was conflicting evidence necessitating the determination of question of fact by a jury, <em>undoubtedly the rule of the Lipslcy case would require that the appeal be quashed”. </em>(Emphasis supplied.) So that, instead of <em>Conley v. Mervis </em>overruling the <em>Lipslcy </em>case, it affirmatively recognized the continuing force of that authority. Indeed, the very statement quoted above plainly reveals the inherent fallacy of the decision in the <em>Conley </em>case. What that case obviously sought to hold was that, where a judgment upon the whole record should have been entered by the court below, an appeal from the refusal to enter judgment in such circumstances lies under the Act of 1911, but Avhere, upon the review of such an appeal, there appears to be “conflicting evidence necessitating [a] determination ... by a jury . . . the rule of the Lip-sky case would require that the appeal be quashed”. In short, the ruling of the <em>Conley </em>case is that, <em>if a judgment should have been entered below, then there is a </em>

In these four cases we did confirm the right of appeal and disposed of them on the merits but on the ground that they were in effect appeals from the granting of new' trials and, therefore, reviewable, as at common law, for a palpable abuse of judicial discretion or for a plain error of law which induced the court’s granting of the new trial. For example, in the <em>Phillips </em>case, supra, it was said that, “The situation presented to us [i.e., where a motion for judgment on the whole record under the Act of 1911 has been refused] is therefore the same as if the court had granted a new trial after a verdict. On an appeal from an order such as the one here complained of, we never reverse unless a palpable abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge is disclosed or unless an erroneous rule of law, which in the circumstances necessarily controls the outcome of a case, is certified by the trial judge as the sole reason for his action: [citing cases].” <em>Hoban v. Conroy, </em>supra, was disposed of on the identical ground and the <em>Phillips </em>case was cited as authority. Likewise, <em>Thomas v. Brohm, </em>supra, was disposed of on the same ground on the authority of <em>Hoban v. Conroy. </em>And, in <em>Rossner v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, </em>the order refusing a motion for judgment under the Act of 1911, which superfluously included a grant óf a new trial, was affirmed on the ground that “As the court below is of opinion that the case should be retried, we see no error in its ruling [i.e., refusing the motion for judgment upon the whole record]”, <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>citing <em>Lipsky v. Stolzer, </em>supra, <em>Hoban v. Conroy, </em>supra, and <em>Thomas v. Brohm, </em>supra. By contrast, the rule of <em>Conley v. Mervis, </em>as will be recalled, is that if, on the admitted or undisputed facts of a case, where the jury has disagreed, the court below should have granted a motion for judgment upon the whole record, there exists a right of appeal to this or the Superior Court, as the case may he, from the lower court’s refusal so to enter judgment.</p>

      <em>Conley </em>case was cited. But, on the avowed authority of the <em>Phillips </em>case, supra, the extent of the review on appeal was held to be the same as on an appeal from the granting of a new trial. It is apparent, therefore, that the Superior Court has not uniformly followed the rule of the <em>Conley </em>case.</p>
    <p id="b606-4" data-blocks='[["BL_606.5",606,[229,609,1148,853]]]'>From what we have shown, we believe it is clear that the ruling in <em>Conley v. Mervis </em>has not been followed by this Court <em>in any instance </em>where the question of the right to appeal from the refusal of a motion for a judgment under the Act of 1911 has been raised or considered. On.the other hand, as justification for appeals in such cases, an entirely different legal theory has grown up, viz., that the refusal to enter judgment upon the whole record is tantamount to the granting of a new trial and that the granting of a new trial remains appealable by virtue of a common law right thereto, unaffected by the procedural statutes which authorize' entry of judgment upon the whole record: cf. <em>March v. Philadelphia &amp; West Chester Traction Co., </em>supra, which, however, was exclusively concerned with the N. O. V. Act of 1905 and its 1925 amendment.</p>
    <p id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.6",606,[229,1492,1149,862]],["BL_607.1",607,[210,258,1150,975]]]'>But, such an appeal, in connection with action taken under the Act of 1911, is an anomaly, for, while the right to appeal from the granting of a new trial derives from the common law and does not depend for its existence upon the statute, the scope of the appeal embraces no more than a review for a palpable abuse of discretion or a plain error of controlling law. Where the jury disagrees, unless a judgment be entered upon the whole record, a new trial ensues without a grant thereof by the court. Manifestly, therefore, there is no place even for a revieAV of judicial discretion' where none has been exercised and where judicial action would have been vain and inefficient. It can make no material difference whether the court, in disposing of a motion for judgment upon the whole record, simply orders “motion dismissed”, as in the <em>Lipsky </em>case, or adds to such action <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>an order for a new trial. In the given situation, the latter provision would be but surplusage. The retrial results from the jury’s disagreement and, Avith the motion for judgment upon the whole record denied, the new trial follows in due course as a matter of law. It would be absurd to say that a right to appeal, after the denial of a motion for judgment upon the whole record under the Act of 1911, depends upon whether the court included with its order, denying the motion for judgment, a direction for a new trial. A court is ineffectual to grant ivhat it lacks the power to withhold. Incidentally, Lip<em>sky v. Stolzer </em>did not, as the appellant suggests, ignore “the common law rule permitting an appeal from an order granting a new trial”. The <em>Lipsky </em>case Avas simply not concerned with such an appeal since the new trial was not the result of an exercise of judicial discretion but folloAved from the disagreement of the jury.</p>
    <p id="b607-4" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[215,1255,1150,1094]],["BL_608.1",608,[237,267,1147,208]]]'>In any vieiv, it cannot reasonably be denied that, so far as the terms of the Act of 1911, itself, are concerned, the Act makes but one matter appealable, viz., “the judgment thus entered”, that is, on a motion for judgment upon the whole record folloAving disagreement by the jury, and confers the right of appeal upon but one party, viz., “the party against whom [such judgment] is entered . . .”. <em>Lipsky v. Stolzer </em>correctly so interpreted the statute and pertinently held, in addition, that an order dismissing or denying a motion for judgment upon the whole record under the Act of 1911 is not a judgment within the contemplation of the Act, as indeed it is not: cf. Restatement, Judgments, § § 1, 2 and 3. The appellant affirmatively concedes as much. Its brief states, — “It may be admitted that <em>Lipsky v. </em>Stolzer, supra, interpreted literally and logically the language of the Act of 1911. That Act does not, literally construed, permit an appeal in the absence of a judgment entered in the loAver court.” Yet, in the present instance, Ave have an appeal under the Act of 1911, although no <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>judgment was entered by the court below, and an appellant against whom no judicial action has been taken. He is merely the party whose motion for judgment was overruled and, for such, the statute provides no appeal.</p>
    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[230,495,1153,1299]]]'>Against all of this, only one argument, based on supposed expediency, is advanced for maintaining in force the allowance of appeals under the rule of <em>Conley v. Mervis. </em>The appellant argues that such appeals serve “to expedite the determination of litigation”, — a suggestion derived, no doubt, from a dictum of the <em>Conley </em>case to the effect that “. . . the act [of 1911] was not intended to be productive of unnecessary . . . litigation”. But, just what has been the actual experience since the decision in the <em>Conley </em>case? As stated in footnote 3, supra, — of the thirteen subsequent appeals to this Court, only <em>three </em>resulted in the entry of judgments here. The other <em>ten </em>cases were returned for the retrial which otherwise would have ensued promptly, following denial of the motions for judgment, had the appeals not been taken. Furthermore, in the very nature of such appeals, all of the testimony must be printed for the review; and, as a consequence, large and expensive records were brought up on those ineffectual appeals to no good or useful purpose whatsoever. So that, contrary to the above-quoted comment of the <em>Conley </em>case, this “unnecessary . . . litigation” was <em>not </em>the product of the Act but resulted from a disregard of the Act and its long-settled and sound interpretation.</p>

It has never been overruled; its continuing validity was expressly recognized in <em>Conley v. Mervis; </em>and, the most that has ever been claimed for the <em>Conley </em>case is that it “modified” the rule of the <em>Lipsky </em>case: see <em>Phillips v. American Stores Company, </em>supra, at p. 35. All that need be done, therefore, and all we have endeavored to do herein is to clear away the confu<a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>sion that tbe ruling in <em>Conley v.

In tbe first category, tbe facts are conclusively established, as a matter of law, by a jury’s verdict, while in tbe second group there has been a disagreement of tbe jury and no one but tbe court can find tbe facts in passing upon a motion for judgment under the Act of 1911. There is a very real danger in tbe latter situation of judicial invasion- of tbe time-tested and time-honored province of tbe jury. Tbe integrity of tbe right of trial by jury can best be preserved in such connection, as the Act of 1911 endeavors to safeguard it. In keeping with the intent there shown, where a trial has resulted in a disagreement of tbe jury, tbe case is to be tried again <em>if the trial court </em>is “of opinion that tbe case should be retried”. After all, the right to move for judgment upon tbe whole record, after a disagreement of tbe jury, is of relatively' recent creation. No such right existed at common law save for tbe practically ineffectual and undemandable “reserved point”: See <em>March v. Philadelphia &amp; West Chester Traction Co., </em>supra, at p. 415. But, a trial court uoav has tbe power to enter judgments in such circumstances, — -a power which will no doubt be appropriately and effectively exercised whenever tbe facts are such that reasonable and sensible men can not differ about them or draw conflicting inferences from them. That <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>power derives from the Act of 1911, supra, which we will do well to follow as written and as <em>Lipsky v.
