He found, inter aliá, that in seeking to have himself appointed substituted guardian of the incompetent daughters of Anna Corr Jones,' appellant showed a persistent desire to secure employment, together with a lack of familiarity Avith legal principles which rendered him ineligible; and that, although Bernard Corr Jones, the co-executor and co-trustee, manifested a stubborn, unreasonable and childish attitude toward appellant, in certain matters, appellant “is not free from blame for the antagonism which exists betwéen himself and his co-trustee Bernard Corr Jones for the reasons that: (a) His attitude with respect to his employment as attorney for the estate of Anna Corr Jones, deceased, after he learned that his co-executor objected to his employment, was threatening . . . (b) His refusal to-terminate the lease of the apartment was arbitrary and not justified-by any investigation or consideration of the facts ... (c) His refusal to exhibit tax bills to his co-executor was arbitrary and overbearing ... (d) His delay in commencing the preparation of the guardians’ accounts and his attitude with respect thereto contributed to the antagonism which existed between himself and his co-executor . . .

    <p id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.5",618,[227,371,1147,636]]]'>The Master also found that: “The antagonism wbicli presently exists between . . . [appellant] and Ms co-trustee, Bernard Corr Jones, is so intense as to warrant a finding that, unless conditions improve, administration of the trust by these trustees will be inharmonious in the extreme.” Being of the opinion, however, that the case presented against appellant was not sufficiently strong to warrant his removal, and that the petition for the appointment of an additional trustee did not allege enough facts to justify the appointment of a co-trustee, the Master recommended that both petitions be dismissed.</p>

At that time, the court below said: “These men should be given an opportunity to function as trustees in the hope that they will pull themselves together and act like reasonable, persons. If they cannot, this matter may be brought before the court again. At that time the matter will, no doubt, be so presented that we will have the opportunity to remove them both if both continue to be at fault.”</p>

He requested appellant and Ms co-trustee to authorize payment of this sum to him by the Pennsylvania Company. Appellant refused to consent to the payment, but his co-trustee agreed to do so. John Lawrence Bryant Jones then filed a petition on March 19, 1947, for a citation on appellant to show cause why he should not pay this income to him, or that appellant be removed as trustee for non-payment thereof. Appellant having filed his answer, the court below again referred the controversy to the same Master who had previously heard the case.</p>

The court en banc entered a final decree, as recommended, stating that: “We retained the prior petition in order to see whether the two trustees could ‘act harmoniously and like reasonable persons.’ This proceeding may be regarded as in the nature of a supplemental bill. . . . [Appellant] has repeated his childish and obstructive conduct, and we take into consideration that which is contained in both proceedings in coming to the conclusion that the interests of the estate and trust are likely to be jeopardized by the continuance of Franks as a fiduciary (Par. 8 of Section 53 (a) of the Fiduciaries Act), and further conclude that . . . [appellant] has failed to pay over income of the estate according to his duty under the trust (Par. 6 of the same Section).” Appellant then appealed to this Court.</p>

He also argues that since be acted under tbe advice of counsel, be was protected in bis refusal to authorize payment tof distributable income. With these contentions we cannot agree. The learned court below, in disposing of these arguments, properly said: “That Franks [appellant] has no knowledge or means of knowledge of tbe amount of income in the bands of tbe Pennsylvania Company, or whether tbe estimated deductions are correct. It is Franks’ duty to find out. Tbe Pennsylvania Company is willing to give him information and to pay over on authorization by tbe trustees. Tbe operation of this trust for tbe benefit of tbe children of testatrix (some of whom are incompetents) is not to be stalled indefinitely by litigation over tbe trusteeship. The difficulties of ascertaining gross and net income and tbe risk are no different from what they would be if tbe fund bad been set up in tbe bands of these trustees. Tbe conduct of a trustee would not be <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>tolerated who refused to pay out periodically tbe income which is in his hands, and we see no essentially different situation here, for the money is in his control. A reasonable man in the position of this trustee would accept the figures furnished by the Pennsylvania Company and act on them unless something appeared to show that the company was irresponsible or unreliable. Franks has so acted nineteen times in the past after inquiring ‘whether there was that much income on hand’ . . . When Bryant Jones made his request, Franks ‘assumed that there was approximately that much income on hand’. ... By this statement in his testimony he denies his plea that he does not know and cannot find out . . . The advice of counsel will not justify a trustee in refusing to perform such an act fundamental to his trust as ascertaining what income is available for distribution and paying it to the beneficiaries, particularly when he admits that he has reliable means of information.”</p>

On October 22, 1945, the above named accountants filed a schedule of distribution which schedule has never been approved by the court.

The mere fact that there is such friction or hostility is not necessarily a sufficient <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>ground for removal, since otherwise the beneficiaries could by quarreling with the trustee force him out. Thus in Forster v. Davies, 4 DeG. F.&amp;J. 133, 139, Lord Justice Turner said: “I certainly cannot agree with the argument at the bar that the mere fact of there being a dissension between one of the several cestuis que trust and the trustee is a sufficient ground for this court removing that trustee from the trust, because the consequence of that would be that one cestui que trust might at any time raise a quarrel with the trustee and thereupon come to this court to discharge the trustee and remove him from the trust upon the ground of the impossibility of their acting together. It would be the duty of the court, as I conceive, in all cases of that description, to inquire and ascertain from Avhose fault that dissension or that cessation of friendly intercourse has arisen.” On the other hand, where there is such friction or hostility as seriously to impede the proper performance of the trust, especially if the trustee is at fault, the trustee will be removed.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[213,1360,1145,317]]]'>A refusal to remove a testamentary trustee was affirmed in <em>Mathues’s Estate, </em>supra. This Court there held that active antagonism of the beneficiaries of an estate toivard a trustee, while undesirable, is not sufficient to compel the court to order the latter’s removal, unless provoked by him and likely t'o jeopardize the estate.</p>

In Avhat manner is the estate “likely to be jeopardized”? There is no finding that appellant is the cause of the acrimonious relations. The master has found that he is not the sole cause and the court below has remarked that the attitude of both petitioner and appellant was “childish.” A most cursory reading of the record leaves no room for doubt that the actions about Avhich petitioner complains are of his creation. He has prevented the one in whom testatrix <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>reposed her confidence and trust from entering upon his duties. He has made numerous unreasonable demands and thereby prepared well in advance the evidence to be used against appellant. He failed in his first attempt to secure removal of appellant by order of court. He has sought to constitute appellant a mere figure-head who would nod approval to the administration of the trust estate by the Pennsylvania Company. Failing in the latter because of appellant’s well-founded belief that he could not delegate the discretionary matters involved in the administration of the trust to another <em>(Kohler Estate, </em>supra), petitioner again renewed his attempt to secure his removal, having first secured his position by further written demands upon appellant.</p>
    <p id="b628-4" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[244,1039,1148,583]]]'>The opinion of the majority sustains the action of the court below thereby permitting a beneficiary to bring about acrimonious relations between himself and trustee and to rely thereon as a cause for rem'oval. It approves the practice of securing, by delay through litigation, administration of a trust by the person in whom the creator thereof has reposed confidence and it condemns a trustee for a reputed breach of trust occasioned in advance of his entry upon lawful performance of any duties thereunder. These results are clearly contrary to reason and to decisions of this Court.</p>
    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[247,1650,1148,697]],["BL_629.1",629,[221,263,1146,208]]]'>The right of any person owning property to name his trustee-administrator has been sacredly guarded by the courts. Recognizing this right, the court below refused in the first instance to dismiss appellant-trustee. After a hearing upon the second petition, however, using the prior record not supplemented in any material respect, it entered a decree of discharge. This action necessarily defeated the intention of testatrix to have as a co-trustee an individual in whom she had the utmost confidence during her lifetime and to whom she entrusted the administration of her estate after her death. No sufficient cause for this drastic action appears in this record. The estate has not been jeopardized nor has any loss resulted <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>from any act of appellant or big failure to act. Control of the estate has never passed into his hands and he has never had any opportunity to mismanage or in any way jeopardize the same.</p>
    <p id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[221,490,1147,585]]]'>The decree of the court below should be reversed and the petition dismissed. A schedule of distribution should be filed and approved and the trust <em>res </em>turned over to appellant and his co-trustee so that they may enter into their duties as trustees. If thereafter the estate is endangered and intervention becomes necessary to save trust property, proper proceedings may be instituted to effect appellant’s removal as a co-fiduciary. Removal under the facts presented in this appeal is premature and constitutes an unwarranted abuse of discretion by the court below.</p>
