At the trial of the case appellee’s motion for compulsory nonsuit and a requested point for binding instruction were refused. A jury returned a verdict for $5175 in the Survival Action, and for $3600 in the Death Action. Appellee filed motions for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>and for a new trial. The court below dismissed the motion for a new trial .but granted the'Motion for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>for the reason that there was no proof of appellee’s negligence. This appeal followed.</p>

M., was operating appellee’s 43.4 feet .tractor-trailer in the City of Chester, Pennsylvania. Proceeding, southwardly On Madison Street, he entered the intersection of Madison and Third Streets and turned left onto Third Street. On the northeast corner of the pavement is a sewer cover 3 by 5 feet. Sylvester Stanalonis, decedent, was last seen standing on the sewer cover. Thereafter, the view of witnesses was obscured by the' tractor-trailer as it turned left onto <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>Third Street. The front wheels of the tractor came within two to two and one-half feet of the curb. A thnd was heard and decedent was next seen lying flat on the street, his head toward the sewer, approximately two and one-half feet therefrom, and his feet pointed to the southwesterly corner and extending into the intersection. The rear wheels of the trailer were seen to pass oyer his body at a point approximately four feet from the sewer opening. The thud was produced by some contact with the aluminum body of the trailer. At the time the wheels passed over his body, the tractor was at an angle to the trolley tracks running parallel on Third Street, and the trailer was proceeding around the corner. The tractor and trailer were practically on a line. After Leone heard the thump and stopped the equipment, the rear of the trailer was ten feet to the east of the decedent’s body. The tractor was facing east and the position- of the trailer was diagonal with the car tracks. Stanalonis was placed in the automobile of a passing motorist and taken to a hospital where he died four days later from injuries sustained in this accident.</p>

This contention cannot be sustained. The evidence has been considered most favorable to him. The conclusion is, nevertheless, irresistible that appellee’s negligence is not the only reasonable conclusion justified by the evidence and the verdict of the jury was based upon conjecture and surmise rather than facts established by the testimony.</p>

Conjecture and surmise are not substitutes for proof and a jury’s verdict based thereon will be set a.side: <em>Stauffer v.

Failure to rebut that presumption does not warrant an inference of negligence. Cf. <em>Rowles v.

The position of Stanalonis and the place where he was standing when contact was made with the body of the trailer is not shown. Viewing the evidence most favorable to decedent, there is none which suggests how he came to lie prostrate in the intersection, his head toward the sidewalk and feet toward the center of the intersection as the rear wheels of the trailer went over his body. Certain it is that the.evidence of circumstances prior and subsequent to the contact are not such as to satisfy reasonable and well-balanced minds that the accident resulted from the negligence of the defendant.
