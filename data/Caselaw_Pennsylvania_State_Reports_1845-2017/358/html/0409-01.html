L. 403, provides that unless a contrary intention appears, if a provision in a residuary clause fails or is void, the subject of the void clause “shall pass to and be divided among the other residuary devisees or legatees, if any there be. . . .” On appellants’ construction, Mary Faiss Riesing would come into the enjoyment of the residue on the death and interment of the pets, if the trust were valid; if now we lift out of the residue the words creating the trust said to be void, we still find an express gift of the residue to Mary Faiss Riesing.</p>
