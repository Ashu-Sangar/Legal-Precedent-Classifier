Notwithstanding the balances distributed to beneficiaries under settlor’s will were $299,396.93 principal, -and $56,987.68 income, trustee did not present any claim against settlor’s estate or petition to have any funds set aside to secure payment of the -interest during the life of Elizabeth M.

Donahue, Esq., who had been duly appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>of Edward Í?. Borden, 3rd, and trustee <em>ad, litem </em>for unascer-tained parties in interest for the reasons that: (1) Elizabeth M.

Catherine A. Donahue, Esq., again appointed guardian <em>ad Utem </em>of Edward P. Borden, 3rd, succeeding life tenant, and trustee <em>ad litem </em>for unborn or unascertained parties in interest, filed her exceptions to the account. The auditing judge reaffirmed the prior finding of negligent administration and surcharged trustee the difference between $30,000 and $24,151.02, the present value of principal. The court <em>en bane </em>properly dismissed trustee’s exceptions to the adjudication.</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[266,891,1148,311]]]'>Appellant contends that: (1) settlement of settlor’s liability was beneficial to the trust; (2) settlor did not intend to postpone settlement of his estate until termination of the <em>inter vivos </em>trust; (3) trustee acted upon advice of counsel; and (4) trustee’s actions were prudent under the circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b164-5" data-blocks='[["BL_164.6",164,[267,1223,1149,1018]]]'>Respective obligations and rights of settlor, trustee and beneficiaries were clearly defined by the deed of trust. The primary intention was to guarantee to Elizabeth M. Borden an annual income of $1500 for her life or until remarriage, and to trustee an annual compensation of $75. To assure accomplishment of that intention, settlor directed trustee to <em>continually </em>maintain a minimum, not a maximum, of $40,000 collateral, and to demand additional security if, in the opinion of trustee, that presently held was insufficient. Settlor further intended that upon the death of Elizabeth M. Borden there should be capital in the amount of $30,000 available to trustee. Settlor bound himself, his heirs, executors and assigns, to complete performance of the deed of trust. Consideration of the entire deed of trust, the relative rights and obligations created and the ages of the respective beneficiaries clearly refutes appellant’s' contention that settlor could not have intended to postpone final settlement of his own estate.</p>
    <p id="b164-6" data-blocks='[["BL_164.7",164,[268,2266,1146,103]],["BL_165.1",165,[238,271,1148,1091]]]'>The auditing judge properly stated that “a heavy duty rested upon the trustee to see that this obligation <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>was enforced, and that there was insured to the life tenant the income provided by the trust agreement.” The obligations which settlor undertook were clear and definite. The liability of his estate for the continued performance thereof was not doubtful. Trustee did not compromise a doubtful right but surrendered a $30,000 written obligation and collateral valued at $63,000 for $40,000 cash. The temporary gain in income from a reinvestment of the $40,000 cannot unequivocally be held to have been beneficial to the trust when compared with the actual loss of security resulting from the transaction. Appellant held a lawful claim against settlor’s estate. It was not permitted to act to the possible detriment of the life tenants but was under a duty to secure sufficient assets or security to enable it to carry out the undertakings of settlor as regards the beneficiaries. Acting upon advice of counsel is a factor to be considered in determining good faith, but is not a blanket of immunity in all circumstances. Cf. Restatement, Trusts, Section 201, Comment a.</p>
    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[239,1382,1148,879]]]'>The findings of fact made by the auditing judge were approved by the court <em>en bane. </em>They are binding upon this Court if supported by the evidence. After careful consideration of the record, we conclude that the auditing judge and the court <em>en bane </em>did not err in holding that settlor’s covenants to continue periodic payments to a time which might extend beyond his lifetime formed the basis for a claim which should have been presented at the audit of his executor’s account; that request should have been made at that time to secure performance of the said obligations by having sufficient assets set aside <em>(Speare Estate, </em><a href="/pa/349/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="349 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="459134" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0076-01">349 Pa. 76</a>, 78, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20A.2d%20489" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="36 A.2d 489">36 A. 2d 489</a>, 491) ; and that presentation of such claim was trustee’s duty and neglect so to do constituted neglect of a duty that a person of ordinary prudence would not have omitted.</p>
