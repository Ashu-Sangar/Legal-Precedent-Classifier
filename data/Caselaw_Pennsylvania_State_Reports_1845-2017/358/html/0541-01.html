A short time after construction was begun and before any planes had used this airport, this action was begun to prohibit the use of this property as an airfield. Even at the time of trial the field had been used only by a few small airplanes at infrequent intervals. It could not be generally used because construction had not been completed on either runway. Defendant Krader testified that the proposed airport was to be used only by airplanes powered by single engines, not in excess of two hundred horsepower. No night flying and no regularly scheduled commercial flights were contemplated from this field. Student pilot instruction was planned together with the sale of light airplanes and the renting of hangar space to private plane owners. The air traffic pattern, for planes landing and taking off, has not been definitely established. The east-west runway was designed to be 3000 feet long, and the north-south runway 2800 feet in length, when completed.</p>

      <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>The surrounding countryside is rural and sparsely settled. Many country estates and farms are located throughout the general vicinity. The main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, running east and west, is about one mile to the north of defendants’ property. The north boundary of the proposed airport is located on Route 202, a main highway, heavily travelled by both pleasure cars and trucks. The only industrial plant in the area is located about a mile away.' The various plaintiffs include the owners of eighteen country residences and representatives of three institutions. None'of plaintiffs’ buildings are closer than- 500 feet and some are located over three miles away from the airfield in question.</p>

A careful examination of the record shows clearly that no serious attempt was made to prove any allegation but that noise from the airplanes would constitute a nuisance.</p>

    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.6",567,[224,689,1145,690]]]'>There was ample evidence to sustain the Chancellor’s findings that the prevailing winds at the airfield were from the west and that airplanes ordinarily take off and land into the wind. Therefore, the property owners immediately to the west of the airport would be most frequently subject to any noise made by planes as they took off and were attempting to climb to a desirable flying altitude. Plaintiff Francis D. Crew and his wife, owned the property adjoining the airport’s western boundary, and immediately beyond their property and to the west thereof was located the residence of plaintiffs Walter and Helen Allen. The testimony of Mr. Crew and of Mrs. Allen merits attention.</p>

Is it not a fact that your testimony here today has been based upon the fact that there have been only one, two, or three planes at this airport? A. Yes, but our reason for objecting here today is not what has gone on in the past but what we expect in the future.” All of plaintiffs’ witnesses were allowed to indulge in this type of conjecture and to speculate as to what might occur in the future, e. g.: “It is going to be very objectionable.”</p>

On direct examination she said: “If you are in the living room of our house and we have guests you practically have to scream to make them hear you if the planes are going over the house.” On cross-examination, however, her testimony <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>was as follows: “Q. You don’t know the altitude of these planes in feet when you saw them? A. I possibly have but they don’t bother me, they are up high and the noise does not bother me. Q. They do go over the house? Not directly over the house. Q. How far from your house do they go, if you can judge? A. I can hardly say. They go across the field directly across the road from the house, and how wide that field is I don’t know but they go directly across that field . . . Q. Those planes do not bother you at all? A. They haven’t.”</p>
    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[240,845,1146,315]]]'>One of the plaintiffs was Rush Hospital, an institution located over a mile away.

In what regard? A. All my life I have had a very horrifying experience of planes.” No useful purpose would be served by a further discussion of the testimony adduced by plaintiffs as it is wholly inadequate to sustain the allegations of their bill or the conclusion of the Chancellor.</p>
