    <p id="b301-10" data-blocks='[["BL_301.15",301,[274,1437,1150,378]]]'>The trial was prematurely stopped by the presiding judge who appears to have thought that plaintiff had put in all his evidence of liability<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> when in fact that was not so.. This misunderstanding appears from the colloquy reported in the printed record on pages 112a to 116a. To correct this error, we must grant a new trial. See <em>Mazer v. Kann, </em><a href="/pa/343/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="343 Pa. 376" data-case-ids="1208368" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0376-01">343 Pa. 376</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.2d%20707" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="22 A.2d 707">22 A. 2d 707</a>.</p>

THE COURT: I do not see any necessity for any side bar conference in this. I will entertain any motion you have to make.” Thereupon counsel for each of the defendants moved that a nonsuit be entered as to <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>bis client. These motions were granted. Buie 2231(h) (1) Pa. B. C. P. prohibits the entry of a compulsory nonsuit on the motion of a defendant before plaintiff has completed presenting his evidence against all the defendants.</p>
