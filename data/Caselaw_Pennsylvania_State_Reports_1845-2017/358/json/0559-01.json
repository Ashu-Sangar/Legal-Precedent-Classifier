        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nIn an action in trespass for personal injuries sustained in an automobile accident, Sarah D. Jones, wife-plaintiff, recovered a verdict for $5,000 against Patrick Williams, original defendant. The jury exonerated the additional defendant, John W. Jones. A motion for a new trial was filed by the original defendant. In granting the motion, the court said: \u201cThere is no question in this case of the plaintiff\u2019s right to a verdict and the amount of damages to be assessed . . . We are of the opinion however that the additional defendant was also negligent and the jury acted capriciously and in disregard of the undisputed evidence in failing to so find.\u201d Plaintiffs and additional defendant appealed from the court\u2019s order.\nOn April 16, 1946, the additional defendant, John W. Jones, was operating in a northwardly direction on 11th Street, Philadelphia, a passenger car owned by his father Albert R. Jones and occupied by both parents, co-plaintiffs. At the intersection of 11th and Callowhill Streets, defendant\u2019s truck, which was traveling in an eastwardly direction on Callowhill Street, sideswiped with plaintiff\u2019s car causing damage to it and injuries to Sarah D. Jones. John W. Jones testified he was proceeding north on 11th Street at 11:30 A.M. on a clear day at a speed of 8 to 10 miles an hour. On the intersecting Southwest corner, there was a bridge abutment and also parked cars, which obstructed the driver\u2019s view. He could not see west on Callowhill Street until he was at the curbline. Upon reaching the corner of 11th and Callowhill Streets, he reduced his speed to 6 miles an hour and proceeded into the intersection about 8 to 10 feet when he saw about 25 feet from him defendant\u2019s truck approaching at a rate of speed of 16 to 18 miles an hour. Its \u201cpath\u201d was 5 or 6 feet from Jones\u2019 car. When Jones first observed it, the truck was about 5 feet past a \u201cStop Sign\u201d located 20 feet west of the west curbline of 11th Street. Jones testified that the truck \u201chadn\u2019t stopped, didn\u2019t make any attempt to stop at the Stop Sign, so my first impulse Avas to try to give it the gas, get across but I realized it was too late for that, so I swerved right and threw on my brakes; I thought there was a possibility he could swerve\u2014\nThe original defendant\u2019s negligence is not challenged in this appeal. The issue is whether or not the court erred in ordering a new trial because the court believed that the facts called for a verdict against both defendants.\nJohn W. Jones had a right to assume that traffic would heed the \u201cStop Sign\u201d and not enter the intersection at a rate of speed which would make likely a collision with his Chevrolet car. When he saw the truck had not stopped but was approaching his path he \u201cswerved right and threw on the brakes\u201d. This is all he could do. Jones\u2019 left front fender and grille collided with the defendant\u2019s right front fender. The court below was no more justified in depriving the additional defendant of his exculpatory verdict than the lower court would have been had it deprived the plaintiff of his verdict against the Gas Company, in Trerotola v. Philadelphia et al., 346 Pa. 222, 29 A. 2d 788. There we said: \u201cHaving secured a verdict against one of two alleged tort-feasors, the plaintiff should not be denied of his judgment because the court believes that the verdict should have been rendered against both of the alleged tort-feasors.\u201d\nIn Felo et al. v. Kroger Grocery & Baking Company et al., 347 Pa. 142, 31 A. 2d 552, this Court in an opinion by Mr. Justice Drew held that a plaintiff who has secured a verdict against one of two co-defendants in a trespass action is entitled to the benefit of the verdict, even though the court believes that it should have been rendered against both of the alleged tort-feasors. See also Kins v. Pittsburgh Rwy. Co., 154 Pa. Superior Ct. 29.\nThe court below in its opinion granting a new trial said: \u201cWe are of the opini\u00f3n however that the additional defendant was also negligent [as was the defendant Williams] and that the jury acted capriciously and in disregard of tbe undisputed evidence in failing, to so find.\u201d We do not find in tlxis record any evidence warranting tbe trial judge in declaring bim guilty of negligence as a matter of law. What this Court said in MacDonald, Admrx., v. P. R. Co., 348 Pa. 558, 564, 36 A. 2d 492, is applicable here: \u201cCourts must not lose sight of what Wigmore calls \u2018the bipartite constitution of the common law tribunal\u2019. (Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed. Vol. 9, sec. 2487.) To lay down a rule that whenever a trial court is convinced that tbe proofs on either side of a civil action in which there are issues of fact triable by a jury are so conclusive that the court can declare, as a matter of law that the verdict must be for the party offering such proofs, would be to introduce a radical innovation in trial procedure in this Commonwealth. The error of the court below was in taking upon itself the fact finding functions of the jury.\u201d\nThe trial judge drew the inference that John W. Jones was \u201cgoing a good deal faster than he said he was\u201d, because \u201cthe left fender, bumper, grille, radiator, headlight of the plaintiff\u2019s car were smashed\u201d. It is always a very conjectural thing to judge the speed at which a moving object was traveling when it collided with another object, from the damage it sustained, for there is nothing more unpredictable than the \u201cfreakish\u201d results of a collision of two objects. (For example, when a locomotive and a cow collide, the former is sometimes derailed.) The damage Jones\u2019 machine actually sustained was what one should expect from a collision between a six-ton truck traveling 18 miles an hour and a lightly constructed Chevrolet car.\nWhen John W. Jones was asked on cross-examination, \u201cHow quickly, in how many feet, would you say you could stop your car, going at a speed of about six miles per hour,\u201d he replied, \u201cAlmost immediately . . . a couple of feet\u201d. It was on this testimony that the Court chiefly based its conclusion that Jones was negligent. As to this, two things are to be said. First, Jones\u2019 statement as to the speed of his car and as to how soon he could stop, was only an estimate. Apparently he could not stop his car \u201cin a couple of feet\u201d for although he did \u201cthrow on his brakes and swerve to the right\u201d he did not avoid the collision. Since the truck was only 20 feet away when Jones first saw it and since Jones\u2019 car was then 8 feet into the intersection and only 5 or 6 feet from \u201cthe path of the truck\u201d, it is obvious that at that moment the circumstances were such as to make a collision inevitable. Jones cannot be adjudged negligent for committing himself to the intersection, for with a \u201cStop Sign\u201d facing the truck before it got into the intersection he had a right to assume that no vehicle coming from the left into the intersection would enter the intersection at a speed of 16 or 18 miles an hour. Jones\u2019 only error was his reliance on the belief that the \u201cStop Sign\u201d would be heeded. The assumption that another driver will obey the traffic rules cannot be adjudged negligent unless the person making the assumption has timely warning that his confidence in the other\u2019s lawabidingness is misplaced.\nWhile this Court usually supports the action of the trial court in granting or refusing a new trial we do not entirely abdicate our reviewing functions in such cases. This Court, too, has the duty to determine from the record whether or not the jury\u2019s verdict Avas so contrary to the evidence as to shock one\u2019s sense of justice and to make the award of a new trial imperative so that right may be given another opportunity to prevail. In the following cases cited in support of the appellee\u2019s position in respect to the award of a new trial: Nark v. Horton Motor Lines, Inc., 331 Pa. 550, 1 A. 2d 655; Koch et al. v. Imhof, 315 Pa. 145, 172 A. 673; and Yago et al., Appellants, v. Pipicelli, 343 Pa. 222, 22 A. 2d 699, this Court declined to reverse the refusal of the court beloAV to grant a neAV trial. In Knies v. Kraftsow, 156 Pa. Superior Ct. 296 (cited by appellee) the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of the court beloAV in denying a new trial. In Wilson v. Kallenbach, 332 Pa. 253, 2 A. 2d 727 (cited by appellee), in which this Court affirmed the order of the court below granting a new trial, we said: \u201cIt is well settled that a new trial will not be granted because of a mere conflict in testimony: Kennelly v. Waropoyak, 266 Pa. 94; Harmer v. American Ry. Exp. Co., 269 Pa. 271; or because the trial judge on the same facts would have arrived at a different conclusion: Donnelly v. Penna. Co., 252 Pa. 175.\u201d\nThe question at issue below was one of fact and exclusively for the jury\u2019s determination. The finding that the additional defendant was not guilty of negligence was in our judgment strictly in accordance with the evidence. The court below in invading the province of the jury and nullifying its favorable verdict for the additional defendant showed a clear abuse of discretion..\nThe order of the court below granting a new trial is reversed.\nMr. Justice Linn dissents and Mr. Justice Stern concurs in the dissent.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn:\nI dissent. In Marko v. Mendelowski, 313 Pa. 46, 47, 169 A. 99, we said: \u201cWe have frequently said we will not reverse an order awarding a new trial unless a palpable abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge is disclosed or unless an erroneous rule of law, which in the circumstances necessarily controls the outcome of the case, is certified by the trial judge as the sole reason for his action: . . .\u201d See also Hitchay v. Phillips, 316 Pa. 290, 175 A. 389. The court en banc, in granting a new trial in this case said, \u201cAs we think the verdict should have been against both the defendants, it would be unjust to deny the defendant\u2019s, motion for a new trial.\u201d Another salutary rule recognizes that the trial judge is in better position to consider the merits of testimony than the members of this Court. In Phillips\u2019 Estate, 295 Pa. 349, 356, 145 A. 437, we said, \u201cThe trial judge saw all of these witnesses, and hence is far better able to determine what weight should be given to their testimony than we can possibly be.\u201d\nI therefore accept the trial judge\u2019s statement that it would be unjust not to try this case again.\nIn Maloy v. Rosenbaum Co., 260 Pa. 466, 472, 103 A. 882, we said: \u201cWhile the ascertainment of the underlying facts, and the drawing of the inferences and final conclusions therefrom, are for the jury, even where strong conflicting oral evidence is produced by a defendant, yet, in every such instance, a grave responsibility rests upon the trial judge to see to it that no verdict contrary to the weight of the evidence or shocking to judicial conscience is allowed to stand, no matter how many new trials must be granted in order to effect the ends of justice; and this will always be so, until the fundamental law, which ordains that trial by jury shall be as heretofore, is changed to give greater power, in the realm of fact, to the judiciary.\u201d See also Hess v. Stiner, 144 Pa. Superior Ct. 249, 19 A. 2d 560.\nIn Sandonawicz v. Life Ins. Co., 129 Pa. Superior Ct. 431, 196 A. 543, an order affirming a fourth trial on matter of fact was affirmed.\nMr. Justice Horace Stern concurs in this opinion.",
