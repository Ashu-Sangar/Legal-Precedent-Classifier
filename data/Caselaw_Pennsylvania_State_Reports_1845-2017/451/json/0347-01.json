        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Chief Justice Jones,\nThis action in equity was brought to set aside a deed on grounds that it was procured by fraud and undue influence. The court below entered a decree adjudging the disputed deed null and void and ordering the appellants, Dewey H. Seaman (\u201cDewey\u201d) and Esther L. Seaman (\u201cEsther\u201d), grantees, to reconvey the property to the grantor, Beulah E. Seaman (\u201cBeulah\u201d). As Beulah is now deceased, she is represented for the purpose of this appeal by Joan E. Thomas (\u201cJoan\u201d), executrix of the estate.\nThis appeal raises the questions whether the evidence supports a finding that Dewey made fraudulent misrepresentations to Beulah inducing this conveyance and whether the evidence establishes the exercise of undue influence.\nOur consideration of these questions necessitates a preliminary recounting of the involved factual situation which gave rise to this dispute. Beulah Seaman, eighty-three years old and unmarried at the time of this conveyance, owned a six-acre farm in Middlecreek Township, Pennsylvania. Benlah resided in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania with her sister until the sister\u2019s death in August 1968. With the death of her sister, and the onset of medical and financial difficulties, Beulah became increasingly dependent upon her niece, Joan, the appellee-executrix here. Beulah reposed great confidence in Joan and relied upon her for financial guidance.\nAfter the death of Beulah\u2019s sister, Beulah\u2019s seventy-two-year-old brother, Dewey, began to visit her daily. On February 11, 1969, while visiting the tenants of her Middlecreek farm, Beulah received a telephone call from Dewey, who announced he was buying the farm. Beulah balked when Dewey indicated that he hoped to consummate the \u201csale\u201d immediately but Dewey responded he had made an appointment for them to see a Selinsgrove attorney that day and the arrangements \u201ccould not be cancelled\u201d. Dewey then transported Beulah from her Middlecreek farm to the office of Dewey\u2019s attorney. Beulah attempted to ascertain the \u201csale\u201d price of her farm while enroute to the scrivener\u2019s office, but Dewey would not discuss the purchase price; he merely assured Beulah he was \u201cbuying\u201d the farm.\nWhen Beulah and Dewey arrived at the office of Attorney Harvey P. Murray, Jr., the deed had already been prepared. Beulah was allowed to examine the document and thereupon questioned why the purchase price was not recited in the deed. She was told that most people preferred not to recite the consideration for the deed on the face of the instrument. When Beulah questioned the fact that the deed vested a present interest in her brother and a remainder in his wife, and expressed the fear that she was not adequately protected by its terms, the deed was redrafted to reserve a life estate in Beulah.\nBefore signing the deed, Beulah told Dewey she preferred not to act until discussing the matter with her niece, Joan. Dewey replied that Joan \u201cknew all about\u201d the transaction and that she was \u201cdelighted\u201d by it. Beulah signed the deed, reluctantly, in the presence of the appellants and Attorney Murray. There was no one present at the signing of the deed either to represent the decedent\u2019s interests or give her independent, disinterested advice. On the same day, Dewey met with Joan to tell her he had \u201cpurchased\u201d Beulah\u2019s farm and that he and his wife, Esther, intended to take care of Beulah. He also confided in Joan that he had misrepresented Joan\u2019s approval of this transaction to Beulah.\nBeulah\u2019s tenants removed, at appellants\u2019 request, and Dewey and Esther took possession in March 1969. Beulah resided with her brother and wife from July 1969 until October 1969, when Esther informed Beulah she would have to \u201cmake other arrangements\u201d. No consideration for this conveyance was ever paid. Beulah left the Middlecreek farm in October of 1969 and consulted an attorney: this action was commenced on February 5, 1970, by the decedent\u2019s complaint in equity.\nFraud is composed of a misrepresentation fraudulently uttered with the intent to induce the action undertaken in reliance upon it, to the damage of its victim. Edelson v. Bernstein, 382 Pa. 392, 115 A. 2d 382 (1955); Neuman v. Corn Exchange National Bank & Trust Co., 356 Pa. 442, 51 A. 2d 759 (1947). To sustain the conelusion of the court below, evidence of appellants\u2019 fraud must be clear, precise and convincing. Aliquipa National Bank v. Harvey, 340 Pa. 223, 16 A. 2d 409 (1940); Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Shay, 82 Pa. 198 (1876). The test is met where the witnesses depended upon to prove fraud distinctly remember the facts to which they testify and narrate the details with specificity. Broida v. Travelers Insurance Co., 316 Pa. 444, 447, 448, 175 A. 492, 494 (1934); Ralston v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., 267 Pa. 257, 269, 110 A. 329, 333 (1920). Two witnesses testified, unequivocally, that Dewey told them he had \u201cbought\u201d the farm. Beulah\u2019s testimony, though colored by self-interest, is corroborative. It is appellants\u2019 position that he did not intend to purchase the farm, but rather to act as caretaker of the property for the remainder of Beulah\u2019s life in order to divest her of the burden of its care. In addition to the evidence of disparity between Dewey\u2019s unspoken and expressed intent, there is uncontroverted testimony by Joan Thomas, the decedent\u2019s confidante, that appellant, Dewey Seaman, misrepresented Joan\u2019s approval of the deed to Beulah: \u201cHe also told me the time I was there that afternoon, he said \u2018I lied to her [Beulah]. I told her you knew about it [the deed].\u2019 I didn\u2019t learn about it until everything was signed after five o\u2019clock that night.\u201d\nThe materiality of these misrepresentations cannot be doubted. The falsification by Dewey, his statements to Beulah that he intended to provide consideration, was basic to Beulah\u2019s decision to \u201csell\u201d the farm. The fabrication of Joan\u2019s approval of the deed is material because Beulah relied upon Joan for financial advice. The extent of Beulah\u2019s reliance is underscored by her statement, before signing the deed, that she would not agree to its terms unless she could first discuss the transaction with Joan. We hold that there is sufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to support the lower court\u2019s finding of fraud.\nThe court below also determined that \u201cDewey H. Seaman [had] exercised undue influence upon his sister Beulah E. Seaman in obtaining the deed\u201d which is the subject of this appeal. \u201c[U]ndue influence which will avoid a deed is such influence as is obtained by excessive importunity, superiority of will or mind, or by any other means constraining the grantor to do what he is unable to refuse. Whether such improper influence was exercised must usually be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the particular case, such as the situation of the grantor and his relation to others, his condition of health and its effect upon body and mind, his dependence upon, and subjection to, the persons claimed to have influenced him and their opportunity to wield such influence. . . .\u201d Withers v. Withers, 363 Pa. 431, 434, 70 A. 2d 331, 333 (1950), quoting from Teats v. Anderson, 358 Pa. 523, 528-29, 58 A. 2d 31, 33 (1948).\nAppellants state, correctly, that the burden of proving undue influence rests upon the party asserting it unless that party can prove a confidential relationship between the grantor and grantee, in which case the burden of proof must shift to the party asserting the validity of the deed to prove it was obtained by the free, voluntary and intelligent act of the grantor. Dzierski Estate, 449 Pa. 285, 296 A. 2d 716 (1972) ; Sendick v. Matvey, 391 Pa. 286, 295, 138 A. 2d 92, 96 (1957). Here our agreement with appellants\u2019 position ends. Appellants assert that appellee\u2019s decedent failed to sustain the burden of proof of undue influence. Additionally, since the evidence does not disclose a confidential relationship between Dewey and Beulah, appellants contend that the burden of proof did not shift to appellants to prove the deed was obtained by the free, voluntary and intelligent act of Beulah Seaman; and therefore the lower court\u2019s determination that the deed was coerced by undue influence cannot be sustained. We disagree.\nThe decedent\u2019s advanced age, her failing health and financial status, the fact of the recent death of the person with whom she made her home, the fact that appellants initiated the transaction with unseemly haste, the oral commitment to a contractual consideration without the commitment of its terms to the written instrument, and the actual fraud of the appellant, Dewey Seaman, all support a finding of substantial coercion sufficient to warrant an inference of undue influence destroying the decedent\u2019s free agency. We hold that appellee\u2019s decedent adduced sufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to support a finding of undue influence.\nDecree affirmed. Appellants to pay costs.\nThe decree appealed from also ordered the appellants to pay Benlah $115.00 per month from the date of the subject conveyance to the date possession was delivered back to her; that appellants be reimbursed for permanent improvements, repairs, taxes and insurance paid by them during their occupancy; and that appeUants return items of personal property over which they retained control during their stay.\n\u201c[T]hat is to say, the said Beulah E. Seaman is seized thereof as tenant for life, and the said Dewey H. Seaman and Esther L, Seaman, husband and wife, are seized in fee simple of reversion expectant upon the determination of the said estate for life.\u201d\nThe lower court filed its adjudication, voiding this deed, on November 30, 1971. After a petition for rehearing and exceptions to the findings of fact and conclusions of law were dismissed on January 27, 1972, the court entered a final decree, confirming the decree nisi, on February 8, 1972. After Beulah\u2019s death, Joan was substituted on April 27, 1972, as the personal representative of Beulah\u2019s estate.\nCharles B. Page, tenant on Beulah Seaman\u2019s Middlecreek farm prior to the February 11, 1969, deed, testified as follows: \u201cQ. (Direct examination by counsel for Beulah Seaman) : Did you have any subsequent conversation with Dewey Seaman or his wife concerning this property? A. Later on with Mr. Dewey. Q. And what was involved in those conversations? A. Well, he said he bought the property, and he wanted us to move out by the first of March if possible.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nJoan Thomas, in direct examination by counsel for appellee\u2019s decedent, offered the following testimony:\n\u201cMrs. Dewey Seaman on Eighth Street at that time called and said my Uncle Dewey wanted to talk to me. So then I decided I would, because they said it would take a few minutes.\n\u201cI went there after work. And when I got there, he came in and he said\u2014he clapped his hands\u2014he said he bought the home; and I was shocked at first because I didn\u2019t expect anything like that.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nLuther v. Luther, 216 Pa. 1, 64 A. 868 (1906), presents a strong factual analogy. A son induced his mother to assign to him a right to redeem real estate by representing to her that he had consulted with the mother\u2019s legal advisor and her other son. The Court characterized his artifice as fraud.\nWe need not consider the issue of whether there is sufficient evidence to establish a confidential relationship. This issue only arises if the party attacking the validity of the deed has not adduced evidence sufficient to support a finding of undue influence without the benefit of the presumption arising out of confidential relationship.",
