In 1968 an appeal reached this Court wherein the question raised was whether the church was subject to the patriarchal jurisdiction of the Moscow-based general Russian Orthodox Church [Patriarchate], or whether its hierarchical allegiance properly lay with “The Russian Orthodox Church of America”, known as the “Metropolia”. At the time of our decision <em>[St. Michael and Archangel Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church v.

During litigation in the lower court and until 1967, both groups, Metropolia and Patriarchal, shared the use of St. Michael’s Church, albeit, scheduled at different times. In 1967 the lower court allowed the majority faction to change the church charter to align it with the Metropolia Hierarchy. At this point the Patriarchal group rented a hall from a fraternal organization in which to hold their religious services. While the appeal was pending the Metropolia group in June 1968 started a “New Building Fund” program. Pledge cards for a three-year period entitled “St. Michael’s Orthodox Catholic Church of the Metropolia New Building Fund Program” were distributed to the parishioners. Printed on these cards was the following provision: “It <em>is understood that these funds will he only used for Metropolia Affiliated St. Michael’s Orthodox Catholic Chwrch of Philadelphia.” </em>It was found <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>that approximately $73,000 was raised for the project during 1968-69.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The Metropolia group treated St. Michael’s as if it were their own church when in fact it was not so aligned; it is therefore not unfair to assign the risk of losing this investment to them.

As the instant court below noted in its opinion, contributions to this fund were made from 1957 to 1962. As the chancellor observed further on: “It is clear from this record that the contributions to the church prior to the date of this litigation, February 1, 1963, were made by its members without a deep concern for the jurisdictional affiliation of the church for the common good of all members of the church and to support the life of the church.” This being the case, any money contributed to St. Michael's Church during the halcyon days of unconcern about jurisdiction properly belongs to the corporation.</p>

In 1965 certain parishioners affiliated with the Patriarchal group began a class action with the object of obtaining a declaration that the purpose for which the funds were collected [to erect an education and recreation building] had failed and therefore the funds should be returned to the donors in proportion to their contributions. After trial of the issues, the chancellor entered the following decree: “And Now, <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>to wit, this 11th day of April, 1967, plaintiffs’ prayer for an accounting and for the return of funds contributed by them and other members of this corporation towards the erection of an education and recreation building is dismissed.
