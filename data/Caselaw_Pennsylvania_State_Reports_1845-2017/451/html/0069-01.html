It is not appropriate for counsel to act as an amicus curiae or as adviser to the court. Before the merits of an indigent’s appeal are determined by a court, he is entitled to the advocacy of a lawyer in his behalf. If the lawyer acts as a court would, the position of the appellant is not at all improved and may be made worse. The Ninth Circuit expressed this concern in terms of lack of notice to the indigent appellant that counsel, if appointed, might give an <em>ex parte </em>communication to the court which ‘adds the weight of his opinion to the position of his client’s adversary.’ Harders v. California, 373 E. 2d 839, 843 (9th Cir. 1967). The Supreme Court has stated clearly that the attorney’s task is to advocate, not to judge, the appellant’s case. See Anders v.

We cannot successfully and constitutionally perform that function unless we consider a presentation devoted to arguments for the accused, leaving it to us to determine whether and to what extent they have merit.
