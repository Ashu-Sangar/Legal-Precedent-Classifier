At a special meeting on December 16, 1963, called to discuss the future of the club, the membership passed several <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>Resolutions three of which are relevant to this litigation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Those Resolutions were:</p>

Sometime after August 23, 1969, the new officers of the club withdrew the balance of the “Old Members’ Equity” account and invested it in certain U. S. Treasury Bills. Appellants subsequently made numerous oral and written requests pursuant to the above Eesolutions to have their pro rata shares of the proceeds from the sale of the Delaware County property distributed to them.

    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.6",616,[193,1021,1155,588]]]'>Appellees, again, interposed preliminary objections seeking to dismiss appellants’ complaint for the following reasons: (1) res judictata; (2) lack of a justiciable controversy; (3) an adequate remedy at law; and (4) a demurrer that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because, (a) no by-laws were created giving appellants any rights they claim; (b) no intent to dissolve the corporation can be inferred from the minutes of the meeting of December 16, 1963; and (c) appellants are estopped from asserting any vested interest in the property of the Club.</p>
    <p id="b616-6" data-blocks='[["BL_616.7",616,[193,1621,1156,521]]]'>Based solely on points (a) and (b) of appellees’ demurrer the court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint, whereupon appellants filed this appeal. Appellants argue here that, contrary to the court’s decision below, the Resolutions were validly enacted giving them the rights they claim, and that the officers of the corporation are bound to carry out the clear directives of those Resolutions. We agree with appellants and accordingly reverse and remand.</p>

Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 289, art. I, <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>§§1 et seq., 15 P.S. §§7001 et seq. The chancellor ruled that the Resolutions were not validly enacted because of noncompliance with the notice provision of the corporate by-laws.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The chancellor noted that rather than stating specifically what was to be discussed at the special meeting, as required in the by-laws, the notice only indicated that the purpose of the meeting was “to discuss and take necessary action regarding the future of the” Club.</p>
    <p id="b617-3" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[162,863,1150,807]]]'>However, even assuming, arguendo, that notice was insufficient, the notice provision in the by-laws was waived by attendance at the special meeting. “Attendance of a person either in person or by proxy, if the bylaws permit voting by proxy, at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.” Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 289, art. I, §10, as amended, 15 P.S. §7010. Here, 35 of a total membership of 48 persons attended the meeting. This was sufficient to constitute a quorum for the proper conduct of the business of the corporation. No objection was interposed by any other members.</p>
    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.5",617,[162,1684,1150,369]]]'>The chancellor also held that Resolution 3 creating the three-year trust fund for the old members was invalid because it was approved by only 21 of the 35 members present—two less than the necessary two-thirds majority. He concluded that there was not a validly adopted resolution indicating an intent to dissolve the corporation.</p>
    <p id="A7O" data-blocks='[["BL_618.4",618,[181,360,1156,741]]]'>
      <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>However, as appellants correctly point out, the chancellor applied the right criterion (the two-third majority vote) to the wrong Resolution. Resolution 3 dealt with the creation of the trust, which is no longer relevant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Resolutions 4 and 7 gave appellants the option to withdraw their pro rata equity and excluded later members from having any vested interest in those proceeds. It was Resolutions 4 and 7 that expressed the membership’s intent to dissolve the corporation. Both of those Resolutions were passed unanimously— clearly sufficient to meet the two-thirds majority requirement. Therefore these Resolutions, giving appellants the option to withdraw their funds, were validly enacted.3 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.5",618,[180,1123,1156,266]],["BL_619.1",619,[168,355,1150,918]]]'>The next issue is whether there was, in fact, an intent to dissolve the corporation expressed in the Resolutions of December 16, 1963. Appellees argue that on its face Resolution 3 expresses no desire on behalf of the corporation to dissolve itself. Again, however, appel<a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>lees have directed their attack toward the wrong Resolution. Resolution 4 clearly expressed the corporate decision to give appellants (old members) their pro rata equity distribution at any time after the expiration of the three-year trust period. Under the statute (Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 289, art. X, §1001, as amended, 15 P.S. §8001) the only method of accomplishing this pro rata distribution to the old members is dissolution of the corporation. While the drafters of the Resolution may not have been aware of the precise statutory prerequisites to such distribution, the intention to effect a distribution is nonetheless clearly evident. The undeniable implication of Resolution 4 is that the officers of the corporation should take all necessary steps to fulfill the mandate of that Resolution. This necessarily means that the officers must take the required steps to dissolve the corporation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b619-3" data-blocks='[["BL_619.4",619,[170,1285,1150,260]]]'>Appellants now have commenced the appropriate action—indeed virtually the only course of action available to them-—by seeking a judicial decree declaring the duty of the corporate officers to adhere to the mandates of these properly adopted Resolutions.</p>

      <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>Finally appellees contend that appellants are barred by the doctrine of res judicata from now pursuing this claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Appellees rely, mistakenly, on <em>Borden v. Baldwin, </em>supra and argue that this Court’s decision in 1971 that no distribution may occur absent dissolution proceedings is a bar to this litigation. We find this argument both fallacious and without merit.</p>
    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[177,731,1156,535]]]'>In <em>Baldwin, </em>supra at 583, <a href="/citations/?q=281%20A.2d%20892" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="281 A.2d 892">281 A. 2d at 895</a>, this Court said “[t]he corporation code will not suffer even a partial distribution of funds absent formal dissolution proceedings.” See Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 289, art. Ill, §304, as amended, 15 P.S. §7304. However, we most definitely did not bar appellants from subsequently attempting to institute those statutorily required dissolution proceedings.
