Following a degree-of-guilt hearing at which the District Attorney certified to the court that the crime rose no higher than murder in the second degree, appellant was found guilty of that crime by the trial court and sentenced to a term of not less than six nor more than twenty years’ imprisonment. No appeal was taken. On September 22, 1970, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (PCHA) alleging (1) that he was denied his appellate rights, (2) that the evidence introduced at the degree-of-guilt hearing was insufficient to raise the crime above voluntary manslaughter, (3) that his guilty plea was not knowingly or intelligently entered because it was based upon an involuntary confession and dereliction of counsel, and (4) that his trial counsel was incompetent. This is an appeal from the lower court’s denial of relief following a hearing at which appellant was represented by appointed counsel.</p>

It is well-established that on direct appeal from a second degree murder conviction based on a guilty plea, a defendant can only attack the voluntariness of the plea, the validity of the sentence and the related question of whether he introduced evidence sufficient to reduce the killing to manslaughter.

When an accused pleads guilty to murder generally, he admits that he is guilty of second degree murder and that there is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for second degree murder. <em>Commonwealth v. Dillinger, </em><a href="/pa/440/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="440 Pa. 336" data-case-ids="1932155" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0336-01">440 Pa. 336</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20505" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="269 A.2d 505">269 A. 2d 505</a> (1970). Even though an accused enters a plea of guilty to murder generally, he is still given an opportunity to introduce evidence that will mitigate the offense to voluntary manslaughter. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Kerekes v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/423/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="423 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1903177" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0337-01">423 Pa 337</a>, 340, <a href="/citations/?q=223%20A.2d%20699" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="223 A.2d 699">223 A. 2d 699</a>, 701 (1966).

Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that the Commonwealth’s testimony more than adequately supported a second degree murder conviction. Three eyewitnesses saw appellant holding the gun on the victim while the victim had his hands up, saw appellant advance and fire at the victim and saw appellant fire again as the victim fled.</p>

Taylor, </em><a href="/pa/449/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="449 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1945625" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0345-01">449 Pa. 345</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20823" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="296 A.2d 823">296 </a><a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a><a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20823" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="296 A.2d 823">A. 2d 823</a> (1972). Initially we note that appellant’s confession was made knowingly and freely. He was advised of his constitutional rights as prescribed by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a> (1966), when he was arrested, advised again when taken into the police station and advised a third time before he made his formal statement. Although the <em>Miranda </em>warnings had not been given immediately before his prior oral admission, this would not invalidate his subsequent formal statement. In <em>Commonwealth v. Abrams, </em><a href="/pa/443/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="443 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="1937013" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0295-01">443 Pa. 295</a>, 299, <a href="/citations/?q=278%20A.2d%20902" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="278 A.2d 902">278 A. 2d 902</a>, 905 (1971), this Court held that the prosecution has no absolute duty to repeat the <em>Miranda </em>warnings at each successive stage of an interrogation. Here, the appellant was repeatedly informed of his constitutional rights and freely and intelligently chose to waive those rights. Even assuming that appellant’s confession was constitutionally infirm, we do not conclude that his guilty plea was primarily motivated by his confession. It seems appellant pleaded guilty in order to avoid facing the eyewitness testimony which might have sufficed to convict appellant of first degree murder. Further, from a review of the record colloquy between appellant and the trial court, we are convinced that appellant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily pleaded guilty.</p>

The test for the competency of counsel’s advice does not involve a retrospective consideration of whether the advice was right or wrong but rather whether the advice was within the range of competence normally required of criminal defense attorneys. <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em><a href="/us/397/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="397 U.S. 759" data-case-ids="12058501" data-case-paths="/us/397/0759-01">397 U.S. 759</a>, 771 (1970). Our concern, therefore, is with the reasonableness of counsel’s assessment of his client’s case and his subsequent advice, including advice as to the effect of entering a guilty plea. <em>Commonwealth v. Ward, </em><a href="/pa/442/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="442 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1935336" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0351-01">442 Pa. 351</a>, 354, <a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%2092" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="275 A.2d 92">275 A. 2d 92</a>, 94 <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>(1971). Considering the circumstances surrounding the confession, the denial of a motion to suppress the confession and the eyewitness testimony that could establish a deliberate killing, we conclude that defense counsel had a reasonable basis for advising his client to plead guilty.</p>
    <p id="b419-3" data-blocks='[["BL_419.4",419,[176,680,1150,856]]]'>Appellant makes a number of claims to support his final allegation that his trial counsel was incompetent. The only claim that we need mention is that counsel was incompetent because he failed to argue to the trial judge, after the appellant pleaded guilty to murder generally and the Commonwealth certified that the crime rose no higher than second degree murder, that the case rose no higher than voluntary manslaughter.
