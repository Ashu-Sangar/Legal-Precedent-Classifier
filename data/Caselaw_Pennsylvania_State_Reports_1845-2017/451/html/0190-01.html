While much of the publicity was routine, factual, and wholly lacking in inflammatory content, a great deal of publicity about Pierce was emotionally charged and inflammatory, and clearly pointed to his guilt. A brief review of some of the inflammatory news coverage will show the quality of the publicity. In one story the police were quoted as stating Pierce had been arrested, and he verbally confessed to the double shooting. The story read: “[Police] He’s the triggerman. . . . He admitted it and now he’s crying and weeping.” The story went on to state; “Police said Pierce’s record dates to 1963 and included arrests for car theft, assault and battery and carrying a con<a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>eealed deadly weapon. ... He reportedly served time in the state juvenile center in Dallas, Pa.” Another story was entitled, “Two Youths Re-enact Media Street Attack.” This story reported a staged re-enactment of the crime and read: “Speaking softly, Pierce who Police say has confessed to being the ‘triggerman’ described how the three youths encountered the victims and then indicated where the victims fell after their attack.” Accompanying this story was a large picture of Pierce flanked by a policeman with a caption which read: “Alan Pierce indicates for C.I.D. Detective Edward Smith where one of the victims fell.” Another article was titled, “Third Youth Held in Media, Chester Man, 20, Admits Being Gunman, Chief Says.”</p>

A responsible press has always been regarded as the handmaiden of effective judicial administration, especially in the criminal field. Its function in this regard is documented by an impressive record of service over several centuries. The press does not simply publish information about trials but guards against the miscarriage of justice by subjecting the police, prosecutors, and judicial <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>processes to extensive public scrutiny and criticism. This Court bas, therefore, been unwilling to place any direct limitations on the freedom traditionally exercised by the news media for ‘[w]hat transpires in the court room is public property.’ Craig v.

In condemning such a practice, Mr. Justice Stewart, speaking for the majority of the Court, stated: “In the view we take of this case, the question of who originally initiated the idea of the televised interview is, in any event, a basically irrelevant detail. For we hold that it was a denial of due process of law to refuse the request for a change of venue, after the people of Calcasieu Parish had been exposed repeatedly and in depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing in detail to the crimes with which he was later to be charged. For anyone who has ever watched television the conclusion cannot be avoided that this spectacle, to tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it, in a very real sense <em>was </em>Rideau’s trial—at which he pleaded guilty to murder. Any subsequent court proceedings in a community so pervasively exposed to such a spectacle could be but a hollow formality.” <a href="/us/373/0723-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="373 U.S. 723" data-case-ids="11720000" data-case-paths="/us/373/0723-01">373 U.S. at 726</a>, <a href="/us/373/0723-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="373 U.S. 723" data-case-ids="11720000" data-case-paths="/us/373/0723-01">83 S. Ct. at 1419</a>. We believe that much of what was said in <em>Rideau </em>is applicable herein. In the instant case, as in <em>Rideau, </em>we believe that the deliberate release of the information that Pierce was the confessed “trigger-man” in the double shooting, as well as the staged reenactment of the crime “in a very real sense <em>was </em>[Pierce’s] trial at which he pleaded guilty to murder.” All the information released by the authorities clearly pointed to Pierce’s guilt, and any prospective juror exposed to this publicity must surely have formed a definite opinion as to Pierce’s guilt or innocence. Moreover, some of the information, such as the accused’s past criminal record, was not admissible at trial, but it was available to the prospective jurors through the news account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In the constitutional sense a fair trial <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>necessarily demands the evidence developed against the accused shall come from the witness stand in a public tribunal with the full judicial protection of such rights as: counsel, cross-examination, confrontation, and the right against self-incrimination.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> These safeguards could not have been afforded the appellant, they <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>were precluded from being fully effective by the pretrial news coverage.</p>

The information in this case was not reported as a result of independent research by the representatives of the news media—it came directly from the police. It was the authorities who released the fact that Pierce was the confessed “triggerman” with a past record, and the police who staged the “re-enactment” of the crime. Moreover, the District Attorney’s Office is not free from some blame for the aroused tone of the community because his office released statements such as: “I am waiting for the misguided social worker to begin a fast and vigil at the hospital beds of these most recent victims of savage lawlessness. When the robbers are captured, I promise them a swift and very special treatment.” The District Attorney’s Office also refused to produce witnesses at an arraignment because of alleged telephone threats to the victims of “ultimate death”.</p>

Officers of the Commonwealth and the police have a special duty and responsibility to <em>all </em>of the citizens of the Commonwealth. They must never lose sight of the fact that an accused has a right to a fair trial by an impartial jury, that only a jury can “strip a man of his liberty”, and a man is presumed innocent until <em>proven guilty in a court of law, </em>and that all men are guaranteed basic rights under the Constitution.</p>

The State court sanctioned this as not only permissible but as an inevitable ingredient of American criminal justice. That sanction contradicts all our professions as to the establishment of guilt on the basis of what takes place in the courtroom, subject to judicial restrictions in producing proof and in the general conduct of the proceedings.

Precisely because the feeling of the outside world cannot, with the utmost care, be kept wholly outside the courtroom, every endeavor must be taken in a civilized trial to keep it outside. To have the prosecutor himself feed the press with evidence that no self-res trained press ought to publish in anticipation of a trial is to make the State itself through the prosecutor, who wields its power, a conscious participant in trial by newspaper, instead of by those methods which centuries of experience have shown to be indispensable to the fair administration of justice.</p>
