In the absence of a jurisdictional defect, there is no basis for disturbing the judgment duly entered against the defendant—Thomas Sheridan, who did not appear (initially or at any stage of this litigation) to challenge the claim for support or the validity of the judgment entered against him.</p>
    <p id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.7",137,[151,993,1153,1344]]]'>The majority proceeds on the assumption that the Family Division “inappropriately exercised jurisdiction.” The majority also assumes that this issue is one which appellant-garnishee (Mellon Trust) can raise in New Matter. Rule 1275(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure is specifically to the contrary. That Rule provides: “(b) The garnishee in his answer under 'new matter’ may include the defenses of the immunity or exemption of property, the defense that no property of the defendant was in the possession of the garnishee at the time of service of the attachment, or any defense or counterclaim which he could assert against the defendant if sued by him, <em>but may not assert any defenses on behalf of the defendant against the plaintiff or otherwise attack the validity of the attachment” </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, under New Matter, the garnishee may raise only: (1) the immunity or exemption of the property; (2) the defense that no property of the defendant is in its possession; and (3) any defense or counterclaim it could raise against the defendant. Whether the Family Division “inappropriately exercised jurisdiction” is not one of the permissible issues under Rule 1275(b). It, therefore, cannot be asserted—as the garnishee here attempts—in New Matter.</p>

Those defenses may only be raised by the defendant. The judgment against the defendant forecloses those issues. Nor may the garnishee in his answer otherwise attack the validity of the attachment. That must be done, if at all, at an earlier stage of the action, by preliminary objection, and if not attacked by such a pleading is deemed waived.” 2 Goodrich-Amram, Standard Pennsylvania Practice, §1275 (b) -2 at 216 (1962). Here, defendant Thomas Sheridan neither appeared nor interposed any defense and a default judgment was entered against him. The judgment so entered foreclosed the garnishee from asserting that the Family Division “inappropriately exercised jurisdiction” in this proceeding. The garnishee may not now raise that issue either on its own behalf or on behalf of the defendant.</p>

Apparently recognizing that there is no longer a jurisdictional problem raised, the majority nevertheless devotes a substantial portion of the opinion to a consideration as to which division would have been the most appropriate for the filing of this lawsuit. An even more serious mistake in my judgment is that it leaves open the implication that an appellate finding of an inappropriate selection of division for the initiation of an action may of itself, without a consideration of the merits, justify the vacation of the order below although admittedly the court rendering the decision had jurisdiction over the cause.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a>

Article Y, §5, Pennsylvania Constitution. As was stated by one of the members of the Constitutional Convention: “There have over the years been many conflicts between the orphans’ court and the common pleas as to who had jurisdiction. Then in many other courts there have been similar conflicts about jurisdiction.

      <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>By a long and labored discussion in this area the majority has attempted to resurrect a problem that it was hoped had been interred forever. They justify this attempt to revive the problem by the presumptuous judgment that the selection of a forum in this lawsuit could properly be characterized as “willy nilly”. In my opinion, this conclusion is not only unjustified but represents an unnecessarily harsh criticism of the plaintiff and the court below. First, I do not agree that even if the selection was patently erroneous that it should be the subject of appellate review. The question no longer being one of jurisdiction, it is difficult to understand the reason for appellate review. Clearly, the 1968 amendment relegated the issue to a matter of administration and any abuse thereof should be handled administratively.</p>

In setting forth the areas of concern for each division of the new unified court of common pleas the Schedule to the Judiciary Article was not attempting to define theories of actions (e.g., assumpsit, trespass, etc.) nor did it base the classification upon the form of process (e.g., foreign attachment). Bather it was attempting to define the broad areas of the law to which each division was to direct its attention.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a> It is equally as clear that an action con<a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>cerned with enforcement of obligations predicated upon a duty to support bom from a family relationship was entrusted to the Family Division of the new court. I cannot agree that the establishment of the obligation and the reduction of the arrearages to judgment so transforms the character of the lawsuit so that it is no longer an appropriate concern for the Family Division. While admittedly it is an action to enforce an obligation, it is nevertheless an obligation derived from a duty to support as opposed to a contractual duty. The majority, while holding that the reduction to judgment had removed it from the area of support and transformed it to a collection for debt, nevertheless recognizes the origin of the obligation for the purpose of determining the applicability of Section 12 of the Estates Act of 1947<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">3</a> and Section 1 of the Act of May 10, 1921.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_4" id="ref_footnote_4_4">4</a> To maintain that for purposes of selecting a forum the fact of the existence of a judgment so transforms the action that we must ignore that it emerges from a support obligation and yet recognize the character of the obligation in determining the right of the judgment holder to proceed against a spendthrift trust is in my judgment utter nonsense.</p>

An inappropriate exercise of jurisdiction by a division of the court of common pleas should not in and of itself pro<a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>vide the basis for a reversal of a judgment on a vacating of an order.</p>

The issues to be resolved by the court below in this action were, whether there was an obligation, and whether there was a fund from which this obligation could be satisfied. The majority of this Court agreed with the lower court’s determination that each was to be answered in the affirmative.
