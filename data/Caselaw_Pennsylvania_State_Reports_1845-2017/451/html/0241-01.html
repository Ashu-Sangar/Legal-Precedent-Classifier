The circumstances surrounding appellant’s arrest and the lengthy delay before arraignment, as established by the Commonwealth’s own witnesses, are as follows: Appellant was arrested at approximately 11:45 A.M. on June 27,1971. He was immediately taken to the police station and handcuffed to a chair for the next twenty-one and a half hours. During that interim, spent in a “well-lit” room of modest dimensions, appellant was subjected to almost constant police interrogation. By the computation of the police appellant could have had no more than six hours of respite during this twenty-one and a half hour detention.</p>

Finally, at 9:15 A.M. on June 28, a second statement, now challenged as involuntary, was secured from the appellant, and within minutes he was thereafter arraigned.</p>

Zeal in tracking down crime is not in itself an assurance of soberness of judgment. Disinterestedness in law enforcement does not alone prevent disregard of cherished liberties. Experience has therefore counseled that safeguards must be provided against the dan<a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>gers of the overzealous as well as the despotic. The awful instruments of the criminal law cannot be entrusted to a single functionary. The complicated process of criminal justice is therefore divided into different parts, responsibility for which is separately vested in the various participants upon whom the criminal law relies for its vindication. Legislation such as this, requiring that the police must with reasonable promptness show legal cause for detaining arrested persons, constitutes an important safeguard—not only in assuring protection for the innocent but also in securing conviction of the guilty by methods that commend themselves to a progressive and self-confident society. For this procedural requirement checks resort to those reprehensible practices known as the ‘third degree’ which, though universally rejected as indefensible, still find their way into use. It aims to avoid all the evil implications of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime. It reflects not a sentimental but a sturdy view of law enforcement. It outlaws easy but self-defeating ways in which brutality is substituted for brains as an instrument of crime detection.” <a href="/us/318/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="318 U.S. 332" data-case-ids="364464" data-case-paths="/us/318/0332-01">318 U.S. at 343-44</a>, <a href="/us/318/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="318 U.S. 332" data-case-ids="364464" data-case-paths="/us/318/0332-01">63 S.

    <p id="b323-4" data-blocks='[["BL_323.5",323,[183,617,1150,1099]]]'>Eule 118 is a mere procedural device, lacking in constitutional dimension. The impact of Justice Roberts’ opinion, as I read it, is to attach to Rule 118 a judicial evidentiary exclusionary rule, and to hold that a violation of Rule 118 with the only consideration being <em>the amount of time </em>between the arrest and the confession, renders the confession inadmissible. In other words, no consideration is given to whether the confession is voluntary. <em>Miranda </em>teaches that a person accused of crime is entitled to certain basic and fundamental rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Miranda </em>also sets forth guidelines under which a determination can be made if an accused’s “waiver” of his rights is constitutionally valid, and if a confession is voluntary and admissible in a judicial proceeding. To give Rule 118 the force and effect advocated by Mr. Justice Roberts is to preclude any consideration of the guidelines enunciated in <em>Miranda.</em>

An individual is arrested without a warrant, taken to police headquarters and given full warning of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waives. He is then intermittently questioned by the police for a period of time, which may be construed as “unreasonable delay” under Rule 118, a,nd confesses. Under the position espoused by Mr. Justice Roberts his confession would be inadmissible at trial, notwithstanding it was freely given and unquestionably met all of the constitu<a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>tional standards dictated by <em>Miranda. </em>Ironically, the result would be the exclusion of a confession which is freely given and constitutionally valid merely because of a violation of a procedural rule which was brought into existence to insure that confessions would be voluntary. The accused’s constitutional rights have not been violated, the police have afforded the accused all the required protections so that his confession is a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary exercise of his free will; yet, the confession is excluded. I cannot reconcile this type of result with the general purposes of our criminal law. Additionally, its impact on the administration of justice in Pennsylvania gives me great concern.</p>
