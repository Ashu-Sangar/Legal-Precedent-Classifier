Appellant replied affirmatively as to his understanding of the right to counsel. On the first giving of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings (prior to submitting to a polygraph test) he stated that he had done nothing wrong and did not need a <em>lawyer; </em>on the second giving of the warnings (prior to questioning five days later) his response was, “No, I will do my own talking”.</p>
