They were awarded $243. The parents then moved to vacate the award on the ground that the arbitrator denied their request for a recess to obtain the testimony of decedent’s attending physician as to certain medical matters having a bearing on the daughter’s future work capacity. The lower court vacated the award and remanded the case for a hearing de novo before another arbitrator, and we affirmed. Writing for the Court, Mr. Justice [now Chief Justice] Jones said at pp. 137-138:</p>

The important fact that stands clear is that Smaligos’ counsel did proffer medical testimony which was relevant and of great import in the determination of loss of future earnings of the decedent and that the arbitrator determined such testimony was not necessary. It may be true that Smaligos’ counsel should have come prepared with the medical testimony at the time of the hearing and that perhaps the necessity of such testimony came to him as an ‘afterthought’ (as stated by the arbitrator), but such observations cannot militate from the all-important fact that counsel did at the time of the hearing make an offer to present the medical testimony and the arbitrator viewed such testimony as ‘unnecessary’.</p>
