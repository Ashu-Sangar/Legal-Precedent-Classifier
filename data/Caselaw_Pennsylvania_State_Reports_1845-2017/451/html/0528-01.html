Kelief was denied in the PCHA proceeding and Johnson filed another appeal to this Court.</p>

In the PCHA petition appeal, this Court sustained the lower court’s finding that appellant’s confession was not coerced, but reversed the lower court on appellant’s other PCHA claim, that he was improperly denied his appeal rights. Appellant was, therefore, given the right to file post-trial motions as though timely filed. In the appeal from the habeas corpus petition denial, this Court agreed with appellant’s claim that his confession was elicited at a critical stage in the proceedings when counsel was required under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Massiah v.

All three were convicted of murder, but Smith, the appellant, alone filed neither post-trial motions nor an appeal. Eighteen years later, Smith filed a habeas corpus petition, which eventually resulted in this Court granting him a direct appeal nunc pro tunc.

However, the court ruled that Smith unlike his co-felons would be able to avail himself of the <em>Bedline </em>rule. In distinguishing the situation of Smith from that of his co-felons, the court stated: “All three of those cases, however, were collateral attacks on the convictions. By contrast, the instant case is on <em>direct appeal. </em>Although in the three collateral attack cases, we spoke of the law as it existed at the time of the relator’s ‘conviction’, we were not at that time faced with a situation where the conviction had not yet become final, as here. Hough’s conviction had become final as a result of his appeal, and Almeida’s became final by virtue of his failure to take an appeal. In contrast, here, Smith’s conviction is not final, as he is on direct appeal. No one would suggest that this Court would be violating any settled principles of law by making a change in the law and reversing a conviction, even though the law at the time of conviction supported the conviction. This has occurred innumerable times, in practically every landmark constitutional criminal case. Nor should the result be any different where the appeal is nunc pro tunc rather than immediately after conviction.” <a href="/pa/438/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="438 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1929276" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0218-01">438 Pa. 218</a> at 236, <a href="/citations/?q=261%20A.2d%20550" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="261 A.2d 550">261 A. 2d 550</a> at 559.</p>
