Appellee’s claim was based on an alleged oral contract whereby she agreed to perform domestic services in consideration of decedent’s promise to bequeath $10,000 to her. Judge Muth, as the auditing judge, after hearing, filed an adjudication dismissing the claim. Appellee interposed exceptions to the adjudication and Judge Muth, sitting as the court en banc, amended his prior adjudication and allowed the claim. The executor appealed.</p>

Theodore Mengel, appellee’s son, testified that he was present in decedent’s apartment in 1962 when his parents and the decedent discussed the terms of the contract and reached an agreement. He further <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>testified that his mother, appellee, regularly performed domestic services for decedent for at least eight or nine years prior to decedent’s death. He testified that following the 1962 agreement he personally transported appellee to and from decedent’s apartment “hundreds of times.” Two of decedent’s neighbors—one of whom lived in the same building as decedent—also testified and corroborated the fact that for at least eight years appellee performed household services for decedent “almost every day.”</p>

Judge Muth, sitting as the court en bane, recognized the weight which must be afforded this testimony when he concluded: “An examination of our Adjudication and a review of the testimony discloses that the auditing judge apparently allotted an inordinate influence to the fact that the testimony with reference to the nature of the agreement rested entirely upon the son of the claimant. As pointed out in our Adjudication, this testimony was relevant and admissible. We also concluded that the testimony concerning the nature and the teínas of the contract was direct, precise and specific. Our dismissal of the claim of Ida R. Mengel was based upon the assumption that proof of the claim had not been established by evidence which is clear, direct, precise and convincing. In our Adjudication, it seems that little weight was given to the mute evidence of the continued employment and services of the claimant to the decedent from the time the oral agreement was entered into in April of 1962, until the time of the death of the Testatrix in December of 1969. <em>The testimony of Theodore 11.
