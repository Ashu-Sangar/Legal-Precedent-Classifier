    <p id="b294-6" data-blocks='[["BL_294.9",294,[184,1118,1154,382]]]'>In 1919, defendant-appellee issued to the insured (appellant’s husband) a life insurance policy in the face amount of $15,000.

This double indemnity provision, and the exceptions contained therein, are the subject of this appeal.</p>

Immediate and extensive brain surgery was required. From the moment of the accident until his death, Mr. Burne’s existence was that of a complete and hopeless invalid, unable to speak, subject to seizures and requiring constant nursing and medical care. Vast sums of money were expended by appellant, and the most sophisticated medical techniques utilized, merely to keep her husband medically alive, albeit in a vegetative state, for <em>áy2 </em>years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It is conceded by the appel<a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>lee insurance company that the injuries sustained were the direct and sole cause of the insured’s death.

However, the policy states that such accidental death benefits will be payable only if “. . . such death occurred . . . within ninety days from the date of the accident.” One further exception in the double indemnity rider provides: “This Accidental Death Benefit shall not be payable * * (10) if the death of the insured shall occur while any premium is being waived under any disability benefit attached to or incorporated in said policy. * *” (It should be noted, however, that under the policy, no premiums are waived until the insured furnishes proof to the company that the insured has been totally incapacitated for at least six months.) On the basis of these exceptions, the trial court, en banc, granted defendant-appellee’s motion for summary judgment. This appeal challenges the validity of these exceptions as applied to the facts of the instant case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The provision has its origins at a much earlier stage of medicine. Accordingly, the leading case construing the provision predates three decades of progress <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>in the field of curative medicine. Advancements made during that period have enabled the medical profession to become startlingly adept at delaying death for indeterminate periods. Physicians and surgeons now stand at the very citadel of death, possessing the awesome responsibility of sometimes deciding whether and what measure should be used to prolong, even though momentarily, an individual’s life. The legal and ethical issues attending such deliberations are gravely complex.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[185,899,1155,824]]]'>The result reached by the trial court presents a gruesome paradox indeed—it would permit double indemnity recovery for the death of an accident victim who dies instantly or within ninety days of an accident, but would deny such recovery for the death of an accident victim who endures the agony of prolonged illness, suffers longer, and necessitates greater expense by his family in hopes of sustaining life even momentarily beyond the ninety day period. To predicate liability under a life insurance policy upon death occurring only on or prior to a specific date, while denying policy recovery if death occurs after that fixed date, offends the basic concepts and fundamental objectives of life insurance and is contrary to public policy. Hence, the ninety day limitation is unenforceable.</p>

So too, <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>the decisions as to what medical treatment should be accorded an accident victim should be unhampered by considerations which might have a tendency to encourage something less than the maximum medical care on penalty of financial loss if such care succeeds in extending life beyond the 90th day. All such factors should, wherever possible, be removed from the antiseptic halls of the hospital. Rejection of the arbitrary ninety day provision does exactly that.</p>

In granting appellee’s motion for summary judgment, the trial court obviously relied upon a single thirty year old case, <em>Sidebothom v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/339/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="339 Pa. 124" data-case-ids="1201275" data-case-paths="/pa/339/0124-01">339 Pa. 124</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20A.2d%20131" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 A.2d 131">14 A. 2d 131</a> (1940). That case, as well as virtually every other case which construed a ninety day limitation provision,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> is based on considerations which have no pragmatic applicability to the factual situation here. The earlier judicial interpretation of the ninety day provision was that its underping purpose was to govern situations where there existed some possible uncertainty over whether injuries sustained in an accident would actually result in death. The ninety day provision attempted to delineate a line governing cases where the injuries may or may not <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>cause death. Ninety days was the arbitrary period advanced by the carrier within which to ascertain whether death will in fact result from the accident.</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[179,513,1155,1045]]]'>The factual situation in <em>Bidebothom </em>is illustrative of the principles underlying a ninety day provision. There the insured suffered injuries from two different exposures to carbon monoxide. While in the hospital he suffered further injuries from a fall from a hospital bed. In two crucial ways that case is distinguishable from the instant one. First, the injury involved in <em>Bidebothom </em>was not the type that with any degree of certainty could be regarded as fatal. In addition <em>Bidebothom </em>presented distinct causation problems, the deceased having suffered injuries both within and without the ninety day period. The instant case suffers from neither of these infirmities. It was clear from the moment of the accident that the husband would die as a result thereof, the only question being one of time. Nor was there any causation problem, it being conceded by the defendant that the sole cause of death was the injuries suffered by the husband when struck by the car.</p>

We are not to suppose that conditions involving forfeitures are introduced into policies by insurance companies, which are purely arbitrary and without reason, merely as a trap to the assured or as a means of escape for the company <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>in case of loss. When therefore a general condition has no application to a particular policy; where the reason which alone gives it force is out of the case, the condition itself drops out with it.” <a href="/pa/107/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="107 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="8856143" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0026-01">Id. at 37</a>.

This case is clearly one where “the reason of a condition does not apply.” The provision should not be applied to cases where, as this record establishes, no dispute exists as to the cause of death. Surely the ninety day provision was not meant to be “merely ... a trap to the assured or as a means of escape for the company in case of loss.”</p>
    <p id="b299-3" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[192,1140,1155,1214]]]'>Demonstrative of the principle that if a general condition has no relevance to a particular fact situation it is not applied are jurisdictions construing insurance policy provisions allowing awards for the loss of a limb, only if the loss occurs within sixty days of the accident. Claimants have successfully recovered when they produced medical testimony which established that it was obvious <em>before </em>the end of the sixty day period that the insured victim would need an amputation, but the actual amputation was delayed by doctors until <em>after </em>the sixty days period for reasons of health. <em>Westenhover v. Life &amp; Casualty Insurance Co., </em><a href="/so2d/27/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="27 So. 2d 391" data-case-ids="10050537" data-case-paths="/so2d/27/0391-01">27 So. 2d 391</a> (La.

Such rationale is directly applicable to the instant case. Here the appellant was prepared to prove through expert medical testimony that well within the ninety day period it was certain that the husband would die as a result of the injuries received; it was only due to extraordinary efforts on the part of attending physicians, implementing the most advanced medical techniques available, that the husband was kept scientifically alive.</p>

      <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>Under the life insurance contract the specific hazard indemnified is premature death resulting from an accident. Recovery for that loss should not be forfeited by the arbitrary and unreasonable condition that payment will be made only if the accident victim dies within ninety days but not if he survives beyond that point. On this record it is obvious that to enforce the ninety day condition would serve only “as a trap to the assured or as a means of escape for the company in case of loss.”</p>

Further, the waiver-of-premium exception, when read in conjunction with the entire waiver-of-premium supplement, creates an obvious ambiguity. Simply, the two provisions when read together yield the following interpretation: If the insured is totally and continuously incapacitated for a period of at least six months, the premiums due on the policy are waived by the company; however, if during the post-six month waiver-of-premium period the insured should die by accident, no double indemnity benefits will be paid. It is unclear whether the policy provisions preclude double indemnity recovery only in those cases where death is caused by a second accident which occurred after the six month period, or whether the policy bars double indemnity recovery in all cases where the insured dies by accidental means during a period when premiums are being waived.</p>

Here the basic policy was one for “ordinary life”, and the proceeds of $15,000 were paid upon Burne’s death to his widow, the appellant, as beneficiary. The present suit is to compel payment of the additional $15,000 under the accidental death benefit endorsement added to the policy for a small additional premium (less than 10% of the basic premium).

Other situations can easily be imagined in which a family medical decision might be made, quite understandably, in the light of financial limitations.

Because the insured’s disability following what the majority would refer to as the “first accident” must continue uninterruptedly for six months in order to activate the waiver-of-premium benefit, there can be no recovery under the accidental death benefit, if the “first accident” eventuates in the death of the insured since the death did not occur within the required 90-day period. As to the result when death is caused by accidental means while premiums are being waived due to a previous disability (what the majority calls the “second accident”) the situation is equally clear: The insured’s death because of the “second accident” will not entitle the beneficiary to double indemnity; indeed, this is the precise situation against which the insurer drafted this language.</p>

L. 682, art. VI, as amended, 40 P.S. §752 (A) (4).
