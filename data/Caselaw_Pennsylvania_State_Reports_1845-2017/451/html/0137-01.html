On November 29, 1909, the Whites and Global entered into a written agreement of sale for the purchase of property owned by the Whites. The purchase price was $90,000 with a down payment of $9,000 to be paid into an escrow account. Robert F.

In anticipation of settlement and start of construction on the property, the Whites and their tenants vacated the premises in the first week of May, 1970.</p>

Hertz told the parties that “It [the financing] was in the bag.” At this meeting the parties executed a second extension agreement. The relevant part of this agreement provides: “The parties agree that settlement is ex<a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>tended to on or before May 25, 1970, 9:00 a.m. In the event settlement is not consummated at that time, the parties agree to a further extension of settlement to on or before June 5, 1970. If such further extension is required, Buyer shall pay retroactive to this date the sum of |15.00 per day, until the date of settlement. Such payment shall cease on the day Buyer is ready, willing and able to make settlement, whether or not settlement is consummated.”</p>
    <p id="b215-3" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[155,843,1151,323]]]'>Shortly thereafter Global did receive a verbal commitment from a mortgage lending institution in the amount of |200,000.

The reason given for this delay was that Global had acquired another parcel of real estate and had obtained mortgage financing for a package deal which included the White’s property, and that only the paper work needed to be completed on this matter. Subsequently, on that same date the parties signed the following agreement, the focus of this litigation:</p>

    <p id="b216-8" data-blocks='[["BL_216.9",216,[196,1292,1154,203]]]'>(4) Global’s failure to consummate settlement on July 10, 1970, was a breach of the agreement which entitled the Whites to retain the $9,000 escrow less counsel fees and costs.</p>
    <p id="b216-9" data-blocks='[["BL_216.10",216,[195,1515,1154,661]]]'>Appellant contends that the financing contingency in the original agreement of November 29, 1969, entitles it to the return of the escrow deposit, and that it at no time agreed to alter or waive that condition. The chancellor construed the provision in the June 3 extension agreement that “settlement shall be made on or before July 10, 1970, and time is of the essence,” as abrogating the mortgage financing condition of the original agreement. The court reasoned that because Global had, prior to the extension agreement, assured the Whites that Global had secured the mortgage financing it therefore waived that financing condition.</p>
    <p id="b216-10" data-blocks='[["BL_216.11",216,[265,2186,1082,45]]]'>In reaching this conclusion the chancellor stated:</p>

Therefore, the intention of the parties in entering into the June 3, 1970, extension agreement must be interpreted in the light of these surrounding circumstances. The intention of the parties, when they signed the June 3 agreement which stated that ‘settlement shall be made on or before July 10, 1970’ and ‘time is of the essence’ is held to be as follows: (1) that the condition requiring the procurement of mortgage financing had been accomplished; (2) that inasmuch as the condition had been met, this extension agreement vitiated the conditional nature of the contract of November 29,1969; (3) that the only thing that remained for the complete performance of this contract was some necessary paper work (month and seven days, i.e., from June 3 to July 10); and (4) that final settlement should be made on or before July 10, 1970.</p>

See <em>East Crossroads Center, Inc. v. Mellon-Stuart Co., </em>supra; <em>Siciliano v. Misler, </em>supra. There is no ambiguity in this extension agreement, nor is there any clause providing that the buyer would forfeit its $9,000 deposit if it failed to make settlement on or before July 10, 1970. The waiver of such a contractual right—the return of the escrow deposit—must be a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act of the party. See <em>Gaffney v.

Such an important condition in a written agreement of sale must be given effect unless altered by the parties or specifically waived by the party in whose favor that condition runs in the agreement.

Neither of the first two agreements constituted a waiver of the financing condition, nor does the language of the third extension writing permit the conclusion that such a waiver has occurred. Moreover, in examining the entire extension agreement, see <em>Sykes v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>Breen v. Rhode Island Ins. Co., </em>supra, it is evident that there is specific consideration for the third extension agreement—Global’s obligation to pay $950.00 to the sellers. This was the stated consideration for the further extension. In the absence of a specific contractual alteration or waiver of the conditional provision of the original agreement, that financing provision remains valid and must be given full effect. If the sellers were bargaining for any additional alteration, such as the abrogation of the financing condition, in return for this further extension, that too, as the payment of the $950.00, would have been expressly included in the written agreement.</p>
