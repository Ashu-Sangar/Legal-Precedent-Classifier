In a well reasoned opinion by Judge Stadtpeld, speaking for a unanimous court, it was held that a fine abates upon the death of the defendant and cannot be enforced against his estate whether or not the judgment of sentence had become final at the time of death. Quoting from an Oklahoma decision, the court said: “The reason for the rule has been stated as follows: ‘In a criminal action the sole purpose of the proceedings is to enforce the criminal law and punish the person found guilty of a violation thereof. The personal representative of the deceased is not responsible for the alleged violation of the law by the defendant during his lifetime, and cannot be required to satisfy the judgment rendered against him. It is only the person adjudged guilty who can be punished, and a judgment cannot be enforced when the only subject matter upon which it can operate has ceased to exist’.” [Citations omitted].

Aside from the fact that the record shows no such certification of the judgment here involved, these statutes are inapplicable to the present situation. It is not a question of the orphans’ court either enforcing or disregarding a final judgment of sentence of a criminal court; the question is, upon Stauch’s death in 1955 what then was the status in <em>any </em>court of the fine imposed on him in 1949? The answer of <em>Embody </em>is that the efficacy and vitality of criminal judgments, whether in relation to a fine or imprisonment, is dependent upon the existence of the person subject to it. Upon his death the punishment, whether it be the continued deprivation of his liberty or the collection of an unpaid fine, must necessarily come to an end.</p>

(See footnote 3, supra.) No empirical data is cited to indicate that this has been the experience over the past thirty years, and in fact the fear seems quite unrealistic. The Commonwealth is not powerless to enforce criminal money judgments. For over a century the courts have had by statute “power to award process to levy and recover such fines . . . as shall be imposed by them . . .”. Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, §32, 17 P.S. §361. Whether a fine is paid voluntarily or collected by process involuntarily during the lifetime of a defendant, the defendant is thereby being punished. If, however, it is collected after his death, whether in the course of orphans’ court proceedings or otherwise, the punishment falls not upon the guilty person, but upon his estate, which normally means his family. The result is not <em>only to </em>inflict punishment on those not guilty of any crime, but <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>also to run counter to the recognized reasons for sanctions in the criminal law.</p>

When that wrongdoer dies, the purpose of the sanction is no longer present and an attempt to perpetuate its existence is devoid of justification and reason. The fact that during the lifetime of the subject, an obligation to pay a fine is created is not controlling. It must be remembered that the obligation was only for the purpose of effectuating the end of the punishment. It differs significantly from an obligation which arises from a contract or some other relationship between individuals which transcends the fact of death.

Punishment of the defendant is only one aspect of that concern and there are other aspects which transcend the death of the defendant. An appellate review as to the propriety of the conviction below is necessitated because there are consequences which flow from conviction which extend beyond the death of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth v. Walker, </em>supra, at 146-7.

Embody, </em><a href="/pa-super/143/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="143 Pa. Super. 354" data-case-ids="1031795" data-case-paths="/pa-super/143/0354-01">143 Pa. Superior Ct. 354</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20620" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="17 A.2d 620">17 A. 2d 620</a> (1941), reasons that the $6000 fine should abate because to do otherwise would “punish” the devisees, rather than the defendant. This reasoning ignores the basic fact that when sentence was imposed, the defendant immediately incurred a statutorily authorized and judicially imposed obligation to pay the fine. Payment of this fine from the offender’s assets does not penalize <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>those with a possible testamentary interest in the decedent’s estate a,ny more than payment of other money judgments. Beneficiaries of a decedent’s estate are entitled to only that which remains after the payment of taxes, costs of administration and decedent’s debts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a> Thus, satisfaction of the decedent’s obligation to the Commonwealth in no sense deprives his devisees or heirs of anything to which they are legally entitled. Surely, the majority would not and, indeed, could not hold that, if a dcedent incurred a civil debt, his estate need not pay the debt because payment would penalize his devisees by reducing the funds available for distribution to them.</p>
    <p id="b371-4" data-blocks='[["BL_371.5",371,[202,1071,1148,603]]]'>It must be obvious that <em>Embody </em>was based on a completely inaccurate view of the nature of a final judgment of sentence, its integrity and its immunity from attack in a subsequent collateral noncriminal proceeding. It was based also on a complete misconception of just what assets of a decedent’s estate are available for distribution to a decedent’s beneficiaries. <em>Embody, </em>decided by the Superior Court over thirty years ago and never reviewed by this Court, I submit, is a decision without precedential vitality and therefore should be rejected.</p>

The result reached by the majority ignores the wise observation of the Orphans’ Court Division of Allegheny County. That court, although feeling bound by <em>Embody, </em>nevertheless expressed its hope that appellate review would result in the rejection of <em>Embody. </em>The orphans’ court stated: “The court is reluctant to make this adjudication for the reason that if this is the law, any fine imposed need not be paid; the <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>defendant only needs to wait until the time he passes away at which time the fine will be discharged, regardless of the size of the estate which he leaves. We do not believe that this is good law and we recommend that the Commonwealth take an appeal from this adjudication.”</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[179,684,1157,659]]]'>Finally, the majority also ignores the constitutional provision that “the Governor shall have the power to remit fines ... on the recommendation in ivriting of a majority of the Board of Pardons. ...” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_7" id="ref_footnote_3_7">7</a> The Legislature implemented this constitutional authority by providing: “The Board of Pardons shall have the power to hear applications for the remission of fines . . . and to make recommendations in writing to the Governor thereon, in the manner provided in and under and subject to Article IY, Section 9, of the Constitution of this Commonwealth.” Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 177, art. IX, §909, as amended, 71 P.S. §299 (Supp. 1972).</p>
    <p id="b372-5" data-blocks='[["BL_372.6",372,[174,1356,1159,760]]]'>Thus, the majority’s creation of a per se rule of abatement of fines upon death of the defendant in addition to being unauthorized, unnecessary and unwise, is actually contrary to the express grant of constitutional and statutory authority vested in the Governor and the Board of Pardons. The constitutional provision and implementing statute has established the appropriate and exclusive forum for the consideration of deserving requests for abatement of fines. The majority’s holding today denigrates in toto the finality of the judgment of sentence of the prior criminal judicial proceeding and totally frustrates the controlling constitutional and statutory provisions relating to the “remission of fines.”</p>
