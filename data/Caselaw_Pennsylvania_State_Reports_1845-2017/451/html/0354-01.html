The complaint alleged that Stefan, a former employee of Jim Pappas Associates (“Pappas”), and three other former employees, namely, Calhoun, Mitchell and Haasis, formed an association of management counseling and executive recruiting. It is alleged that the association of appellee, Calhoun, Mitchell and Haasis acquired confidential information about Pappas’ clients and utilized the information to the benefit of appellee, and his associates, and the detriment of Pappas. Appellant’s complaint against Stefan seeks the reimbursement of $5,180.00, an amount allegedly advanced to Stefan in connection with his Pappas employment, and $25,000 punitive damages.

While the scope of our review is limited to a determination of whether the lower court has acted in abuse of its discretion, we have repeatedly delineated the combination of factors which must be considered before a default judgment may be opened: (1) the petition to open the default judgment must be promptly filed; (2) the failure to enter an appearance or file a timely answer <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>must be excused; and (3) the party seeking to open the judgment must exhibit a meritorious defense. <em>Carney v.

Appellee’s counsel, Brobyn, was away from his office until October 4, the last day to file a timely responsive pleading under normal procedural circumstances. Thirty-six days later, on November 9, appellant moved for a default judgment. An. answer was not filed by the appellee until November 11, fifty-five days after personal service of the complaint and thirty-eight days after counsel Brobyn’s return from vacation. Even assuming that these facts justify the conclusion that an extension was requested and granted, there can be no justification for the unexplained thirty-eight-day delay between the date of Brobyn’s return from vacation and the date of his belated answer on appellee’s behalf. We could not strain these facts to mean that the silence of appellant’s counsel indicated an agreement to an unlimited extension. Nor does the extension preclude the appellant’s motion <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>for a default judgment within a reasonable time after October 4, 1971, since the purported extension could only be considered a courtesy lasting not more than a brief period after Brobyn’s return from vacation. <em>Cf.

Under these circumstances, the lower court’s determination that the defendant’s failure to file a timely answer was “reasonably” excused is erroneous. <em>See, also, Carney v.
