The testimony also established that three of the males entered the store and two remained outside, up the street from the store, to act as “lookouts”. Mercier confessed to the police, without the assistance of counsel, that he was one of the individuals on the street acting as a lookout.

Bordner, </em><a href="/pa/432/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="432 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1919662" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0405-01">432 Pa. 405</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20612" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="247 A.2d 612">247 A. 2d 612</a> (1968), we held that the use of the office of a third party by the police was as much interrogation as if the questions were propounded by the police themselves. Given this background, in the recent case of <em>Commonwealth v. Hamilton, </em><a href="/pa/445/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="445 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="1939995" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0292-01">445 Pa. 292</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20172" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="285 A.2d 172">285 A. 2d 172</a> (1971), we dealt with a similar question in an analogous situation. In <em>Hamilton, </em>the accused was taken to a police station but was not administered the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. He was then confronted with two individuals who had previously confessed to the crimes therein involved, and these individuals accused Hamilton of being the triggerman in the crimes. Mr. Justice Pomeroy, speaking for the Court, held this procedure constitutionally invalid and a form of interrogation stating: “A person whose freedom is restrained and who is a suspect must first be apprised of his constitutional rights prior to the initiation of <em>any </em>form of official interrogation be it direct or conducted indirectly through the offices of a third party.” (Emphasis in original.) <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20172" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="285 A.2d 172">Id. at 297</a>, 285 A. 2d at 175.</p>

We refuse to distinguish between confronting the appellant directly with those <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>who implicate him and reading their statement to him, both have the same effect—both are a form of official interrogation. Consequently, reading the statement after appellant had exercised his <em>Miranda </em>rights was totally impermissible. Interrogation should have ceased once the appellant exercised his constitutional rights, and since we hold the reading of the statement of a third party to appellant was a form of interrogation, obviously interrogation did not cease. Hence, the police violated the mandate of <em>Miranda.</em>

    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[155,1168,1151,318]]]'>As we said in <em>Commonwealth v.

The only circumstance which distinguishes the instant case from that in <em>Nathan, supra, </em>is that here, appellant was permitted an opportunity to speak with his mother and his aunt prior to making his statement and indicating that he did not require a lawyer. We do not believe that this opportunity to talk to two lay people, albeit close family members, was sufficient. Appellant had indeed indicated his desire to avail himself of the services of an attorney before submitting to interrogation. What followed thereafter was all the result of the improper procedure of the police in confronting <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>Mm with the third party’s statement implicating him. For a waiver to be effective, the reversal of the defendant’s position must have been initiated by Mm. This is not a situation where a person in custody, after asserting his rights, indicated a desire to waive them without any further activity on the part of the police. Here, the police imtiated the chain of events which culminated in appellant’s inculpatory statement by, in effect, saying to him, after he had asserted his rights, “we have you now because we have a statement from another party wMch implicates you.” To hold that one in appellant’s situation made a knowing and intelligent waiver in such circumstances would be reaching too far to overcome the presumption against a waiver, wMch operates in favor of appellant.</p>

Upon being confronted with Washington’s statement, Mercier said nothing incriminating, but asked to converse privately with his mother and aunt. Permission was granted and the three conferred privately for approximately twenty minutes. Upon emerging from this conference and without anything further being said by the police, Mercier asked to be given a polygraph test. He was then again administered a full set of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, said he understood, but still desired the test. In response to the question, if he wanted a lawyer to be present he stated: “No, I asked the other detective for one, but I changed my mind. I want to tell you what happened without having a lawyer with me.” At this point, Mercier was allowed to again speak privately with his mother and aunt. At the conclusion of this second conference, which consumed at least ten minutes, the requested test proceeded.

It should also be noted there was no extensive period of questioning, no incommunicado incarceration, and no physical abuse, and it is undisputed Mercier was fully aware <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>of Ms rigMs. On these facts the waiver was certainly voluntary or at least it may not be ruled involuntary as a <em>matter of law. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.
