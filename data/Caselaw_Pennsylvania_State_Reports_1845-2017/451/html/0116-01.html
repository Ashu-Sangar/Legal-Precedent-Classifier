Prior prosecution testimony indicated that Ronald Bellan and George Johnson Avere in the company of the appellant at the time of the killing. Thus the witnesses were not strangers to the jury. Under such circumstances, the jury could reasonably have drawn inferences adverse to Bellan and Johnson and transferred these adverse inferences to the appellant. As stated by Professor Wigmore at 8 Wigmore, Evidence §2272, at 426 (McNaughton rev. 1961): “The layman’s natural first suggestion would probably be that the resort to privilege in each instance is a clear confession of crime.” Since the jury could reasonably have drawn inferences adverse to the appellant, the appellant was entitled to cross-examine the witnesses. This, of course, was impossible, because the witnesses invoked the Fifth Amendment. Once testi<a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>mony has been presented to a jury from which adverse inferences can be drawn, the appellant cannot be deprived of the opportunity to challenge those inferences in the jury’s mind. To so deprive the appellant is to effectively deprive him of his rights to confront the witnesses against him guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment which is applicable to state prosecutions. <em>Bruton v.

In this case the jury knew of an alleged crucial relationship between appellant and his co-indictees. There was clearly the danger that inferences adverse to the appellant would reasonably be drawn by the jury. Since the jury could reasonably have done so and the defendant was helpless to challenge the inferences, he was effectively deprived of his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment.</p>

In Greene the defendant wished to call a co-defendant to the stand knowing that the co-defendant would plead the Fifth Amendment. The defendant claimed that the co-defendant was the guilty party and desired the jury to hear the co-defendant plead the Fifth Amendment. The trial judge refused to allow the co-defendant to testify before the jury. On appeal, a divided court affirmed the trial judge’s decision holding that a jury may not draw any inference from a witness’ exercise of his constitutional rights. Although this Court was divided on whether the defense was entitled to have the jury draw inferences <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>adverse to the prosecution because a defense witness invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege, the Court was unanimous in stating that the jury could not be permitted to make inferences adverse to the defendant as the result of a prosecution witness’ invoking his privilege under the Fifth Amendment.

The possibility that the jury may have reasonably inferred an admission of guilt through a transfer process to the appellant is highly prejudicial. See <em>Bruton v.

Convictions should not be obtained with any suspicion of prosecutorial misconduct. In this case, the prosecution and the court knew that the co-indictees would invoke the Fifth Amendment. The witnesses should, therefore, not have been permitted to take the stand. The error was compounded when the witnesses were on the stand because the questioning did not cease after the first invocation of the Fifth Amendment. The questioning continued with a clear and deliberate attempt to plant in the jury’s mind, knowing that the Fifth Amendment would be invoked, evidence of an association between the witnesses and the appellant during the alleged time of the killing. A conviction obtained by the prosecution by the use of such “testimony” cannot be allowed to stand.

Counsel, however, although failing to object to Bellan’s testimony did object to Johnson’s testimony and stated that the calling of both co-indictees was prejudicial. If anything, it appears that counsel’s failure to object to <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>Bellan’s testimony was an oversight and not a deliberate choice.</p>
    <p id="b199-3" data-blocks='[["BL_199.4",199,[175,448,1147,915]]]'>In view of the extremely prejudicial nature of the testimony by the two co-indictees at the trial, we are unable to ascertain any reason why trial counsel failed to raise the issue in post-trial motions and in the direct appeal. In view of trial counsel’s objections and statements before Johnson’s testimony, it is obvious that trial counsel realized the prejudicial nature of the testimony by the co-indictees. Previous counsel’s failure to raise the issue could not possibly have had any reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interest and, therefore, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel denying appellant his constitutional right to assistance of counsel. Thus the issue was properly raised in the appellant’s PCHA petitions.
