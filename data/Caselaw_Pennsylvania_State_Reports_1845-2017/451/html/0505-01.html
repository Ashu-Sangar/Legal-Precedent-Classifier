In contrast, the petitioner was found guilty of first degree murder which carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (see f.n. 1, supra), and the trial judge followed the accepted practice of instructing the jury to fix a life sentence. In such a situation, a verdict of guilty is for all practical purposes equivalent to the sentencing, and the actual imposition of sentence is but a mere formality.

Having concluded that an adjudication of first degree murder is tantamount to sentencing since the element of doubt as to the sanction to be imposed is nonexistent, to grant an absolute right to bail for the most serious offense cognizable under our law exacting the most severe penalty and at the same time denying that right to individuals who have been convicted of certain lesser charges would create an anomoly completely indefensible in logic and reason. Consistency would demand that following a jury verdict of guilt of murder in the first degree bail must, at the <em>very least </em>be discretionary. However, after an analysis of all of the factors bearing upon this decision and a review of all the law in this Commonwealth related to the issue, we conclude that we must reject any attempt to vest this responsibility within the discretion of the trial court.</p>

    <p id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.5",588,[175,949,1159,805]]]'>While all of these factors are compelling before trial, they have little or no application once a conviction has been obtained. After conviction, the presumption of innocence has been overcome beyond a reasonable doubt and the chance that imprisonment will subsequently be shown to have been unwarranted is minimized. The potential for unjust imposition of a sanction or for the unnecessary expenditures of funds is lessened. The defendant’s need to marshall evidence in his defense is no longer a consideration. Bail at this stage only postpones the rehabilitative process which is our main concern when the adjudicatory stage has been completed. Thus, the considerations militating in favor of granting bail are significantly diminished by the completion of the trial in a verdict of guilt.</p>
    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.6",588,[179,1765,1156,588]]]'>In contrast, the countervailing public need to insure that the defendant will remain in custody increases greatly after conviction, and, when viewed in the context of one convicted of first degree murder, the public interest in detaining the convicted defendant becomes compelling. There are two aspects to that interest: (a) The protection of society in general; and (b) the risk that the defendant will flee and avoid sanction. See, e.g., <em>Leigh v. United States, </em><a href="/citations/?q=82%20S.%20Ct.%20994" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="82 S. Ct. 994">82 S.

      <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>One convicted of first degree murder has committed the most severe breach of the law of this Commonwealth and is therefore subject to our most severe penalty. To ignore the strong possibility of flight for one in such a position would be a blatant illustration of ignoring reality. To minimize the potential danger that his freedom would cause to society in general and to the witnesses who brought about his conviction in particular would be the height of judicial irresponsibility. The punishment of life imprisonment, which is mandatory, by its very nature renders a monetary bail ineffective and no responsible alternative condition of release has been suggested that can reasonably meet the problems his discharge from confinement would create.</p>

    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[158,1388,1151,978]]]'>While we are content to rest upon our holding that bail should be denied a person convicted of murder in the first degree during the disposition of post-trial motions, we cannot be unmindful of our responsibility to assure each prisoner a speedy trial and to provide a legal system which processes the matters before it with due dispatch. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Hamilton, </em><a href="/pa/449/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="449 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1945648" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0297-01">449 Pa. 297</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20127" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="297 A.2d 127">297 A. 2d 127</a> (1972). While our responsibility to provide a judicial system free of inordinate delay commands a high priority and we have become increasingly conscious of this interest in recent years, this goal alone would not justify the ignoring of the factors mentioned above that occasion our decision that bail should not be permitted for one convicted of first degree murder while awaiting disposition of post-trial motions. However, where there has been an unexplained and unreasonable delay between verdict and formal sentencing the matter is placed in a different posture.</p>
    <p id="b590-3" data-blocks='[["BL_590.4",590,[186,358,1157,643]]]'>
      <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>The controlling factor before verdict is the presumption of innocence and this principle forced us to conclude that bail should be granted as a matter of right. After verdict the presumption is no longer present and our main concern must be the protection of society and the immediate initiation of the rehabilitative process for the offender. Both of these objectives would mitigate against the allowance of bail. Where there has been an unreasonable delay caused by the Commonwealth and not contributed to by the defense, the conviction becomes suspect and the possibility of the innocence of the accused cannot then be ignored.</p>
    <p id="b590-4" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[187,1013,1158,686]]]'>We therefore feel constrained to add a proviso that will assure the disposition of these post-trial proceedings promptly and will avoid the possibility of persons languishing in jail for inordinate periods of time. In attempting to arrive at a reasonable time for the completion of these post-trial motions, we have considered the difficulties that are involved in complicated and protracted trials. We have attempted to take into account the workload of our judges and their staffs, the time consumed in the transcription of the testimony, the preparation of briefs and also to allow for reasonable opportunity for the court to consider the arguments and to render its decision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Hopefully, in those counties where the workload permits, the period between verdict and final sentencing will be much shorter. We therefore hold if post-trial proceedings in a case of first degree murder are not disposed of and the defendant is not sentenced within the stated four-month period, he may then apply for bail. If the trial judge is convinced at that juncture that the defendant neither caused nor consented to the delay, and is provided reasonable assurance against flight, bail may be granted.</p>
