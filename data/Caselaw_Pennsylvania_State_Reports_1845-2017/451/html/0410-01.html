Triangle is a closely held corporation, whose assets consist solely of radio stations WEEP and WEEP-FM in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

On or about August 14, 1968, Jack Harvey of Blackburn &amp; Go. arranged a meeting between Field and Jones in Pittsburgh for the evening of August 14, 1968. In advance of the meeting, Harvey prepared a typewritten letter agreement dated August 14, 1968, which he brought with him to the meeting. At the meeting the purchase of radio stations WEEP and WEEP-FM <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>by Field was discussed and during this discussion, various pen and ink changes were made by Harvey in the text of the typewritten letter agreement and the changes were initialled by Field and Jones. In the early morning hours of August 15, 1968, the parties visited the facilities of the radio stations and after viewing the premises, Field signed the letter and Jones signed the acceptance for the appellant.</p>

This letter also set forth guidelines as to five minimum requirements that would be satisfactory to Jones. Approximately two weeks later, Field submitted to the appellant the final corporate informa<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>tion with reference to the corporation he was willing to set up for the purpose of making the purchase. Finally, on November 1, 1968, Jones wrote to Field and stated that since Triangle’s minimum security safeguard had not been fulfilled, Triangle would not enter into a formal binding contract for the sale of the properties to Field or his proposed corporation.</p>

    <p id="b489-3" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[168,1031,1151,1107]]]'>An examination of the record before us discloses ample evidence from which the chancellor could properly have concluded that the parties intended the letter agreement of August 14, 1968 to be a binding contract. At trial it was clearly established that in the Spring of 1968, Triangle had engaged Blackburn &amp; Co. to obtain a purchaser for the radio stations. After another interested party made an offer below Jones’ original quotations and also imposed a contingency upon the offer, Blackburn &amp; Co.’s representative, Harvey, suggested that Jones meet with Field who had made three previous oral offers which were rejected in early August, 1968. Harvey’s testimony concerning the meeting shows that he called Field and said Jones would meet with him in Pittsburgh. Harvey further testified that he then advised Jones that Field was coming to Pittsburgh to meet with him on the basis that they would either make a deal or have no further discussions and Jones replied: “That’s fine. I would like to get it over with or not. I would like to wind it up tonight.”</p>

After inspecting the radio station facilities, the parties signed the letter agreement, carefully initialing every change. We agree with the chancellor’s conclusion that “[a]n examination of the document would indicate it embodied the essential terms to constitute a binding contract.

However, as stated above, we believe the chancellor had ample justification in concluding that the letter agreement itself, by its terms, formality and the extraordinary care in its execution, indicates that the signatories intended to bind themselves to an enforceable contract.</p>

However, from the record before us it is clear that Myron Jones did so agree and only after an extended discussion of the subject. An individual cannot subsequently contend that he is entitled to further security beyond what he originally agreed. As Mr. <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>Chief Justice [then Justice] Jones has stated in an analogous context: “The law demands of every man who bargains with another that he should do so only after due reflection of the possible consequences of his bargain and if he misjudges consequences that could have been expected by a reasonably intelligent man, he cannot rely on the law to remedy his fecklessness. Absent some legally recognized infringement of the law of contract by one party, the law will not reform a written contract so as to make a contract for the parties that they did not make between themselves and certainly never to rescue a party who did not reasonably foresee the consequences of his bargain.” <em>New Charter Coal Co. v. McKee, </em><a href="/pa/411/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="411 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="1885988" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0307-01">411 Pa. 307</a>, 312, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.2d%20830" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="191 A.2d 830">191 A. 2d 830</a>, 833 (1963). Furthermore, we agree with the chancellor that the agreement provides for adequate security. The value of the tangible assets is secured by a mortgage. The value of the intangible assets is secured by a pledge of the stock of the corporation which owns them. These terms are clearly those intended by the parties during armslength bargaining and we will not now allow one of the parties to complain.</p>

We do not believe that Article 2 of the UCC applies to the instant contract. Rather than being an agreement for the sale of “goods”, this is a contract for the sale of the businesses of two radio stations, including their tangible and intangible assets, as a going concern.

We believe that the nature of the transaction, the intention of the parties as reflected by the writing, and the lack of specific reference to designated assets renders inescapable the conclusion that the letter agreement was one integrated contract.</p>

First, this is not the situation contemplated under section 2-210 whereby a party contracts for performance by one individual, expecting him to perform, and thereafter discovers that a second individual, an assignee, will perform. As indicated by the chancellor below:</p>
    <p id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[155,1921,1150,214]],["BL_498.1",498,[185,344,1156,1111]]]'>“[T]he letter agreement makes it clear that the parties, at the time the <em>agreement was executed, knew Mr. Field was going to assign Ms rights. </em>The agreement states: ‘It is understood that the undersigned is <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>making this offer on behalf of a corporation, either in existence or to be formed, in which he is or will be a stockholder, and that the undersigned has the right to assign all of his rights and obligations under this offer to such corporation.’ Thus, the parties knew when the agreement was signed that Field was not going to be the performing party but that a corporation would perform. Moreover, the letter agreement specifically provided for the security which the assignee corporation was to provide. The last paragraph of the first page of the letter agreement states that the buyer’s note will be secured by a mortgage on all the assets delivered and the pledge of all of the stock of the newly formed acquiring corporation. Where an agreement, even for the ‘sale of goods’, expressly states the security which the assignee will provide, the seller cannot later contend that he is entitled to further security beyond what he originally agreed to. The letter agreement provides for adequate security which the plaintiff has always been willing to provide.” (Emphasis in original.)</p>

Briefly, appellant’s argument is as follows: The letter agreement of August 14, 1968 specifically referred to the transfer of seller’s FCC construction permit to increase the power of WEEP radio station to 50,000 watts and the purchase of Triangle’s 50 kilowatt transmitter. Subsequently, after this litigation commenced and pursuant to this permit appellant proceeded to construct a new 50 kilowatt facility. Since both parties agreed that the appellee was not entitled to gratuitously receive the newly constructed facility, the court below decreed specific performance of the remainder of the agreement without reference to the transmitter site. Appellant argues that this decree places the parties in an impossible situation because it results in a division of the two facilities and the licenses to operate them. This, Triangle submits, leaves it without an auxiliary transmitter and gives appellee a 50 kilowatt facility which he does not own.</p>
    <p id="b499-4" data-blocks='[["BL_499.5",499,[159,2101,1149,269]],["BL_500.1",500,[184,355,1157,381]]]'>We agree that the construction of the new transmission facility affects the value of the contract. However, construction of the facility was undertaken by Triangle with full knowledge that Field was seeking specific performance of the contract. In effect, after <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>unilaterally creating an expensive facility not covered by the agreement, Triangle is now alleging that an oppressive situation exists which makes specific performance inequitable. This Court will not refuse specific performance against a party who, by its own questionable conduct has attempted to make performance of the contract impossible.</p>
    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[181,746,1156,997]]]'>In determining that specific performance should be decreed, justice forces us to take into account the enhanced value of the bargain due to the new facility. Contrary to the lower court’s decree, we do not deem it proper to separate this transmitter from the rest of the stations’ assets since it is obvious that the 50 kilowatt transmitter is an integral part of radio station WEEP. However, rather than allowing appellee to gratuitously benefit from the improved facilities, we believe that the equities of the situation require that appellant be reimbursed for the cost of the new facility.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Therefore, the granting of specific performance as to the auxiliary transmitter is conditioned upon payment to Triangle of an amount equal to the actual expenses incurred in constructing the new 50 kilowatt facility.
