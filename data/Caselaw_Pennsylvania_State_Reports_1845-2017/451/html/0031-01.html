Upon discovering that the door was locked, they broke a window, but the intense smoke drove them back.

Yanoscsik, a Pennsylvania State Police Fire Marshal. He testified that the fire started in a cardboard box containing clothing, photographs and hair curlers, and that he found no positive signs of deliberate human intervention such as gasoline, kerosene or an incendiary device. However, he also testified that he could find nothing such as oil rags to indicate that the fire started by spontaneous combustion. There was no sign of an accident involving electrical wiring or a gas heater. The following colloquy ensued: <em>“Q. </em>Now, in your opinion, considering all the facts, was there human intervention involved in this fire? A. There had to be. Q. And why do you say that? A. Because fire doesn’t start by itself unless it is an accidental fire caused by electricity, lightning, spontaneous combustion. Q. You found no evidence—The Court : Let me ask you, not to interrupt, you say nothing to indicate an accidental fire, and nothing you tell me—you started to tell what an accident fire is. The Witness : The accidental fire is one that would be caused by an electrical short circuit, by spontaneous combustion by lightning. The Court: Suppose someone fell asleep while smoking, would that be an accidental fire? The Witness : Yes, sir. The Court: All right. Go ahead. You said there had to be human intervention. If someone fell asleep smoking, would that be human intervention? The Witness: Yes, but he didn’t mean to start the fire. He accidentally started—dropped a cigarette and started a fire. Q. All right. Now, through your investigation here and the investigation that continued, do you have <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>any opinion as to whether or not this fire was of incendiary origin and if so, what is it and explain what that means. The Court: I think if you can explain what you mean first by incendiary origin. The Witness: Incendiary origin of a fire means that the fire in no way was caused by any accidental means. It had to be started by some human being. By Mr. Wion : Q. And, indeed, purposedly started or set? A. That’s correct. Q. And again, in your opinion, was this fire of incendiary origin? A. It was.” On cross-examination, the trooper admitted that this fire could have been caused by a carelessly tossed cigarette or match.</p>
    <p id="b109-3" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[179,1006,1150,649]]]'>In addition to the trooper’s testimony, the Commonwealth produced circumstantial evidence which it claims tends to establish criminal agency. First, Larry Alleman testified that the door was nearly always unlocked when he returned from school, but that on this occasion the door had been locked. The lock on the door was the Yale type with a knob and a button on the inside of the door, thus making it unlikely that the door could be locked accidentally. Second, at approximately 3:10 p.xn., only twenty minutes before the fire was discovered, the wife of the owner of a nearby tavern saw the appellant leave the cabin, get in her car and drive away.</p>
