The opinion continued: “Unions obviously are concerned not to have union standards undermined by non-union shops. This interest penetrates into self-employer shops. On the other hand, some of our profoundest thinkers from Jefferson to Brandéis have stressed the importance to a democratic society of encouraging self-employer economic units as a counter-movement to what are deemed to be the dangers inherent in excessive concentration of economic power.” <a href="/us/339/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="339 U.S. 470" data-case-ids="362314" data-case-paths="/us/339/0470-01">339 U.S. at 475</a>.
