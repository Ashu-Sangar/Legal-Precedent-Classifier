There we held that, “where one with an insurable interest . . ., at the time of applying for a policy, advises the agent of the insurance company ... of the desired coverage and truthfully states to such agent the facts involved in the risk, and the agent, acting within his real or apparent authority and without actual or constructive knowledge of the applicant, fails to insert a requested provision, the insurer cannot set up such mistake in avoidance of the policy.” We, therefore, find ample authority from commentators and from the pronouncements of this court to support the principle that a party who knowingly causes a written instrument to fail to embody the intent of the other party is estopped from relying on <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>such, defect iu the instrument.

    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[212,563,1155,1163]]]'>It remains to determine whether this doctrine would justify relief under the facts alleged in the appellant’s complaint. We are satisfied that the complaint contains the elements of estoppel set forth in <em>GEGG v. Aetna, supra. </em>First, appellant alleged that it was the owner of the building. That allegation establishes that it has an insurable interest. Second, appellant alleged that the applicant, Publishing, disclosed to Marsh that appellant was the owner and Publishing was the lessee of the building. Marsh was thereby in possession of all of the facts relevant to the risk involved in insuring the building. Third, appellant alleged that Marsh knew that appellant was intended to be designated as the insured party, yet Marsh caused Publishing to be named as the insured party. Marsh therefore was advised of the desired coverage and failed to provide that coverage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Fourth, appellant alleged that Marsh was acting as broker and agent for Insurers in obtaining these policies. As we explain below, this allegation is sufficient to establish the liability of the Insurers on a theory of agency.</p>

Hanover Fire Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/364/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="364 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1223512" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0052-01">364 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.2d%20828" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="70 A.2d 828">70 A. 2d 828</a> (1950), refused to grant relief to a “total stranger” to an insurance policy. <em>Spires </em>does not demand such a result in the in-<a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>slant ease. In <em>Spires, </em>the plaintiffs leased an airplane hangar to tenants who, under the terms of the lease, were obligated to maintain fire insurance thereon. A fire destroyed the hangar, and when the tenants refused to make a claim, the plaintiffs sued the insurance company directly. We refused to grant relief because the plaintiffs were not referred to in the policy and the tenant and insurance company did not intend them to be third party beneficiaries. That is clearly different from the facts alleged here: Marsh knew that appellant was intended to be designated as the insured party and, but for the alleged mistake appellant would in fact have been a named party in the policy. The contracting parties in <em>Spires </em>never intended to create an obligation between the insurers and the plaintiffs. Here the converse is alleged and reformation is sought to effectuate that intent.</p>
    <p id="b235-3" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[164,1298,1149,267]]]'>The lower court also relied upon <em>Van Cor, Inc. v. American Casualty Co. of Reading, </em><a href="/pa/417/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="417 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1894047" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0408-01">417 Pa. 408</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20267" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="208 A.2d 267">208 A. 2d 267</a> (1965). This case merely affirms the rule that, in order for one to be a third party beneficiary, to a contract, <em>the </em>contracting parties must have so intended.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[161,1578,1152,716]]]'>The court below contended that our appellate courts have never granted relief to a “total stranger” to a written contract. <em>Bugen v. New York Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/408/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="408 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1308391" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0472-01">408 Pa. 472</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.2d%20499" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="184 A.2d 499">184 A. 2d 499</a> (1962) refutes this contention. There, while the plaintiff had been named as beneficiary in an earlier life insurance policy, she was not named in the policy upon which liability was predicated. She was granted reformation on the basis of mutual mistake. Where the gravamen of a complaint is the failure of an insurance company to name the plaintiff as a beneficiary, it would deprive the aggrieved party completely of relief to adopt the rule relied upon below.</p>
    <p id="b236-3" data-blocks='[["BL_236.4",236,[197,338,1161,1887]]]'>
      <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>As a minimum, a pleader must set forth concisely the facts upon which his cause of action is based. Such a requirement is reasonable because, where the complaint lacks facts which are crucial to recovery, it would be unjust to require the defendant to undergo the expense of a trial. <em>Vitro Manufacturing Co. v. Standard Chemical Co., </em><a href="/pa/291/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="291 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1107309" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0085-01">291 Pa. 85</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20615" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="139 A. 615">139 A. 615</a> (1927). On the other hand, where the crucial facts are in the exclusive knowledge of the defendant, and the plaintiff so pleads, he should be given considerable latitude. 1 Goodrich Amram, Standard Pennsylvania Practice §1019-1, at 105. While this complaint is far from a model of clarity, it does contain the elements necessary for reformation based upon a theory of estoppel. Marsh was on notice of the facts which it had to refute, and that is all that is required of a complaint. See, e.g., <em>Pottstown Daily News Publishing Co. v. Pottstown Broadcasting Co., </em><a href="/pa/411/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="411 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1885990" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0383-01">411 Pa. 383</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.2d%20657" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="192 A.2d 657">192 A. 2d 657</a> (1963). Of course, it may appear at trial that the appellant cannot produce clear and convincing evidence to prove his allegations, and, in such a case, reformation should be denied. <em>Easton v. Washington County Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/391/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="391 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="1276845" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0028-01">391 Pa. 28</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20332" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="137 A.2d 332">137 A. 2d 332</a> (1957). It also may appear, from <em>undisputed </em>facts established by pretrial discovery and affidavits, that appellees are entitled to summary judgment. See, Pa. R. C. P. 1035. The lower court sustained the appellees demurrers, however, and in that procedural posture, we must accept appellants allegations as true. <em>Borden et al. v. Baldwin et al., </em><a href="/pa/444/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="444 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="1938543" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0577-01">444 Pa. 577</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=281%20A.2d%20892" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="281 A.2d 892">281 A. 2d 892</a> (1971), <em>Cantonese v.

It alleges further that Marsh issued the policies to Publishing as agent for each of the Insurers. Finally, the policies themselves are attached to the preliminary objections and we may refer to them for purposes of deciding a demurrer. <em>Detweiler v.

Those policies contain the signatures of the individual employees of Marsh in the contract and their signatures appear as agents of Marsh, which in turn was an agent of the insurance companies. An averment of agency is a fact that is admitted for purposes of a demurrer rather than a conclusion of law. <em>Frazier v. Buskin, </em><a href="/pa-super/203/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="203 Pa. Super. 525" data-case-ids="767913" data-case-paths="/pa-super/203/0525-01">203 Pa.

        <em> </em>From the Insurers’ preliminary objections, it is apparent that the appellant notified the Insurers of its claim before they had made any settlement with Publishing. The Insurers chose to ignore this claim and to consummate the negotiations with Publishing rather than to use the vehicle of interpleader or declaratory judgment to ascertain their liability. See, Pa. R. C. P. 2301 et seq., and Act of June 18, 1923, P. L. 840, §1 et seq., 12 P.S. §831 et seq.</p>

It was the obligation of the appellees to allege and prove that the error in this case was so significant as to warrant the invocation of the theory of constructive knowledge.</p>
