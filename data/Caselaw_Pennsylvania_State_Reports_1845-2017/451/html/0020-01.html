While it may very well have been, as appellant suggests, the intention of his parents to dispose of the property in accordance with section 3 even though the order of death between them was not uncertain, it is equally as possible that it was their intention to allow the survivor to make the determination as to the distribution. Thus, the failure of the joint will to provide for the residue where there was a survivor may have been deliberate. It is not for us, at this juncture, to attempt to assign a motive to their actions. We must accept the will as written and under <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>these circumstances conclude that no provision, for whatever reason, was made for the disposition of a residue of the estate. We therefore hold that the will of the decedent did not contain a residuary bequest or devise and thus the property must pass in accordance with the Intestate Act of April 24,1947, P. L. 80, §1 et seq., as amended, 20 P.S. §1.1 et seq.</p>
    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[160,728,1149,1321]]]'>The second issue concerns the effect of the family agreement. The appellant contends that the agreement binds the signatories to the interpretation of the will he urges above. The agreement is, at best, ambiguous on this point. It directs the appellant, as executor, to pay each of the seven daughters $500.00, free and clear of all debts or taxes. There is no mention of the distribution of the residuary estate, although the agreement directs George, Jr. to probate the will. Family agreements are favored in law because they avoid devisive and unnecessary litigation. <em>Fry v.

Such agreements serve that purpose, however, only when they are clear and unambiguous. Braun<em>schweiger’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/322/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="322 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1167835" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0394-01">322 Pa. 394</a>, 397-398, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20753" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="185 A. 753">185 A. 753</a> (1936). Here, the agreement is silent on the most crucial point, the distribution of the residuary estate, and therefore, it cannot be interpreted to be an acceptance of the scheme of distribution outlined in section 3 of the will. The most logical interpretation of the agreement would be that it merely insures to each daughter a specific bequest of $500.00, free of inheritance tax and debts.</p>
    <p id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.6",99,[160,2072,1148,269]],["BL_100.1",100,[201,334,1158,932]]]'>Even if we could accept the interpretation urged by the appellant, the agreement is void because it does not bind all of the daughters.

Although he concedes that the non-signing sister, Mrs. Franzini, should receive her intestate share, the appellant argues that the signing sisters nevertheless should be bound by the agreement to receive only $500.00. Such a result would distort the clear terms of the agreement. Paragraph 3 directs George, Jr. to pay <em>each </em>of the seven daughters $500.00. We will not presume that the daughters who signed this agreement intended to bind themselves regardless of the share of the estate going to other sisters. The only fair interpretation of this agreement is that the sisters signed with the understanding that each sister would receive $500.00. We will not distort the agreement by awarding one sister her intestate share while binding the remaining sisters to a maximum of $500.00.</p>
