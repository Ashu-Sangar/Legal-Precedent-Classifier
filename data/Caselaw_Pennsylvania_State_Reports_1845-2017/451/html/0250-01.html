      <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>The last assignment of error is that the court below erred in allowing the fact-finder to hear the content of the statement which was suppressed. The essence of this objection was directed at the fact that the trial judge also presided during the Suppression Hearing. It is now suggested that this was unduly prejudicial to the appellant since although the confession had been ordered to be suppressed, the trial judge who sat as the finder of fact, was aware of its contents. The record reflects that there was no request that the trial judge disqualify himself for this reason or any other. Further, the appellant did not choose to be tried by a jury which would have eliminated his present complaint. It is clear that as a matter of trial strategy, the appellant chose to proceed with the same judge at trial who had presided and ruled in his favor during the Suppression Hearing. He cannot now be heard to complain. See <em>Commonwealth v. Corbin, </em><a href="/pa/447/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="447 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="1942954" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0463-01">447 Pa. 463</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=291%20A.2d%20307" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="291 A.2d 307">291 A. 2d 307</a> (1972); Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

The better practice in a multi-judge county would be to have the trial conducted by someone other than the judge who presided over the Suppression Proceedings particularly where there is a waiver of jury accepted. <em>Commonwealth v. Corbin, </em>supra. See, <em>Levin, Exclusionary Rules in Nonjury Criminal Cases, </em>119 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 905, 918-919 (1971). Here, however, the defense clearly chose to proceed in this manner as a matter of trial strategy, he is not entitled to relief because of his dissatisfaction with the result.</p>

The record, however, showed that during the brief life span of the child, there had been no manifestations of epilepsy.</p>
