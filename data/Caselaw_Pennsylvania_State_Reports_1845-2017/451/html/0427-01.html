      <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>As early as <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/351/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="351 U.S. 12" data-case-ids="1105068" data-case-paths="/us/351/0012-01">351 U.S. 12</a> (1956), the United States Supreme Court indicated its concern with respect to discrimination caused by those unable to meet the expenses of litigation. In holding that the equal protection clause required that an indigent defendant in a criminal case was entitled to be furnished the trial transcript at public expense, the Court stated “there can be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has.” <a href="/us/351/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="351 U.S. 12" data-case-ids="1105068" data-case-paths="/us/351/0012-01">351 U.S. at 19</a>. Eecent decisions of the Supreme Court have unquestionably demonstrated that the desire to eliminate inequities in the criminal process caused by indigency has if anything heightened rather than diminished. As noted in <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/399/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="399 U.S. 235" data-case-ids="6169466" data-case-paths="/us/399/0235-01">399 U.S. 235</a> (1970) : “Subsequent decisions of this Court have pointedly demonstrated that the passage of time has heightened rather than weakened the attempts to mitigate the disparate treatment of indigents in the criminal process.” <a href="/us/399/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="399 U.S. 235" data-case-ids="6169466" data-case-paths="/us/399/0235-01">399 U.S. at 241</a> (footnote omitted). In <em>Williams </em>the Court determined that where the State had “defined the outer limits of incarceration necessary to satisfy its penological interests and poEcies, it may not then subject a certain class of convicted defendants to a period of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum solely by reason of their indigency.” <a href="/us/399/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="399 U.S. 235" data-case-ids="6169466" data-case-paths="/us/399/0235-01">399 U.S. at 242</a>. The Court therefore held that a State may not constitutionally imprison beyond the maximum sentence fixed by statute a defendant who is financially unable to pay a fine. In <em>Morris v. Schoonfield, </em><a href="/us/399/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="399 U.S. 508" data-case-ids="6170226" data-case-paths="/us/399/0508-01">399 U.S. 508</a> (1970), four members of the Court in a concurring opinion stated that “the same constitutional defect condemned in Williams also inheres in jailing an indigent for failing to make immediate payment of any fine, whether or not the fíne is accompanied by a jail term and whether or not the jail term of the indigent extends beyond the maximum term that may be <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>imposed on a person willing and able to pay a fine.” 399 U.S. at 509. In <em>Tate v.

Nor is our decision to be understood as precluding imprisonment as an enforcement method when alternative means are unsuccessful despite the defendant’s reasonable efforts to satisfy the fines by those means. . . .” <a href="/us/401/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="401 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="11712570" data-case-paths="/us/401/0395-01">401 U.S. at 400-01</a>.</p>

In the cases before us there was no determination of immediate ability to meet the mandates that had been imposed, nor was there a showing that a reasonable opportunity had been given to allow the appellants to comply without immediate incarceration. We believe that the Supreme Court has made it plain that a defendant may not be incarcerated merely because he cannot make full payment of a fine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> There<a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>fore, we hold that the appellants must be given the opportunity to establish that they are unable to pay the fine.

L. 872, §506, <em>as miended, </em>18 P.S. §4506. This act in pertinent part provides: “Any man charged by an unmarried woman with being the father of her bastard child, shall be the reputed father and if she persists in the charge in the time of her extremity of labor, or afterwards in open court, the same shall be given in evidence in order to convict such person of fornication. Such man, being thereof convicted, shall be sentenced, in addition to the fine aforesaid, to pay the expenses incurred at the birth of such child, and if such child is born dead or shall die during the continuance of the order for the maintenance of said child, to also pay the reasonable funeral expenses thereof, and to give security, by one or more sureties, and in such sum as the court shall direct, to the institution district where such child was born, to perform such order for the maintenance of the said child, as the court shall direct.” If Root’s imprisonment had resulted because of his failure immediately to pay a fine imposed under this section, clearly the considerations discussed above would be fully applicable. A somewhat different situation is presented here because the amount to be paid represented the lying-in expenses, support from the <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>time of birth to the date of the order,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> and the costs of prosecution.</p>
    <p id="b509-3" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[165,456,1149,1109]]]'>Admitting that the origin of the obligation is not a fine, we nevertheless believe the same considerations which motivated the Supreme Court in <em>Tate, </em>would necessarily require the same result in this instance. There is no basis in logic or law to permit a person who is fined for his wrongdoing to escape immediate imprisonment because of indigency and yet ignore the financial status of one who has incurred legal obligations through illicit conduct. The absurdity of such a distinction is graphically demonstrated when we consider that the imposition of a fine serves <em>only </em>the end of punishment, whereas an order to pay expenses incurred, although having punitive overtones, is primarily imposed to reimburse those costs that resulted from the individual’s acts. There is obviously more reason in the latter instance to afford a reasonable opportunity for payment than the former. To impose this obligation without consideration of defendant’s financial ability to pay, completely frustrates the pui'pose which this section of The Penal Code is designed to achieve.</p>

    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.6",510,[184,411,1155,477]]]'>Initially, I voice my objection to this Court assuming jurisdiction of this appeal. Jurisdiction is clearly in the Superior Court (see Appellate Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, Art. Ill, §302, 17 P.S. §211.302, Supp. 1972-73), and I am not persuaded the appeal presents an issue of such <em>immediate public importance </em>as to warrant us permitting the bypassing of the court wherein initial appellate jurisdiction lies.</p>
    <p id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.7",510,[184,906,1155,437]]]'>As far as the merits of the appeal are concerned, I join in the order remanding the cases to the trial court for more studied consideration. However, I think it should be clearly understood that our action today does not preclude the trial court from imprisoning the appellants as an enforcement method if, after reasonable opportunity, the appellants refuse, neglect or are unable to comply with the orders of the court.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b510-6" data-blocks='[["BL_510.8",510,[186,1355,1150,99]]]'>Mr. Chief Justice Jones, Mr. Justice O’Brien and Mr. Justice Pomeroy join in this concurring opinion.</p>
