The facts surrounding the killing indicated to the police that it was probably a “gang” slaying, involving two gangs in the neighborhood—the 28th and Oxford Gang and the 28th and Montgomery Gang. Appellant, a member of the 28th and Oxford Gang, was awakened from his sleep and taken to the police station at some time between 3:3Q and 4:00 in the morning. Apparently appellant was one of several people picked up in connection with the killing, presumably because of his membership in a gang which was thought to be involved. There was no probable cause for the arrest. In fact, in the words of the officer involved, there was no arrest. Appellant was merely “picked up for investigation.”</p>

Where did you arrest him, Officer? A. I did not actually arrest him. Upon information received from the Homicide Division, I went to his home to see if he was home. If he was home, I was to send him <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>down to the Homicide Division so that they could talk to him. He was merely picked up by myself as the result of a memorandum from the Homicide Investigation. He was to be picked up for investigation. Q. You did not arrest him? A. No, sir. Q. You did not have a warrant? A. No, sir.”</p>
    <p id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[237,685,1156,492]]]'>Within one hour after his arrival at the police station, after being given the proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the appellant orally confessed to the crime and stated that he had given the gun he used in the killing to Samuel Winns, a fellow gang member. As a result of this information Winns was picked up and a search warrant was obtained for Winn’s residence. A search of this residence led to the discovery of the murder weapon.</p>

The previous trial began on October 14,1970. The jury retired to deliberate on October 20, 1970, and deliberated through October 23,1970, at which time the jury announced that it could not agree on a verdict. The trial judge, observing the deadlock and that two jurors were ill and a third juror was pregnant and required medical attention, declared a mistrial. It is agreed that both <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>the attorney for the Commonwealth and counsel for appellant acquiesced to the mistrial.

    <p id="b473-5" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[201,1850,1148,323]]]'>Considering the facts of the instant case, where the jury declared themselves hopelessly deadlocked after twenty-four hours of deliberation over a three-day period and three of the jurors required medical attention, the court was correct in its declaration of a mistrial for reasons of “manifest necessity.”</p>

However, the alternate jurors, <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>as is customary, were discharged after the conclusion of the court’s final charge, and were no longer part of the case.</p>
    <p id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[152,516,1157,423]]]'>Appellant, in addition to arguing that the rule of “manifest necessity” was not met, also argues that it was improper for the court to declare a mistrial without his consent. Appellant’s brief indicates that his trial counsel acquiesced the declaration of a mistrial. As we indicate herein, the declaration of a mistrial for reasons of a hung jury does not require the acquiescence of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[151,959,1158,658]]]'>Appellant seems to be confusing the situation where a mistrial is declared under Rule 1118 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, <em>Commonwealth v.

Rule 1118 applies only to situations where a mistrial is declared due to a prejudicial event occurring at trial. Rule 1118 states: “(b) A motion to declare a mistrial shall be made when the <em>prejudicial event </em>is disclosed. In all cases only the defendant or attorney for the defendant may move for a mistrial.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.7",474,[148,1630,1156,717]]]'>This rule covers only those situations where an event which is prejudicial to the defendant occurs. It does not deal with the situation of a hung jury. If Rule 1118 were the sole means to declare a mistrial and the defendant did not move for a mistrial, the jury would be forced to reach a verdict after they had stated that they were deadlocked, with the possibility that a lone juror, who was in opposition to the majority, would ultimately be coerced into voting with the majority just to bring an end to the deliberation. Such a possibility would fly in the face of our Anglo-American system of jurisprudence. See also <em>Commonwealth v.

Fingerprints were then taken of the people arrested and matched with those at the scene of the crime. At Davis’ trial, the fingerprints were introduced. The Supreme Court, in reversing Davis’ conviction, speaking about mass arrest situations without probable cause, stated: “Nothing is more clear than that the Fourth Amendment was meant to prevent wholesale intrusions upon the personal security of our citizenry, whether those intrusions be termed ‘arrests’ or investigatory detentions.” At pp. 726, 727. See <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Wong Sun, </em>federal agents illegally arrested a man named Toy in his bedroom and immediately after his arrest he gave incriminating statements. The Supreme Court, speaking about those statements of Toy, said: “The Government argues that Toy’s statements to the officers in his bedroom, although closely consequent upon the invasion which we hold unlawful, were nevertheless admissible because they resulted from ‘an intervening independent act of a free will.’ This contention, however, takes insufficient account of the circumstances. Six or seven officers had broken the door and followed on Toy’s heels into'the bedroom where his wife and child were sleeping. He had been almost immediately handcuffed and arrested. Under such circumstances it is unreasonable to infer that Toy’s response was sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion.” Page 486.</p>

Under those circumstances, the Commonwealth was able to persuade us that the confession was free of the coerciveness inherent in the unlawful arrest. However, in the instant case, appellant’s confession followed soon after the illegal arrest and the Commonwealth is unable to persuade us that it had any other evidence which would have led to a lawful arrest of appellant and a lawful confession.</p>
