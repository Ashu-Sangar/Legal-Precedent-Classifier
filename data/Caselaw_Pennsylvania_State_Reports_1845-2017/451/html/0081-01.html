Rather than arguing that the length of deliberation caused a coerced verdict of guilty, appellant is arguing that the trial judge coerced the jury’s verdict by continually <em>withdrawing </em>from them their right to deliberate. We find this somewhat unique argument to be totally without merit. In <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant contends that these photographs were irrelevant in a felony murder case, and that any evidentiary value they might have had was outweighed by the “likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors.” <em>Commonwealth v.

On this theory these photographs were admissible to show the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body in order to infer an intent to kill. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Moore, </em><a href="/pa/398/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="398 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1289167" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0198-01">398 Pa. 198</a>, 202-03, <a href="/citations/?q=157%20A.2d%2065" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="157 A.2d 65">157 A. 2d 65</a>, 68 (1959) and cases cited therein.

They argue that it was necessary for the Commonwealth to establish the use of a deadly weapon on a vital portion of the body and that the pictures served this purpose. The record, however, reveals that the Commonwealth had also introduced the testimony of Dr. Catherman, the pathologist who performed the autopsy; Sharon Kerzner, a laboratory technician; Officer Ashmore, the first officer to arrive at the scene; and Ernest Sewell, the co-defendant. Each of these witnesses testified as to the nature of the injuries and the condition of the bodies. The pictures, at best, were cumulative as to this issue. In addition, there was no serious contradiction by the defense either <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>as to the nature of the wounds or the cause of death, While I agree that there may be instances where pictures should be permitted to aid in establishing a specific intent to kill, this case was not one where there was a need to risk the possible prejudice inherent in the exhibit.</p>
