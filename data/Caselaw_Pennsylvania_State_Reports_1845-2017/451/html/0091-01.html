Letters testamentary were granted to Elizabeth Snyder, appellant. Thereafter, the executrix filed her final account. That account was confirmed and a final decree of distribution entered on May 31,1971. No exceptions were taken to the adjudication.</p>

      <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>On November 24, 1971, over seven months after the decree of distribution, appellant filed a petition to set aside the adjudication so that she could file a claim for $7,500. This amount, she claimed, was due her as a result of loans purportedly made to decedent in 1965. This claim was not asserted at any time during the administration of the estate and does not appear in the statement of debts and deductions nor in the final account. Appellant, who was present at the audit and was represented by counsel in her fiduciary capacity, neither informed the court of this claim at audit nor filed exceptions to her account or the adjudication.</p>

Our review of the record, however, reveals that the chancellor properly determined that “the reasons offered in support of the petitioner’s request are without legal or equitable merit, and that the facts and circumstances here present neither justify nor warrant the granting of the requested relief.” Finding no abuse of discretion, or error of law, we affirm.</p>
