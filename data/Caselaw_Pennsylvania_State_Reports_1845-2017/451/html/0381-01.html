Two days later, appellant, George Betrand, a juvenile, known to the police as “Primo”, was arrested without a warrant. He was taken immediately to the station house and placed in a locked interrogation room where he remained for approximately two hours. A detective subsequently arrived and advised him of his rights by reading from the standard police interrogation card. After approximately one-half hour of questioning, appellant gave an oral statement admitting his involvement in the robbery.</p>

    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.5",460,[178,1279,1157,702]]]'>Applying the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>standards here it is patently clear that the informant’s tip, the <em>sole basis </em>for appellant’s arrest, was insufficient to establish probable cause. First, the tip came from an unidentified informant, who supplied no indication that he had any personal knowledge of the crime whatsoever. His information was completely conclusory with no underlying facts or circumstances to bolster his report. The anonymous caller merely told the police that the suspect’s name was “Primo” and indicated where “Primo” lived—nothing more. Thus the first requirement of Agmlar-Spinelli—underlying circumstances supporting an informant’s conclusion—was clearly absent here.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b461-4" data-blocks='[["BL_461.6",461,[179,624,1150,811]]]'>The Commonwealth urges that probable cause was established here because the “anonymous telephone call contained significant <em>inner indicia </em>of reliability, important details of which were corroborated by the arresting officers’ own knowledge.” Apparently the Commonwealth is contending that the informant was <em>inherently </em>reliable since he was an “anonymous citizen-informant” who was “too scared” to reveal his identity to the police. Such an informant, argues the Commonwealth, is more reliable than “the typical stoolie”. However, the Commonwealth here engages in sheer conjecture, as it admittedly has no evidence that the unknown informant was either a “typical stoolie” or a “citizen-informant”. It thus has absolutely no indication of the informant’s reliability.</p>
