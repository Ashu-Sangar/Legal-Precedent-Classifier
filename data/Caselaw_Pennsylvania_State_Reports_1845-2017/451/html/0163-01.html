After the occurrence Daniels went outside, flagged down a passing police vehicle, led the police to where Kellam and Wilson both lay prostrate, admitted he stabbed them and produced the knife he used in the attack. Upon being taken to a hospital, Kellam was immediately pronounced dead. Wilson died from his wounds on February 4th.</p>

He urges the trial evidence fails to support the convictions, and hence, the trial court erred in not sustaining a motion to arrest the judgments, or, even if the contrary is true, a new trial should have been awarded because of the evidentiary use at trial of a recorded incriminating statement he made to the police in the absence of a knowing and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights.

For example, see <em>Commonwealth v.

On the contrary, we have emphasized that all of the circumstances must be considered in determining if a knowing and intelligent waiver was effected. After carefully considering the instant record, we are not convinced the trial court committed an error of law in finding that Daniels fully understood his rights at the time involved, and with this understanding freely chose to waive them.</p>

Daniels denied the debt, told the men to leave and closed the door; three or five minutes later there was another knock or kicking on the door and Daniels went to the kitchen and placed a butcher knife in one of his pockets; when he opened the door Daniels was again confronted by the same four men, but this time Kellam did most of the talking; when Daniels again denied the debt, Kellam invited him outside; Kellam then drew his hand back and Daniels observed “something like brass knuckles on his hand with a fork sticking out;”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Daniels kicked Kellam and he fell down a nearby stairs; Kellam then started back up the stairs and Daniels “met him halfway”; Daniels pulled the knife and stabbed Kellam and the latter fell down; when Kellam tried to get up Daniels stabbed him again; Daniels then ascended the stairs and upon finding Wilson standing in the doorway of his apartment he stabbed Mm in the chest; Wilson then ran down a hallway and Daniels ran behind him and stabbed him in the back.</p>

The following conditions must be satisfied before one can successfully invoke tbe defense of self-defense: (1) the slayer must bave been free from fault in provoking or continuing tbe difficulty which resulted in tbe killing; (2) tbe slayer must bave reasonably believed that be was in imminent danger of death, great bodily barm, or some felony, and that there was a necessity to kill in order to save himself therefrom; (3) tbe slayer must not bave violated any duty to retreat or avoid tbe danger. <em>Commonwealth v.

Tbe record is unclear as to bow many steps Kellam fell, but assuming be fell to tbe described landing be was not far removed from Daniels at any relevant time. When Kellam started up tbe stairs again brandishing a bent fork, Daniels certainly bad reasonable grounds to believe be was in imminent danger of death or great bodily barm, and since be was in bis own dwelling bouse, there was no duty to retreat. Where a man is dangerously assaulted or feloniously attacked in bis own dwelling bouse by one not a member of bis household, be need not retreat, but may stand bis ground and meet deadly force with deadly force to save bis own life, or to protect himself from great bodily harm. <em>Commonwealth v.

Wilkes, </em>supra), this burden does not exist where the Commonwealth’s own evidence establishes the killing was excusable. When this occurs, as it did in the instant case insofar as the Kellam killing is concerned, the Commonwealth has then failed to establish a felonious homicide beyond a reasonable doubt, which it must do before the accused may be convicted of even voluntary manslaughter. <em>Commonwealth v.

While Daniels lacked culpability in provoking the fight, he was the one responsible for continuing it once Wilson began to flee.

Here once Wilson attempted to flee<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> from Daniels and the latter continued the altercation by pursuing him, Daniels then became the aggressor and was not acting in self-defense.</p>

The murdered man and the defendant lived in a boarding house. Their rooms were on different floors. The affray started in the defendant’s room. The two men separated, and the defendant’s victim went downstairs. At the foot of the stairs he turned and went back. <em>The defendant, instead of talcing shelter in his own room, remained on the landing of the stairway. </em>The fight was renewed, and the murder followed. It was with reference to that situation that the court said that the defendant was under a duty to avoid the encounter. <em>He had only to enter his own room mid he would have teen safe. </em>The court did not hold that it was his duty to abandon his home and take refuge in the streets.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

Were we to agree, as I am satisfied we should, that one faced with an assault of deadly force while in an apartment hallway must retreat to his own apartment (if by doing so he could reduce the risk to his own life), then obviously appellant here could not establish self-defense in rushing in an aggressive manner from a no-retreat area (doorway of an apartment) <em>into </em>a retreat area.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

They leave the first time, but return shortly thereafter. Appellant, who had several visitors in his apartment, reasonably stepped into the hall rather than expose his visitors to the four aggressive intruders. One of them brandishes a dangerous weapon, another came at the appellant. In the course of the entire episode, appellant stabs two of the men. Under the majority’s view the four men should have been individually checked and searched by the appellant before he moved against any of them. An episode, such as that which occurred in this case, cannot be broken up. At the time appellant stabbed Wilson, two of the group of four men were still in the hallway outside appellant’s apartment. What was the appellant to do when a second man came at him after he had already found it necessary, in self-defense, to stab the first man? He could hardly have been expected to leave the second man alone while there were still present in the hallway the third and fourth members of the gang. How would the appellant know what these two men would do, or what weapons they had? The majority analyzes the factual situation as though there were four unrelated aggressors. There was actually one single aggressor which can fairly be called a gang and as long as the gang was threatening, the appellant had a right to defend himself.</p>
