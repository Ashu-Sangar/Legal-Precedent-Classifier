No pretrial motion to suppress evidence was filed; however, at trial, the court permitted appellant’s retained counsel to file an oral motion to suppress the narcotics (seized pursuant to a warrant). This motion, after an evidentiary hearing, was denied. Thereafter, on March 19, 1969, appellant was found guilty, as charged, by the court, sitting without a jury. On June 23, 1969, appellant was sentenced to serve a two-four year term of imprisonment. No post-trial motions were filed and no appeal taken.</p>

(1965) 1580, §§1 et seq., 19 P.S. §§1180-1 et seq. (Supp. 1972), alleging (1) the use of illegally seized evidence at trial; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel and; (3) an obstruction of his appellate rights. An evidentiary hearing was held on January 7, 1971, at which time appellant was represented by appointed counsel. On January 20, 1971, appellant’s petition was denied. An appeal to the Superior Court resulted in an opinionless per curiam order of affirmance. This Court granted allocatur and we now affirm.</p>
    <p id="b394-6" data-blocks='[["BL_394.9",394,[174,1707,1154,416]]]'>Appellant here contends that the PCHA (Post Conviction Hearing Act) court erred in two respects; (1) by finding that probable cause existed to sustain the issuance of the search warrant, and (2) by finding that the issue had been waived, since appellant knowingly and intelligently failed to take a direct appeal.

Despite this notice, and the trial court’s post-sentencing <em>Douglas </em>advisement, given more than two months later, appellant made no further effort to pursue his appellate rights, or contact counsel, until some fifteen months later, when the instant PCHA petition was filed.</p>

Appellant concedes that counsel did challenge the existence of probable cause, including the oral sworn testimony submitted to the magistrate as a supplement to the written affidavit. The PCHA court was correct in its finding that appellant’s counsel was not ineffective at trial.</p>
      <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.2",395,[183,793,1154,671]]]'>Appellant’s first contention obviously has no merit, since the trial court, waiving the time requirement embodied in Pa. R. Crim. P. 323(b) (motion to suppress must be filed at least 10 days prior to trial), permitted a suppression hearing to be conducted at trial. Appellant has alleged no prejudice from the utilization of this procedure. Rather, appellant advances the unsupported contention that because counsel did not see the search warrant, or the affidavit in support thereof, until a few minutes prior to trial, insufficient time remained for counsel to conduct a proper and complete investigation. No allegation is made as to how this shortness of time hampered counsel in his representation of appellant. As this Court has repeatedly held, “. . . shortness of time per se in the preparation of a defense does not [standing alone] constitute ineffective assistance.” <em>Commonwealth v. Hill, </em><a href="/pa/450/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="450 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1947073" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0477-01">450 Pa. 477</a>, 481, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="301 A.2d 587">301 A. 2d 587</a>, 590 (1973), and the eases cited therein.</p>
      <p id="b395-6" data-blocks='[["BL_395.3",395,[184,1480,1150,577]]]'>Appellant’s second complaint as to counsel’s ineffectiveness is equally devoid of merit. It is clear, from the record, that counsel’s decision not to attack the specificity of the warrant and reasonableness (scope) of the search had a “reasonable basis” and was “designed to effectuate his [client’s] best interest.” <em>Commonwealth v. Hill, </em>supra at 479, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="301 A.2d 587">301 A. 2d at 590</a>. On the face of the warrant, the place and person to be searched, and things [narcotics] to be seized, were set out with clarity. An attack on this issue would obviously have been futile. As to counsel’s decision not to question the scope of the search, this too was eminently reasonable. The objects seized (38 packets of heroin) were found on appellant’s possession, a “place” and “person” obviously within the scope of the warrant.</p>
      <p id="b395-7" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[182,2073,1150,307]]]'>We therefore conclude that counsel’s tactical decision to attack only the lack of probable cause was reasonable. “[0]ur inquiry ceases and counsel’s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had <em>some reasonable basis </em>designed to effectuate his client’s interests.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
