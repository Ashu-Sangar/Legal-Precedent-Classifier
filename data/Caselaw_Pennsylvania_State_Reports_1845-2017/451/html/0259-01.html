Downey, was involved in an automobile accident with cars driven by defendants Elva Weston and Samuel M. Edelson. In July of 1967 appellant brought this action in trespass against defendants in Montgomery County. The matter was tried to a jury over a period of eight days and a verdict was returned for plaintiff in, the amount of f15,455. Unsatisfied with that figure, plaintiff filed a motion for new trial which was denied by the court below. Erom the judgment entered following that denial the plaintiff brings this appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Some months later Downey began to experience pain in his neck and shoulders, pain which soon radiated to his legs. Within a year after the accident, appellant began to lose strength in his arms and legs and experienced difficulty in performing his daily task of milk delivery. On November 4, 1967 Downey suffered a fall at work that precipitated his early retirement from employment. Subsequently appellant’s condition was diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sometimes herein “ALS”), a relatively rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive deterioration and death of nerve cells located in the spinal column. As the nerve cells die, muscular stimulation is impeded and ultimately <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>blocked altogether; atrophy and paralysis ensue. At the time of trial, appellant was almost totally paralyzed and had a life expectancy of four years.</p>
    <p id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[177,510,1157,854]]]'>The chief issue at trial was that of causation, i.e., whether Downey’s amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was caused by the trauma he received in the automobile collision with defendants. Plaintiff produced medical experts who testified to their belief that trauma can and in this case did cause the disease. Defendants on the other hand produced experts whose opinion it was that trauma is not a causative factor in the onset of the disease. It is appellant’s theory on this appeal (shared by appellees) that “[i]n returning its verdict of $15,000, the jury obviously was compensating Mr. Downey only for injuries other than his condition of mixed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The jury did not accept the contention . . . that plaintiff’s condition . . . was caused by the trauma involved in the accident of March 30, 1965.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The doctor admitted that he had spoken in the living room of his home with that attorney on the eve of the trial and had allowed him to examine a medical file compiled during Downey’s earlier consultation in Dr. Brady’s office. With that much established, plaintiff’s counsel then undertook to show by further cross-examination of Dr. Brady that such pretrial disclosure of plaintiff’s medical records without Downey’s permission and out of his presence violated the Hippocratic Oath and the Principles of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> After objection by defense counsel, however, the court barred this line of cross-examination.</p>

The issue in the case, as appellant points out, was one of causation: did or did not appellant’s sclerosis result from the trauma he had sustained? In support of this theory that it did, appellant produced the testimony of three medical experts. In opposition to that theory, the defense likewise called three medical experts. In all, the record contains hundreds of pages of testimony by these six expert witnesses, virtually all of which is devoted to the question of causation and all of which conclusively demonstrates hut one fact: the best minds of medical <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>science are nowise in agreement as to the etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

It is true that a sizeable portion of Dr. O’Neill’s testimony related to “various and sundry colds and respiratory infections.” Plaintiff, however, had stated that he had had “no [health] problems whatsoever.” We cannot say as a matter of law that the verity of a statement so sweeping is not affected by proof that the person making it has in fact been afflicted with the “various and sundry colds” of the ordinary person.</p>

Defendants had a twofold purpose in introducing evidence of this fall in 1967. First, they sought to show that Downey had suffered a trauma over two years <em>after </em>the date of the automobile accident in which defendants were involved; second, they sought to show that Downey himself at the time attributed the fall to “wet leaves” and not to the earlier automobile accident and that he had filed a claim for workmen’s compensation. All parties, the court included, were evidently in agreement that while it was arguable that the <em>application </em>for such benefits might be relevant as an admission of the plaintiff, the <em>receipt </em>of such benefits would be inadmissible as a violation of our decision in <em>Boudwin v.

Nonetheless, the testimony at trial with regard to the subject of workmen’s compensation was as follows: “Q. As a result of that [fall] was this accident reported to any Workmen’s Compensation? ... A. It was a report for Workmen’s Compensation. By Mb. Natjlty: Q. And as a result of that accident do you know of your own knowledge how long <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>Mr. Downey <em>received </em>Workmen’s Compensation benefits? A. Until approximately the middle of February of 1968, when they were discontinued.” It is clear that, notwithstanding his offer at sidebar to show only the application for benefits, defense counsel went further and proceeded to make inquiry about receipt of benefits. While we find it unnecessary to discuss the relevance of an application for benefits, we think it clear that to allow testimony of receipt of collateral benefits during the same period in which plaintiff sought damages from defendants was error under the decision in <em>Bouchoin. </em>Unlike <em>Boudwin, </em>however, we think the error here was harmless.</p>

Downey was first said to be suffering from ALS in the year 1967. According to his theory, the fall in November, 1967 was caused by Ms developing sclerosis and that sclerosis was in turn caused by the automobile accident in March, 1965. Thus, the period during which Downey received workmen’s compensation benefits of unspecified amounts (November, 1967 — February, 1968) was not a period in which Downey would be entitled to damages from defendants here <em>unless </em>the jury accepted his theory of causation; this, however, it admittedly did not do. Additionally we doubt that plaintiff’s claim to compensation for loss of future earning capacity for a period of sixteen years (192 months) could have been prejudiced by the jury’s learning of his receipt of workmen’s compensation in unspecified amounts over a period of only four months.</p>
