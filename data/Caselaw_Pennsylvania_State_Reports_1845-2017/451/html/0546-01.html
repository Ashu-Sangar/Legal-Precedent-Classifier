Thompson, were married on June 29, 1968, but have been separated since July 5, 1969. After the separation, Mrs. Thompson filed a complaint in equity against her husband seeking to recover certain property and seeking an order requiring appellant to file an account of the sums earned by Mrs. Thompson which had been deposited in a joint savings account which she alleged her husband had converted for his own use. Mr. Thompson filed a timely answer to the complaint, <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>denying liability and liability to account. Hearings were held in <em>the </em>Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia on November 16, 1971, March 22, 1972, and September 7, 1972, at which time the testimony was concluded. Immediately after the close of testimony on September 7, 1972, the court made an oral finding in favor of the wife and denied the husband’s request for findings of fact and conclusions of law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

On September 25, 1972, the husband filed exceptions to the court’s finding. These exceptions are still pending before the court below.</p>

He also ordered the husband to return the engagement ring and wedding band to the wife, which he found to be the property of the wife. It is from this “order and decree’ requiring an account that the husband has taken this appeal. The court did not file an opinion.</p>

Rule 1516 recites that the parties may file requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law. Rule 1517 itemizes the contents of the chancellor’s ‘adjudication’. This adjudication must contain, in addition to a decree nisi, a summary of the issues raised in the pleadings, specified findings of fact and conclusions of law, and a discussion of the factual and legal questions involved in the case. Rule 1518 allows the parties 20 days to file specific exceptions to this adjudication. Finally, Rule 1519 provides that the court en banc shall pass on these exceptions, or, if none are filed, the prothonotary, upon praecipe, shall enter the <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>decree as final.
