On April 5, 1971, after motions to suppress evidence and statements were denied, a jury found appellant guilty as charged. Following the denial of post-trial motions, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on the indictment charging murder, ten to twenty years imprisonment on the indictment charging aggravated robbery, to run consecutively with the sentence imposed on the murder bill, and sentence was suspended on the bill charging conspiracy.

In defining the crimes charged, it was implicit that the acts of the culprits must be a direct cause of the death to sustain a conviction. Further, the jury was explicitly told that it had to determine how the deceased died and that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every element necessary to constitute the crimes charged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

This contention is without merit. Again, we note that there was no request for the court to so charge. Nor was this the thrust of the defense at trial and we are unaware of any law that suggests that the court has the obligation of advancing a theory of defense not raised by the parties.</p>

Specifically, he contends that as a matter of law the blows to the head were not the proximate cause of the deceased’s death. We find no merit in this argument since there is nothing in the record to indicate that there was any independent cause of death which supervened the blows inflicted upon the victim during the robbery. As it must, the Commonwealth has proven that the robbers’ actions were the direct cause of death. <em>See Commonwealth v. </em>Johnson, <a href="/pa/445/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="445 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1939992" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0276-01">445 Pa. 276</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=284%20A.2d%20734" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="284 A.2d 734">284 A. 2d 734</a> (1971); <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b173-3" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[182,1185,1150,716]]]'>Appellant, however, alleges that the facts of this case indicate that the deceased actually fell from his bed so as to independently cause his death. As the Commonwealth points out, the sole and exclusive source of this contention is the testimony of a Mr. Roberts, who was the deceased’s employer. He testified that the deceased reported for work on December 7, 1969, but had to be sent home because of his physical condition. On December 9, 1969, Mr. Roberts found the deceased lying on the floor of his room. Mr. Roberts stated that the deceased was “[o]n his side. Looked like he rolled out of bed. I called a red wagon and sent him back to the hospital.”</p>

However, assuming that the deceased did fall from bed, this alone could not have caused the injuries which resulted in death. At trial, Dr. Fillinger, the Assistant Medical Examiner of Philadelphia, testified that the post-mortem examination <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>which he performed revealed that the cause of death was the subdural hemorrhage in two areas of deceased’s skull. Dr. Fillinger further testified that the injuries sustained by the victim were consistent with blows inflicted by a crowbar and when asked by defense counsel whether there was a supervening cause of death other than the subdural hemorrhage, he replied: “I can find no supervening or intervening cause which may have caused the death of this individual. His initial injuries present a continuity which terminated in his demise, and I can find nothing which interrupted or produced any major change in this course.” Confronted with this evidence, which was contradicted only by appellant’s bold assertion that the fall from bed was the substantial factor in deceased’s death, we believe that the jury properly rejected the unsubstantiated theory of the defense.</p>
    <p id="b174-4" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[180,1287,1156,937]]]'>Even assuming that the fall from bed was the immediate cause of death, appellant does not escape criminal responsibility. Unquestionably, the blows to the head were severe and were the direct cause of his deteriorated physical condition which, in turn, ultimately led to his collapsing on the floor. Consequently, appellant is legally responsible for the death since “one charged with homicide cannot escape liability merely because the blow he inflicted is not mortal, or the immediate cause of death. If his blow is the legal cause, i.e., if it started a chain of causation which led to the death, he is guilty of homicide.” <em>Commonwealth v.
