Petitioner also contends that the District Attorney’s Office has been allowed to abuse its discretion and power in initiating and implementing the invocation of this rule. The amicus limits its brief to supporting petitioner’s allegation that the rule unconstitutionally infringes upon the right of criminal defendants to counsel of their own choosing.

At the outset, we note that because the petitioner does not fall within the class of persons whose rights are thus affected, his standing to raise this issue might well be questioned. See, e.g., <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em><a href="/us/405/0727-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="405 U.S. 727" data-case-ids="11723565" data-case-paths="/us/405/0727-01">405 U.S. 727</a> (1972). The doctrine of standing insures that a court will have the benefit of truly adverse parties in resolving a case. The petitioner, <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>beyond, question, has standing to challenge the effect of Buie *301 upon his right to practice law. In considering such a challege, we are forced to consider the effect of the rule on the formation of an attorney-client relationship. Such an inquiry would necessarily include the right of an attorney to practice law as well as the right of an accused to counsel of his choice. The two rights are opposite sides of the same coin, and no treatment of the effect of Buie *301 on one would be adequate without examining its effect on the other. Both parties and the amicus devoted significant portions of their respective briefs to the subject, thus the basic consideration for invoking the standing doctrine is satisfied. It is also significant that respondent registered only a perfunctory one-sentence challenge to petitioner’s standing. Were we to fail to reach the right to counsel’s objection, it almost certainly would be raised subsequently by one with standing (see f.n. 9), thus a consideration for judicial economy would also dictate that we consider the issue. We therefore hold that no purpose would be served by allowing the question of standing to foreclose a decision on the merits of this contention.</p>

The accused’s rights—such as those relating to a speedy trial, to an adequate opportunity to prepare the defense, and to confront witnesses—are constantly in potential or real conflict with the prosecution’s legitimate demands for some stability in the scheduling of cases. The availability of prosecution witnesses is often critically dependent on the predicability of the trial list.

It is the trial judge who must balance the conflicting demands of court administration with the rights of the accused, conscious, however, that when he considers the rights of those accused of crime, he must consider not only those involved in the case immediately before him but also those of other defendants awaiting trial whose rights may be affected by the consequences of trial delay.” <em>United States ex rel.

    <p class="author" id="ANp" data-blocks='[["BL_391.8",391,[776,890,515,33]]]'>Mr. Justice Manderino :</p>
    <p id="b391-7" data-blocks='[["BL_391.9",391,[188,944,1152,646]]]'>I concur with the majority that Rule 301 of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas (see majority opinion) has no reasonable relationship to the objective the Rule was designed to meet; that the Rule provides no standards; and that the Rule is too vague and over-broad. T must add that the Rule also violates constitutional guarantees in tbat it does not apply to <em>all attorneys </em>appearing in the criminal courts. The Rule is specifically aimed at <em>defense counsel. </em>It has no application to <em>counsel for the prosecution. </em>The Rule is thus one-sided and an obvious violation of the petitioner’s constitutional right to equal protection of the laws.</p>
    <p id="b391-8" data-blocks='[["BL_391.10",391,[188,1603,1150,427]]]'>A criminal trial requires an attorney to represent the prosecution and an attorney to represent the defense. Any rule (although it is otherwise constitutional) which restricts a particular attorney in the representation of defendants but does not restrict a particular attorney in representing the prosecution raises what may be insurmountable problems under the equal protection guarantees.</p>
    <p id="b391-9" data-blocks='[["BL_391.11",391,[188,2043,1149,317]],["BL_392.1",392,[184,354,1154,152]]]'>Rule 301 is a <em>court </em>rule. It is not and should not be a <em>prosecution </em>rule. Certain court rules applying only to defense counsel and not to counsel for the prosecution may be valid. In the present context, however, in which the objective is to eliminate the delay of <em>criminal trials </em>by restricting representation, I fail to see any difference <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>between the defense and the prosecution side since both sides must be represented in a criminal trial and that requires two attorneys, one on each side.</p>
    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[182,518,1155,317]]]'>If <em>counsel for the prosecution </em>represents the prosecution in cases involving ten or more defendants whose indictments are over a year old, I fail to see why such representation should not be prohibited in exactly the same manner that representation by defense counsel is prohibited.</p>
    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.6",392,[181,848,1156,481]]]'>The Rule also contains provisions in order to insure that an attorney who is a member of a firm does not allow his partners or associates to enter an appearance in order to avoid the Rule. I fail to see why this same prohibition should not apply to <em>counsel for the prosecution. </em>If <em>counsel for the prosecution </em>enters an appearance in a given case, substitution of other <em>counsel for the prosecution </em>should not be permitted if the purpose is to avoid compliance with the Rule.</p>
    <p id="b392-6" data-blocks='[["BL_392.7",392,[178,1341,1156,591]]]'>Like the majority, I commend the effort to eliminate delays in the trial of criminal cases. A rule, however, cannot be constitutional which assumes a one-sided posture in a context which requires a two-sided posture. In the context of Rule 301, <em>defense counsel </em>is not a reasonable classification justifying restrictions which are not imposed upon <em>counsel for the prosecution. </em>In terms of appearances by attorneys for a criminal trial, the only reasonable classification for a rule would be the classification of <em>trial counsel </em>including both <em>defense counsel </em>and <em>counsel for the prosecution.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b392-7" data-blocks='[["BL_392.8",392,[178,1943,1154,262]]]'>Any rule designed to eliminate delay in the trial of criminal cases must not only meet the constitutional standards set forth in the majority opinion, but must also protect the petitioner’s constitutional right to equal protection of the laws.</p>
