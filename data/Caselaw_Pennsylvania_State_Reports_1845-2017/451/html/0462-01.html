These charges arose out of the robbery of the Li’l General Store in Wilkinsburg. This indictment was consolidated for trial with another indictment which charged only Samuel Taylor and Raymond Peterson with robbery of a store in Oakmont. Appellant was not charged on the second indictment. There was no alie<a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>gation that appellant participated in the Oakmont robbery or that the Oakmont robbery was part of a series of transactions involving appellant. Challenges to the consolidation of these indictments were made by appellant and denied. He was then tried by a jury and found guilty of armed robbery and violation of the Uniform Firearms Act. The Superior Court affirmed appellant’s conviction and we granted allocatur.</p>

However, even assuming that Wilkinsburg and Oakmont are “in the same neighborhood,” there was no proof offered that the crimes in question were the product of a common scheme or of a continuing conspiracy between appellant and his co-defendants. Since no evidence was given to link appellant to the Oakmont robbery, the fact that the crimes were similar in nature does not afford a sound basis for ordering their consolidation at trial.
