If the turnpike company owned the land in fee, it would still belong to the company and should be assets for payment of its debts or distribution among its stockholders. If the turnpike company had only a right of way, then upon forfeiture of its charter and cessation of the use by the company, the land should revert to the owners of the fee. In either case, the railroad company, on appropriating a portion of the bed of the old road under its right of eminent domain, would not be bound to reconstruct the old road. There is no evidence to show how the turnpike company originally obtained possession of the ground, but presumably it entered under the powers of its charter and thereby acquired only an easement of right of way, which necessarily expired on the cessation'of the use and reverted to the owners of the fee: Fisher <em>v. </em>Coyle, <a href="/watts/3/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts 407" data-case-ids="1841295" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0407-01">3 Watts 407</a>; Ridge Turnpike <em>v. </em>Stoever, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 378" data-case-ids="480128" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0378-01">6 W. &amp; S. 378</a>; Lancaster Turnpike <em>v. </em>Rogers, 2 Barr 144; P. &amp; L.

It was said in Nor. Cen. Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 9 Norris 300, the main object and purpose of a turnpike is to provide a public highway of a superior quality. It is very clear that a turnpike is not a private road or way. It cannot be closed by the stockholders against public use. It is constructed by virtue of public authority, and for public use. It is for the use of every person who desires to pass over it, on payment of the toll established by law. Its use is common to all who comply with the law: <a href="/citations/?q=47%20Ill.%20493" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="47 Ill. 493">Id.</a></p>

It was maintained, controlled and operated as such by the company until 1881, when the charter was declared forfeited by due process of law. The turnpike was used and traveled as a public highway from the time it was constructed until the charter of the company was forfeited, and so continued to be used until the plaintiff in error took possession of the portion thereof which gives rise to this contention.</p>

No judgment or decree had destroyed its character as such. It had been dedicated to public use. It had been accepted and used as a public highway for some forty-five years. The forfeiture of the charter of the turnpike company destroyed the rights of that corporation : yet the road still remained, in fact and in law, a public highway: Craig <em>v. </em>The People ex rel. <a href="/citations/?q=47%20Ill.%20495" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="47 Ill. 495">47 Ill. 495</a>.</p>
