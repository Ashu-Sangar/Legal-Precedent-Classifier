Farm No. 1 was sold by the executors and bought by A. as trustee for the devisees. He then leased the same to B. (one of the devisees) who held it for several years, until it was again sold by A. under order of Orphans’ Court. After the widow’s death, B. had possession of farm No. 2 for several years, when he was made administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of the testator’s estate, and sold the said farm as the will directed. A.’s account as trustee and B.’s account as administrator were both confirmed by the Orphans’ Court, without exception. Subsequently, upon the appointment of an Auditor to report distribution of the funds in the hands of both accountants, derived from the sale of the two farms, the other devisees sought to charge B.’s share of the fund with certain rents and profits, which it was claimed he owed the estate, on account of farm No. 1, during the time it was held by A. as trustee, and of farm No. 2 during the time between the widow’s death, and B.’s appointment as administrator :</p>
