The Act of April 15th 1869 does not apply to this case. The notes were dated long before its passage, and this suit was brought, after the death of James Maekrell, against his executor, thus bringing it directly within the exception. Further, there should have been some evidence to connect the defendant’s testator, with the party signing the note, he being a marksman. Evidence of identity is always required in such cases: Whitelocke <em>v. </em>Musgrove, 1 C. <em>&amp; </em>M. 511; Reap <em>v. </em>Featherstone, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Luz.%20L.R.%204" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Luz.

There., both the interest of the attesting witness and the law which excluded interested witnesses existed at the time of the attestation, and continuously until the time of trial. In this case the Act of 1869 intervenes, and makes an attestation by an interested party as good as an attestation by a disinterested one — the parties all living, as of course is the case when the paper is signed. Thus the attestation is made good, and the witness dying, it is proper to prove the handwriting by a competent witness: Powers <em>v. </em>McFerran, 2 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 45. The Act of 1869 applies to attestations before its passage as well as after. It simply affects the remedy. It has never been doubted that a contract made before the Act of 1869 but then incapable of proof, for want of a disinterested witness, can, since the Act, be established by the testimony of witnesses rendered competent by the Act, except of course cases where rights of property have meantime vested. The same principle allies to subscribing witnesses: Patterson <em>v. </em>Shrader, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20W.N.C.%20429" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="12 W.N.C. 429">12 W. N.

At the time Emily Wolf signed the papers as a witness, she was an interested party, and hence disqualified. When the ease was called for trial she could not have been examined, if living, for the reason that the suit was against an executor. The rule in such cases is that where a subscribing witness to a bond is interested therein, as well at the time of attestation as at the trial, he cannot be examined as a witness to prove the execution, nor is proof of his handwriting sufficient for the purpose; Swire <em>v. </em>Bell, 5 D. <em>&amp; </em>E. 371; Nelius <em>v. </em>Brickell’s Adm’r, 1 Haywood 25. Where, however, a subscribing witness becomes interested after subscribing, even by his voluntary act, his handwriting may be proved : Hamilton <em>v. </em>Marsden, <a href="/binn/6/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Binn. 45" data-case-ids="1795098" data-case-paths="/binn/6/0045-01">6 Binn. 45</a>, It was urged, however, that the Act of 1869 having been passed after the attestation and before the trial, the case does not come within the rulings above cited. We are unable ’to see what the Act of 1869 lias to do with this case. It does not apply to actions brought by or against executors or administrators. But it was urged that if the paper had been executed after the passage of the Act of 1869, the subscribing witness would not have been disqualified upon the ground of interest, and if so, it would be competent to prove her handwriting upon the triah We do not propose to decide upon the effect of the Act of 1869 in the case of a subscribing witness, for it is not necessary to this case. The Act did not operate when the papers were signed, for it had. not then been passe&amp;h It did not operate when the cause was tried for the reason already stated. All the Act does is to permit interested persons to testify in certain cases, with a proviso tliat in a particular class of cases it shall not apply. The case in hand belongs to the latter class.</p>
