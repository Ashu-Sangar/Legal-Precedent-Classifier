The mortgage was dated long after the passage of the Act of 1851, and the mortgagee took with notice of the existing law, and he or his assignee cannot deprive the mortgagor of his rights thereunder.

The application in cases coming fairly within the terms of the Act, is a matter of right, and upon payment into court of the full amount claimed it is the duty of the court to order satisfaction of the mortgage.

Strictly the amount claimed should, on leave granted, be paid into, court before the order of satisfaction is made, but when payment of the money into court is made a condition precedent to the operation of the order or decree of satisfaction, it practically amounts to the same thing; but, in all such cases, a reasonable time within which the mortgagor may pay the money into court should be specified in the order, and as a general rule proceedings on the scire facias sur mortgage should not be stayed until the amount claimed is actually paid into court. Until then the mortgage security, with all its incidents, belongs to the mortgagee, and he has a right, save in exceptional cases, to proceed thereon until the mortgagor has placed himself in a position to demand that satisfaction be entered on the security.

The prayer, as amended, is that petitioner have leave to pay into court the amount claimed by the assignee of the mortgage, and that, upon payment into court of that amount, the court will order and decree that satisfaction be entered on the mortgage, &amp;c., in accordance with the terms of the Act. For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of money claimed by the mortgagee, a commissioner was appointed who reported to the court that the amount, including interest to March 4th 1883, attorney’s commissions, prothonotary’s percentage, and costs on the sci. fa. sur mortgage to same date, was $7,171.32. It is not denied that this is the con-ect amount claimed at that date, b.ut the decree complained of was not made until nearly two months thereafter. In the meantime, additional interest had accrued on the mortgagee’s claim, together with additional attorney’s commissions and prothonotary’s percentage, &amp;c. The amount specified in the decree should have included all these up to the day the money is actually, paid into court. As already stated, the Act contemplates the payment into court of the full amount claimed by the mortgagee, with interest and all costs to the date of payment.

It is apparent from what has been said that the Act was intended for just such cases as that presented in the petition, and the application when put in proper form, as it was by the amendment, was clearly a matter of rigid.</p>
    <p id="b207-6" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[208,1947,1162,345]]]'>The second specification is without merit. The fact that the scire facias was issued, and in the hands of the sheriff before the petition was presented, did not preclude the mortgagor from availing himself of the provisions of the Act. He had a right to do so at any time before judgment in the scire facias. After that it would be too late. The judgment would necessarily be a final adjudication of the mortagee’s claim, which could not be questioned in any collateral proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b207-7" data-blocks='[["BL_207.7",207,[215,2291,1156,129]],["BL_208.1",208,[248,400,1165,254]]]'>The last specification of error is sustained. In the order of court a reasonable time should have been fixed within which the money should be paid into court; and there was error in <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>not requiring the mortgagor to pay, in addition to the amount specified in the order, interest on the principal sum from March 4th 18S3, until the money was actually paid into court, together with attorney’s commissions and prothonotary’s percentage thereon. If this had been done, the decree would have been substantially correct.</p>
    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[247,655,1161,130]]]'>The order staying proceedings on the scire facias has not been assigned for error, and it is therefore unnecessary to add anything to what lias already been said on that subject.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[463,783,943,855]]]'>The decree is reversed at the.costs of the mortgagor, Samuel M. Stewart; and leave is now granted llim to pay into the' court below^ within twenty days from this date, the amount claimed by the assignee of the mortgage, to wit, seven thousand one hundred and seventy-one dollars and ■thirty-two cent's '(&lt;§&gt;7,171.32), together with additional interest on the principal debt from March 4th 1883, until the whole amount is paid into court, and also attorney’s commissions of five per cent, and prothonotary’s percentage on said additional interest; and, upon payment into court, within the time specified, of the whole amount claimed by the assignee of tho mortgage, it is ordered and decreed that satisfaction be entered on the mortgage ; and it is further ordered that the record, with a certified copy of this opinion, be remitted to the court below, with instructions to carry into effect the foregoing decree, and proceed with the case according to law.</p>
