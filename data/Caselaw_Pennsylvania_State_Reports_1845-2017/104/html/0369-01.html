Upon the audit of the account of a trustee in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny county, to which account exceptions had been filed, the auditing judge filed an adjudication or opinion, refusing to sustain said: exceptions, and entered a formal decree, wherein the entire account was. reformed and restated. The exceptant having taken an appeal from said decree to the Supreme Court, the accountant moved to quash the appeal on the ground that, no exceptions having been filed to the'adjudication and decree of the auditing judge, the said decree was not a definitive decree of the Orphans’ Court, from which an appeal would lie.</p>
