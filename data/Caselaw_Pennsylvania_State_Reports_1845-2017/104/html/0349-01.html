In order to show a promise by the defendant within six years to pay said debts, he testified that on March 4th 1874, he had the following conversation with defendant. Plaintiff said : “ You never sent me the money that I gave you to go to California. . . . You are aware that I was sued and had that $500 to pay. He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out three gold drafts, triplicates. I had them in my hand. He asked, what can I get for that in the bank? He said he would pay me and make it all right. We came up to the bank. . . . He wanted to get the money. I concluded he was going to pay me right • there. He left the draft for collection... A few weeks after that I wanted him to settle.
