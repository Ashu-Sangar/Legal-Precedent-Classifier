It was, then, the exercise, operation, and use of the property of defendant that produced the gross receipts, and these went into the hands of the receivers, simply because they were receivers of the property and assets of the defendant. Their appointment gave them— so far as this case is concerned — no right <em>to </em>take any <em>gross </em>x-eceipts that did not belong to defendant. They were acting for it, and at its expense, and not for themselves, and the product of the exorcise aud use of its franchises and property, belonged to it as much as the franchises and pi-opcrty themselves! The only difference is that had the x-eceivers not been appointed,, the officers of the defendant would have been free to apply the receipts to such of its uses as they thought best,. whereas the receivers will apply them to such of its uses as the court may direct. In either case they are used for the benefit of the defendant. Tiiis view does not rest upon any theory of the existence of the relation of principal and agent between defendant and the receivers ; it is involved in a simple statement of tho actual facts of the case.</p>

But it is said — and this is the fourth aud last specification — • that if the receipts were taxable, the account should have been settled against the x-eceivers, and not against the company. We consider this a merely technical objection. We are not called upon to express any opinion as to whether the settlement would he good if made against the x-eceivers ; we consider it binding as made against the company. The tax was due from it, the <em>report </em>was made by it, as is expressly stated in the mcmoi-andum included in it. It is verified by the assistant treasurer of tho company, who is also assistant treasurer of the i-eceivers, and one of the x-eceivers is, and was during the period covered by the report and the settlement, president of the company.

The corporation is no more liable for the tax than if the United States-Government had taken manual occupation of our road and run it, nor than a lessor of a railroad is liable instead of a lessee. The question of origin and ownership of the property lias nothing to do with the question of liability to tax for a particular half year.

As to the lien, under § 14 of the Act of 1879, that Act was passed long after, the date of the mortgage; under which the receivers were appointed, hence the statutory, lien is subsequent to the receiver’s lien.
