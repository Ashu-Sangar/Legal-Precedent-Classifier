A man can only leave one last will, and it was this, his valid will, that was designed to be protected. A party claiming under the true will is not interested to contest the probate of a former will. The later will has in this case been judicially adjudged to bo the testator’s last will. If this is in conflict with the former decree, the later will should prevail. The statute was designed to prevent fraud and not to facilitate it. Hence, the limitation should not here apply: Sophia Marsden’s Appeal, 6 Out. 202. It will be noticed that the. warranty deed of W.

The probate as to realty was, however, but prima facie proof that the instrument was, in fact, the last will and testament, and no lapse of time gave the probate any conclusive effect.

Elis adjudication, as to this, was a sentence or decree against “all interested to controvert it.” Ho one of these perhaps, was named.in the decree, or had notice of the proceeding, but all interested to contest its validity, as to the realty,were bound within the five years then next ensuing, to take notice of the fact, whether named or notified, or neither.

Assuming this to be true upon due proof, in an appropriate ¡proceeding, how could such an attack prevail as against the present defendant? He is a bona fide purchaser, for a full valuable consideration paid. His purchase must be assumed to have been made upon the faith of the register’s decree, which, except for the alleged fraud, by the lapse of five years, had ripened into a conclusive presumption of law, as to the title, under the will: but he had no knowledge of, or participation in the fraud, and is therefore entitled to protection against its consequences. Title to real estate “should be certain and secure,” and the very purpose and design of the Act. of 1856 would be defeated, if an innocent purchaser, under such circumstances, could not hold his estates, “in the confidence that they would not be lost by secret and unknown claims or by fraud and perjury.”</p>
