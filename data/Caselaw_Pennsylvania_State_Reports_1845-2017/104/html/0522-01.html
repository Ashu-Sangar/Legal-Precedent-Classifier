The most obvious are, that defendant is incorporated under the name of “ railway ” company. It was not in existence at the date of the Act under which plaintiff claims the right to tax, and it was, and is now, compelled to pay a perpetual tax to the city for the privilege of using the streets, and also a yearly tax on dividends. Will any or all of these jnstify the conclusion that the Act does not comprehend the defendant? We think not. While there is a popular understanding that the expression ‘^passenger railways ” does not mean the great lines of road operated by steam power, yet it by no means follows that the term “ railroad ” does not properly include all passenger railways, for purposes of taxation. A railway is essentially a railroad. They mean the same thing, and are used indiscriminately in reference to our great inter-state lines. We have the Penn’a Railroad Co., and the Pittsburgh, E. W. &amp; C. Railway Co. Nothing in defendant’s charter, so far as has been made to appear, will justify me in saying that the term railroad in the Act does not include passenger railways.</p>

It is true that courts will always seek to avoid such interpretation of a statute as would work injustice or oppression, or as would be in contravention to the general policy of the state; and, in a doubtful case, such considerations are entitled to great weight. But where the statute is unambiguous, and nothing appears showing that the intent of the legislature was different from that indicated by the terms of the Act itself, it is our duty to give it effect, however unjust and oppressive it may be. The remedy is with the legislature, not with the courts. But it does not strike us that the complaint of double taxation is well founded in this case.

This depends on the effect to be given to the Act of 4th January 1859. It is entitled “ An Act to enable the city of Pittsburgh to raise additional revenue.”' A very natural and effective way to raise more revenue, was to impose taxes on property which at that time was exempt from such taxation.

It speaks so clearly that it cannot be misunderstood. Its purpose is distinctly stated in the title. To that end the enacting clause provides that “all real estate” in the city belonging to any railroad company shall be “ subject to taxation for city purposes the same as other real estate in the city.” Other real estate in the city was then taxable for city purposes. Up to that time all the real, estate of any railroad company was not subject to taxation the same as other real estate for the purpose named. Thenceforth, for that purpose, no distinction was to be made between the real estate of a railroad corporation, and that owned by any individual: The lawmakers are presumed to have known that this property was then exempt from such taxation. All other real estate of any railroad company outside of that in question was already subject to this form of taxation. Unless the intention of the'Act was to bring this property within the taxing power of the city, this section has no meaning. We cannot impute to the legislature the folly of assuming that it did not intend to produce a practical result for the benefit of the city. The fact that such property had theretofore been held to be an incident to the corporate franchises of the railroad companies, matters not. It nevortheless was real estate.

' It is claimed that the property is exempt from taxation as real estate, under the authority of "Wayne County <em>v. </em>Delaware and Hudson Canal Co., supra, notwithstanding the Act of 1859. At first view that case might appear to sustain this claim. A careful examination of the case, however, leads to a different conclusion. The Act authorizing the canal company in that case, to improve the navigation of the river, declared that “ the property of said company, whether real or personal, within this state, shall at all times be liable for its debts and subject to taxation in like manner as similar property held by an individual or by a corporation now is or may be.” The preamble to the Act recites the fact that the canal company had been incorporated by the legislature of the state of New York : and by the Act of our legislature of 1st April 1825, P. L. 141, the company was authorized “to purchase and hold any quantity of lands situate at any place within ten miles of the waters of the Lackawaxen, not exceeding five thousand acres.” Undoubtedly the purpose of the clause first quoted was to make all the property of the company within this state liable for its debts and subject to taxation. How liable, and how subject ? It did not attempt to create any new forms of proceeding: but to preserve and apply the forms of law then applicable to each kind of property. Its property was to be liable for its debts and subject' to taxation, “ as similar property held by an individual or by a corporation.” That is, so much of its property as was subject to sale on execution or to taxation as individual property might be so sold and taxed ; but such other property as it held and used as essentially necessary for the enjoyment of its franchise was to be held liable for its debts and subject to taxation in like manner as similar property held by a corporation — that is, by'other corporations. The exemption of such property of a corporation from taxation as real estate, was then well recognized law.' The Act does not contain anything indicating an intention to change the manner of its taxation. The court therefore ruled that case On the general principle recognized in other cases where the charters did not contain such language. It is not. applicable to' the present case.</p>

The express words of the Act of 1834 declared that, “real estate, viz: All houses; lands, lots of ground,” &amp;c., &amp;c., should be subject to taxation. The Act of 1844, § 32, declared that “all real estate, to wit:' houses, lands, lots of ground. . . and all other real estate not exempt by law from taxation,” should be assessed and subject to taxation for all state and county purposes. In considering the application of this language in the case above cited, Kennedy, J., on p. 337 said: “ But if the lock-houses and collectors’ offices attached to the canal belonging to the plaintiffs in error, are to be considered as constituent parts of the canal, or necessarily incident thereto, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, fairly to show that they are embraced within the list of enumerated articles above.

Besides, that there was no design to tax canals under the general denomination of lands, houses, and other real estate, also appears from this: that they are not classed as real estate, but are treated by the legislature as a species of personal property. They are not taxed as real estate, but their corporate franchise, the canal itself or the dividends, are taxed, or may be, by the Commonwealth, and moreover, the dividends of the respective shareholders, may, in the shape of income, be again taxed, not only for state but county purposes.”</p>

This is the express ground upon which the whole doctrine is based in the opinion of this court in the case of Northampton County <em>v. </em>Lehigh Coal &amp; Nav. Co., 25 P. F. S. 461. It was there held that neither the Act of April 8th 1873, repealing all laws exempting real estate from taxation, nor the Constitution of 1874, made any change in the course of judicial decisions upon the construction of the general laws. On p. 464 Sharswood, J., says : <em>“ </em>There is nothing in the provision that all taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, which at all contravenes the general principle settled by the Supreme Court as to what is real estate within the classification of the tax laws, and that land, necessary to the franchise of a railroad corporation, is a part of such franchise, and not real estate subject to local taxation under the existing laws.” In my judgment this is the only true ground upon which the decisions holding the indispensable structures of corporations of a public character to be free from taxation as real estate, can be rested. In point of fact the passenger station of a railroad company is a “ house,” and the ground upon which it is erected is “ land,” no matter what purposes they may be used for. But when they constitute part of a railroad, while they are still in fact a house and land or “ real estate,” they have in legal contemplation entered into, and become a part of the railroad itself, the whole of which is represented by the capital stock. This stock is the legal manifestation of the corporate franchise, which is the right to build, maintain and conduct a railroad. The indispensable structures therefore, have, by the character of their use, absolutely lost their quality of real estate, and are not at all defined or included in any Act of legislation which uses that term or mode of designation, only. In the entire course of the decisions of this court not a solitary case has been found in which this rule has been departed from. With absolute and unbroken uniformity, we have always held that this class of structures is not taxable even under Acts which make <em>all </em>real estate, and <em>all </em>houses, lands, and lots of ground, subjects of taxation. It must certainly be conceded that the generality of this mode of designation permits no distinction as to the use or ownership of the real estate, the houses, the lands or lots of ground, which are declared to be subjects of <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>taxation by the supreme taxing power. Not a fragment of utterance can be found in the Acts of 1799, 1834 or 1844, in the least degree indicative of a legislative intent that “ real estate,” “houses,” “ lands,” or “lots of ground,” if they belong to a railroad company and are indispensable to its use are not to be taxed. The reason why they' can not be taxed under those Acts, is because they are personal estate, and therefore not included within the enumeration of taxable subjects. Now this rule which declares such structures to be personal estate is no part of the statutory law of the state. It is the law altogether outside and independently of any statute. It has become the law by the decisions of this court, and will remain Ihe law, after the decision of the present case, as it has always been before. It is not founded upon any idea of a legislative intent to exempt, but upon a totally different and independent idea, to wit, that the property.in question is not in fact — that is, in legal fact— real estate or houses or lands, but personal estate, corporate franchise.</p>

It can not be claimed that there is any declaration that for the purposes of this Act, the necessary works of railroad companies within the city of Pittsburgh shall bo treated as real estate. There is no provision that such works of those companies shall be taxable. There is no ambiguity in the language of the Act. It means just what it says : that the real estate of railroad companies within the city is to be taxed for city purposes. Whatever real estate such companies possess within the limits designated, is taxable under the act. The terms of the Act are fully satisfied, and apparently there is nothing to be determined by ■construction or interpretation. Yet it is perfectly manifest t hat if the works and structures in question are to be taxed at all, it can only be done by construction. Considered affirmatively, and by force of its plain words, there is not the slightest <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>expression in the section of any intent to tax personal estate, or to change the law of the state which declares these works and structures to be personal estate, or to declare that law suspended as to the property of railroad companies in the city of Pittsburgh. How then are these structures to be made taxable under this Act? It was decided by the court below, and is contended on behalf of the city, that unless this Act is held to apply to the works in question it is useless and meaningless, because the real estate of the city is taxable for city purposes by other laws, and under those laws the real estate of the railroad companies is taxable independently of this Act. In order then to give meaning and effect to the Act, it is proposed to extend it to the works and structures in question, in contravention of the existing and undoubted law of the state which holds them to be personal property only, and as such nntaxable as real estate.</p>

But if wo find language used which is incapable of a meaning we cannot supply one. It is true that we have here words which, as they stand, are useless ; a circumstance, perhaps, not altogether unprecedented. But, to give an effectual meaning, we must alter not only, “ or ” into. “ and,” but “ issued ” into <em>“ </em>levied.” It is extremely probable that this would express what the legislature meant. But we can not supply it. Those who used the words thought that they had effected the purpose intended. But we, looking at the words as judges, are no more justified in introducing that meaning than we should be if we added any other provision. We can do no more than give such a meaning as the words authorize.” In the case of Frye <em>v. </em>Chicago, &amp;c. R. R.

That meaning we are compelled to respect and to enforce. If there is prior legislation to that effect we must nevertheless give to this Act the same effect. If such prior legislation should be repealed, this remains, and we can not refuse to enforce it in its literal sense, without repealing it, which of course we can not do. The utmost, therefore, that can be said of the Act in question, is that it is superfluous. It is very certain, however, that mere superfluity of legislation is no objection either to its validity or its effective operation. It is not at all uncommon to discover different legislative enactments in relation to the same subject, but surely it was never considered that the redundancy of legislative action thus ascertained, constituted any reason for denying its actual operation, or for changing its plain meaning.</p>

It is thus stated in the paper book of the very able counsel for the city: “ The legislature of 1859 knew of the decisions in the Permanent Bridge case and in the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company case. They knew that merely subjecting land or real estate to taxation within the county or city did not thei-eby enable the county or city to tax the real estate occupied by (the) corporation with its necessary works. Therefore, in the Act of 1859, in so mauy words they said that the real estate either owned or possessed by a railroad company, should be therefore (thereafter?) subjected to municipal taxation, the same as other real estate owned by individuals.” This is probably the strongest and most ingenious presentment, in support of the construction contended for by the city, that the subject will admit of. It refers the meaning of the Act to the conscious, or supposed conscious, intelligence of the members of the legislature which passed it. Yet what is the true character of this argument? In very terms it affirms that the legislature know the existing state of the law, knew that if they simply declared that the “ real • estate ” of railroad corporations should be taxed, the “ necessary works” would not become subject to taxation. Yet, notwithstanding this knowledge, they deliberately, consciously and intelligently chose those very words in designating what property should bo taxed. The learned counsel for the city conclude from this premise that the legislature meant that all the real estate of railroad companies, including the indispensable structures, should be taxed. To my mind precisely the opposite inference is the only one that can be drawn. If the legislature knew that the words used had a defined and restricted meaning, which excluded the structures in question from taxation, how is it possible to resist the conclusion that if they used them at all they used them in that sense? To hold the contrary is to hold that the members of the legislature vio<a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>lated tlieir duty and their official oaths, that they deliberately used words which they knew had a certain fixed, definite and restricted meaning, when they intended that the words should have an entirely different and opposite meaning. We have no right to impute such conduct, or the motive or purpose which would prompt it, to a co-ordinate branch of the government; and if we had the right, we ought not, in the interest of public morals and policy, to exercise it. If this legislature knew that by using only the words “real estate,” in the Act designating the subjects of taxation, the indispensable structures of railroad companies would not become subject to taxation, then if they really intended such structures to be taxed, they should, and necessarily would, have said so in unmistakable language. It was a perfectly simple and easy matter to do so, either by naming the structures, such as passenger stations, freight houses, engine houses, offices, water stations, &amp;c., or by using general language with an express declaration that it was intended to include all the works and structures of the companies, whether used for the purposes of the roads or not. Rot having done so, and having used only words which have received a fixed, definite, legal meaning by the repeated decisions of this court, we are bound to infer they intended to use them in that sense.</p>

When it is considered that the general Acts of 1834 and 1844 made taxable all real estate, and all houses, lands and lots of ground, without any distinction of ownership or use, this argument loses much of its force, because those Acts were quite as applicable to the real estate, houses, lands and lots of railroad companies, as to those of other corporations or individuals. But the argument is definitely met and answered by a decision of this court which lias never been doubted or overruled, in which the ownership of the property subject to taxation was much more limited than in .the present case. In the case of Wayne Co. <em>v. </em>Del. <em>&amp; </em>Hudson Canal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.W.%20Harr.%20351" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 W.W. Harr. 351">3 Harr. 351</a>, the Act of April 1st 1825, P. L. 141, which authorized the company to improve the navigation of the river Lackawaxen, provided in the fifth section, “ That the property of the said company, whether real or personal, within this state, shall at ail times be liable for its debts, and subject to taxation, in like manner as similar property held by an individua] or corporation, now is or may be.” It was lieid by this court that the reservoirs created by the company for supplying the canal with water, the houses and gardens occupied by the lock-tenders and collectors along the canal and railroad, the engines. <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>and machinery for raising cars up the planes, and the engine-houses, the houses and gardens occupied by the engineers attending the engines, ancT the collector’s and engineer’s office in Houesdale were not subject to taxation for state or county purposes. The point was made by counsel for the county, on the argument in this court, that the Act in question expressly made taxable the real and personal estate of this particular corporation in like manner as the same kind of property held by an individual or corporation. But this court, and also the court below, held that the works and buildings above mentioned were not taxable, and adhered to the general doctrine expressed in the cases heretofore cited. It seems to me this case is a complete answer to the entire argument on behalf of the city in the present case, so far as mere authority is concerned, and that consistency requires that we should either overrule it or stand by it and give it application to the present contention. It seems to me also that the case of Northampton Co. <em>v. </em>Lehigh Coal <em>&amp; </em>Nav. Co., above cited, is equally imperative and controlling in the same direction. There the very purpose of the Act in" question (Act of April 8th 1873, § 1, P. L. 61), was to repeal all laws exempting real estate from taxation, and the express words of the Act were: “ That all real estate within this Commonwealth shall be liable to taxation for all such purposes as now is, or hereafter may be, provided by general laws, excepting only therefrom the classes of property specifically exempted from taxation,” by certain Acts relating to places of worship, burial grounds, &amp;c., &amp;e. When a special exception was inserted in this Act which did not include railroad or canal companies, it might well be argued that the intention of the legislature, as well "as the words of the Act, subjected all other real estate within the Commonwealth to taxation, without any regard to its ownership or use. But we then thought differently, and held to the course of all the previous decisions, that the term “ real estate ” did not include the necessary works and structures of a railroad company because they were not real estate but 'a part of the corporate franchise.</p>

I believe that, subject to the rules hereafter declared, and subject to the exceptions of equitable construction, to be discussed in the next chapter, the tendency of all our modern decisions is to the effect, that the intention of the legislature is to bo found in the statute itself, and that there only the judges are to look for the mischiefs meant to be obviated, and the remedy meant to be provided.”</p>

This consideration brings into operation another rule of construction which seems equally decisive of the present contention. In Potter’s Dwarris on Statutes, page 274, it is thus expressed: “Words and phrases, the meaning of which in a statute has been ascertained, are, when used in a subsequent statute, to be understood in the same sense.” In note 4, at the foot of the same page, the rule is more fully expressed and accompanied with authorities, thus: “Where the terms of a statute which has received judicial construction, are used in a later statute, whether passed by the legislature of the same state or country, or by that of another, that construction is to be given to the later statute: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Hartwell, <a href="/mass/69/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="3 Gray 450" data-case-ids="2077137" data-case-paths="/mass/69/0450-01">3 Gray 450</a>; Ruchmaboye <em>v. </em>Mottichmed, 32 Eng.

If we say they must have intended to tax the necessary'works of the companies, we assert for them an intent which they did not assert for themselves. Of course we can only do this upon the theory that they really designed, had the mental purpose, to tax such works. But by what authority can we say this? We know nothing of them as individuals, we can not possibly know anything about their mental purposes. We know nothing of their personal integrity, nothing of their intelligence. Suppose the Act was drawn by a crafty and designing person in the interest of the railroad companies, who used this language because he knew that the words “ real estate” would not include the necessary works of the companies? Or suppose certain members, in sufficient numbers to constitute a majority, voted for it, for the same mason, and in the same interest ? Either or both of these suppositions are entirely in accord with actual experience in the business of legislation, and yet either of them, would, if true, utterly destroy the argument from intention. Who shall say they are not true in this case, or, by what authority shall we so declare ? Or suppose that either the draftsman of the Act, or the members who voted for the bill, or all the members, entertained the belief that the real estate of railroad companies was free from taxation, and sought to make it taxable in the city of Pittsburgh by this Act? In that event <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>the words “real estate” would have their proper legal signification, they would include all real property which was merely convenient, and exclude such as was essential to the exercise of the corporate franchise. This was precisely the. case with the general laws of 1799, 1834 and 1844. If the legislature which passed this Act was entirely ignorant of the distinction between works of convenience and works of necessity, then of course it cannot be said that they had any specific intent to tax works of necessity, because they knew nothing about them. Lastly, if they did know of the distinction, and therefore knew the necessity of using apt words in order to tax the indispensable structures, and nevertheless did not use those words, then we are bound to presume that they did not intend to tax the structures. The legal px’esuraption is that they did know the existing state of the law, and that they passed the Act in question with that knowledge. The learned counsel for the city, understanding this perfectly, have rested their case upon this theory. It is the only theory upon which it can be rested, but it is, in my judgment, entirely inadequate to.t the purpose for which it is invoked. Eor it necessarily presupposes the presence of a knowledge which would compel the use of words which do not appear, and the omission or carefully defined use of words which do appear in the Act in question. Hence we cannot by mere inference assert an intent, which the legislature, knowing the necessity of its assertion, failed entirely to express.</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[226,1472,1162,341]]]'>There is a curious circumstance in the work of the legislature of 1858, which strongly illustrates the danger of conjecturing an intent upon considerations which are outside of an Act in question. It happens that this same legislature passed an Act which was approved on April 21st 1858, and is found on p. 385 of the Pamphlet Laws of that year. It is a supplement to the Act incorporating the city of Philadelphia, and its purpose is expressed in the preamble, thus:</p>
    <blockquote id="b572-5" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[225,1813,1163,172]]]'>“ Whereas, the burden of taxation for the support of the government of the said city is'now mainly boi’ne by the owners of real estate therein, and it is just that the ownei'S of personal property should contribute thereto: therefore,</blockquote>

But what is of still more consequence, they expressly declared that this was done for the purpose of taxing personal property, in ease of the owners of real estate.. In other words, they asserted a purpose to tax personal estate only, and as an exercise of that purpose they taxed the necessary structures of railroad companies only. The conclusion is irresistible that this legislature knew that the necessary works of railroad companies were personal estate, and also that in order to make them taxable they must be expressly named. The inference, therefore, seems conclusive that when they passed the Act we are considering, and only named <em>“ </em>real estate” in it, they did not intend to tax the structures.</p>

The Act was approved the éth of January 1859, which was one day before the legislature of that year assembled. It was really passed by the legislature of 1858, on April 15th, and as the legislative record of that session shows, it was reported, considered and passed as a private bill, and without a word of debate. The express purpose of the Act was to enable the city of Pittsburgh to raise additional revenue by taxation. Onerous taxation was imposed by the other sections. Yet it is conceded that in all the time from the passage of the Act, down to the present proceeding, twenty-two years, no attempt was made by the city to tax the necessary works and structures of the railroad companies. Why is this ? Certainly the persons who procured the passage of the Act knew what their own purpose was in obtaining its enactment. It must be assumed the money was needed which would be derived from the enforcement of the Act, and that the city authorities would use all the agencies which the Act afforded. Acting upon this theory they would at once and continuously thereafter have proceeded to assess and tax the structures in question. But they never did, and the only reason that can be assigned for this omission is that it was not supposed that the structures were taxable under the Act. Had the persons who obtained the passage of the Act believed the necessary works were taxable, they would at least have made the attempt to have them taxed, and would have appealed to the courts for that purpose, by proper proceedings. The fact that no sucli attempt was made for more than twenty years after the passage of the Act in question, affords a most persuasive inference that it was not expected, and therefore was not intended by the Act to subject the necessary works of railroad companies within the city <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>limits, to taxation for city purposes. Contemporaneous construction and usage are regarded as valuable aids in the interpretation of statutes of doubtful meaning: Sedgwick on Construction of Statutory and Constitutional Law, p. 212, 215 et seq. The force of this consideration is greater in the present than in ordinary cases, because the city is practically asking us to reverse her own construction of the Act in question, continued for many years, when it was constantly her highest pecuniary interest to have asserted the rights which she now claims under the Act.</p>
