Truby, as executor of Mrs. Wallace, claimed that the intention of the testator was that his widow should be entitled to one-third of the latter sum before the debts and expenses were paid, and to the interest of the former sum during her life; thus throwing the expenses of administration, &amp;c., upon the residuary legatees.

Distinctions might be attempted between these cases and the present one, but I think they would not prove very satisfactory, and would tend to confuse the principle asserted in their decisions. Here, the residuary bequest is to my four sisters, Jean, Nancy, Rebecca and Rachel, to each one-fourth, to them and to their heirs. In Gittings <em>v. </em>McDermott, 2 M. &amp; K. 69, the language of the residuary clause was as follows: “ All the remainder of my property of whatsoever description, &amp;c., I give and bequeath iu equal shares to each of my dear sisters, viz: to my dear sister Mary Stewart, one-half, and to my sister Sarah Gittings, the other half of the said property, and upon their death respectively, to their heirs. Lord Brougham said that if the bequest of the residue stood alone, the death of one of the sisters in the lifetime of the testatrix would have caused a lapse, and a lapse was saved in that case mainly by the use of the word or, in previous bequests. Much importance seemed to be given to this word when the bequest is to one or his heirs. In 2 Williams on Executors 1088, 5th ed., it is said: “It appears to be now established that when there is a bequest to A. or his personal representatives, or, to A. or his heirs, the word ‘ or,’ generally speaking, implies a substitution, so as to prevent a lapse.” See the force attached to it in Gross’s Estate, supra, where Sorver <em>v. </em>Berndt, same book 213, is corrected and placed upon its proper foundation. In Sloan <em>v. </em>Hanse, <a href="/rawle/2/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Rawle 28" data-case-ids="1820609" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0028-01">supra,</a> the court would not even construe the word “ or ” so as to save a lapse. In the present will the copulative is used instead of the disjunctive, which would make a stronger case against exceptants. It is not for us to pronounce a decree that'would seem to disturb the current of decision in this state.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[204,1728,1168,689]],["BL_362.1",362,[248,395,1181,1229]]]'>II. Exception is taken by counsel for the estate of Mrs. Wallace to the scheme of distribution adopted by the Auditor. She was the widow of testator, and it is thought she did not get all she was entitled to under the will. Her husband left her one-third of all his personal property absolutely, excepting, however, from this bequest, the sum of $9,697.76, the price for which he had sold his farm. He gave her one-third of the interest that might accrue on this sum during her life, these bequests to be in lieu of dower. It is contended she ought to get the one-third of the absolute bequest,' before deducting debts, and expenses of administration. This would give her about a thousand dollars more than the Auditor allowed her, and take an equal sum from the grandson. The reasons assigned for the adoption of this method of distribution are, that the widow is to be treated as a purchaser of what she got, and her legacy would, therefore, not abate even in favor of a child. <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>But it is not a question of abatement. The question is how' much did testator give his widow ? The will says, the one-third of his whole estate absolutely, less a certain sum, the price of his farm, out of which he creates a specific or demonstrative legacy for his grandson and another for his widow during her lifetime. The Auditor gave her the one-third of the first bequest after deducting debts and expenses of administration. The argument is that he should have given her the third before such deductions were made, in other words, that she was entitled to a third of what testator owed. If the language of the will required such a construction, we would have to follow it. But an estate consists of what is left, after the payment of debts and the expenses of administrating it, and when one-third, or any other fractional part thereof is bequeathed, we readily understand what is meant. If he had given her a specific sum, in lieu of dower, so large as not to leave enough for payment of debts, and specific legacies, these legacies would have to give way to the claims of the widow. She was not bound to accept under the will if she was dissatisfied with the provision made for her. The residuary clause does not warrant the construction so ingeniously urged on behalf of the widow. It does not say she shall have her bequest before any debt is paid. The debts are mentioned before the bequests. It provides, as residuary clauses usually do, that after payment of funeral expenses, debts and bequests, the remainder shall go as directed. It would require much plainer language than this to show that testator meant to give his widow a sum equal to one-third of his debts and expenses of administration in addition to the one-third of his estate.</p>

Guthrie’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%2013" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="1 Wright 13">1 Wright 13</a>, was especially relied upon, where Justice Strong said: “ Undoubtedly the word heirs may be shown by the context to have been used in the sense of sons, daughters, children, &amp;c., and when it is so used the rule in Shelley’s case is inapplicable.” There are several cases where the word “ heirs ” has been held to mean children, but they were all instances where such was the evident intent of the testator as gathered from the will itself. This will contains nothing from which such an intent can be inferred. And the fact that the testator knew that two of his legatees were dead when he made his will, and intended the legacies to go to their children, can make no- difference unless he has expressed his intention in his will: Sword <em>v. </em>Adams, <a href="/yeates/3/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="3 Yeates 34" data-case-ids="6771178" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0033-01">3 Yeates 34</a>; Comfort <em>v. </em>Mather, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 450" data-case-ids="1853563" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0450-01">2 W. &amp; S. 450</a>; Campbell <em>v. </em>Jamison, 8 Barr 498; Sloan <em>v. </em>Hanse, <a href="/rawle/2/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="2 Rawle 28" data-case-ids="1820609" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0028-01">2 Rawle, 28</a>; Dickinson <em>v. </em>Purvis, 8 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 71; Ritter <em>v. </em>Fox, <a href="/whart/6/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="6 Whart. 99" data-case-ids="1837005" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0099-01">6 Wharton 99</a>.</p>

Our answer is that the decree of the court below carries out the testator’s intent so far as he expressed it in his will, and that the rule referred to is a rule of property, sustained by a long line of authority both in England and in this country and too firmly embedded in our system of law to be uprooted by anything short of an Act of Assembly. There are already two statutes in this state which have to some extent modified the rule of the common law, viz : the Act of April 8th 1833, which saves the lapse in favor of a child or other lineal descendant, and the Act of May 6th 1844 which contains a similar pro<a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>vision in favor of the children of a brother or sister where the testator leaves no lineal descendants. Neither Act applies to this case.</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[196,543,1169,725]]]'>There is no merit in the widow’s claim to have the testator’s debts, expenses of the administration and costs of audit deducted from the residuary fund. There is no residuary fund nntil the debts and expenses are paid. The testator gave bis widow one-third of all his personal property absolutely, excepting however from this bequest the money for which bis farm should be sold. This amount was $9,897.76. Iio gave her the interest on one-third of this for life; the two bequests to be in lieu of dower. The claim of the widow would add about $1,000 to her share, and deduct that much from the grandson. The reason assigned for her claim is that the bequests in her favor are in lieu of dower; hence slie is a purchaser, and as to her there can be no abatement. It is not a question of abatement. The gift of one-third of the personal estate is a gift of oue-third of what may be left after the payment of debts and expenses. As this is ali her husband left her there is no abatement. We find no error in this record.</p>
    <p id="b365-6" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[480,1272,885,88]]]'>The decree is affirmed and the appeals dismissed at the costs of the respective appellants.</p>
