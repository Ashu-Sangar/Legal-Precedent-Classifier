The defendant is simply a collector, and, as we have seen is only liable- if, and because, it fails to collect. [The tax is one which has been long in force, and was not imposed by the Acts of 1879 and 1881.] They only change the rate from three mills to four mills, and so far as they enumerate subjects of taxation, are merely re-enactments of the earlier law.

The words'of the section are: ‘ Made taxable for State purposes at the rate of four mills on every dollar of -the value thereof annually:’ This phrase, ‘ every dollar of the value thereof,’ occurs also in section thirty-four of the Act of 1844, and clearly means actual value. . . ...

[There is no other machinery for ascertaining the actual value of mortgages, however, than that provided by the earlier laws, and the evidence before, ns shows that it was put in operation.] The County Commissioners made returns to the Bevenuo Board of all mortgages valued for State taxation ; the returns were accepted- and duly acted upon by the Board,, the taxes were assessed,, collected, and, as the State Treasurer testifies, fully paid for the years in question.</p>

Without more, how can we say that this is not true ? . . . Moreover, there is certainly no presumption, whatever the negligence of assessors may be, that none of these bonds were included in the assessment of 1879, and if some were included they are still there and have paid tax already for 18S0 and 1881. But how can their number be ascertained by the defendant ? [It has no control over the process of assessment or over the ordinary collectors; it is only one of the State’s agents without information as to the action taken by the others, and commanded to collect a tax without oven being furnished with a duplicate of its assessment. And further, this tax being upon the actual value of the bon,ds, how much shall the corporation retain ? It has been given no power to make a valuation, and none is made by the Act itself. This is done by another agency, of whose proceeding the defendant has no knowledge; how then can it calculate the sum it must deduct? The Act of 1881, does not materially differ from the Act of 1879, and we need not separately discuss its provisions. Both leave untouched the old method of valuation and assessment, and the same presumption of payment applies to the taxes claimed under the later statute. . . . The Act of 1881 is a supplement to the Act of 1879, and was intended to re-enact and supply the seventeenth section, but in the failure to provide for a valuation of mortgages it is like the original, and the remarks just made apply to it with equal force. In this respect it only differs from the Act of 1879 by providing for a return by the corporation of ‘ the amount of such indebtedness,’ and this does not seem to us to be any nearer a perfect valuation.]”</p>

It is for the law-making power to select the subjects of taxation ; in the exercise of this power the legislature may perhaps impose a tax, not only upon what the citizen owns, but also upon what he owes. This question we will neither discuss nor decide. The act of 1879 is so clear in its provisions, as to preclude the possibility of doubt as to its construction ; the tax of four mills is expressly upon “ mortgages,” «fee., <em>“ </em>owned,” «fee., “ possessed by,” &amp;c., and no distinction is taken, or discrimination made, between a corporate and an individual indebtedness, except that &lt;£ all corporations paying interest on loans, hereby taxed for state purposes only, shall deduct the said tax from the said interest, and pay the same into the state treasury.” The tax is imposed indiscriminately, upon all mortgages, «fee., in the hands of the owner or possessor, but the corporation is made the collector of the tax upon the corporate loan. This was the construction put upon the Act of 30th April 1864, by 'this court, in the case Maltby <em>v. </em>R. R. Company, 2 P.

The phrase, <em>“ </em>every dollar of the value thereof,” has acquired a well established signification under our revenue system; it means simply the actual value, or worth. The 4th section of the act of 15th May 1841 requires the assessoi's to value “ all objects of taxation, according to the <em>actual value </em>thereof, and at such rates and prices, for which the same would separably bona fide sell.” The oath of office, which is administered to the assessors, under the 9th section of the Act of 27th July 1842, obligates that officer to value all taxable property, at the rate or price which he shall, “after due examination and consideration, believe the same would sell for, if sold singly and separately, at a bona fide sale, after full public notice.” The 3d section of the Act of 15th May 1841, provides, that if any assessor, or assistant assessor, shall knowingly and intentionally assess, rate or value any property “ at more or less than he shall know’ and believe the just cash value <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>or rate thereof,” he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, &amp;e. It is the duty of the board of revenue commissioners, under section 3d of Act of 1878, to ascertain and determine, “ the fair and just value of the property of the cities and counties of the Commonwealth, made taxable by law, adjusting Mid equalizing the same, as far as possible, so as to make all taxes bear as equally as practicable, upon all the property of the Commonwealth, made or hereafter to be made taxable, for state purposes, <em>in proportion to its actual value.”</em>

    <p id="b117-5" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[202,793,1166,764]]]'>The Legislature has thus frequently defined the phrase “ every dollar of the value thereof ” to signifying actual value, and the construction which is deducible from the continued, general and uniform practice and understanding throughout the Commonwealth, is the same. That the same signification was in the legislative mind, at the passage of the Acts of 1879 and 1881, is made clear, by the fact, that shares of stock in banks and savings institutions, are put in the same class with “mortgages, money owing by solvent debtors,” &amp;c., are also, and in like manner, made taxable, at the rate of four mills “ upon every dollar of the value thereof,” and that value is defined by the same Act to be “ the actual value in the market where located.” It can scarcely be believed that “the value thereof,” thus generally and indiscriminately applied to both corporate and individual loans, to bank shares, agreements and accounts, must be construed to have two altogether distinct and different significations, when used but in a single connection.</p>

The tax of a citizen is the result of the rate, applied to the value of the property which he owns, and he is not taxed until the rate is thus applied, by some legal mode of adjustment; no duty of payment arises, no proceeding to collect can be sustained, until the tax is thus created. Is there any provision in the Act of 1879, or the amendment thereto of 1881, for the making of this valuation ? If there is none, these Acts cannot constitute an independent scheme for the taxation of corporate loans, but must be aided by the machinery of the Act of 1844, and if the latter Act is not fully supplied' by the former, no implication of repeal could arise, at least, as to the parts not supplied. We can find no such provision in the Acts of 1879 or 1881.</p>

That the corporation officers are themselves the assessors, and the acceptance by the State of their valuation, affords an official estimate which is equivalent to an actual assessment. Thus it is conceded that the ascertainment of some basis or valuation, on which to lay the tax, is essential to a valid levy, and that the Act of 1879, taken alone, provides no such basis.</p>

Besides, the tax is in no sense one against the corporation, but against its creditoi’s, as individual citizens of the State, and we cannot see how, or upon what principle of law, the report of the corporation, as to the <em>amount </em>of its indebtedness, could be regarded as an assessment, binding upon them, who have been made no parties to it, and have no control over it. There is no community of interest between a debtor and his creditor ; their interests are ordinarily adverse. Certainly that cannot be regarded as a valid assessment of an ad valorem tax which is made by persons whose interests are adverse, who are under no official oath or obligation, where the person charged has no notice, no right to interfere for his own protection if he had notice, and no appeal; and when, in fact, there is no adjudication as to actual value.</p>

Moreover, if this report was intended to be made at the end of each year as a basis of taxation and exemption from other taxation for that year, and not the ensuing year, as seems to be conceded in the argument, on both sides, and in the opinion of the court below — then, if the learned counsel of the Commonwealth are correct in their view of this case, the concluding clause of the section under consideration becomes abortive and of no effect.</p>

Such a settlement must, of course, be for taxes which the corporation collector failed to collect. As it is the assessment which supports the tax, it must precede the levy, and the levy must precede the settlement. If the settlement is the assessment, then the case is anomalous in this, that we hold the collector for a default which confessedly^ could not exist ; for, how could the collector, collect a tax which had not been previously assessed ?</p>

But it is certainly very clear that the terms of exemption and the tax cannot both he enforced, and that it was not the intention that they should. We are of opinion, therefore, that the Acts of 1879 and 1881, taken together, or separately, cannot be regarded as an independent system; they lack the machinery for their own enforcement, but if taken with other previous enactments, providing that machinery, they have their proper place in our revenue system.</p>

This method of reaching subjects, capable of successful concealment, and liable to escape the notice of the most vigilant assessor, has, for many years, been recognized by our courts as a valid exercise of legislative power. It was applied under the 42nd section of the Act of 29th April 1844, to the indebtedness of municipal corporations, in the following provision:</p>

By the last named Act it was provided that “ the officers of incorporated companies, which pay interest,” &amp;c., shall before payment of the same, retain from the “ depositors, bondholders or creditors, the amount of state tax, imposed by existing laws, and shall pay over the same to the State Treasurer.” It was further provided, however, as follows: “ And that all the laws regulating the mode of such payment, in regard to treasurers of counties, cities and boroughs, be and the same are hereby extended to the financial officers thereof, and they are hereby required to collect, and pay over the taxes due to the state, on such payments of interest, as provided in this section to be done by officers of incorporated companies ; and in case of any officer neglecting, or refusing to retain the same, he shall become personally liable for the amount.”</p>

Whilst the presumption is legitimate that the accepted return of the assessors is full and true, as to all matters falling within its scope, no presumption could arise that the officer transcended his duty, even if the return by the generality of its expression was susceptible of such a construction. In such a case, a return of “ all mortgages, moneys owing by solvent debtors,” &amp;c., would be construed to cover such mortgages, &amp;c., &amp;c., only as came within the range of the assessor’s duty. As this provision of the law of 1844, was incorporated into the Act of 1864, and thus extended to the indebtedness of incorporated companies, the latter Act also possessed the means of its own enforcement. It is urged, however, that the provisions of the Act of 1844, were only extended to the financial officers of corporations, so far as “ they regulate the mode of payment,” and that the mode of payment does not necessarily embrace the power and process of assessment. Such has not been the construction which this court has put upon the Act of 1864. That Act was first considered by this court in the case of Maltby <em>v. </em>R. &amp; C. R. R. Co., 2 P. F. Smith 140; and, although the reasoning of the case is not fully developed in the opinion, it proceeds upon the assumption that the assessment under the Act of 1864, was upon the par or nominal value under the provision incorporated from the Act 1844, and thus the phrase <em>“ </em>the laws regulating the mode of payment,” was construed to embrace the whole process of assessment and collection. The question was fairly raised, however, elaborately discussed, and distinctly decided in the case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Phœnix Iron Company, heard at the January Term 1868, but not reported. In that case, Justice Agnew in delivering the opinion of the court says:</p>

The third section of the Act of 30th April 1864, under which the return was made, provides that all the laws regulating the mode of such payment, in regard to treasurers of counties, cities, and boroughs, shall be extended to the financial officers of the companies. The forty-second section of the Act of 1844, regulating the duties of such treasurers, directs them to assess the tax upon the nominal value of the <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>evidence of debt, and deduct it from the interest or dividend, and pay it over to the State Treasurer. Thus the law itself fixes the measure of valuation at the par value of the debt.”</blockquote>

The valuation is here implied from the terms of the Act, it is specific and determinate, and therefore enforceable. The Act of 1861 had the same effect upon loans of incorporate companies, which the Act of 1811 liad upon municipal loans ; both were withdrawn from the ordinary processes of the revenue system. As there was no express provision to that end, however, it is not improbable that some confusion resulted in general practice, and therefore the Act of 1868 provided “ that the principal sums, from the interest of which the said tax is deducted, shall not be assessed and taxed for State purposes, in- the valuation of personal property, or returned by County Commissioners to the Board of Revenue Commissioners.” Thus, the difficulties which had then doubtless occurred under previous legislation, and which have arisen here, were averted.</p>
