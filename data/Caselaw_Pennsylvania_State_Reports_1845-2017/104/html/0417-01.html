Bobinson, then the owner of-a certain property situate at Haysville, Allegheny county, Pa., applied to Isaac M. Pennock, a real estate broker, to negotiate-for him a loan of $12,000, to be secured by a bond and mortgage on said property ; that this, property was at' the time encumbered by four mortgages, the first, or “ McNish ” mortgage, being held by Brewer partly in his own right and partly as-' executor of Ebenezer Brewer, deceased, and the other three being held by Brewer in his own right; that in June .1876, Toomey agreed to loan Bobinson the sum of $12,000, and take' as security therefor a mortgage on said property: that this mortgage was executed to Isaac M. Pennock on June 8th 1876, and assigned by him on 'the 27th of said month to Toomey, when the said $12,000'was paid-; that prior to said loan and ' assignment, and as a consideration therefor, Brewer agreed with Toomey and Bobinson to satisfy the first mortgage so held by him, and to postpone the lien of the other three mortgages, <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>so that the Pennock mortgage, of which Toomey was the assignee, should be the first lien on said property; that the consideration of this agreement was the payment to Brewer of $5,650 of the said $12,000, and the additional transfer to him by said Eobinson of certain collateral security ; that in pursuance of such agreement, Brewer entered of record instruments of writing, postponing the second, third, and fourth mortgages, in the following form :</p>

Newmever, Esq.), was conflicting ; that for the complainant consisted of the evidence of Pennock, Eobinson and Stewart, and was to the effect that Brewer had made tlio agreement to satisfy the McNish mortgage with Eobinson, Pennock, and Stewart, Toomev’s attorney; that Toomey had taken the mortgage on Eobinson’s property on the faith of said agreement, and had paid to Brewer $5,650 of the $12,000 in consideration therefor. Brewer, who was the only witness in his own behalf, testified: “ I am at present a resident of Cleveland, Ohio.” He further testified that the agreement to postpone the second, third and fourth mortgages did not include the satisfaction of the first; that even if it had, the said agreement was made with Eobinson, and that Toomey was not privy thereto; that no consideration moved from Toomey to him to support the alleged agreement. He further contended as matter of law that the court had no juiisdiction ; that as he was a resident of Ohio, an adequate <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>remedy was afforded tlie complainant at common law under the' Act of March 31st 1823 (P.

Robinson states the terms of the agreement more specifically, and says that the McNish mortgage was to be sat- j isfied upon the payment to Brewer of five thousand, six hun-, dred and fifty dollars. Stewart’s testimony shows that he understood that Brewer agreed to satisfy the McNish mortgage, and that he paid the money believing it had been satisfied. The written postponements of the three mortgages recite that' it was the intention to make the mortgage assigned to Toomey' the first lien on the property therein described. This glance <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>at the testimony is not for vindication of the Master’s conclusions of fact, but for ascertainment whether Toomey was privy to the contract and paid out his money in consideration of the satisfaction and postponement of the prior mortgages. Unless Brewer alone remembers the truth upon the controlling points in the case, Toomey paid his money for the mortgage npon Brewer’s agreement to make it the first lien. The testimony against him is too strong to be discarded. He claims there was no privity between himself and Toomey. But Toomey’s attorney was present at the making of the contract that the Pennock mortgage should be made the first lien, and paid the money for it (Brewer receiving part), when he thought that contract had been accomplished.</p>

It matters not, that afterwards, he and Robinson.made a different application of the money, for they had no right to make a new arrangement to the prejudice of Toomey. Brewer, claiming that the McHish mortgage is unpaid and in force, it is within the province of a Court of Equity to compel him to perform his undertaking, which induced Toomey to pay his money.</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[267,1359,1164,213]]]'>Ho question arises whether the appellant had power to release or postpone the lien of a mortgage in favor of the estate of Ebenezer Brewer, deceased, for he was executor and actually-received the money on the mortgage to an amount exceeding the sum owing to the estate.</p>
    <p id="b436-6" data-blocks='[["BL_436.6",436,[269,1572,1163,726]]]'>The appellant denies jurisdiction in equity on the ground that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy under the Act of March 31st 1823, P. L. 216, which provides that where the legal holder of a mortgage has removed, or shall be out of the state, and payment being made of all the money or amount due, or to become due thereon, and shall so continue for two years, the mortgagor^ or the owner of the mortgaged premises, may petition the court of Common Pleas for a decree of satisfaction of the mortgage. It does not appear when Brewer became a resident of Ohio. He resided there at the time he testified, but he nowhere avers that he was a non resident of Pennsylvania when the action was begun. Toomey was neither the mortgagor nor owner of the mortgaged- premises when he brought suit. Without further note, it is plain that this case is not within the terms of the Act of 1823, and it is unnecessary to determine whether, if the plaintiff could have relief under that Act, his,bill in equity could be sustained.</p>
