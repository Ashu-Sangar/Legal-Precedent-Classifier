L. 311), contained the following provisions : “ The affairs of this corporation shall be managed by u Board of Directors, consisting of twelve members . . . who .shall have power to appoint other officers, and employ such agents, clerks and attorneys, as may be found necessary for the transaction of the business of said company, and shall . . make, execute and perfect such and so many bargains, policies and other instruments as shall or may be necessary.” “The president shall . . . have full power to examine, adjust and settle in all cases of loss not exceeding one hundred dollars. In all cases exceeding this amount, he may call to his assistance one or more directors as he may think necessary . . . aud shall have a general supervision over the affairs of the company.” A policyholder having sustained a loss exceeding in amount one hundred dollars, the president and two directors were appointed by the Board of Directors to “adjust” it. The president and one of the directors so appointed agreed with the assured that if he would reduce the amount of his claim, and surrender his policies, the company would release him from all further liability ou said policies for assessments. <em>Held:</em>

The fact that he has “ a general supervision over the affairs of the company” simply confers upon him authority in matters arising in the line of his ordinary duties. Not only is the power to make such an agreement as was made in this case withheld from the president, but under the provisions of the charter and the decision in Akers <em>v. </em>Hite, 13 Norris 394, that power could only be exercised by the directors collectively. They did not, even if they had the right, delegate this power to the president and the two directors.

In this general assessment, policies, Nos. 86 and 290 were embraced, the former to the amount of $246.88, and the latter of $48.</p>

    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[264,533,1161,511]]]'>We have no doubt, whatever, that an adjustment upon such terms was within the power of the company, and if so, that authority under the fourth section of the charter might be delegated, as it was in this case, to an adjusting committee of the board. The president had “ general supervision over the affairs of the company,” and a^one or with the concurrence- of any member of the board had full power to examine, adjust and settle in all cases of loss. This adjusting committee had as much power to effect a settlement of losses incurred as the board, and that power was derived from the same source; the action of the committee was not subject to the approval of the board of directors, the committee had “ full power.”</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[259,1044,1161,555]]]'>By the ninth section of the company’s charter it is provided that “any member can -withdraw from this company at any time, by paying his or her proportion of the losses up to the date of withdrawal, and surrendering his or her policy.” This surrender and settlement, it is alleged, was made and the policies properly cancelled and delivered to the president of the company. If this be true, and the jury have so found, the insurance relation was thereby broken, and no further liability remained as against either of the contracting parties. The proportion which the losses incurred bore to the whole amount insured'at the time of the loss, gave the ratio of the defendant’s liability to the loss, and thus a reasonably approximate estimate could at any time be made.</p>
    <p id="b266-6" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[255,1599,1161,460]]]'>Whether or not there was in fact an agreement to release the defendant’s policies from future assessments, was the specific question for the jury. The release, if given at all, covered both policies, and this defence was to the whole of the plaintiff’s claim. Mr. Stranahan’s testimony, upon this question was positive, he testified as to an existing fact of which he claimed to have actual knowledge. Mr. IToagland, in rebuttal, testifiled as positively, that no such fact existed, and although he testified in negative form, his assertion is positive in effect, that is to say, he testifies positively that no such transaction occurred with him.</p>

P. Kerr on the precise question before the jury. The court used language a little strong perhaps, in saying that the testimony of Mr. Kerr “ amounted to nothing in the shape of contradicting Mr. Stranahan,” if this was spoken of the entire testimony of both of these witnesses ; we think, however this language is subject to a qualification which is contained in the charge as a whole. <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>The vital question for the jury, as has been stated, was whether or not there was an agreement to release the policies from future assessments. Even if there was, in fact, a difficulty in the adjustment, such as Mr. Kerr referred to, arising out of Clingan’s alleged purchase, that was not at all inconsistent with the agreement; for the adjustment and abatement .made, might have been in consideration of either, or both of these together. The distinction between positive and negative testimony was carefully stated, and the jury was fully instructed as to the nature and effect of each ; it was certainly manifest to the jury that the reference of the court in the expression quoted was alone to the negative portion of Kerr’s testimony, and to this only was it applied.</p>
