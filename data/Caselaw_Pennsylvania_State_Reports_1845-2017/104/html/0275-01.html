As to the second, fifth and sixth assignments, it is unquestionably a rule of law that the railroad company acquires no rights as against the land owner until it gives him a bond. Prior to that time an entry upon the land for construction purposes is an unlawful act, a trespass. It follows that the owner’s dominion over the soil, and his right to make use of the same, continue in full force down to the moment at which the bond is given. The position of the defendant upon this subject, which amounts to this, that as soon as the owner knows the location is made, he is bound to cease using the ground embraced in the appropriation, is therefore absurd. The extent of this absurdity is shown by the fact that, as appears by the evidence admitted, the road in question was located in 1871, and not constructed till 1879. Should the plaintiffs have deprived themselves of the use of their land for these eight years and claimed damages for this deprivation ? But it may be said that, while they had the right to use the land until wanted, they took the risk of losing any crops which might be upon it when the bond should be given and construction of the road commenced. This, however, amounts to a practical deprivation of its use.

Corn and potatoes were then growing on it. They were probably planted in April or May. Their destruction in making the road was claimed as an item of damage. The evidence covered by the second assignment appears to have been admitted under the view that no damages should be allowed for this item, if the plaintiffs knew when planting them, that stakes indicating location, had previously been set there, and the defendant was engaged in constructing the road on adjoining lands.</p>
    <p id="b297-9" data-blocks='[["BL_297.7",297,[209,1055,1174,1201]]]'>This is a misapprehension of the law, under the undoubted facts of the case. Conceding that stakes had been set on the ground either in 1868 or 1869, or not until 1871, or at each time, as it is shown two lines were run, the defendant thereby, acquired no riglit to take possession and occupy the lands. Actual payment of damages or security therefor duly approved must precede the taking. The plaintiffs were under no legal obligation to refrain from using their property by reason of any expectation that the defendant might afterwards take it. Although the compensation is usually called damages, yet it is in fact the consideration or price of a privilege purchased. Until the company made a permanent location, it was not liable for damages under tlie statute. When these crops were planted it had not made such location, nor had it given the required security. The bond was not filed until in June 1879 ; whether before or after the land was taken, or when the bond was approved, does not appear. The defendant acquired no right to the possession until the security was approved by the court of Common Pleas. If the plaintiffs had refrained from using their lands for the eight or ten years which intervened between the running of the first line, and the final location of the road, it is very dear they could not have recovered damages for that interval of time. Until final location was made, the defendant was not in position to compel a sale of the privilege. Without payment or security it had no right to take possession. Prior thereto the plaintiffs’ full right to the enjoyment of their property remained unimpaired. It follows the court erred in receiving the evidence covered by the second assignment.</p>
