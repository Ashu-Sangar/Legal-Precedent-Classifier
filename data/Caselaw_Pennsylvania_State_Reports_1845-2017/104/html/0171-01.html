In an application to the Court of Common Pleas to have a judgment marked satisfied, under the Act of March 14th 1876 (P. L. 7), it is essential to aver that actual payment of the judgment has been made in full. An allegation of set-oil to the full amount of the judgment will not bring the application within the operation of the Act.</p>

In such an. application, a petitioner set out that the judgment was not fully paid, but that he claimed a set ofE to the amount remaining due thereon, which the plaintiff in said judgment refused to allow.

    <p class="summary" id="b189-8" data-blocks='[["BL_189.6",189,[204,923,1163,472]]]'>“ The Act of 14th of March 1876, provides for the granting such rules, and further that should it appear to the satisfaction of the court that the judgment has been fully paid as set forth iu the application, the court shall direct the prothonotary to mark of record the satisfaction of the judgment. We think this Act only contemplates actual payment, and not cases where there are disputes as to whether claims or accounts in independent transactions between the parties should operate as credits on the <em>judgments, </em>— e. <em>g. </em>this case. No court would like to assume such responsibility. They could frame an issue, however, and call in the aid of a jury to determine the fact.</p>

In Speakman’s Appeal, 71 Pa. St. R. 25, it is said : ‘ An Auditor’s finding, if not supported by evidence, will be disregarded, but like a verdict must stand unless clearly against the weight of the evidence.’ Had the question of fact in the present case been submitted to a jury we should not have disturbed the verdict had it been the same as the finding of the commissioner. Apart from this, he had the witnesses before him, examined them at length, and had better means of coming to a conclusion than we who have only the written testimony. We shall not disturb his finding for the reason given, and the same being adverse to the plaintiff and in support of the petitioner the rule must be made absolute.</p>

    <p id="b190-8" data-blocks='[["BL_190.9",190,[231,839,1165,600]]]'>The power vested in the courts by the Act of March 14th 1876, P. L. 7, in relation to the entry of satisfaction of judgments which have been fully paid by the defendants, being in derogation of the right of trial by jury, must be strictly construed, and, therefore, limited to cases of actual payment in full. To hold that everything which could be given in evidence under the plea of payment in the trial of a pending suit, shall be treated as actual payment after judgment, would be a wide departure from the letter and spirit of the Act: Felt <em>v. </em>Cook, <a href="/pa/95/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="95 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="492879" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0247-01">95 Pa. St. 247</a>. The Act is intended only for cases where it is clear that the judgment has been paid ; to give a summary remedy when the facts are undisputed. It does not apply when there is a substantial dispute about the facts: Horton <em>v. </em>Hopf, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.N.C.%20381" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 W.N.C. 381">4 W.

    <p id="b190-9" data-blocks='[["BL_190.10",190,[229,1438,1159,384]]]'>In the application of the defendant he set ont that the plaintiff’s judgments were not fully paid, that he claimed the right to sot off a debt upon book-account, and that the plaintiff refused to allow the set off- The plaintiff’s answer to the rule to show cause stated his reasons for that refusal, and prayed the court to discharge the rule. But the court appointed a commissioner to take testimony, and afterwards the attorneys “ agreed that the commissioner, in addition to taking testimony, report the facts to the court with his opinion.”</p>
    <p id="b190-10" data-blocks='[["BL_190.11",190,[228,1822,1160,598]],["BL_191.1",191,[183,409,1173,546]]]'>Upon the facts set forth in the application, it was error to grant the rule to show cause. Taken as true, they made a case not within the operation of the statute. When the answer was filed the rule ought to have been discharged ; but instead, the court appointed a commissioner to take testimony. It does not appear that the parties consented to such appointment, or to a reference. They agreed that the commissioner might also report the. facts with his opinion ; not that he should determine whether a book account should be set off against the plaintiff's judgments. They might have made an agreement that he should act as arbitrator or referee; no set form of words or technical phrases were requisite for the making of it, but such Avords or acts were requisite as Avould clearly sIioav a submission. Erom the commencement of the proceeding it affirmatively ap<a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>peared that there was no case for the appointment of a commissioner, and that the piaintitf refused to allow the defendant’s claim. Then, it ought not to be interred from bis agreement respecting the commissioner’s report that the plaintiff submitted the dispute to a referee. It mattered not to him whether the commissioner or the court found the facts from the testimony, for neither had power to determine the controversy under the Act of 1876. The learned judge of the common pleas rightly concluded that this case was not within the intendment of the Act, but we think lie erred in ruling that the parties created their own tribunal for disposition of the case, aud thereupon ordering satisfaction of the judgments to be entered.</p>
