In each case the right to sell is suspended until the trial of the issue, but the creditor’s vested lien cannot be affected by the interlocutory order. The bond of indemnity which the court required the defendant to give, on staying the writ, was a cumulative remedy, and was appropriate to protect the plaintiff in case of intervening loss or destruction of the goods by fire, depreciation, robbery or misappropriation pending the issue, during which the defendant’s custody was substituted for that of the sheriff, though theoretically the goods remained in custody of the law: Bain <em>v. </em>Lyle, 18 P.

The opening of a judgment, as said in the Kittanning Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Scott, 5 Out. 449, may leave the judgment in full force for all purposes but execution; but, for that purpose, a new judgment must be rendered. When a judgment is opened, it does not remain a final judgment, and only a final judgment can support an execution; and a lien as to chattels results from the execution. When judgment is obtained in cases where the original has been opened, it is a new judgment, and may be for a different amount than the original one. In such a case, execution necessarily issues on the" last judgment. In this case, the judgment opened was for $923 ; and the judgment entered after verdict and trial, was for $822. A writ of venditioni exponas, issued on the original, would have been irregular and erroneous, and any issue of execution on the new one obtained after trial, would have necessarily been a fieri facias, and the issuing of such fieri facias under the authorities in this state, would have been an abandonment of levy on writ on former judgment. To hold, under the facts in this case, that the levy on execution on former judgment still remained a lien,-after trial and anew judgment, would be an anomaly. If the lien of the levy remained unaffected by the order of the court opening the judgment, it is clear that the order left the sheriff in the legal custody of the goods levied on mider the writ: and if he parted in any way with such possession, by a relinquishment of the same to Van Doren, the assignee of Sample, he became liable for the amount of the value of the levy: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Contner, 6 Harris 444, 445 and 446. The bond of indemnity, unlike an interpleader bond, was made to the plaintiffs, and its condition covered any damage in the loss of the fruits of the levy, from any cause whatsoever.</p>

The very question was raised on the record on distribution of the proceeds of the goods which were sold' on a subsequent writ, and the money was awarded to the first writ upon the express ground that the lien was not lost. The same doctrine was again declared in Bain <em>v. </em>Lyle, 18 P. F. S. 60, and although in that case a bond had been given for the return of the goods, it was held to be no substitute for the <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>goods, and that the lien of the execution was not discharged. In Kightlinger’s Appeal, 5 Out. 540, these cases were recognized as full authority for the rule, and would certainly have been applied had the circumstances of that case required it. It was unnecessary to do so, but only because an order continuing the lien had been made when the stay of proceedings was granted. The rule itself was vindicated by Woodward, J., in Batdorff <em>v. </em>Focht &amp; Brother, by the proposition that the lien of a ñ. fa. after levy is a vested lien which cannot be impaired by an interlocutory order. Although, as was there said, it is the usual and proper practice, to direct that the lien shall remain, when a stay is ordered, it was held to bo unnecessary. The judge said, “But where, as in this case, it-is omitted, the lien must, nevertheless, be regarded as preserved, for it is one of the vested legal rights of the plaintiff, and can no more be sacrificed by an edict of the court without a hearing than any. of his other civil rights, whether of liberty or property.” This reasoning is so entirely satisfactory that it need not be extended. In Batdorff <em>v. </em>Focht, and in Kightlinger's Appeal the lien was made effective by awarding priority to the writs in the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the goods upon subsequent writs, although in the latter case an interval of nearly four years elapsed between the granting and discharge of the rule to open the judgment. In Bain <em>v. </em>Lyle an execution against Austin was levied upon goods which were claimed by Corry. The latter gave an interpleader bond to the sheriff, and the goods were thereupon delivered to him. Subsequently they were sold on an execution against Corry, and purchased by a stranger. The interpleader issue being decided in favor of Austin, it was held he might follow the goods in the hands of the purchaser at the last sale. This, of course, was upon the theory that the original execution creditor could not be deprived of his recourse to the goods, notwithstanding they had been given up to the adverse claimant upon his substituting an interpleader bond in their place._ In the present case the bond given was a general indemnity bond only, and in no sense a substitute for the goods. It was for indemnity against all damages which might be sustained by reason of the order staying proceedings. It contained no provision for a return of the goods. It is plain then that if any of the goods originally levied upon still remained in the possession of the defendant in the execution, or of his assignee, for the benefit of creditors, who is merely his representative (In re Fulton’s Est., 1 P. F. S. 204), it was the right of the plaintiff to seize them by another writ, and 'sell them in satisfaction of his claim. If they had passed to an assignee in bankruptcy, which does not appear in the testimony, they would still be subject to the lien of the <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>levy originally made. The offer of proof was somewhat indefinite, but in substance it was proposed to show the value of the goods which remained subject to the levy at the time of the final judgment, and that the plaintiffs could have realized the greater part of their judgment out of personal property which remained subject to the levy. This offer was rejected on the ground that the lien of the execution was dischargedand that the property had passed to an assignee for the benefit of creditors, and afterward to an assignee in bankrnptey. This was an insufficient objection, and the learned court below was in error in rejecting the offer, and the judgment must therefore be reversed.- The evidence offered was material because it might show that the sureties in the indemnity bond were released in whole or in part by. the omission of the plaintiffs to seize and sell the remaining goods. We cannot pass upon that question any further at this time, because the evidence is not before us. It is enough to know that a total or partial discharge might be the result of the admission of the rejected testimony.</p>
