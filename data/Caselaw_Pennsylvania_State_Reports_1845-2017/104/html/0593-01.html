Upon its execution, the said William Scott produced the certificate in question and after remarking that he had never had a settlement with his brother Andrew in their business relations, expressed a wish to assign $4,000 of this deposit to him. lie, therefore, requested Marshall to write the indorse, merit in question and when this was done, signed and handed it to Marshall with the remark that “he should take it with him and put it in his safe; that it was for Andrew Scott.” Marshall look the certificate thus indorsed with him, retained it in his office until after the testator’s death, which occurred several months later, and then handed it to Andrew Scott.</p>

The donor delivered the certificate to Marshall, with the instruction to take it, that it was for the donee. This was evidently an instruction to deliver it, the only delivery that the donor, a dying man, could possibly make. To constitute a valid gift it need not be delivered to the donee by the donor, but as in this case, it may be given to some third person for the donee’s use, and this will be a valid delivery: Allen <em>v. </em>Cowan, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20Barb.%20101" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="28 Barb. 101">28 Barb. 101</a>; Pringle <em>v. </em>Pringle, 9 P. F. S. 281. But the transaction was more than a gift. It was an instrument executed under seal, having as its consideration the obligation of the donor to the donee for past services. It was a solemn promise to pay $4,000 in settlement of a debt, and, as such, should have been sustained.</p>
