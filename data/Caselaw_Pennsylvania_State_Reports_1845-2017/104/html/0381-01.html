In the distribution of the estates of foreign decedents, the rights of domestic creditors must be protected in the courts of this state; but in the case of an assignment by a foreign insolvent for the benefit of his creditors, a widely different policy has been pursued. The fact that <em>a </em>statute of limitation of the state of the insolvent’s domicile runs after three years, and has been pleaded in bar of a claim of a creditor of this state by the assignees, does not raise any equity in such creditor to claim distribution of the fund in this state for his protection.</p>

Robb, Esq., as Examiner and Master, who reported the facts to be substantially as follows : Charles Smith, of New Brunswick, New Jersey, died on May 18th 1848, leaving a will in which he bequeathed to Fitz Randolph Smith and Charles Smith Olden, of Princeton, certain bonds, mortgages, &amp;e., in trust to pay the income thereof to his nephew, Charles Gardiner Smith, during his life; to Charles’ wife, Martha McDowell Smith, in case she should survive him, during her life; and after Üie death of Charles Gardiner Smith and his said wife, to apply the income to the support, maintenance and education of the children of his said nephew, until they should severally arrive at the age of twenty-one years, and as they arrived at that age, respectively, to pay to each of said children one equal share of the fund with its accumulations. Charles Gardiner Smith died November 2d 1870, leaving to survive him his wife Martha McD. Smith, a citizen of Pennsylvania, and five children. George G. Smith, one of these children, was a citizen of Maryland, and having become insolvent, made a voluntary assignment under the insolvent laws of that state on April 22d 1874, to McDowell, McAtee and Embry, the complainants in the bill. By this assignment Smith conveyed <em>“ </em>all and singular the real and personal property of which he was then possessed wheresoever situate, together with all and singular his interest and estates of every kind and description wheresoever situate, including real estate described in the deed, &amp;c., and also all money due and payable to him, and all moneys thereafter to become due and payable on and by all and singular all notes, bills, bonds, judgments and mortgages then held by or made payable to him.” There was no particular mention made of the property in New Jersey. This deed was duly recorded in'Washington county, Maryland, the assignor’s domicile, on April 22d 1874, and in Pennsylvania in the year 1878, but was never recorded in New Jersey. On October 5th 1874, George G. Smith joined with his brothers and sisters in an assignment to liis <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>mother, Martha McD. Smith, of all their interest in remainder' in the trust fund held by Fitz Randolph Smith and Charles Smith Olden. Mrs. Smith had then full knowledge of this previous assignment for the benefit of his creditors, and knew of it as early as June 18th 1874 when she purchased part of his real estate in Maryland from his assignees, McDowell et al. On December 18th 1874, Martha McD. Smith filed a bill in the Court of Chancery, New Jersey, against Charles Olden, the surviving trustee under her husband’s will and all of her children. The assignees of George G. Smith were not parties to this bill. Subsequently, on February 16th 1875, the Court of Chancery made a final decree that the said fund amounting to $59,819.15 should be paid to her; and in pursuance of this decree she received that amount from Olden, the trustee. At this time George G. Smith was indebted to his mother to the amount of $29,885.69, over $11,000 of which was represented by his notes on which she was liable as indorser. George G. Smith’s share of the $59,819.15 received by Mrs. Smith amounted to $11,963.89, and this amount was appropriated by her principally to the payment of his debts for which she was herself liable. George G. Smith’s indebtedness to his Maryland creditors was also large, amounting to about $40,000. After the filing of the present bill Martha McD. Smith presented her claim as a creditor of George G. Smith to his Maryland assignees, the present plaintiffs. The courts of that state held, however, that her claim was barred by the statute of limitations there in force.</p>

The effect of the assignment made by Geo. G. Smith, was to withdraw his property in Pennsylvania, where the statutory limitation is six years, from seizure for debts existing there. It is contended, therefore, that it would be inequitable and unjust to compel her to relinquish the fund iu her hand, in order to its removal into a foreign jurisdiction, where her clear rights may thus be disregarded and defeated by the absolute bar of a foreign statute, and that as a Pennsylvaniacréditor she is entitled to protection against such a result.</p>

The same rule has been observed, in the distribution of a fund arising from the transfer of property made under coercion of the law, iu any form, as an assignment in involuntary bankruptcy, or of a fund in the hands of a receiver. In all such cases, the transfer being in invitum, by process abroad, it will be regarded" only so far as it is not inconsistent with the i-ights and claims of our own citizens: Lowry <em>v. </em>Hall, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20131" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 131">2 W. &amp; S. 131</a>. But in the case of a voluntary assignment for creditors, no such rule has ever been recognized&lt; in this state; on the contrary, as shown by numerous decisions, and by the provisions of the Act of 1855, a widely different policy has been pursued. If the owner of personal goods or estate in Pennsylvania, may, at the place of his domicile in a foreign state, bona fide and for valuable consideration, dispose of the same, receiving and placing the consideration within his own control, and this he may undoubtedly do, he may certainly with like effect convey his estate to the benefit of his creditors here and elsewhere. As stated by Chief Justice Gibson in Lowry <em>v. </em>Hall, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20131" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 131">2 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 131</a>: “ The voluntary transfer of a chattel by the debtor, if not forbidden in other respects by the law at the place of the situs, is to be as <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>much regarded there or elsewhere as it would be at the place of the domicile.”</p>
    <p id="b405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[162,490,1168,718]]]'>Whilst an extra-territorial effect is almost denied to an assignment made compulsorily, to one voluntarily made, ex mero motu, by a failing debtor, full effect is always given, not only in Pennsylvania but in the other states of the Union ; a failing debtor has the right to make such legal disposition of his property among his creditors, as lie may elect. Mr. Justice Story in his Conflict of Laws § 111, says : “It is therefore admitted that a voluntary assignment, by a party, made according to the law of his domicile, will pass the personal estate, whatever may be its locality, abroad as well as at home. The law distinguishes that which results from the exercise of power under the law, from that which comes from the free will of the party ; the former is limited in its effect to the country where the law is in force, whilst the latter is given universal and general operation, under the comity of nations: Speed <em>v. </em>May, supra; Dundas <em>v. </em>Bowler, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20McLean%20397" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 McLean 397">3 McLean 397</a>; Livermore <em>v. </em>Jenckes, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Howard%20126" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="21 Howard 126">21 Howard 126</a>.</p>
