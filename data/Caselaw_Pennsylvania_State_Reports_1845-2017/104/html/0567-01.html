That Act does not apply where the words would have created, prior to its passage, a sole and separate estate in equity. Since that Act, the equitable estate has often been referred to as a married woman’s “ separate” estate: Todd’s Appeal, 12 Har. 431; Wright <em>v. </em>Brown, 8 Wr. 238; Twining’s Appeal, 1 Out. 41. The question is, what estate was conveyed by the deed ? Not whether the grantor ought, under the circumstances, to have conveyed a fee simple.</p>

The real consideration was payment of the father’s debt as guardian, and he had no right to restrict the conveyance. If the words used have that effect, equity will reform the deed. But we contend they do not have that effect, but convey a separate estate at law under the Act of 1848. There is no creation of any trust, or disposition of any remainder, and no intention expressed or implied to create a technical equitable estate. In many cases, words stronger than these have been held to convey a fee simple: Heath <em>v. </em>Knapp, 4 Barr 228; Krause <em>v. </em>Beitlel, <a href="/rawle/3/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Rawle 199" data-case-ids="1822531" data-case-paths="/rawle/3/0199-01">3 Rawle 199</a>; Torbert <em>v. </em>Twining, <a href="/yeates/1/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Yeates 432" data-case-ids="6776121" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0432-01">1 Yeates 432</a>; Morrison <em>v. </em>Dollar Savings Bank, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20Leg.%20Int.%20215" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="36 Leg.

    <p id="b585-11" data-blocks='[["BL_585.13",585,[184,1904,1165,426]]]'>The only question presented by this record is whether the deed from Jehu P. Smith to his daughter Margaret, created a sole and separate use for the said Margaret. The conveyance is to the said Margaret, her heirs and assigns, “ as the separate estate of the said Margaret.” -The same expression occurs in the habendum clause of the deed, which is as follows: “ To have and to hold the said land .... unto the said party of the second part, her heirs and assigns, for the only proper use and behoof of the said party of the second part, her heirs and assigns forever, as the separate estate of said Margaret E.

In Todd’s Appeal, 12 Harris 429, it was said: “ That expression always refers to an equitable estate held by somebody in trust for a married woman.” In Penn’a Co. for Ins. on Lives <em>v. </em>Foster, 11 Casey 134, it was held that the Act of 1848 created a separate legal estate as distinguished from a separate equitable estate, and that the Act does not enable a married woman to dispose of property held by a trustee for her separate use. This conveyance was not to a trustee, but directly to Mrs. Aiken. . This, however, is not material, for it was held in Wright <em>v. </em>Brown, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20224" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Wright 224">8 Wright 224</a>, that the wife’s interest is the same whether the gift is to her directly or to a trustee for her. We are, however, relieved of the discussion of the question whether if this had been a settlement by the grantor upon his daughter, the words in the deed would have created a sole and separate use. This was not in any sense a settlement. The grantor was the guardian of his daughter, and the conveyance shows upon its face that it was in consideration of the ward’s money in his hands. Under such circumstances it was not in the power of the grantor to impose a separate use trust upon the grant, or any clog upon it whatever, without his daughter’s consent. She was a purchaser for value. It is true, the additional consideration of “ natural love and affection” is mentioned in the deed, but this is of no importance, as the case stated does not show that the property was worth a dollar more than the money consideration named. The case was argued upon the theory that the property was worth considerably more than the $1,300, specified as the indebtedness of the grantor to his ward. This, however, is outside of the record, and we cannot regard it.</p>

There is nothing upon the record to show Mrs. Aiken’s consent to such an arrangement. On the contrary, the agreement of herself and husband to convey the land to the plaintiff in error in fee is conclusive that she declines to be bound by the restriction.</p>
