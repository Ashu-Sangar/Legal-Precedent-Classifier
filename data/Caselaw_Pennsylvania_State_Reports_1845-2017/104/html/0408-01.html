If they imposed such duties upon him, and gave him such powers, limited only by Pis discretion, they are liable for injuries resulting from an act of his, clearly incident to the performance of his duties, in the scope of his employment. He stood in their place. If the libel was written under the authority of his employment and in furtherance of their business, they are responsible whether the wrong resulted from his mere negligence or from a wanton and reckless purpose to accomplish the business in an unlawful manner : Howe <em>v. </em>Newmarch, <a href="/mass/94/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="12 Allen 49" data-case-ids="1196967" data-case-paths="/mass/94/0049-01">12 Allen 49</a>; Ramsden <em>v. </em>Boston &amp; Albany R.

If Palmer were still living be might be sued jointly with them for this libel, or he and they might be sued separately : Odgers on Libel and Slander.*157, *294.

    <p id="b431-6" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[181,1144,1160,858]]]'>It is true it has been held that express malice in an employee who has written a libel, cannot be invoked to swell the damages against the employer, if ho <em>was </em>ignorant of the publication and not negligent: Detroit Post Co. <em>v. </em>McArthur, <a href="/mich/16/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="16 Mich. 447" data-case-ids="1945557" data-case-paths="/mich/16/0447-01">16 Mich. 447</a>: Scripps <em>v. </em>Reilly, 38 Id. 10; Robertson <em>v. </em>Wylde, 2 Moo. &amp; <a href="/citations/?q=Robards%20101" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="Robards 101">Rob. 101</a>. It was, however, held in Goddard <em>v. </em>Grand Trank Railway Co., <a href="/me/57/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="57 Me. 202" data-case-ids="634568" data-case-paths="/me/57/0202-01">57 Me. 202</a>, that whenever exemplary damages would be recoverable, if the act had been done by the master himself, they are equally recoverable when the act is done by his servant. So in Wood on Master and Servant § 323, it is said, “ in many instances it has been held not only that the master is liable for the wanton and malicious acts of his servant in the execution of the authority given him by the master, but also, that in all such cases the wantonness and malice may be shown to enhance the damages,” citing Hawes <em>v. </em>Knowles, supra. This conclusion flows logically from the ground on which the liability of the master rests. If he so authorizes the act, that he commits it through the agency of another, he cannot claim exemption from any of the legal consequences flowing from the act.</p>

The proprietors do not always reside in the city in which the paper is published. They may be in foreign countries much of their time. They direct as to the general course to be pursued; but do not restrict the writers as to the specific means by which the desired end shall be attained. If the proprietors are asked to give the name of the author of any article, they refuse to do so, and a person aggrieved, as a general rule, has no means of <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>ascertaining the name of the writer. If they are not held responsible for what they cause to be written and published, every person connected therewith may escape those punitive damages which the law frequently imposes. As was said in Barr <em>v. </em>Moore, 6 Norris 385 “the liberty of the press should at all times be justly guarded and protected ; but so should the reputation of an individual against calumny. The right of each is too valuable to be encroached on by the other.”</p>

It follows that evidence was admissible to prove, for the purpose of swelling the damages, the careless, reckless or wanton conduct of the employee in writing the article, in execution of authority given him by the defendants. Under their plea of not guilty, the defendants may. prove, in mitigation of damages, the facts and circumstances which induced the writer to erroneously make the charge, provided such facts and circumstances do not tend to prove the truth of the charge made.</p>
    <p id="b432-7" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[267,1176,1157,432]]]'>It follows, from reasons already given, the learned judge erred in charging substantially as matter of law, that if the defendants had no personal knowledge of the article before it was published, and afterwards in good faith, did what was reasonable to make amends and reparation, it was not a case for punitive damages. If the facts were found as stated they were for the jury to consider in mitigation of damages; but they should not be considered alone, as controlling such damages. They should be considered in connection with all the other evidence submitted to the jury justly tending to enhance the damages.</p>

The language of the article did not expressly charge any fraudulent or corrupt conduct or motives. In the declaration the plaintiff put his construction on the meaning of the language used. The learned judge charged if the jury found the meaning to be as there averred, it was libelous. The plaintiff has no just cause of complaint with this answer, besides the jury found the language to be libelous. There is no merit in the 5th assignment.</p>
