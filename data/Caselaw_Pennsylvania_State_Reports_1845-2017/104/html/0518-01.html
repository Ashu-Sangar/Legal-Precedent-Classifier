While the arrangement with the bank and the circumstances under which the judgment was given were well enough, the subsequent portion of the offer, by which it was proposed to show that the bank permitted Sunderman’s property to be sold for a price greatly below its value, was clearly inadmissible. It was no defence. The learned judge below might have separated the wheat' from the chaff, but he did not do so, and, under all the authorities, he was not bound to do so.</p>
    <p id="b537-6" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[180,845,1162,87]]]'>Nor is there any merit in the second assignment. It was entirely competent to show what the judgment was given for.</p>

    <p id="b537-8" data-blocks='[["BL_537.6",537,[245,1188,943,43]]]'>The point is an interesting one, but it is not raised.</p>

A reservation of a point upon all the evidence is bad. A reserved point must be based upon facts admitted in the cause or found by the jury. We have said this so often that a reference to the cases is unnecessary.</p>
