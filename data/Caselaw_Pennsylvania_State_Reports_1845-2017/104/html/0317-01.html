She afterwards left Wimer’s home and became a charge on Worth township. Its overseers of the poor applied to Wimer for the expenses of her maintenance, whereupon he gave them the bond recited above, by which he agreed that in consideration of the maintenance of the pauper by the township, and her burial after death, and a release of his liability in the premises, he would pay the township $1,500 in ten annual instalments of $150 each. Upon the execution of .this bond, the overseers gave Wimer a written release, which purported to extinguish all further liability on his part for the care of said pauper. Eleanor Hines lived seven years after this arrangement was made, and during that time was maintained by the township, and then buried at its expense. Wimer paid seven of the annual instalments, and it was admitted that the amount so paid exceeded that incurred by the township in the care of said pauper. Wimer refused to pay the remaining three instalments falling due after her death, claiming that the overseers had no power to make the agreement, and also that it was without consideration.

    <p id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[243,736,1163,642]]]'>An act of a municipal corporation, done in an attempt to exercise power not possessed by it, is void. There is no distinction iu reason between the cases of entire absence of enactment conferring power, and a prohibition of its exercise beyond a certain limit. In one case power is not granted, in the other it is expressly withheld, and in each there is a total absence of authority: McPherson <em>v. </em>Foster Bros., <a href="/iowa/43/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="43 Iowa 48" data-case-ids="2310611" data-case-paths="/iowa/43/0048-01">43 Iowa 48</a>. The object of a municipal corporation is municipal government, and what this means is not learned from business usage, but from the legislation of the state. Hence there is a tendency to limit the contracts of municipal corporations much more strictly than the contracts of private corporations. But when a municipal corporation is authorized to perforin certain business duties, as to issue bonds or subscribe stock, it may be estopped by false recitals, as against bona fide purchasers: 1 Whart. Cont. § 143</p>
    <p id="b336-5" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[240,1376,1163,681]]]'>Here there can be no pretence of legislative authority for making the contract. It concerns nothing but the care and support of a pauper, and the sole and entire duty of the overseers is to provide for the poor of the district. They could not relieve Wimer, wholly or partly, from his obligation to maintain the pauper during life; they had no right to exact from him a greater sum than reasonably necessary for her maintenance. Wimer obtained by his contract with the'overseers, an empty promise, binding neither them nor their successors in office. If they-obtained a promise in the bond for less than Wimer was already bound to pay, he was not relieved ; if for more, it is a speculation they should not be permitted to enforce. At the date of the contract it was the duty of the overseers to provide for the pauper and collect the expenses from Wimer. Where is the consideration for a promise to pay more than the expenses ?</p>

Such promise adds nothing to and takes nothing from the original obligation. Even a promise to pay a specific sum on account of a liability for unliquidated damages is invalid, unless the promise be conditioned upon some new consideration, such as delay or forbearance or release. A promise cannot be conditioned on a promise to do a thing to which a party is already legally <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>bound; for instance, a promise to pay a witness extra fees for his attendance at court is invalid: 1 Whar. Cont. §§ 489. 500. See Robb Adm’r <em>v. </em>Mann, <a href="/pa/11/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="11 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="404658" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0300-01">11 Pa.

    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[176,529,1167,803]]]'>The overseers were legally bound to do just what they agreed to do and all that they did for the pauper. Wimer was legally bound to pay all their expenses for the pauper, and he has paid them. This is not a simple question of capacity to contract where a party having had the benefit of a contract with a corporation attempts to deny its validity. Remark is unnecessary to distinguish it from the case of a party who borrowed money from a corporation and seeks to avoid payment on the ground that the corporation had no authority to lend the money. This is the case of a quasi municipal corporation created for the purpose of making necessary provision for poor persons within its territory, that did no more for a pauper than was required of it by law, that has received payment from one who owed support to the pauper, and from whom the distinct could lawfully collect the expenses, and that now seeks to recover a sum in excess of the expenses upon a void contract on the ground that it performed its part of the contract in the mere performance of its statutory duty. We are of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</p>
