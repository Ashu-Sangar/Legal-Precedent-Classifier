    <p id="b321-6" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[158,531,1172,1033]]]'>1This was not a county bridge. The bridge built by the township had been swept away by a freshet. This contract was to rebuild on the same site. We think it was clearly within the general power of the supervisors to contract for the erection thereof. It was, however, an act requiring such deliberation, and the exercise of such judgment, as to call for the action and assent of both supervisors. Both of them were a party to this contract. Having a general power over the subject matter in the unquestioned performance of their duty, the contractor was not required to run around and inquire of the tax-payers, whether they still owed road-taxes, and whether they desired to pay the same by work on the proposed bridge. He had a right to assume the supervisors were faithfully discharging their duty in making the contract, and that the taxes laid for road purposes had either been paid in work, or that the tax-payers preferred to pay the same in money. It is a well known fact that many do prefer to pay in money. The question now is not between the township and tax-payers. The latter are not here complaining that they were deprived of an opportunity of paying their taxes in labor. It is an attempt by the same authorities who made the contract with the builder of the bridge,, after he has fulfilled his contract, and the township has received the benefit thereof, to repudiate the contract but to continue in the full enjoyment of the contractor’s work and expenditure.</p>
