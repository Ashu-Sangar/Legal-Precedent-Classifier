In 1876, A. and B. owned a joint and undivided interest in a certain leasehold estate in a tract of land upon which buildings had been erected. The said lessees sublet the rooms in said buildings to other parties. They agreed between themselves that A. should have charge of the lower front rooms of the building, lease the same, collect the rents therefor, etc., and that B. should have a similar charge over the rear and upper rooms. This arrangement, which was simply for purposes of convenience, did not affect their joint ownership, as eacli recognized the undivided interest of the other in the whole lease. In October 1879, A. leased one of the rooms under his care to C. for a term to expire April 1st 1880. He collected the rent, and signed a receipt therefor in the name of “A. &amp; B. per A.” On December 31st 1879, C. received from B. a notice to quit on the expiration of his term. On going to A. for an explanation, O. was referred by him to B., who renewed the lease for another year. On June 30th 1880, A. sold his undivided interest in said leasehold to D. &amp; E. On December 31st 1880, D. &amp; E. served tlie following notice on O.:</p>

In an action by D. &amp; E. to oust O. under the Landlord and Tenant’s Act of December 14th 1863, the judge, under this state of facts, submitted the question to the jury whether 0., under his contract of December 31st 1879, was the tenant of A. or of B.; charging them that in the former event, A. having parted with his interest to D. <em>&amp; </em>E., O. would be estopped from denying their title, and the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover :</p>

The premises were afterwards sublet, by Rambler &amp; Landis, for a term of twenty-two years. The latter term, expiring on the first of April 1881, was, in the year 1876, held by David Detwiler and J acob W. Stofer, equally, and in common. Buildings had been erected thereon, and the several rooms therein were, by Detwiler and Stofer, leased from year to year for business purposes. Detwiler acquired his interest in the sublease in 1876, and shortly afterwards, it was agreed between Detwiler and Stofer, that Detwiler should take charge of the front part, collect the rents, provide tenants, &amp;c., and that Stofer should take charge of the rear and the upstairs of the building. There was no partition in the ownership; the care of the rooms, and the distribution of the rents, were thus provided for, and settlements avoided ; they <em>“ </em>called it square.”</p>

In October 1879, Detwiler leased one of the rooms under his care, to' George Wenger, for a term, to expire on the 1st day of April, 1880, at the rate of $50 per annum. Wenger went into the possession, and on the 16th February 1880, paid a portion of the rent to Detwiler, who gave a receipt in the following form:</p>

In other words, was the lease renewed through Mr. Stofer, or Mr. Detwiler, or was the lease made between Mr. Wenger and Mr. Stofer, as if Mr. Detwiler had nothing to do with it? Was Mr..Stofer at that time substituted, in accordance with the arrangement of the parties, as the landlord of Mr. Wenger? or did he assume to become the landlord of Mr. Wenger at that time, and did he rent the premises to him, as if they belonged to himself ?”</p>

There was no sufficient evidence to justify the submission of such a question to the jury. The history of the cause, from the beginning to the end, the notice to quit, the complaint upon which the suit depends, the proceedings before the justice, which by agreement constitute the pleadings in this case, abundantly show that Stofer and Detwiler were not only the joint owners, but the lessors of the property to Wenger. The affidavit of Raymond &amp; Campbell, which is the foundation of the whole proceeding, is clear and explicit in its recitals as follows:</p>
    <p id="b53-6" data-blocks='[["BL_53.4",53,[213,886,1165,342]]]'>“ That the said Jacob W. Stofer and David A.

    <p id="b53-8" data-blocks='[["BL_53.6",53,[212,1401,1163,553]]]'>The facts of this case are altogether different from those in Holt <em>v. </em>Martin, 1 P. F. S. 499, and the law governing its determination is therefore different. This is not the case of a lease, by an agent, for an undisclosed principal, as in the case of Holt <em>v. </em>Martin, supra, and in Seyfert <em>v. </em>Bean, 2 Norris 450. Here, the ownership was open, disclosed, recognized and admitted. The transaction was plain and unmistakable. In October 1879, Detwiler made the contract with Wenger, and the rent Avas paid to and receipted by him, in the name of Detwiler &amp; Stofer. In December following, Stofer made the contract by the direction of Detwiler, and, now the effort is to show what Avas expressly refused in Holt <em>v. </em>Martin and Seyfert <em>v. </em>Bean, 2 N. 450, viz.: that Stofer was only the agent of Detwiler.</p>

It was explicit and clear, however, in this, that possession was demanded at the expiration of the lease. This was sufficient. .</p>
