J.) found the facts of the case to be, briefly, as follows : — John Bardsley, the plaintiff, was a depositor in and creditor of The Allegheny Savings Bank at the date of its suspension October 8th 1877, at which time the balance due. and owing him by the bank was $2,035.34. The Allegheny Savings Bank was a copartnership association in which the copartners were individually liable for the debts. George Lysle was one of the copartners ; and at the date of his death, January 12th 1877, was the owner of- two shares of the capital stock of the Savings Bank. By his will, duly proved January 25th 1877, he appointed the defendants his executors, and they duly administered his estate in accordance with the provisions of his said will. On October 8th 1877, a creditor’s petition in bankruptcy was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, against the members of The Allegheny Savings Bank, including the defendants as executors of said George Lysle ; setting forth that the association was insolvent or in contemplation of bankruptcy and praying that thejr might be adjudged bankrupts under the Act of Congress of March 2d 1867. To this petition the executors of George Lysle filed a plea setting forth “ that said George Lysle, the elder, died on January 13th 1877 and that letters testamentary upon the estate of said decedent were granted to these respondents by the register of wills of said Allegheny county, whereby the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court of said county attached and was and is now over said estate.” And further, <em>“ </em>that before and at the time when said petition by said Davidson was filed in this case, they were not, nor neither as they believe was said estate, copartners in the said firm doing business as the Allegheny Savings Bank, in manner and form, &amp;c.” On October 13th 1877 the Allegheny Savings Bank presented their petition in the District Court for a meeting of its creditors to consider a proposition for composition, and JSTovember 30th 1877 was appointed for the meeting before N. Vf. Shaffer, Esq., Register. Due notice of this meeting was given in accordance with the Act of Congress. At this meeting a proposition was submitted by the Allegheny Savings Bank to their unsecured creditors providing for an extension of time for the payment <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>of tlieir claims and for a trustee to collect from the stockholders the several amounts due from them, by the terms of the composition. Malcolm Hay was-elected trustee for the creditors at this meeting, John Bardsley, the present plaintiff being present, and the meeting was adjourned from time to time until February 1st 1878 when the proposition was accepted by the statutory quorum of the creditors in number and amount. A subsequent meeting was held after due notice given by the Register thereof, on July 26th 1878, and the Register certified that the securities offered under the composition had been duly accepted by the required quorum of the creditors.</p>

On January 20th 1879, the defendants, in pursuance of the provisions of the composition, paid in cash to the trustee elected the amount required from the estate of their testator, and after the composition proceedings had been confirmed, and the trustee filed of record his certificate of that fact, this present suit was begun on November 9th 1877, the plaintiff retaining his deposit book, and not having received from the trustee any part of the money paid to him under the composition proceedings.</p>

After his death one of the firm petitioned to have the surviving members thereof, and also the estate, of said George Lysle declared bankrupts. The defendant’s executors, were required to respond and answer the petition. They appeared and demurred to the jurisdiction of the bankrupt court, and denied its right to interfere with the estate of the decedent, over which the Orphans’ Court of the proper county had acquired jurisdiction. The record does not show that <em>any </em>replication thereto was filed, nor that any decision was rendered on the demurrer; but the estate and the executors of Lysle do not appear to be thereafter named in the proceedings. until after composition.</p>
    <p id="b651-7" data-blocks='[["BL_651.8",651,[201,1220,1168,976]]]'>At the first meeting of the creditors, held before the register in bankruptcy, his report shows that the plaintiff was present, and acted with the other creditors in matters before the meeting. When a proposition for composition was afterwards presented to the creditors for their action, the name of the plaintiff was attached to the ratification of the same, and the register in certifying to the IT. S. District Court the number and names of those creditors who had signed or ratified the composition, included the name of the plaintiff, and the court below in the present case finds as a fact that he was then present, and also at the election of the trustee of the creditors under the proposition for composition. The composition was duly confirmed. The defendants assented to, and ratified it. They paid over to the attorney of the trustee the sum of forty-five hundred dollars in full payment of the contributory share of the decedent’s estate in the composition. Thus it is shown that the executors of the deceased copartner became a party to the' composition proceedings, and paid over the contributory share of the decedent’s estate of the sum agreed to be paid by the composition. They thus waived all their objections, and contributed to the fund for the payment of all the creditors of the bankrupt, the just proportion of the liability of the estate of the decedent.</p>

It was duly confirmed, and after a modification subsequently made and approved by the court the money was paid for the benefit of all the creditors under the resolution and composition, according to the provisions of section 5103 of the Bankruptcy Act, U. S. Rev. Statutes, 2 ed. 982.</p>
    <p id="b652-5" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[282,974,1163,683]]]'>It is true nearly two years after the proceedings were confirmed, and several months after the payment made by the defendants, as before stated, the plaintiff applied to the court showing that his name was signed to the composition proceedings, through inadvertence and without authority; and the court ordered his name where so signed, be stricken from the composition proceedings; yet the court added “ this correction not to prejudice, affect, or fin any way invalidate said composition proceedings in bankruptcy, or of any of the interests of the parties whether as creditors or debtors who are interested therein.” In addition to this cautionary qualification of the order, the plaintiff also averred in his petition that he did not seek to assail or attack the composition in any way, that enough creditors had voted for the composition “ to constitute a majority in amount and nn mber without including your petitioner’s name, to leave the sufficient majority according to law.”</p>

It is in either case subject to the provisions of the statute. Tho proposition of composition to all the unsecured creditors, not being stockholders, was to pay the sum specified “as a composition in full satisfaction and’payment of the indebtedness of said firm.” The fact that the name of the plaintiff was long after stricken from the composition proceedings, did not destroy their conclusive effect on his claim, the payment of which was secured thereby.</p>

No portion of the estate of the decedent had been distributed by the Orphans’ Court, when the proceedings in bankruptcy were commenced. The whole assets of the firm remained in the hands of the surviving copartners. The fund was then within the grasp of the Bankrupt Court. Under the composition the plaintiff became entitled to his ratable share of the sum thereby secured and paid. Without reviewing the multitude of cases cited, and others not cited, we think the learned judge correctly held that the plaintiff could not recover in this action.</p>
