It may be repealed by necessary implication. The leaning however of the courts is strongly against repealing the positive provisions of a former statute by construction: Dwarr. on Stat. 154. The more natural, if not necessary, inference in all such cases is, that the legislature intend the new law to be auxiliary to, and in aid of the purposes of the old law. There should therefore be such a manifest and total repugnancy in the provisions of the new law as to lead to the conclusion that the latter law abrogated, and was designed to abrogate the former. There are <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>cases, however, in which it is held that although the latter statute be not repugnant to the former one, and there be no express provision in the latter repealing the .former, yet if the latter prescribe the only rules which shall govern, it repeals the former one in all those respects in which it differs from the latter in the governing rule: Daviess <em>v. </em>Fairbairn, 3 How. U. S. R. 636. The general rule however is that there must be such a positive repugnancy between the provisions of the new statute and the old, that they cannot stand together or be consistently reconciled : Wallace Bassett, <a href="/barb/41/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="41 Barb. 92" data-case-ids="5110899" data-case-paths="/barb/41/0092-01">41 Barb. 92</a>; McCool Smith, 1 Black U.

Section 2 provides when and under what rules licenses for the sale of liquors may be granted. Section 3 provides for the classification of hotels, inns, and taverns, and specifies the sum which those of each class shall pay.

Section 6 directs every constable to make <em>return </em>of retailers of liquors, and also under oath of any unlicensed place within his bailiwick, within his knowledge, kept and maintained in violation of this Act, and upon his willful failure to do so, after being duly notified in writing, he shall be deemed guilty of tho crime of perjury, and subject to its penalties.

Section 8 prohibits non-residents of this Commonwealth from engaging <em>in </em>selling, trading, or vending intoxicating liquor within the Commonwealth. Section 9 provides for the cancellation of bonds given under the Act, and the releasing of sureties therefrom. Section 10 prescribes the form and condition of the bond which shall be executed to obtain a license to sell intoxicating drinks. Section 11 declares “it shall not be lawful for any person, with or without license, to sell to any person any intoxicating drink, or any day on which elections are now or hereafter may be required to be held, nor on Sunday, nor at any time to a minor or to a person visibly affected by.intoxicating drinks.” This is the whole section.
