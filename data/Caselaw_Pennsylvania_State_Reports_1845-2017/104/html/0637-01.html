To his only surviving daughter he gives certain property specified. To the only heir of his deceased daughter a specific sum of money. This heir is mentioned by name. In the specific devise to Henrietta no reference is made to her heirs or to her children. The foundation of the per capita rule of distribution rests in a large measure on the presumption, that when the beneficiaries are in equal degrees of relationship to the testator his affection for each is equal, and therefore he will desire to benefit each equally. In these two clauses the testator wholly ignores tlie children of Henrietta as effectually as if they had not existed.

There is no direction therein that the estate be divided between the children of Henrietta; but between her “heirs ” that may be living at the time of said division. It is true the fourth paragraph does indicate, in speaking of' the time of division, that children and heirs of Henrietta^ are for that purpose, referred toas the same persons; yet in' the devising clause of the previous paragraph the word “ heirs ” in its most general sense is used. No language therein contained indicates that it means children or issue only of Henrietta. It-is broad enough to apply to all of her heirs who may be living when the division shall be made.</p>

No <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>names nor sex are mentioned. They are her heirs or children as a class, all representing her, and deriving their share as her heirs, and presumably no greater share than she would otherwise have taken. Moreover, this devise or bequest is to Harry G. McCartney by name, and not merely as his grandson. The gift to him is absolute. It is not contingent that he be living wheu the division shall be made. It vested in him. at once. The possession thereof only was postponed. To adopt the per capita rule contended for, would strike down the absolute devise of one-half the estate to Harry, and cause his share to increase or diminish as the number of the children of Henrietta might increase by birth or decrease by death. Such a result as this was clearly not intended by the testator, and finds no warrant in any of the language used. Conceding, then, the correctness of the rule urged by the appellants, that language somewhat similar has often been held to presumptively distribute the estate per capita; yet a careful consideration of these words, and of the manifest intent and spirit of the whole will, convinces us that such was not the intention of the testator.
