A rule to show cause why an alley in the city of Pittsburgh should not. be vacated was granted under the Act of May 8th 1854 (P. L. 645), upon a petition which alleged that said alley had been “dedicated to public use,” but failed to set forth that it had been accepted as a public highway by the municipal authorities, or that it was twenty or more feet iu width, so as to make it a public highway under the Act of June 16th 1830, § 9 (P. L. 753). Wo notice of said rule, other than by publication as directed by the Act of May 8th 1854 (P. L. 645), in proceedings 'to vacate public highways, was given to those having rights in said alley, who had not joined iu the petition. The court entered a decree vacating the alloy.</p>

The court granted a rule to show cause why said alley should not be vacated and directed that notice of said rule be given by publication in the Pittsburgh Post once a week for four weeks. Subsequently* on proof of publication as above directed, and no objection having been filed, the court on March 27th 1880, entered a decree vacating said alley.</p>

The owners of lots abutting on this alley have the right to the use of the alley from one end to another, as originally laid out, and no part can be closed without the consent of all: McCarty <em>v. </em>Kitchenman, 11 Wr. 239; Hall <em>v. </em>McCaughey, 1 P.

It became such by dedication to the public use and is set forth as, such in our petition. The Act of June 16th 1836, § 9, P. L. 753, expressly declares that all alloys, if not less than 20 feet in width, laid out and appropriated by private persons for public use .... shall for every purpose be deemed, taken and be public highways.” Such being the case, no other notice than by publication was necessary under the Act of May 8th 1854, P. L. 645. That Act only requires personal notice in the case of proceedings to vacate private alleys. The Act of 1854, expressly confers the power upon the court to make the order of vacation. In re Osage Street, 9 Norris 114, was decided under the Act of 1836. We believe that the decision would have been very different, had the Act of 1854 been called to the attention of the court.</p>

L. 045, and had it been a public alley there would have been less room for criticism. There is nothing upon the face of this record to show that the alley was a public alley. The petition sets forth “ That an alley without a name, situate in the Nineteenth ward, city of Pittsburgh, laid out and located in Isabella Beatty’s plan of lots laid out in said ward in which said alley, extending from Livery alley to Stanton avenue, was dedicated to public use.” The dedication to public use by the owners of the ground would not make it a public alley unless accepted by the municipal authorities. Nor is the matter helped by the Act of 10th June 1836, P. L. 153, for the reason that said Act applies only to alleys “ of not loss than 20 feet in width,” which have been opened by private owners, and it nowhere appears in this record that said alley is twenty feet wide. On the contrary, so far as we can judge by the plan, it is less than twenty feet. We must assume, therefore, that this is a private alley. The Act of 1854 provides in such cases that “all persons having interests and rights therein, who shall not be petitioners, shall have notice thereof in writing, duly served upon them.” The petition in this case does not appear to have been signed by any of the owners of property aborting on said alley, or by any one having an interest therein, and no notice was given to the parties to be affected by the vacation of the alley, as required by the Act of 1854 in cases of private alleys. The only notice was by publication as in the case of public alleys. It is hardly necessary to say that the rights of the owners of the alley cannot be taken away without notice and a hearing, upon the petition of persons who have no interest in it.</p>
