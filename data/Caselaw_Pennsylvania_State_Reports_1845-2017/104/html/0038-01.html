No doubt it may build a railroad, but it may build also “ any work or works, public or private, which may tend or be designed to improve, increase, facilitate or develop trade, travel, or the transportation and conveyance of freight, live stock, passengers, and any other traffic by land or water.” . . It may build steamships, employ the same in foreign and domestic transportation, may build any “improvements, structures, roads or fixtures necessary or convenient for the purposes of the said company under the powers herein grantedmay erect lines of telegraph, exercise the right of eminent domain “ for the purpose of erecting, constructing, maintaining or managing any public works such as ” are mentioned above: may advance money or credit to companies, contractors, or manufacturers, may receive on deposit any estate, even though it be real estate, may indorse and guarantee obligations of corporations, firms and individuals, and may assume and carry out any contracts, leases and sub-leases made by any company to or with any company or individual. In view of such an array of powers, — and even this is incomplete,— it is evident that the character of the corporation, in such an inquiry as this will depend upon the business it actually does, and that its proper description may vary, from time to time, as its business varies.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b56-5" data-blocks='[["BL_56.4",56,[231,1387,1176,1025]],["BL_57.1",57,[187,401,1168,172]]]'>It is not necessary now to decide how the simultaneous carrying on of different enterprises would affect the question ; in the case before us the defendant first exercised its powers as a railroad company only, hut when the increase of capital stock was made it had ceased to use this franchise and was acting as a steamship company alone. We see no difficulty in such a state of facts; the defendant by its own act has classified itself, and surely it cannot complain if the Commonwealth takes it at its word. The substance of its business is the essential matter. If the company was really operating a railroad and doing nothing else, is it doubtful that it could not be taxed as a steamship company, merely because it had powers of that sort which it did not exercise ? And when, as a navigation company, it is really operating a steamship line and doing nothing else, can it be pretended that it is still a railroad company, because it once carried on that business and may perhaps do so again ? It might with as much reason be said that a merchant, who has given up his store and taken to fanning, is still liable to pay for a mercantile license. In Com. <em>v. </em>Penn. Coal Co., 2 Pears. 404, Judge Pearson held the defendant to bo a coal company, although it liad authority, and exercised it, to build railroads to carry its coal to market, on the ground that its principal business was to mine, and that transporting was an incident. There the two operations were carried on together; <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>here the defendant had ceased to act as a railroad company ■when the Commonwealth’s claim arose, and there is no question of principal and incident. On the facts, as found, we hold the defendant was not a railroad company in February 1882.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b57-5" data-blocks='[["BL_57.4",57,[172,573,1182,378]]]'>It is argued, however, that the defendant, being then no doubt a transportation company, is within the spirit of the exception,' and therefore should not pay this bonus; but the difficulty is, that there is not a word, or phrase, or sentence in the exception, which, by the most liberal enlargement or construction could be held to cover a steamship company, and the careful enumeration of special classes without general words •makes the exclusion of such a corporation too plain for discussion.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b57-6" data-blocks='[["BL_57.5",57,[171,959,1180,935]]]'>2. The second objection is based on section four of the Act of 1870, providing that the company “ shall be taxable only on the proportion of dividends on its capital stock, and on net earnings or income only in proportion to the amount actually carried by it within the state of Pennsylvania.” . . . This, it is said, exempts the capital stock from all other burdens, and relieves it from liability here. It is not necessary to decide whether the bonus required to be paid by the Act of 1868 is a tax or not, either strictly speaking or in its ordinary and popular sense. If it is a tax in any sense, then the language used does not surrender the right of the Commonwealth to impose it. It is undoubted law that such a surrender can only bo made by clear words and upon sufficient consideration: Jones &amp; Nimick Co. <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 19 P. F. S. 137; and it is by no means clear that the words of this provision should bear the meaning contended for. They apparently refer only to the taxes on capital stock and net earnings, and nowhere, either expressly or by necessary implication, indicate an intention to give up the right of the state to other taxes. If the bonus claimed is not a tax, then the provision does not touch it in any way. In either event, the liability of the defendant is not affected.</p>

Its character is not changed merely because it exercises other franchises given by its charter. The Philadelphia and Reading R. R. Co. owns and operates colliers and barges without ceasing to be a railroad company. The spirit of the Act exempts transportation companies, which it is the policy of the state to foster; they are taxable as such, but not doubly taxed on dividends and by bonus on capital stock. But our company, under the Act of 1870, part of its charter, is expressly made “taxable only on the proportion of dividends on its capital stock.” This limits, while it does not surrender, the right to tax, by declaring that the company shall be taxable when it is successful enough to declare dividends. That precludes the idea of payment of bonus on capital stock; if bonus is a tax, then we are relieved from it by virtue of our charter exemption, which was subsequent to the Act of 1868; if not a tax, that Act of 1868 is invalid, as its title is confined to “ taxing corporations,” &amp;c.</p>
