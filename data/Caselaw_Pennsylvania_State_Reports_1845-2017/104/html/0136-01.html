The rule that a deed, absolute on its face (dated prior to the Act of June 8th 1881), may be shown by parol evidence to have been intended as security for the payment of money, is applicable as well to the case of a sheriff's deed-as to a deed between private parties.</p>

The answer denied the averments of the bill, and the parol testimony taken before an Examiner and Master was conflicting.

This ease is not within the line of cases holding that an absolute deed may be shown by parol to be a mortgage, for the reason that the plaintiff never had any title to the land capable of being mortgaged. The doctrine that one to whom property is struck off at sheriff’s sale has an inceptive title before execution of sheriff’s deed, on which a judgment may become a lien, is based on the assumption of payment of purchase money and the subsequent delivery of a sheriff’s deed in fact, which deed relates back for some purposes (not all) to the date of the sale. But if property is struck off at sheriff’s sale to A. who, without having paid any purchase money, executes a mortgage thereof, and no sheriff’s deed is ever acknowledged to him, but such a deed is duly made to another, to whom he turns over his bid, and who pays the purchase money, the mortgage falls for want of title in the mortgagor. In other words, the <em>“ </em>inceptive interest” proves barren. Such purchaser could not maintain ejectment, and his mortgagee’s title can rise no higher: Hall <em>v. </em>Benner, <a href="/pa/1/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="949901" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0402-01">1 Pa.

As to the averments of the bill which constitute the equity of plaintiff’s case, he introduced testimony that was clear, distinct and positive. The testimony of Mr. Slattery, as well as that of the plaintiff himself was clearly of that character. In addition thereto, they were fully sustained by the corroborating evidence of several witnesses, as to material allegations of the bill. If this testimony was believed, the sufficiency of the evidence in a legal point of view, to convert a deed, absolute in its face, into a mortgage, cannot be doubted. It was clear, precise and indubitable. It is true, there was conflicting testimony, as to all the essential features of the case, but the proper function of a Master, in such cases, is to consider the testimony, pass upon <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>the credibility of the witnesses and thus determine the facts. If the existence of conflicting testimony, introduced perhaps by guilty parties, for the very purpose of shielding themselves, were always sufficient to render the evidence, as a whole, doubtful or uncertain, few fraudulent transactions would be exposed or thwarted. When properly ascertained, in the duly appointed way, the facts must be accepted as trne. It has long been the settled practice of this court not to disturb the findings of an Auditor or Master which have been approved by the court, especially when they are based on oral testimony, except in cases of plain mistake, affirmatively shown or apparent on the face of the record. In this case, nothing of the kind appears in any form, and hence it follows, that the several specifications of error relating to the Master’s conclusions of fact and the action of the court upon exceptions thereto are not sustained.</p>

The Master also finds that since the filing of the bill appellant was regularly put in possession <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>of tlie land and then held the same under the sheriff’s deeds above mentioned.</p>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[261,507,1166,1236]]]'>The question then is, whether upon the facts thus established the appellee was entitled to a decree declaring the sheriff’s deeds to be in fact morgages, and ordering appellant, upon payment of the money secured thereby, to convey the legal title to the land therein described to the appellee. In some of its features the transaction differs from the familiar case of an absolute conveyance of land by the holder of the legal title, as security merely, and so intended by the parties thereto ; but, in principle it is the same. Equity regards the substance rather than the form of a transaction. By his purchase at the sheriff’s sales, appellee acquired an inceptive title to the land in question, which by payment of purchase money and delivery of deeds would have ripened into a complete legal title. He had such an interest as would have been bound by the lien of a judgment entered between the date of sale and the acknowledgment and delivery of the sheriff’s deeds. But, instead of taking the deeds in his own name and then mortgaging the land to secure the loan made by appellant, it was suggested by the latter that the deed should be made directly to him, as security for the loan. This was agreed to and the arrangement was carried out. The manifest purpose of this was not to vest title absolutely in appellant, but to enable appellee to raise money to pay his bid, by pledging the land as security for its repayment. Appellant’s subsequent repudiation of the agreement, under which the deeds were made to him directly, and his attempt to use the deeds for a purpose that was never intended when he obtained them, is a palpable fraud, against which equity, under the facts and circumstances found by the Master, will undoubtedly afford relief.</p>

It should also provide that upon repayment of the loan, or, so much thereof' as remains unpaid, within a reasonable time, appellant shall convey the land in fee to appellee, by deed, with covenant of special warranty against all acts done or suffered by himself. This decree may be enforced by attachment, or a Master may be appointed by the court for the purpose of making the conveyance. It appears that since the decree was entered the case has been sent to a Master for the purpose of stating an account between the parties and ascertaining the balance due by appellee to appellant. The sum to be paid by appellee to entitle <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>him to a conveyance of the land will thus be ascertained and the decree can then be carried into effect, by the court below.</p>
