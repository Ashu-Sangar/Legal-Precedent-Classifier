The deed correctly described the tract of land by metes and bounds, but incorrectly recited that two frame barns were situate thereon, and passed therewith, whereas they were situate on an adjoining tract of land belonging to a third party. The assignment was made by both parties under this mutual misapprehension as to the true location of the barns. Judgment having been obtained for the purchase-money by A. against B., the latter obtained a rule to open the judgment and allow him to defend by defalking from its amount the value of the barns, amounting to one-third of the purchase-money, which rule the court below discharged:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b21-7" data-blocks='[["BL_21.5",21,[190,710,1168,773]]]'>The facts were as follows: In the year 1880 and prior thereto Mark and Priscilla York owned and occupied a farm consisting of over 96 acres. Upon this farm were erected a dwelling house and two frame barns. On June 8th 1881, this tract of land, with the exception of one acre, upon ' which two barns were erected, was sold at sheriff’s sale on a lev. fa. to E. H. Day. The sheriff’s deed, after correctly describing the portion sold by courses, distances, and boundaries, incorrectly added the statement: “ On which is erected a frame dwelling house, <em>two frame </em>barns, one hundred fruit trees, also a good spring of water.” On September 20th 1881, Day assigned the deed to Babcock by the following indorsement on the back thereof : “For and in consideration of the sum of fifteen hundred dollars, to me in hand paid, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, I hereby assign, transfer and set over to Francis O. Babcock, the within deed and the premises thereby conveyed, to have and to hold the same to him, his- heirs and assigns, forever.”</p>

Mr. Day represented to me the amount of land and the buildings that were upon it. lie wánted to sell me 96 acres, with house and two frame barns and one hundred fruit trees. lie presented to me a deed from the sheriff to him of the premises at the time he gave me the deed of the premises. He didn’t represent to me that there was any mistake in the sheriff’s deed, and never represented to me that there was anything wrong in the matter. Mr. Day showed me his deed. He did not show me any deed till the time of my buying the property, and he showed me the deed and represented it as a warranty deed. He said it was as good as any deed that could be made. I had lived near this farm for a great many years Mr. Day lived two miles from it. He told me of the property. I don’t know as he said there was a house or barn on it. He told me of the Mark and Priscilla York property was his, barns and houses and all. I had no reason to doubt before I went to Day but that the barns <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>were on the property. Supposed they were on it. I don’t recollect asking Mr. Day whether the barns were on the property. He didn’t say he had made a survey. I don’t know as I had any reason to suppose Mr. Day knew any more about the property than I did. I don’t recollect any discussion between Mr. Day and myself about the improvements on the property. He said their entire interest was sold, and that he owned it. He had a deed. He has several times told me that those barns were purchased, both before and since the purchase. I don’t know as any one, at the time of the purchase, claimed they were not sold. Ho one at that time had set up any claim to those barns. I know of no fact that leads me to suppose Mr. Day knew of any claim to them.”</p>

The principle that a person should not be compelled to pay for that which he does not receive- applies. The equities between the parties were sufficient to have warranted the court below in opening the judgment. Here the plaintiff below sold, or supposed he sold, a certain piece of property with improvements to the defendant below for the sum of $1,500, and received his pay therefor, or its equivalent. The defendant purchased, or supposed he purchased, the same and paid therefor. It turns out that the plaintiff did not own a large portion of the property, but received security for the same. The defendant did not buy it, although, supposing he did, paid his money and gave his obligation. The deficiency in the quantity of land supposed to have been purchased by Babcock was equal in value to about one-third of the purchase price of the whole land. Here is such a gross mistake or misapprehension of facts between the parties that equity should relieve, either by decreeing a specific performance of the real contract as made and understood by the parties, as far as the vendor can perform it, or by directing a reduction of the judgment to the amount that will compensate the vendee for the loss which he has incurred through a partial failure of performance: Story’s <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>Equity, § 779; Waters <em>v. </em>Travis, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Johns.%20464" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Johns. 464">9 Johns. 464</a>; Erwin <em>v. </em>Myers, 10 Wr. 96; Adams on Equity, p. 90; Miles <em>v. </em>Stevens, 6 Barr 21; Rice <em>v. </em>Olin, 29 <em>P.

The only question raised here, in such case, therefore, is whether the court rightly exercised that discretion under the evidence : Earley’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/90/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="90 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1065647" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0321-01">90 Penn.

Babcock’s testimony does not clearly establish the fact that any representations were made by Day, as to the location of the barns; and being a party to the <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>controversy, it is fair to assume that he testified as strongly in his own interest as the truth would allow.</p>

    <p id="b24-8" data-blocks='[["BL_24.6",24,[255,1049,1168,854]]]'>It was certainly the intention of the parties to this transaction, that Day should transfer to Babcock such interest only as he held by the sheriff’s deed; the writings clearly indicated this, the transfer was of “the within deed and the premises thereby conveyed.” Ho larger bomidary and no greater estate was in contemplation of the parties. The nature of the transaction was unmistakable. There was no reckless assertion— no warranty — no concealment — no deception or fraud ; they were both sincere and honest, both may have been mistaken. Ho hostile claim appeared, no suspicion even attached. Their opportunities for knowing the location of the barns -were at least equal. Babcock lived on an adjoining farm, knew the lines, and directed the subsequent survey. This is not, therefore, the case of a person selling lands which he did not own, and for which he could not make title. The description in the deed was by metes and bounds, and the deed and transfer were effective to vest the title in Babcock. There was no defect in the title to the lands described in the deed, and the truth, as to the actual location of the barns, was as easily ascertainable by one of the parties as the other.</p>

Under the peculiar and special facts of this case, if the injury had been but small, as compared with the consideration, Ave might hold the defendant to be Avithout remedy, but the magnitude of the injury is such, that the defendant should obtain relief in some form. He must not however hold to the profits of his contract, and demand compensation for his loss. He should put the plaintiff in statu quo, tendera reconveyance, demand and sue for a rescission. This is, we think, his proper <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>and indeed his only remedy. ¥e cannot mate a contract for the parties which they never made for themselves.</p>
