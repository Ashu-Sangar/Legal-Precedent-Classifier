Higliberger, believing that a balance of over $1,000 remained due to him on said account, after deducting every credit dixe to Borlin, filed a praecipe instructing the prothonotary of Westmoreland county, to “issue scire facias sur recognizance” against James Borlin, assigning as a breach, the failure of Borlin to pay the said amount ($1,234.77).

It is true the 74th section of the Act of 15th April 1834, authorizes the recorder of deeds to certify the recognizance of the sheriff, taken by him, to the prothonotary. This is for the purpose of creating a lien on real estate, and thereby increasing the security of all persons interested in the proper discharge of the sheriff’s duties. Non constat, that those who entered into the recognizance would not be liable without such certificate. We think <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>however that the filing in the prothonotary’s office of a duly-certified copy of the recognizance is a compliance with the meaning of the statute.
