J., were as follows: Hartman and Moul were owners of contiguous lots in the borough of East Berlin, bounded on the north by King street. Hartman’s lot was bounded on the east by Fourth street, which, according to the original plan of the town, is fifty feet wide, and Moul’s lot adjoins Hartman’s on the west. The lots were numbered respectively as Nos. 75 and 76. The deeds to each called for a frontage on King street of sixty-five feet per lot. This suit was brought to try the title to a seven-foot strip of land spoken of as lying between the lots, upon which Moul had built a woodshed. The defendant claimed that Fourth street was in fact only forty-three feet wide, and that the seven feet on the east of Hartman’s lot, and claimed by him to be a part of the street, was in fact a part of Hartman’s lot, so that the seven feet upon the west, upon which Moul had built, belonged to said defendant, his lot commencing at the end of Hartman’s sixty-five feet of frontage. The town, as originally surveyed, contained no fixed marks or designated boundaries on the ground from which a measurement could be made. Voluminous testimony was offered on both sides as to the respective boundaries of the lots. That of the defendant tended to show that when Hartman purchased his lot in 1866, there was a fence on its east boundary, forty-three feet from the opposite side of Fourth street, and that in building on his lot, he adopted that fence as the eastern line of his lot. Testimony was offered in denial of the existence of such a fence and of such adoption by Hartman. On the west side of Hartman’s lot, and between that and Moul’s, there was never any division fence running from King street, but there was a row of currant bushes about six feet west of <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>Hartman’s house, extending back from King street for some distance where it joined a wooden fence; which latter, extending from the rear alley to the point where it met the currant bushes, some feet west of the rear end of Hartman’s building, turned eastward and joined the building. The plaintiff offered evidence to show that his predecessors iu title had claimed the six-foot strip of land up to the currant bushes, and gathered the currants under claim of right, aud that Mold’s predecessors iu title had acquiesced in this claim. When Moul became the owner of lot No. 76, he dug up the currant bushes and took possession of the strip of land lying between them and Hartman’s house, by constructing a woodshed on said, strip of laud and against Hartman’s wall.</p>

The town in which they were situated was laid out in 1764. The original plot of the town showing the location of the streets and alleys, with the lots designated by numbers, was given in evidence. One Wolf, an old resident of the town, was the custodian of this town plot. When there was once a question as to tho boundaries of these lots, he came upon the ground and pointed out the boundary line. Ho also held the quit-rent deeds, and collected the rents thereon. Having died before the trial, his declarations made at tho time stated were given in evidence. There was no error in this. The declarations of a deceased person are evidence of boundary, when made under circumstances creating a presumption that he had a knowledge of the facts which he states. Wolf had the means of knowledge and called attention to the row of currant bushes on the boundary line. This evidence was also followed by proof of use and claim of the land in dispute.</p>
