        "text": "Mr. Justice Trunkey\ndelivered the opinion of the court, November 12th 1883.\nThe construction of a written instrument is exclusively for the court; except when it cannot be understood without reference to facts not within the writing, and then the jury are to judge of the whole together. If there be a patent ambiguity in the terms of a written contract the court must solve it; but if ambiguity arise from extrinsic evidence it must be solved by the jury. Not controverting these familiar rules, the defendants contend that under all the testimony the question whether they had notice of Foster\u2019s title to the oil at the time it was sold, was for the jury; and, also, that if the court improperly submitted the construction of the writings to the jury, the error was harmless, for the writings fail to give notice of Foster\u2019s title.\nAs the cause was tried the question was submitted upon the writings alone. The plaintiff\u2019s fourth point was, \u201c The telegrams and letters in evidence show that the oil was Foster\u2019s, and are sufficient to visit the defendants with that knowledge.\u201d And the court answered, \u201c We say that is a question for the jury and not for the court, and we have submitted it to the jury.\u201d Upon this point, in the charge, the court said, \u201cIf you are satisfied under the evidence that there was notice, that the telegrams and letters were notice and brought the knowledge to Mr. Berg that the oil was still owned by Foster, and on the payment of the notes would revert to him, your verdict should be for the balance or amount the oil sold for in excess of \u00a710,000. On the other hand, If you think these were not notice \u2014 did not convey knowledge to Berg that Foster still retained the ownership of the oil, then your verdict should be for the defendants.\u201d Thus, the writings were submitted to the jury for construction, and the remaining inquiry is' whether such submission injured the plaintiff. If they show that Foster retained ownership of the oil, subject to Berg & Co.\u2019s right as collateral security for 'White\u2019s notes, then the court should so have instructed the jury, and the plaintiff has cause for complaint.\nThe telegrams and letter relating to the ten thousand barrels of oil, explicitly state that Foster had placed the oil to the credit of Berg & Co. as collateral for the payment of White\u2019s note for ten thousand dollars. They inquire by telegram, \u201cIs oil placed to our credit by Foster, ours as absolutely as if we had-made purchase of \u2019the same?\u201d \u2014 and received answer, \u201c The oil placed to your credit by Foster is as absolutely subject to your order as if you had purchased it.\u201d It is plain that Berg & Co. took the oil as collateral security for the note, subject to their order as if they had purchased it; but upon payment of the note at maturity, the oil would belong to him who gave it as collateral; or upon default in payment and sale of the oil by the holder, the overplus after satisfaction of the note belonged to the owner of the oil. Foster placed the oil and named the purpose; it had been stored in his name, and he transferred it to name of Berg & Co.; the direct and natural inference is that it belonged to him. There is nothing to indicate that he sold or gave the oil to White. Had White been the owner, or had the Union Pipe Company held it in his name, Foster could not have transferred it to anybody for any purpose. In absence of evidence to the contrary, the man who holds a chattel in his own name and pledges it, is presumed to be the owner, and the pledgee is taken to have knowledge that the pledgor is the owner.\nThe writings respecting the second lot of oil are not so explicit ; but it has not been contended that this lot was received on other terms than the first.\nWe are of opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s fourth point ought to have been affirmed. Even if there were sufficient testimony, if believed, to alter or vary the written contract, the plaintiff would be entitled to affirmance of that proposition, though it should be the duty of the court to instruct the jury respecting the effect of such extrinsic testimony.\nJudgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded.",

    "head_matter": "Foster versus Berg & Co.\n1. The construction of a written instrument is exclusively for the court; except when it cannot be understood without reference to facts not within the writing, and then the jury are to judge of the whole together.\n2. The pledgee of oil as collateral, sold it to pay the note for which it was pledged, and turned over the surplus proceeds to the maker of the note. A third party, claiming that he owned the oil, subject to the pledge, and was entitled to the surplus proceeds, brought suit against the holder of the note therefor. The evidence of the transaction consisted mainly of telegrams, which the plaintiff claimed affected the defendant with notice of his ownership, and requested the court so to instruct the jury. This the court refused to do, but submitted the writings, together with all the evidence in the case, to the jury, to find whether the defendant had such notice;\nHeld, to be error. The court should have construed the writings, and have affirmed the plaintiff\u2019s point, with instructions as to the effect of extrinsic evidence, which might, if believed, vary the written contract.\n3. A., having oil in a pipe company, authorized the company to transfer it to B.\u2019s order, as collateral for a loan by B. to O. The pipe company notified B. of such transfer; Held, that B. had notice that the oil belonged to A., and, upon sale of the oil for more than enough to pay C.\u2019s note, B. was liable to A. for such excess.\nOctober 18th 1883.\nBefore Mercur, C.

Foster, to transfer oil which he had in the Union Pipe Line Company to Berg & Co., as collateral security for the loan to White.

Agent.\u201d\nUpon receipt of this letter, on May 26th 1875, Berg & Co. loaned White an additional sum of $5,000 taking his note therefor, at four months, similar in form to the former note of $10,000.\nOn June 15th 1875, Berg & Co. at White\u2019s request, or White with Berg & Oo.\u2019s permission, sold 5,000 barrels of oil, and on July 7th 1875, 5,000 barrels additional, Berg & Co. giving orders on the Union Pipe company for the same which Were duly honored. Of the proceeds, the sum of $10,000 was paid to Berg& Co. in payment of White\u2019s note for that amount and the overplus $1,325, was paid to A. B. White, who used the same for his individual benefit.\nOn July 16th 1875, Foster telegraphed Berg & Co. \u201cwhen does A. B. White\u2019s note $10,000 mature ?\u201d to which Berg & Co. telegraphed answer, same day, \u201c A. B. White\u2019s note for $10,000 paid.\u201d\nWhite testified that he told Foster in September 1875, of the sale of the oil to pay the note, at which Foster expressed dissatisfaction. White replied that he thought he could replace it, but, owing to an unfortunate turn in his business affairs he was not able to do so, and had since been unable to do so.\nFoster afterwards, on May 20th 1881, brought this suit, in which he claimed to recover the excess for which the oil sold, over and above White\u2019s $10,000 note to wit, the sum of $1,325, with interest.\nThe plaintiff submitted, inter alia, the following point:\n1. The telegrams and letters in evidence show that the oil was Foster\u2019s and are sufficient to visit the defendants with that knowledge.\nAnswer. We say that is a question for the jury and not for the court, and we have submitted it to the jury.\nThe court, in the general charge, said, \u201c The question here is whether Berg had notice by telegram or otherwise that Foster still retained the ownership of the oil, and that he had merely transferred it to Berg as collateral to the note of White. If they had, then Mr. Foster would retain the ownership of the oil, subject to the payment of the note of White. That is a question for the jury. Did the telegrams which have been read to you notify Mr. Berg that the oil transferred to him still belonged to Foster, and was deposited merely as collateral, and when the notes were paid would revert to Foster? If you are satisfied under the evidence that there was notice, that the telegrams and letters were notice and brought the knowledge to Mr. Berg that the oil was still owned by Foster, and on the payment of the notes would revert to him, your verdict should be for the plaintiff for the balance or amount the oil sold for in excess of $10,000. On the other hand, if you think these were not notice \u2014 did not convey knowledge to Berg that Foster still retained the ownership of the oil, then your verdict should be for the defendants.\u201d\nVerdict for defendants, and judgment thereon. The plaintiff took this writ of error, assigning for error the answer to the plaintiff\u2019s fourth point as above.\nThompson (McCandless with him), for the plaintiff in error.\n\u2014There was nothing in this case to take it out of the rule that the construction of writings is exclusively for the court: Parker Bank v. Hartley, 10 Norris 470; Bryant v. Hagerty, 6 Norris 261.\nT. C. Campbell (J. D. McJunkin with him), for the defendant in error.\n\u2014 If the court had construed the writings, such construction would necessarily, we contend, have been in our favor, and therefore the plaintiff has suffered no injury of which he can complain. But the fact that ambiguity was introduced by the correspondence between the parties previously to the writings in question, and also by extrinsic evidence, brought the writings, together with the evidence, within the province of the jury: Harvey v. Vandegrift, 8 Norris 346; Bryant v. Hagerty, 6 Norris 256; Allegheny R. R. Co. v. Steele, 11 W. N. C. 113; Esser v. Linderman, 21 P. F. S. 80; McKean v. Wagenblast, 2 Gr. 462; Reynolds v. Richards, 14 Pa. St. 205."
