Lauman, administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of William Scott, deceased, was plaintiff, and Andrew Scott was defendant, to determine whether the right to a certain sum of $4,000 passed to the defendant by the following indorsed certificate of deposit.\nNo. 2,432. Masonic Bank, )\nPittsburgh, Pa., October 31st 1879. [\nWilliam Scott has deposited in this Bank, forty-one hundred and eighty-one and 20-100 dollars, to be left for six months, and to bear interest at the rate of four per cent, per annum, Avhen due.\nIf not presented for payment at maturity, to be continued as a renewal.\nChas.

Cashier.\nIndorsement.\nI, William Scott, direct the Masonic Bank to pay four thousand dollars of the principal within to Andrew Scott, my brother, for value received, the residue and interest to my own credit on the books of Bank.\nWitness : William Scott. [Seal.]\nThos. M. Marshall.\nPittsburgh, October 2d 1880.\nAt the trial, before Eaving, P. J., it appeared that the indorsement ivas written uuder the following circumstances :\u2014 William Scott and Andrew Scott were brothers and had been engaged in business together. The former, during his last illness, sent for his counsel, Thomas M. Marshall, Esq., to draw his will. Upon its execution, the said William Scott produced the certificate in question and after remarking that he had never had a settlement with his brother Andrew in their business relations, expressed a wish to assign $4,000 of this deposit to him. lie, therefore, requested Marshall to write the indorse, merit in question and when this was done, signed and handed it to Marshall with the remark that \u201che should take it with him and put it in his safe; that it was for Andrew Scott.\u201d Marshall look the certificate thus indorsed with him, retained it in his office until after the testator\u2019s death, which occurred several months later, and then handed it to Andrew Scott.\nThere was some evidence that William Scott, after the execution of this indorsement and before his death, instituted a search for said certificate and complained that it had been lost or stolen. This was offered by the plaintiffs as tending to show that there was no delivery of the certificate made or contemplated to be made in the lifetime of William Scott.\nThe court instructed the jury that the evidence not only failed to show, but expressly negatived the theory, that any delivery was made during the lifetime of the donor ; that as the indorsement was without consideration, it had no validity as a, contract. He, therefore, directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff.\nVerdict accordingly for the plaintiff, and judgment thereon. The defendant took this writ of error, assigning for error the said instruction of the court.\nA. M. Brown and John S. Ferguson, for the plaintiff in error.\n\u2014 In furtherance of the donor\u2019s undoubted intention, the court should have sustained the assignment either as an executed gift or as a contract. The donor delivered the certificate to Marshall, with the instruction to take it, that it was for the donee. This was evidently an instruction to deliver it, the only delivery that the donor, a dying man, could possibly make. To constitute a valid gift it need not be delivered to the donee by the donor, but as in this case, it may be given to some third person for the donee\u2019s use, and this will be a valid delivery: Allen v. Cowan, 28 Barb. 101; Pringle v. Pringle, 9 P. F. S. 281. But the transaction was more than a gift. It was an instrument executed under seal, having as its consideration the obligation of the donor to the donee for past services. It was a solemn promise to pay $4,000 in settlement of a debt, and, as such, should have been sustained.\nJ. M. Stoner, for the defendant in error.\n\u2014 Whether or not William Scott intended to deliver the certificate or have it delivered, is immaterial. Unless in point of fact it was so delivercd during Ins lifetime, it is without validity: McCarven\u2019s Estate, 7 W. N. C. 261; Zimmerman v. Streeper, 25 P. F. S. 147; Trough\u2019s Estate, 25 P. F. S. 115; Linsenbigler v. Gourley, 6 P. F. S. 166; Whitehill v. Wilson, 3 P. & W. 405; Lyon v. Marclay, 1 W. 271; Kennedy v. Ware, 1 Barr 445; Campbell\u2019s Estate, 7 Barr 100; Kidder v.
