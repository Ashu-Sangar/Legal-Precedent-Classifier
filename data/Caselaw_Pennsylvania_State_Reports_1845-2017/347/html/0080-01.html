It is certain that the checks in the present instance were not intended by the building and loan association to be payable to bearer. While it is true from a strictly literal standpoint that the estate of a decedent cannot be said to be a name purporting to be that of a person, it is obvious that the words “Estate of Anna Iioffman” were used merely as an abbreviated designation of the payee intended, and if the full appellation had been employed, namely, “Administratrix of the Estate of Anna Hoffman, Deceased,” no question would have arisen under section 9 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, not only because the identity of the payee would thereby have been established, but because of the express provision of section 8 that “The instrument . . . may be drawn payable to the order of: ... 6. The holder of an office for the time being.” In legal and non-legal circles alike it is so common to personify the estate of a deceased person and to use the term “estate” when what is really meant is the legal representative of the estate, that it would be the height of legalism to say that because of the use of the abbreviated form there was no person intended as payee who could indorse the instrument and it therefore became, <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>under the terms of the statute, an instrument payable to bearer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

L. 468, provides that “If a fiduciary makes a deposit in a bank to his personal credit of checks . . . payable to his principal and indorsed by him, if he is empowered to indorse such checks, . . . the bank receiving such deposit is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing thereby a breach of his obligation as fiduciary, and the bank is authorized to pay the amount of the deposit, or any part thereof, upon the personal check of the fiduciary, without being liable to the principal, unless the bank receives the deposit or pays the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in making such deposit or in drawing such check or with knowledge of such facts that its action in receiving the deposit or paying the check amounts to bad faith.” Section 1 defines “fiduciary” as including an “agent.” The term as thus used is obviously more comprehensive than when confined to its purely technical meaning. However, the result in the present case is the same whether the facts be judged by common-law principles or by the provisions of the statute. In <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company v. Diamond National </em>Bank, <a href="/pa/194/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="194 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="912442" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0334-01">194 Pa. 334</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.%201064" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="44 A. 1064">44 A. 1064</a>, it was held that, where checks were made payable to the administrator of a decedent’s estate and he indorsed them as administrator and deposited them in his personal account in a bank, the fund was subject to be drawn out upon his personal checks and the bank was not liable for the loss occasioned by his misappropriation of the money. The theory of the decision was that, since he was entitled to indorse the checks, the bank, in the absence of any knowl<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>edge to the contrary, was justified in assuming that lie was not committing a breach of his obligation by depositing the checks in his personal account, but that he would duly account for the proceeds. So, under section 9 of the act, it is provided that, unless the bank has actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary, it is justified, if the fiduciary is empowered to indorse checks payable to his principal, in accepting them as a deposit to his personal credit.</p>

When it accepted the deposit to Ballen’s personal credit the only risk it took, in the absence of such knowledge, was that Bailen might not have been authorized to indorse the checks; if no such authorization had existed, the bank clearly would have been liable for paying out funds on the basis of an unauthorized indorsement of the payee’s name. But Bailen did have the power to indorse, and if the bank did not actually know that he had been directed to deposit the checks in his attorney’s account it would not be liable because of his violation of this instruction and his misappropriation of the funds after receiving them upon his authorized indorsement; it was not under a duty to investigate whether he was committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in depositing the checks to his personal credit. If, on the other hand, the bank saw the letter of attorney, or otherwise had actual knowledge of the directions it contained, at or before the time it received the deposit or made payments thereout on Ballen’s personal checks, plaintiff would be entitled to recover. The difficulty is, as already indicated, that the pleadings throw no light on the question as to when the bank first acquired knowledge of the provisions of that document, and, as a summary judgment should not be granted except in clear cases <em>(Koehring Company v. Ventresca, </em><a href="/pa/334/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="334 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1190782" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0566-01">334 Pa. 566</a>, <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a><a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20297" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="6 A.2d 297">6 A.2d 297</a>), it becomes necessary to have this controlling fact determined by a jury.</p>

    <p id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.7",108,[176,563,1150,1518]]]'>Justice Drew correctly states in the dissenting opinion the applicable law in this case as follows: “Before the bank may bring itself within the statutory protection, two conditions must be fulfilled: (1) the fiduciary must be empowered to endorse; and (2) there must be an absence of knowledge on the part of the bank of any fact which would make it guilty of bad faith.” He adds: “Neither of these conditions has been met in the instant case.” I think <em>both </em>conditions have been met. Bailen, the attorney, did have written authority from the administratrix “to collect any and all moneys due the said estate, and to endorse any and all checks payable to . . . the administratrix, and to deposit the funds so collected in the attorney’s account”. These three things Bailen was authorized to do were <em>in, the disjunctive. As far as the bank was concerned, </em>Ballen’s authority to endorse was <em>not </em>conditioned upon his depositing the funds so collected in his attorney account. His failure so to deposit was a breach of his trust, but the bank was protected in accepting the endorsement by the second thing authorized in his letter of attorney, to wit: “to endorse any and all checks”. What he did with the funds he collected by the authorized endorsement was of no legal moment to the bank unless it had “actual knowledge that the fiduciary” was “committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in making said deposit” in his personal account. (See Sec. 9 of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act of 1923, P. L. 468).</p>

My answer to this question is “no”. We so held in <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v.

In holding the bank <em>not </em>liable for the resulting loss to the estate, we said: The administrator “had the undoubted right to draw the money and, if he chose, thereupon to deposit the money thus received to the credit of his own account, he had a perfect right to do so. What he did do was nothing more than the equivalent of such action on his part. The money having gone into his own account was subject to be drawn out upon his personal checks Avhich the bank could not refuse to pay. The question is entirely different from the one which would arise if after the deposit was made it was claimed as money of the trust and the bank was notified of the claim before it was paid, but that is not this case.”</p>

The bank has the right to assume that the fiduciary will apply the funds to their proper purposes under the trust, and does not become privy to a misappropriation by merely paying or honoring the cheeks of a depositor drawn upon his individual account in which there are, to the knowledge of the bank, credits created by deposits of the trust funds. But its participation in a diversion of such funds may result from either acquiring an advantage or benefit directly through or from the diversion, or joining in a diversion, in which it was not interested, with actual notice or knowledge that the diversion was intended or was being executed, and thereby becoming privy to it. In that case Judge Collin, speaking for the Court, said: “A bank does not become privy to a misappropriation by merely paying or honoring the checks of a depositor drawn upon his individual account in which there are, in the knowledge of the bank, credits created by deposits of trust funds. The law does not require the bank, under such facts, to assume the hazard of correctly reading in each check the purpose of the drawer, or, being ignorant of the purpose, to dishonor the check. The presumption is, and after the deposits are made remains until annulled by adequate notice or knowledge, that the depositor would preserve or lawfully apply the trust funds. ... A fiduciary may legally deposit the trust funds in a bank to his individual account and credit. Knowledge on the part of the bank of the nature of the funds received and credited does not affect the character of the act. The bank has the right to presume that the fiduciary will apply the funds to their proper purposes under the trust.”</p>

As was pointed out by Mr. Justice Stern in <em>Davis v. Pennsylvania Co., Etc., </em><a href="/pa/337/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="337 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="1197323" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0456-01">337 Pa. 456</a>, 460, section 9 of this legislation “lays down the same test of responsibility in this respect [bad faith] that section 56 of the Negotiable Instruments Law of 1901, P. L. 194, does in regard to notice of an infirmity in a negotiable instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating it.” Before the bank may bring itself within the statutory protection, two conditions must be fulfilled: (1) the fiduciary must be empowered to endorse; and (2) there must be an absence of knowledge on the part of the bank of any fact which would make it guilty of bad faith. Neither of these conditions has been met in the instant case. Bailen was not empowered to endorse the checks; he was only so empowered if he deposited them in his attorney’s account. The sole purpose of the authorization to endorse was to enable him to make deposits under a fiduciary label. To ignore this limitation upon the power, as the majority does when it says that he comes within the literal wording of section 9 because he could under some circumstances endorse, is to indulge in unrealistic scholastic reasoning, and plainly and flagrantly thwarts the intention of the giver of the power. But there is even less ground upon which to base a fulfillment of the second condition, which is not even mentioned in the majority’s opinion. Bailen presented two checks not endorsed by the payee named on their face. In justification of his right to endorse he showed only naked possession; he appeared before the bank with no better credentials than those possessed by a thief. For the bank under such circumstances to have granted his request to honor the checks and pay him the money certainly amounted <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>to bad faith. It was never the intention of the legislature when it enacted section 9 of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act to free the bank of defenses arising from an infirmity of title appearing on the face of the instrument. This factor differentiates the instant case from that of <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Bank, </em><a href="/pa/194/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="194 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="912442" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0334-01">194 Pa. 334</a>, relied on by the majority. There the check was made out to the administrator and endorsed by him as administrator. He had apparent, if not actual, authority to do everything he did up to the point of drawing out the money for his own use, and the bank could not reasonably be expected to divine that when he deposited the proceeds to his personal account he intended later to embezzle them. It was to prevent the assertion of such secret equities, or those difficult of ascertainment, that section 9 was enacted, not to enable one without legal title to create legal title in another, as a thief may do in the case of a bearer instrument. In the present case the endorsement was on its face without authority, and the bank therefore honored it- at its peril. For its misplaced confidence resulting in injury to plaintiff it should be responsible.</p>

As treasurer, Smith was authorized in writing to deposit checks drawn on other banks to plaintiff’s order, and to make payments from the funds on deposit with defendant “upon and according to the checks of plaintiff”, signed by himself as treasurer. In holding that the bank was not warranted in permitting Smith to nullify this written order to the bank by substituting his own oral demand to be paid cash, we said, speaking through Mr. Justice Linn (p. 171) : “The contract between the bank and plaintiff required the bank to pay <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>plaintiff’s checks to the payee designated by plaintiff and to no one else, save on the order of the payee: <em>United Security Life Insurance Co. v.

Therefore it does not come within the protection afforded by section 9 of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act. The consequence of the majority’s holding to the contrary is to enable an agent with a limited power of attorney to transform it into a general one, and thereby commit a fraud upon his principal which the latter may be powerless to redress, and it places a bank which makes no endeavor to learn the terms of the power in a better position than one which ascertains its contents.</p>

As I understand the view of the majority, if the letter of attorney was in the possession of the bank, the contents of the letter of attorney would be regarded as <em>actual notice </em>of the attorney’s breach of trust, and would result in the bank’s liability to the plaintiff. They decide, however, that if the instrument was discovered in the lawyer’s files, a determination that the lawyer did possess authority to endorse would alone be sufficient to relieve the bank from liability. In such circumstance the majority hold that all other parts of the authorization may be disregarded. As I understand it, the issue to be tried by the jury is: in whose possession was the letter of attorney found?</p>
    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[207,1609,1151,698]]]'>I am of the opinion that there is no sound basis for such a highly technical distinction. <em>Since the possible irregularity in the endorsements appeared upon the checks themselves, </em>it immediately placed the defendant bank under a duty to inquire as to the scope of the lawyer’s authority. This the bank did not do. It now seeks refuge in the later discovered letter of attorney— a document which should have been produced in the first instance. The paper reveals upon its face the limitations upon and the extent of the attorney’s authority. It discloses that the lawyer was directed, after collection and endorsement of checks, to place the proceeds in his <em>“attorney’s account”.</em>

The defendant bank also acted in “bad faith” within the meaning of the statute. This is particularly true because the breach of trust was committed in the defendant bank and was, by the deposit in the bank, aided and assisted by the bank employees in entering and recording the deposit. This is a matter of law and not one of fact.</p>
    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[202,787,1152,1353]]]'>The ninth section of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act has been construed by this court on three occasions: In <em>Pennsylvania Co., etc. v. Ninth Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/306/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="306 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1136852" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0148-01">306 Pa. 148</a>, a check was given by a trustee to a bank in payment of the trustee’s personal debt to the bank. In an opinion by Mr. Justice Drew, in which the bank was held liable, it is stated (P. 153), “. . . it had knowledge of all the facts essential to show a breach of trust”. In <em>Union Bank and Trust Co. v. Girard Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/307/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="307 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1138185" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0488-01">307 Pa. 488</a>, two officers of the bank were authorized to execute clearing house due bills, which they did. There existed no facts to put the payee bank on inquiry as to a breach of trust (pp. 496-497), and, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Linn, we held that the payee bank incurred no liability. In <em>Davis, Trustee, v. Pennsylvania Co., etc., </em><a href="/pa/337/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="337 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="1197323" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0456-01">337 Pa. 456</a>, we held, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Stern, that a bank was not liable, for receiving, as a deposit in a fiduciary’s <em>personal </em>account, a check drawn by the fiduciary on the <em>trust </em>account and payable to his own order. (P. 459) “. . . <em>unless the bank received the deposit or pays the cheek with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in making such deposit or in drawing such check, or with knowledge of such facts that its action in receiving the deposit or paying the check amounts to bad faith”.</em>

The facts in the present case, however, present an entirely different situation. <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>Here there were endorsements which should have placed any intelligent and careful banker upon notice. The bank well knew, or should have known, that the duties of a lawyer for an estate are limited solely to legal matters and, in the absence of special authority, have nothing to do with the fiscal affairs of the estate. It, therefore, imposed a duty upon the bank to inquire concerning the basis and scope of the lawyer’s authority. Had it performed this duty, the power of attorney would have disclosed the extent of the lawyer’s authority. With the deposit in the defendant bank it revealed also the commission of the breach of trust in which the bank participated. In its failure to act, and by its participation, the bank should, in my opinion, be held liable under principles analogous to those stated in <em>Pennsylvania Co., etc. v. Ninth Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b121-4" data-blocks='[["BL_121.4",121,[197,1174,1152,916]]]'>I am led by the foregoing situation into an examination of the decisions as to what constitutes <em>actual notice </em>under the statute. The majority <em>assumes </em>that it must always be affirmative proof of the fact itself. On the contrary, notice is regarded in law as <em>actual </em>when the party sought to be affected by it knows of the existence of the particular fact in question, <em>or is conscious of having the means of knowing it. </em>46 C. J. 539, §7. The type of notice referred to as <em>“actual </em>notice” is susceptible of sub-division; it may be either express or implied; that is, it may consist of knowledge actually brought personally home, <em>or it may consist of knowledge of facts so informing that a reasonably cautious person would be led by them to the ultimate fact. </em>(Italics mine.) <em>Id. </em>§8, see <em>City of Baltimore v. Whittington, </em><a href="/md/78/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="78 Md. 231" data-case-ids="1790286" data-case-paths="/md/78/0231-01">78 Md. 231</a>, 235; <em>Rhodes v.

This, in my opinion, constitutes <em>actual notice </em>within the meaning of the statute. In other fields liability has always accrued where a person is put upon inquiry but fails to act: <em>Bradlee &amp; Co. v. Whitney &amp; Kemmerer, </em><a href="/pa/108/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="108 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="539210" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0362-01">108 Pa. 362</a>; see also <em>McCray v.

    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[218,736,1153,968]]]'>Furthermore, I am of the opinion that these facts reveal <em>“bad </em>faith” as defined by the Act. Bad faith, in such circumstances, is stated by Mr. Justice Linn in <em>Union Bank </em>&amp; <em>Tr. Co. v.

Much learning has been expended upon the subject as to what constitutes “actual notice” and “bad faith” under the Uniform Fiduciaries Act, all of which affirm the principles above stated: see <em>Brannan’s Negotiable Instrument Law </em>(Sixth Edition) 633; 18 Michigan Law Review 355; 81 University of Pennsylvania Law Review 617; 3 Scott, Trusts, §324.5, p. 1752, <em>et seq.</em>

The effect should be precisely as if it had been presented to the bank at the time of the deposit. Since the. bank was delinquent in its duty to secure the production of the power of attorney originally, it certainly should be placed in no better position merely because of the fortuitous circumstance that the letter remained in the lawyer’s file. The bank should not be permitted to profit by its own delinquency. Moreover, it is equally clear that the letter cannot be used by the bank to establish the authority of the attorney Avithout regard to the <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>other provisions appearing in the same instrument.
