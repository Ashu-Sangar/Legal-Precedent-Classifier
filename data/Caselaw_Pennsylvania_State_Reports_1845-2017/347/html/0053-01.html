The fund on which Mrs. Huff received income was approximately $218,750, and from the death of the testator until June 19, 1939, the date of the account, she received $111,129.66 income. She died January 14, 1942. The executors’ account, which, according to the Docket Entry, had been filed July 22, 1939, was confirmed absolutely August 2, 1939. With respect to the Huff-Adrian-Dorzuk property, the account showed an investment of $45,693.21 as of that date.</p>

It was stated in argument that the same five children sharing in testator’s estate, share in the same proportions the residuary estate of their mother. Obviously, if she joined in paying herself out of the wrong fund, and if her estate is now required to restore to capital the amount wrongfully received by her as income, her children will receive just that much less from her estate as would be gained by surcharging her in their father’s <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>estate. We all agree that there is no merit in the appeal and that the final decree is required by the equities of the case.</p>
    <p id="b78-4" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[195,461,1153,1352]]]'>Testator, Huff, was President of the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Greensburg; Adrian was the Treasurer of the company and, in 1930, defaulted and absconded. In April, 1926, Dorzuk bought the property and gave his bond and purchase money mortgage for $9,000, apparently the full value; the bond and mortgage were assigned to Safe Deposit. Dorzuk then conveyed to Huff and Adrian undivided two-thirds interest in the property, the grantees agreeing to pay two-thirds of the $9,000 mortgage. Improvements were made and the property was appraised at $40,000. In August, 1927, the then owners, Huff, Adrian and Dorzuk, executed a second mortgage and gave their joint and several bond to Safe Deposit in the sum of $23,000. Safe Deposit then owned the two mortgages aggregating $32,000; the title to the land was in Huff, Adrian and Dorzuk. In the Inheritance Tax Appraisement, Huff’s undivided one-third interest in the property was appraised at $15,000. On September 24, 1928, the executors paid one-third of each of the mortgages with interest to that date, a payment which did not discharge Huff’s estate of contingent obligation resulting from the covenant assuming personal responsibility in the case of the $9,000 mortgage and the joint and several liability on the second mortgage bond.</p>

February 2, 1939, Barclay assigned both mortgages and the bond accompanying the first mortgage, and the judgment on the bond accompanying the second mortgage, to the testator’s executors and, next day, at the sheriff’s sale, the undivided two-thirds interest of Adrian and Dorzuk was bought for $1.00 by the executors. No interest on the mortgages had been paid since September 21,1929, the income from the property having been “consumed” as the learned judge found, “. . . by repairs, insurance, ete., without <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>the payment of any interest.” Early in 1939, Barclay paid principal and interest to February 3, 1939 (the day on which testator’s estate became the sole owner of the property) amounting to $33,686.03 and $840.31 in taxes. The account shows that these sums and other sums were paid out of principal, the total so paid being the sum of $45,693.21,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> as stated in the decree of distribution.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.4",80,[183,737,1152,536]]]'>Argument was heard on the exceptions December 27, 1939. Afterward, on April 25, 1940, counsel for the exceptants obtained a rule on Barclay to show cause why it should not be made a party to the record as trustee of the estate of William A. Huff and why the exceptions theretofore filed should not be made applicable to it “. . . as though Barclay Westmoreland Trust Company had filed and was a party to said account, . . .” The court ordered that it be made a party “without prejudice.”</p>

      <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>The appellants now contend that Barclay committed a breach of trust when it joined in selling to the executors the $3,000 interest in the first mortgage on the Huff-Adrian-Dorzuk property and should therefore be surcharged. In the circumstances, we must reject the contention. This $3,000 interest had been owned by Safe Deposit and passed to Barclay pursuant to the agreement, as has been stated. Testator had obligated himself for $29,000 plus interest on the bonds and mortgages. The property, according to the appraisements in evidence, at all times had a value very much in excess of the $3,000 interest, and common sense and business prudence required that the executors protect their investment by acquiring this small interest to which their investment was subordinated. The measure of duty imposed by law on the fiduciary was due care in the circumstances: <em>Jones’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/344/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="344 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1211007" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0100-01">344 Pa. 100</a>, 104, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20434" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="23 A.2d 434">23 A. 2d 434</a>. It was a salvage operation. If, in advance of the sale, Barclay had asked leave of court to make it, leave would undoubtedly have been granted; to refuse would have been an abuse of discretion.</p>
    <p id="b81-4" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[236,1462,1151,971]]]'>With respect to the payment of interest on the mortgages and taxes out of principal instead of income, the court was properly of opinion that the interest and taxes should have been paid out of income before Mrs. Huff received income, but the court noted that since her participation in the wrong, she had died and that ex-ceptants had not brought in her representatives. Presumably, pursuant to paragraph 6 of the will, quoted above, she received the quarterly statements and made the settlements required; there is evidence that she participated in administration. She not only appears, therefore, to ha.ve participated in the wrongful diversion of principal and income but to have been the sole beneficiary of the diversion. Section 258 of the Restatement of Trusts provides: “(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), where two trustees are liable to the beneficiary for a breach of trust, each of them is entitled to contribution from the other, except that</p>

    <p id="b82-7" data-blocks='[["BL_82.6",82,[167,963,1151,807]]]'>Comment d. states: <em>“Trustees not equally at fault. </em>Where a breach of trust is committed and one of two trustees is substantially more at fault than the other, although both are liable to the beneficiary for the breach of trust, the loss should ultimately be borne by the trustee who is more at fault. If, therefore, that trustee makes good the amount of the loss resulting from the breach of trust, he is not entitled to contribution from the other trustee; and, conversely, where the other trustee makes good the loss he is entitled not merely to contribution but to indemnity from the trustee who is more at fault.” The learned court was right in refusing to surcharge Barclay, apart altogether from the question, which we need not discuss, whether Barclay could be surcharged in this proceeding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
