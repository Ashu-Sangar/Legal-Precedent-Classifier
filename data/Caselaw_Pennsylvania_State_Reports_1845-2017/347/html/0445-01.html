They resided in Lehighton. Komatowski made his home with Evelyn Christman, who was Rehrick’s partner in the textile business. In the colder parts of the year Rehrick, who apparently lived much apart from his wife and daughter, spent considerable time with Miss Christman and Komatowski at the Christman residence. The Rehrick family and Miss Christman each had a cottage in the country a few miles from Lehighton. Rehrick spent the summer months at the Rehrick cottage, while Miss Christman and Komatowski spent considerable time at the Christman cottage at the same place. There was a small pool 35 feet west of the Rehrick cottage and 70 feet north of the Christ-man cottage. It was 19 inches deep at the edge and 22 inches deep at the center. The Commonwealth charged that on Saturday, June 7, 1941, Komatowski took Rehrick from the porch of the latter’s cottage to the pool and “heaved” him into it, thus causing him to drown. It was established that he was drowned and there were only negligible marks on his body. He suffered from paralysis agitans and had little muscular control. He was attended by a man named Auge. On the Saturday in question Auge attended him at the Rehrick cottage and then departed, leaving Rehrick on his porch with Komatowski and a man named Pennell.</p>

M. on the night of his death, Rehrick was “very feeble” and “shuffled along” and the defendant helped him in his walking. <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>Later he saw Rehrick “standing on the porch”. Pennell then left and went to the Christman cottage. While he was at the Christman cottage is the time the Commonwealth claims that the drowning of Rehrick took place. Pennell was asked: “Did yon hear any noise [at that time] ?” He answered, “No”, and in reply to a question said there was “no reason why he didn’t hear” [if there had been a noise]. Then the defendant came over to Pennell and said, “I have got to get out of here before the A. &amp; P. store closes.” That was about 7 P. M. He and defendant left together. Pennell asked defendant how the old man [Rehrick] was, and Komatowski said “O. K.” They then went away and after stopping at a few places for alcoholic beverages they arrived at the A. &amp; P. store about 8 P. M. At 9 P. M. defendant said he had to get back “to stay with the old man that night”.</p>

Sunday, June 28th. At that time Hall had a flashlight with him. He was accompanied by Komatowski and he suggested to the latter that they “report the thing”. It was reported, and Corporal Mcllvaine of the Pennsylvania Motor Police arrived about 10:45 P. M., when the body was taken from the water. Komatowski was not present at that time. He was taken into custody that evening and on the following Tuesday he signed a confession which he later repudiated and which he declared he was forced by the officers to make. In.this confession defendant made this statement: “I walked up the front steps of Rehrig’s bungalow, and I found Pierce Rehrig standing up against the railing, shaking and in a terrible nervous condition. I asked him what was wrong. He said he wished he was dead. He then asked me to take him down to the water, as he wanted to die, that he was tired of living. I stayed on the porch about five minutes trying to talk him out of the idea, but it was no use, as he kept on begging. Finally I took a hold on his right arm and led him down the front steps, and toward the pool, I lifted both of his <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>feet over tlie wooden cap piece on the side of the dam, and stood him on the edge of the dam face forward, and leaning forward. I released my grip on him and he fell into the dam. I turned around and walked across the auto drive to the place where Pennell and I had been sitting. When I got there Pennell was gone, so I walked over to my parked car, and Pennell was sitting. The back of my car was toward the dam, facing toward the highway.”</p>

The two chief factual issues were, first, Rehrick’s ability to walk without assistance, its being the Commonwealth’s contention that he could not have gotten from the porch to the pool unless someone carried him there or helped him there. On this question the testimony was completely conflicting. The other issue was whether or not defendant’s confession, which he made on the Tuesday after Rehrick’s death and which defendant later repudiated, was forced from him by methods which are customarily referred to as “the third degree” and which appellant’s counsel characterize as “brutal and inhuman treatment”. These two issues of fact, like all other factual issues, were of course for the jury. The record shows that the jury rendered the following verdict: “And Now, January 29th, 1942, the Jury in this case came into Court and say they find the defendant, Fred Komatowski, Guilty of Murder in the Third Degree — at 1:45 P. M.” The jury was then polled, and their answer in each case was “Guilty of Murder in the Third Degree.” The Clerk <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>then said to the jurors: “. . . You say you find the defendant guilty of Murder in the third degree. Is this your verdict?” The jury answered: “It is.” The defendant was thus convicted of a crime utterly unknown to the law. Defendant filed a motion for arrest of judgment on the ground that the verdict rendered by the jury was without legal effect. This motion should have been granted. It was denied and the defendant was sentenced to pay a fine of $3,000 and to undergo imprisonment in the Eastern Penitentiary for from six to twelve years for “voluntary manslaughter”, a crime of which he had <em>not </em>been convicted.</p>

As to this discharge on June 10th, the appellant’s paper book contains the following statement: “The District Attorney promised that if the defendant would say nothing anywhere else about his ill treatment [preceding the confession] the charge of homicide would be dropped. Komatowski accordingly made the promise and the charge was dropped. The District Attorney refused to prosecute, believing the confession was forced, but later proceedings were re-commenced by others against Komatowski.” (He was re-arrested on June 24th.) In the Commonwealth’s brief the following statement is made: “District Attorney Heimbach upon a report to him that Komatowski had verbally admitted he helped Rehrig to commit suicide, after Komatowski had re-enacted the crime to James Yenser, Chief of Police of Lehighton, and the prosecutor, Corporal Mcllvaine, on two occasions, after he declared he heaved Rehrig into the pool, and after the defendant signed a written confession admitting the crime, instituted a proceeding before Squire Seip of Palmerton, Pa. This proceeding was dismissed at the suggestion of the District Attorney, in a hearing had secretly at midnight . . . The District Attorney <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>did not withdraw from the prosecution because he believed the confessions were forced, or that prosecution Avas caused by other persons. District Attorney' Heim.bach petitioned the Court to be superseded because he alleged that he was counsel for persons who might be involved in the prosecution, as private counsel before the crime. He further asked to be superseded because he believed he might be called as a witness for the Commonwealth in this connection.”</p>
    <p id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.4",472,[206,815,1149,535]]]'>District Attorney Heimbach may have had proper personal reasons for getting out of this case after the defendant was re-arrested for this alleged murder, but the dropping of his murder charge so suddenly after Komatowsld’s alleged confession and after his promise not to prosecute those officers who, he said, had beaten him, creates a suspicion that certain persons who helped secure that confession had something which they wished to “cover up” and that the best way to do this was to bribe Komatowski into silence by setting him free.</p>

He testified that he asked the defendant to “promise me that upon his release that evening” in the office of ’Squire Seip that he, the defendant, “would not mention anything whatsoever relative to having been beaten up by any of the officers”, and that “he so promised”. He also said that Komatowski refused to sign the alleged confession unless the allegation that “it was true” was stricken out. On cross-examination the district attorney made this statement: “After Fred Komatowski had stated that the confession was gotten out of him as a result of being beaten up, beaten up by Harry Yenser,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> [Chief of Police of Lehighton], after it was decided to dismiss Mr. Komatowski for the time being, I turned to Mr. Komatowski in the presense of Mcllvaine, Hines, and <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>I believe ’Squire Seip, and told Komatowski tbat be was going to be discharged, but prior to being discharged he would have to submit himself to a medical examination that evening, that the medical examination could be dispensed with if he promised me that in the future he would not mention being beaten up, neither would he bring any suit against any of the officers charged with having beaten him up. He did not refuse to submit to an examination by a physician, but he did state that instead of being examined by a physician that he accepted the second of the alternatives, that is, that he would not mention the fact that he was beaten up. Therefore, he was discharged that evening.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

To beat up a defendant while he is in custody is a crime not only against the immediate victim but also against the public, for it brings the administration of justice into disrepute. If the district attorney induced this defendant not to prosecute those who had assaulted him, by promising to release him from custody, his action comes very close to compounding a crime.</p>

Gable, </em>7 S. &amp; R. 423. In that case the defendant was tried for murder. The verdict was “not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter”. A motion was made in arrest of judgment. The court ruled that the intention of the jury was sufficiently manifest from its verdict and that it supported a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. This court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Tilghman, said: “One who is indicted of murder, cannot be convicted of involuntary manslaughter, because it is well settled, that there cannot be a conviction of a misdemeanor, on an indictment for felony. Therefore, when on an indictment for murder, the jury find that the defendant is guilty of manslaughter, it must be understood, such manslaughter as is felonious, which can be no other than voluntary manslaughter.”</p>

Since malice is an ingredient of murder but not of manslaughter, “murder of the <em>third </em>degree” cannot by any process of reasoning be construed as voluntary manslaughter. Blackstone says that manslaughter when voluntary arises from the sudden heat of the passions, murder from the wickedness of the heart.” (4 Blackstone 190). A sentence to the penitentiary on a verdict like the one now before us cannot be permitted to stand merely on the trial judge’s <em>conjecture </em>that the jury <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>

We may, therefore, from its common use in the case, deduce its meaning and the jury in its finding adopted this language and convicted in that degree . . .

The administration of justice must become a mockery if the courts were required to receive and record every verdict tendered, however informal and unresponsive to the issue . . . When the verdict tendered is defective in form only, being sufficient in substance, it is proper for the court to direct the jury how it may be amended. When the finding is defective in substance, the correction must be made by the jury, and the court should be careful to avoid suggesting what the substance of the verdict shall be. When a jury tenders a verdict which is defective in substance, uncertain, repugnant, or not responsive to the issue, it is proper for the court to reject it, as not warranted by law,, call the attention of the jury to the defect, instruct them as to the form of verdict in case they mean to acquit or convict the defendant and send them back to their room where they can, untrammeled by the presence and influence of others, find such verdict as they think proper”, (citing numerous cases).</p>

Black in the case in which he secured an order from the Supreme Court of the United States for the release in habeas corpus proceedings of Milligan, Bowles and Horsey (Ex <em>parte Milligan, </em><a href="/us/71/0002-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 Wall. 2" data-case-ids="6136169,6136640" data-case-paths="/us/71/0002-01,/us/71/0002-02">4 Wall. 2</a>), who were under sentence of death imposed upon them by a military commission convened at Indianapolis in 1864, Attorney Black said: “My clients were dragged before this strange tribunal, and after a proceeding which it would be mockery to call a trial, they were ordered to be hung. The charge against them was put into writing and is found on this record, but you wiU not be able to decipher its meaning . . . The judge advocate <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>must have meant to charge them with some offense unknown to the laws, which' he chose to make capital by legislation of his own, and the commissioners were so profoundly ignorant as to think that the legal innocence of the parties made no difference in the case . . . The commissioners are not on trial; they are absent and undefended; and they are entitled to the benefit of that charity which presumes them to be wholly unacquainted with the first principles of natural justice, and quite unable to comprehend either the law or the facts of a criminal cause.”</p>

Whether these words were quoted from Komatowski or are the trial judge’s is not indicated. In narrating to the jury another witness’s testimony the trial judge said, “Corporal Mellvaine explained the four degrees of homicide”. Whether in saying this the trial judge was using Corporal Mcllvaine’s words or his own does not appear. Such expressions from the trial judge naturally misled the jury to return this improper verdict, which is apparently without a parallel in the annals of the criminal courts of this Commonwealth.</p>
