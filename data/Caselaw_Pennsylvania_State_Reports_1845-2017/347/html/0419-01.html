The justification of this rule is to be sought in the age-long experience of mankind that ordinarily an innocent person will spontaneously repel false accusations against him, and that a failure to do so is therefore some indication of guilt. Of course, it is far from conclusive; it is analogous to the rule which permits evidence of the flight of the accused, his demeanor and conduct when charged with crime or taken into custody, and other acts and circumstances indicating his reaction to the situation in which he is involved. The accusatory statement, being hearsay, is not admissible as evidence in itself of the facts which it asserts, but merely to show what the charges were to which defendant offered no denial; its probative force is derived, not from the credibility of the accuser, but from the silence of the accused in response to it.</p>

Undoubtedly it is evidence of such a nature as to require that it be appraised with caution, and if it be referred to at all by the trial judge in his charge he should so instruct the jury. Persons do not all react the same way in identical situations; where one is emotional, impulsive and quick to assert his rights, another may be timid and easily cowed, especially in the presence of officers of the law; the rule reflects only in the manner in which the <em>average </em>man is apt to conduct himself in such a situation. Similarly in regard to flight, although generally “the wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the righteous are bold as a lion,” there are some people who, though guiltless of wrong-doing, have a deep-seated fear of policemen and the processes of the law. While <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>not a bar to tbe admissibility of the evidence, the fact that the person accused was under arrest and that the charges against him were made by or in the presence of officials is to be taken into consideration by the jury in determining whether his standing mute should give rise to an inference of guilt. The only questions for the court in passing upon the admissibility of the evidence are whether the statements made in the presence and hearing of the accused were such as would naturally call for a denial and whether it was reasonably apparent to him that he had the opportunity and the liberty to speak; any reasons advanced by him to explain his failure to do so are then for the jury. “The probative weight to be attached to evidence of this character is peculiarly a question for the jury to decide in the light of the provocative character of the statements, the character of the surrounding circumstances . . . , and any other matters explanatory of the failure of the accused to speak”: 20 Am. Jur. §1197, pp. 1049,1050. “It is clear that no particular conduct or acquiescence can be classed as constituting a proper or improper admission, and hence it is practically impossible for a court to charge, as a matter of law, what conduct or acquiescence constitutes, or does not constitute, an admission. It is equally clear that the jury must pass upon the question, as a matter of fact, to determine its credibility, as in all other cases of circumstantial evidence”: Wharton’s Criminal Evidence (11th ed.) sec. 665, p. 1107.</p>

For example, when Washington was President of the United States and residing in Philadelphia, the local “Aurora”, edited by Benjamin Franklin Bache (Franklin’s grandson), charged Washington with “overdrawing his salary” and being a “common defaulter”. When Washington left the presidency on March 4,1797, Bache’s newspaper said: “If ever there was a period for rejoicing, this is the moment . . . The name of Washington from this day ceases to give a currency to political iniquity and to legalize corruption” (Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. 1, p. 462). There is no record of Washington ever replying to these accusations, but his silence has never been “admitted” as evidence against his integrity in the court of history.</p>

The record shows that “Mrs. Mayes pointed to the defendant and said he was the one that performed” the illegal operation and “it cost her forty dollars”. The defendant was then asked: “if he had anything to say and he had nothing to say”. The Superior Court said: “It does not appear to us that [an innocent man] would have remained silent under such serious charges.” In the instant case no one “pointed to” this defendant and he was not invited to say anything. He had no reason to believe that he was <em>expected </em>to say anything. It was the woman and not himself who was being interrogated. He might reasonably have expected that his own interrogation would come later. The accusation implicit in the woman’s statements was made not <em>to him </em>but to the officers. Furthermore, it was not nearly so serious as the charge in the <em>Weigand </em>case in which death had been feloniously caused allegedly by the defendant in that case. One’s natural reaction to a less serious charge is likely to be less violent than to a grave charge such as the one made against Weigand. For example, if the “average man” was taken to the district attorney’s office in some city and directly charged with a murder of which he was innocent, he might be shocked into making an instantaneous denial, whereas if he was taken to the same place and heard some women narrate to the officers a story which indicated that he was guilty of violating the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C.A. sec. 397, when in fact, he was not so guilty, he would be likely to conclude that he was being made the victim of a blackmail plot and if he had even ordinary “common sense” would <em>say nothing </em>until he could consult with counsel. Even innocent men have been known to “talk themselves into jail”. When any man talks in the presence of only his accusers and hostile officers, his “talk” may not be recognizable even by himself when next he sees it in print or hears it reported.</p>

The jury had heard defendant’s counsel object to the admission of this evidence as “an effort now being made to attach to the defendant an.admission by silence on .the part of himself to questions that were asked of Alice Ewadinger in his presence”. Counsel then gave good reasons for his objections, such as that defendant when .in the district attorney’s office being “in hostile company” and “not being permitted to interpose any objections to what was being said about him” etc. The jury heard the court say :‘ “Objection overruled”.
