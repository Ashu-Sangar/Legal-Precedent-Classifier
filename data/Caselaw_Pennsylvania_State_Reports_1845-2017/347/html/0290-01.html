When this bill was filed all of these executors except Miss Smith were dead.

It avers that it is willing to abide by the agreement to pay the executors of Miss Smith’s estate $2,512.50. It says: “The only reason why the agreement was not carried out during the life time of Miss Smith was because of the doubt whether her estate and interest was absolute or was a life estate. Glen Alden also says “that upon the death of one having an interest as lessor in such a lease [as this], the royalties are payable to his personal representatives until such time as proper distribution of his estate has been made.

After making specific devises and bequests of certain lands and personal property not involved in this case, the testator in the ninth paragraph of his will devised and bequeathed “all the rest, residue and remainder” of his estate, “real, personal and mixed” to his four children (naming them) and then added: “Should my daughter, May Virginia Smith, die leaving no child or children or issue of deceased children living at the time of her death, I give, devise and bequeath her share of my residuary estate to my other three children aforesaid and their heirs share <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>and share alike.” When testator died, his interest in the 1879 lease on the coal and his right to surface support over that coal were intact.</p>

      <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>In the instant case we must, to he consistent with our rulings in <em>Lerch's Estate, Crawford </em>v. <em>Withrow, </em>and <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Greene Improvement Co., </em>all supra, and in many other cases, hold that the applicable testamentary provision here meant Miss Smith’s death without issue <em>in the lifetime of the testator. </em>Since Miss Smith died without issue after the testator’s death, the restrictive provision cited was inoperative to limit her inheritance. We agree with thé court below that it was the manifest intent of the testator throughout his will to equalize his children in the distribution in the enjoyment of his estate. In the eleventh paragraph of his will he stated that he “tried to make a fair disposition of my property to my four children”. Dividing the property <em>equally </em>among the four children was manifestly a “fair disposition”. The court below pointed out that “it appears throughout the administration of the estate that distribution and conveyances had been made in which all of the heirs, devisees and legatees evidently assumed and took for granted that May Virginia Smith took an absolute interest, share and share alike, with John B. Smith’s other children, notwithstanding the contingency mentioned in the ninth paragraph of the will concerning her decease without marriage and issue”. It is true, as the court ended; “Those transactions . . . have no controlling force . . . but they have some significance.” What <em>is </em>controlling with us is that the testamentary provisions in the three cases last above cited are substantially identical with the restrictive provisions in the will before us. The decisions in those cases therefore rule this case.</p>

If it was the latter it is vested in the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. for administration. It is settled in this State that a lease of coal in place, such as this is, “until such time as all the available merchantable coa.1 shall have been mined and removed”, <em>is a sale of an estate in fee simple </em>and leaves the <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>lessor with only an interest in the royalties to be paid him under that lease.

It differs from a <em>remainder </em>in that it arises by <em>act of the law, </em>whereas a <em>remainder </em>is by <em>act of the parties. </em>A reversion, moreover, is the remnant <em>left in the grantor, </em>whilst a remainder is the remnant of the whole estate disposed of, after a preceding part of the same has been given away.” After the lease of 1879 went into effect the testator had neither a reversion nor a remainder in the coal which was the subject of the lease.
