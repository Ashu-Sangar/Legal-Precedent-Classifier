Testator’s dominant or primary purpose was to give the income to his wife for life, then to the persons he described as annuitants (of whom only his daughter-in-law survives) and his grandson who, after the life interests and subject to them, was also to receive the principal by the time he became 35, his issue, if any, taking if he died before 35. To avoid partial intestacy, it was necessary to make an alternative gift of principal to become effective if the grandson died before 35 without surviving issue. If he becomes 35, he receives the entire principal and the alternative beneficiaries take nothing. Among the alternative beneficiaries is the appellant, who, if the primary plan fails, will, by the fifth paragraph, clause (b), receive $100,000 for its Endowment Fund. The codicil merely modified part of the trust. The application of well settled rules will not permit the court to conclude that, by what he said, he intended, on the death of the wife, to terminate the trust and require redistribution of principal.</p>

    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.4",303,[228,896,1150,1029]]]'>On behalf of the hospital it is said that the only limitation is that the legacy shall be paid “after the death of my wife,” that “after” shall be read “upon,” that, as the brief says, “he intended the gift to be payable upon the death of his wife without further contingency.” To reach that result it is necessary to say that the codicil is ambiguous; “after” is sometimes used in the limited sense of “upon” but in this codicil the general meaning of “after” more fully accords with the dominant purpose expressed in the will. In any view, resort must be had to the context which necessarily includes the will, to see which of two possible meanings was intended. When the context is examined, the hospital’s argument breaks down. The codicil operates on the trust of the residue; it is in this trust that the testator made the alternative provision (in which the hospital may share) to be substituted if his dominant intention be frustrated by the death of his grandson without issue before becoming 35 years old.</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[227,1937,1150,426]],["BL_304.1",304,[208,296,1152,1845]]]'>Appellant also contrasts the words at the beginning of the codicil “that after the death of my wife and the death of my surviving grandson without leaving lawful issue surviving” with the direction to pay the additional sum to the hospital “after the death of my wife . . .” and the omission to repeat the words after “the death of my surviving grandson” etc., as indicating an intention to change the contingency on which the hospital <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>should take the “additional sum” from the contingency on which it should take the first $100,000. But this argument must be rejected. The codicil does not accurately state the conditions on which the grandson was to take. As appears from the quotation of the Fifth paragraph, clause (a), made above, the testator said that if the grandson lived to be 35 years old he should receive the whole principal in which event the substituted beneficiaries would receive nothing whether the grandson died afterward without issue or not. The scrivener of the codicil by the two references to the fifth paragraph was obviously merely identifying the substitutionary disposition of the principal of the residuary trust for purposes of modification by the codicil and was not attempting, by such references, to alter the dominant disposition. This argument as well as that based on the substitution of “upon” for “after” shows the ambiguity and the uncertainty on which appellant must rely to support its contention and which prevent its adoption as the cases cited above in <em>Rainear’s Est. </em>show. But appellant’s position becomes weaker still when the words “additional sum” etc., are considered. The scrivener is assumed to have been familiar with the legal effect of the words used. In <em>Phillips’s Estate, </em>1 Dist. R. 311, it appeared that after giving a nephew a share of her residuary estate in her will, the testatrix, by codicil, subjected it to spendthrift trust provisions; by a later codicil she gave her nephew “the interest of $6,000 in addition to the amount left to him in my will to be paid to him monthly.” It was held that the gift in the second codicil was subject to the spendthrift trust for the original share. Judge Penrose said: “The case falls directly within the reason of the rule as stated in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Lord Harrowby, </em>Johns. 427,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (Hawkins on Wills, 306) :</p>

The objection to all of appellant’s contentions is that the codicil was obviously intended to dispose of part of the principal if the grandson died before 35 without surviving issue, and that he intended the additional gift to affect only the scheme of distribution which he had substituted to be effective on the failure stated.</p>
