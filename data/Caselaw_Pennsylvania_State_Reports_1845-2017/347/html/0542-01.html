They were so considered here on argument and, as they all involve the same fundamental questions, the appeals will be disposed of in one opinion. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendant from putting into operation an ordinance providing for the installation of parking meters in a congested section of the city of Easton, and asked for the removal of such meters if they were installed before the <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>entry of tlie decree sought. Three of the bills were brought by owners of property abutting on streets in the meter zone and the fourth was a taxpayer’s bill. The chancellor, affirmed by the court below, dismissed the bills. We agree with that conclusion.</p>

The ordinance by its preamble declared that in certain sections of the city the free movement of traffic had been impeded for a long period, that attempts to regulate it were not successful, that the existing conditions were a menace to life, limb and property, and that in the opinion of the council the best method to correct these conditions was to designate individual parking spaces in the congested area for parking purposes “for reasonable intervals of time” and to require the users of such space to pay “a portion of the cost of establishing and maintaining the same”. The ordinance then provided for the installation of registering meters and a charge of one cent for twelve minutes and five cents for one hour. It did not permit parking for more than one hour in the designated area. Parking space was to be free “for loading and unloading purposes”, and free parking was permitted on holidays and after business hours. Penalties were provided for violation of the terms of the ordinance.</p>

Highways are primarily for travel. As Lord Ellen-borough said in an early case, <em>Rex v. Cross, </em>3 Camp. 224, 227: “No one <em>can </em>make a stable-yard of the <em>King’s </em>highway.” To paraphrase that statement as applied to the present day: “No one may make a public garage of a public highway.” That, however, is not the situation here for today temporary and reasonable stops of motor cars are lawful incidents of travel. It would unduly interfere with convenient travel by motor car if one could not stop for a short interval for the accomplishment of the purpose or purposes of the trip. “Doubtless temporary and reasonable stops of automobiles on highways are lawful as an incident to travel”: <em>In re Opinion of the Justices, </em><a href="/mass/297/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="297 Mass. 559" data-case-ids="886368" data-case-paths="/mass/297/0559-01">297 Mass. 559</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20N.E.2d%20179" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="8 N.E.2d 179">8 N.

Everyday experience demonstrates the accuracy of that statement. Assuming that such stops may overtax the capacity of streets most of which were laid out in a different age and that conflicts of rights are bound to arise, the state in the exercise of its police power may adopt reasonable regulations for the purpose of meeting the situation. It is that inherent power which the state has invoked here: <em>F-K Market House Co. v. Reading, </em><a href="/pa/310/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="310 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1144320" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0493-01">310 Pa. 493</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%20398" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="165 A. 398">165 A. 398</a>.

The findings of the court show that the plan when put in operation was a success. “It is not necessarily an infringement of the rights of individuals in public ways to charge a small fee for some legitimate special use to defray the cost of the special service afforded”: <em>In re Opinion of the Justices, </em>supra. “It has been recognized consistently by judicial authority that Avhere it is necessary in the proper conduct of business that unusual demands be made on the city facilities, a reasonable charge may be made by the rmmicipality to cover its actual expense in providing such special serffices. ...

We agree with the court below that appellants failed to meet that burden. The receipts from the operations of the parking meters for the period between October 31,1941, and April 13,1942, were shown conclusively by stipulation. No stipulation was filed as to cost of operation and there is nothing in the record to show the actual expenditures during that period or any other date. Neither is there any evidence from which a reasonable estimate of the probable costs of the special service can be made. There was admitted in evidence a budgetary statement by the Director of Finance.

However, it was shown by uncontradicted evidence that the budgetary statement was inaccurate as applied to the present controversy. For example, it charged the entire cost of installation of the meters in one year although they had a life of approximately five years. The police supervision as stated was shown not to reflect the true situation. No allowance was made for possible liability arising through negligence and, in any event, the measure of reasonableness of the charge is not the amount actually expended by the borough in a particular year, much less in part of a year: <em>Chester City v.
