Myers, who was engaged in the insurance and real estate business, and had him prepare for her a judgment note in the sum of $2,000, payable to John K. Euch on demand, without interest, and containing the legend: “This note is not to be exercised until after my death.” On January 22,1937, she had him prepare a similar note in the same amount and with the same inscription. On September 5,1941, she had him prepare a third note, also for $2,000, and similar to the other two except that it was marked “For services rendered” and the other notation was omitted. Each of these notes was under seal, signed by Ella Eynier, witnessed by S. A. Myers, executed on the occasions of her respective visits to Myers and dated accordingly. She left the notes with him, telling him that “after her death she will advise her brother to lift the notes,” (evidently meaning that she would direct her brother to call for them after her death).

But where the purpose of the donor to make a present gift clearly appears, and explicit directions are given as to the person to whom final delivery is to be made, as well as the time when and the event or contingency upon which it is to be made, the transaction is upheld as vesting a valid title in the donee to the deed, bond, note, or other instrument which is the subject of the gift. Thus, in <em>Wagoner’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/174/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="174 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="878658" data-case-paths="/pa/174/0558-01">174 Pa. 558</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20A.%20114" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="34 A. 114">34 A. 114</a>, the facts of which are strikingly similar to those in the present case, a man executed a bond payable to his niece and gave it to a justice of the peace to be de<a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>livered to her after the donor’s death; he told her she should go and get it at his death, which she did. The court sustained her claim on the bond against her uncle’s estate.

She never recalled it and after she died it was delivered to the grantee.

She took the deeds away with her and a year after her death they were found in the library of one of her. friends who had died the previous day. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain an inference that the deeds had been given by the grantor to her friend for the purpose of delivery to the grantees at the time of the grantor’s death; accordingly title passed to the grantees as of the time of the first delivery.</p>
