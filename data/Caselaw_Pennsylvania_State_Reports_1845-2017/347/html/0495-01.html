He avers that this refusal subjects him to “cruel and unusual punishments inflicted” in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. He further avers that under the sentences “he has paid the penalty in full.”</p>

On May 4, 1937, the Relator was released, having served 8 years, six months and one day.</p>

In that case, we quote from President Judge Sulzberger in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Bates v. McKenty </em>as follows: “Assuming as we do, for the purpose of interpreting the statute, that it is constitutional, it necessarily follows that the maximum sentence is the only portion of the sentence which has legal validity, and that the minimum sentence is merely an administrative notice by the court to the executive department, calling attention to the legislative policy that when a man’s so-called minimum sentence is about to expire, the question of grace and mercy ought to be considered and the propriety of granting a qualified pardon be determined.”</p>
