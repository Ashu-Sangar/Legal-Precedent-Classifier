A similar rule was obtained by the executors of Jennie King Mellon. Preliminary objections and answers were filed by respondents. No further hearings .were had, and apparently none were <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>requested. On November 10,1941, the court below, upon review of tb'e record, in which the Commonwealth actively participated, discharged the rules, and dismissed the petitions. This appeal by the Commonwealth followed.</p>
    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[196,572,1152,1191]]]'>The petition of the Commonwealth was properly dismissed. Its right to intervene in the present proceedings is rested upon an extremely tenuous foundation. It asserts first that it was a <em>necessary party </em>to the proration proceedings by virtue of its interest in the Estate of Jennie King Mellon for inheritance taxes which <em>might </em>have been collected had the estate proved solvent. Its contention that it had a “vested interest” in the estate is based upon a fundamental misconception of the incidence of the transfer inheritance tax. As recently as <em>Haid Estate, </em><a href="/pa/347/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="347 Pa. 159" data-case-ids="1217338" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0159-01">347 Pa. 159</a>, this court has pointed out that the only property of a decedent subject to this tax is that portion of his net clear estate which passes to the distributees under his will or under the intestate laws. The tax is upon the <em>transfer </em>of property. It is not a tax upon the estate itself. The Commonwealth, therefore, having assessed no inheritance tax against the Jennie King Mellon estate, had no such interest as to make it a necessary party to every action brought against the estate. The Act of 1937, establishing the procedure for proration, certainly contains no requirement that the Commonwealth be joined.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[198,1773,1148,421]]]'>The objection of the Commonwealth that it had no notice of the proceedings is likewise without merit because it has not shown that its status entitled it to such notice or that, as a possible creditor, it informed the executors of its desire to have notice of any such proceedings. The failure to give notice to the Commonwealth did not constitute a violation of any statute or rule of court.</p>
    <p id="b548-6" data-blocks='[["BL_548.6",548,[198,2212,1149,154]],["BL_549.1",549,[204,309,1151,1360]]]'>The Commonwealth contends, however, that, regard-' less of its status as a necessary party, it was entitled to intervene in these proceedings by the Act of July 7, <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>1919, P. L. 731,12 PS Sec. 145, which confers such right upon the State in “all cases at law or in equity” in which it may have “any interest.” We do not accept the contention of the Commonwealth that this statute was designed to permit the Commonwealth to intervene at pleasure in any suit between third parties in which.it claims an interest regardless of how remote, incidental or indirect such interest may be. This construction would authorize intervention by the Commonwealth in any proceeding upon the mere declaration of its officer or agent that it had an interest. We have held that the section has no such effect. See <em>Cameron v. City Bank of York, </em><a href="/pa/284/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="284 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="1092065" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0187-01">284 Pa. 187</a>. Here the Commonwealth bases its claim upon the fact that if the proration decree is permitted to stand, the estate of Jennie King Mellon will be insolvent, and hence the Commonwealth will be deprived of what inheritance tax it might otherwise have received. Such reasoning would justify intervention by the Commonwealth in any suit brought by a creditor against an estate and, if carried to its extreme, might confer the right upon the Commonwealth to intervene in suits between living persons upon the possibility that the estate of one or the other might be diminished, with a consequent putative loss to the Commonwealth in inheritance taxes upon his death.</p>

The Act of 1919, supra, contemplates intervention in pending suits; it does not authorize the Commonwealth to intervene at any time for the purpose of destroying judicial determinations long since concluded. While no express limitation is placed upon the time within which intervention by the Commonwealth may be effected, we held in <em>Commonwealth’s Appeal (White Twp. School Dist.), </em><a href="/pa/305/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="305 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="1134640" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0263-01">305 Pa. 263</a>, that the Commonwealth must make itself heard “in due season 'as other parties litigant’ would be required to do.” It is apparent that this principle is a <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>necessary corollary to the policy of our law that there must be a definitive end to litigation, and that decrees and judgments, unappealed from, are entitled to protection in the interest of legal certainty. In the present case it is true that the five-year period of review had not expired, but this, in itself, does not justify the delay of the Commonwealth. The decree which the Commonwealth seeks to open was entered in 1939. Through its officer, the Register of Wills, the Commonwealth was familiar with the affairs not only of the Richard B. Mellon estate but also of the Jennie King Mellon estate. The Commonwealth admits that it had notice of the decree after the filing of the inventory and appraisement in the latter estate on February 23, 1940. Obviously there was an unwarranted delay in the filing of its petition, which under <em>Commonwealth’s Appeal (White Twp. School Dist.), </em>supra, was fatal to its right.</p>

The Commonwealth offered no new evidence, and asserted at the bar of this court that it had no intention of so doing. In this circumstance, it has little cause to complain of the refusal of its petition, because the action of the court below, in substance, afforded the Commonwealth the review that it sought. Regardless of the Commonwealth’s right to such a review, it was within the power of the court itself to review its decree.

Mellon, they were responsible for the payment of the estate tax in that capacity (Act of February 26,1926, Ch. 27, Sec. 305 (a), <a href="/citations/?q=44%20Stat.%2074" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="44 Stat. 74">44 Stat. 74</a>, 26 IT. S. C. A. Sec. 305 (a) 1926); and as transferees of the property upon which the deficiency assessment was based, they had individual liability (Act of 1926, supra, section 315 (b), 26 U. S. C. A. See. 315 (b) 1926, as amended by the Act of June 6, 1932, Ch. 209, Sec. 803 (c), 47 Stat; 280). They were also subject to individual liability under Section 3467 of the Revised Statutes, 31 U. S. C. A. 192, because, as executors, they had joined in the payment of the debts of the decedent prior to the payment of the tax deficiency. The record shows that their payments were intended to discharge the liability of the estate, as well as to save themselves from personal responsibility. They were entitled to use their own funds for both purposes. See <em>Bentley’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/196/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="196 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="916842" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0497-01">196 Pa. 497</a>. In an equitable proceeding of this sort, the court is concerned with substance rather than form. We have no hesitancy in holding that insofar as they pai'd the estate tax over and above their respective interests in the estate, they did so as fiduciaries within the meaning of the Act of 1937.</p>

The Act expressly provides that the apportionment of the tax shall be “among the persons interested in the estate to whom such property is . . . transferred,” and defines “persons interested in the estate” as those “who may be entitled to receive or have received any property or interest which is required to be included in the gross estate of a decedent.” The phrase “or any benefit whatsoever,” is clearly disjunctive. Certainly Jennie King Mellon, by receipt of the 80,000 shares of stock, fell within the above definitions.</p>
    <p id="b553-4" data-blocks='[["BL_553.4",553,[205,962,1151,921]]]'>The Commonwealth’s assertion that her subsequent disposition of the shares was by prior agreement with the testator, and that she was merely a conduit whereby the stock was transferred by the testator to Eichard King Mellon and Sarah Mellon Scaife is unconvincing. There is no competent evidence whatever to substantiate this allegation. On the contrary, it appears that Jennie King Mellon retained during her lifetime the preferred shares of the two corporations to which the Aloxite stock was successively transferred, and that she derived therefrom a considerable income. The court below has found as a fact that she was a transferee of 80,000 shares, and that finding is well supported. What she did with the shares after the transfer was her own concern, and did not in any way affect her liability as transferee for the payment of her proportionate share of the estate taxes upon the value of this property.</p>

The letters of the Deputy Commissioner to these two transferees do refer to each as the transferee of 120,000 shares of such stock, despite the fact that Jennie King Mellon was at that time living <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>and enjoying income from the stock as owner of the preferred shares of the corporation by which they were then held. Nevertheless, in the accompanying statements of the gross taxable estate, the Deputy Commissioner expressly refers to “240,000 shares of the common stock of Aloxite Corp. <em>transferred in equal shares to decedent’s wife and two children on May 11, 1932.” </em>Whether the Deputy Commissioner intended by his apparently contradictory remarks to refer to Sarah Mellon Scaife and Richard King Mellon as the ultimate transferees of the stock, or whether this was merely an error, is not clear, nor is it material to our question. Under the Revenue Acts, the value of this stock, which had not come into the hands of the executors of the estate of Richard B. Mellon, was taxable individually to the three transferees who received it from Richard B. Mellon. Their liability was joint and several. See <em>Phillips-Jones Corp. v. Parmley, </em><a href="/us/302/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="302 U.S. 233" data-case-ids="6139241" data-case-paths="/us/302/0233-01">302 U. S. 233</a>. In its enforcement, the Commissioner had absolute discretion to proceed against all, or one, or several, of the transferees for the collection of the whole tax. <em>(Cf. </em>Treasury Regulation 70, Article 87.) With his election to proceed only against Richard K. Mellon and Sarah Mellon Scaife the courts of this State have no concern, and they could not, by any decree, compel the Commissioner to proceed otherwise. This, however, does not determine, for the purposes of proration under the Act of 1937, the respective shares of the tax to be borne by the transferees. The method of collection may have involved inequality of payment, but the purpose of the Act of 1937 was to achieve equality of contribution.</p>

The estate tax, unlike the normal State inheritance tax, is a tax upon the property of the decedent. Unless the decedent has other<a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>Avise provided by will, payment of the tax is to be primarily tbe burden of the executors, and the interest of the distributees is to be diminished pro tanto by the payment of the tax prior to distribution. This Avas pointed out in <em>Jeffery’s Est., </em>supra. It is entirely foreign to the purpose of the legislation to suppose that the equality Avhich it desired to create in distributing the tax burden could be thAvarted by an arbitrary act of the federal taxing officer in proceeding for collection against one or more of the several persons jointly and severally liable.</p>
    <p id="b555-4" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[206,915,1155,1417]]]'>The CommonAvealth also contends that the court beIoav, by including interest upon the deficiency assessment of the estate tax in the proration, exceeded its authority under the Act, or gave to the Act an unconstitutional application. The title of the Act refers to the apportionment of “estate taxes” only, and it is argued that interest upon a tax is not, in itself, a tax. Numerous cases are cited illustrating circumstances in Avhich this principle has been applied. The CommonAvealth, however, overlooks the fact that the Bevenue Act of 1926, Sec. 308 (h), 26 U. S. C.A., Sec. 308 (h) 1926, expressly provides that, “Interest upon the amount determined as a deficiency shall be assessed at the same time as the deficiency, shall be paid upon notice and demand from the collector, and shall be collected as a part of the tax.” Since the Act of 1937 deals with the federal estate tax, and so indicates by its title, and since that tax, by Act of Congress, includes “as a part of the tax” interest upon deficiency assessments, it is clear that the Act of 1937 contemplates proration of such interest and that notice to this effect is amply afforded by the title. It may be noted, in passing, that as the proration of this interest would not in any way affect the solvency of the Jennie King Mellon estate, the interest of the Commonwealth in this portion of the decree does not appear.</p>

These credits amounted to the sum of $13,324,258.70. It is urged that the Act of 1937 contemplates the apportionment only of the net payment of the federal estate tax made by fiduciaries, and therefore that there is no authority for the proration of <em>credits </em>against the gross tax, representing payments by the fiduciaries of normal state inheritance taxes. We believe that this construction of the Act is too narrow and is inconsistent with the legislative intention to effect equality of apportionment. The Act does not state, as the Commonwealth contends, that only the net sum actually paid in cash to the collector of the estate tax is to be apportioned. It provides that the “estate tax” paid by the fiduciary to the Federal Government and the additional Pennsylvania estate tax paid by the fiduciary shall be apportioned. The Federal Government assessed a total estate tax of $37,567,602.59 against the Richard B. Mellon estate. That tax Avas paid by the executors in part by cash and in part by credits. The credits constituted part of such payment within the meaning of the Act of 1937, and Ave so hold. The reasons or policy which motivated the Federal Government in permitting the estate tax to be so discharged in part, need not here concern us. <em>Cf. Knowles’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/295/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="295 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1115203" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0571-01">295 Pa. 571</a>.</p>

As stated in Bispham’s Principles of Equity (10th ed., 1922), Sec. 328: “The equity of Contribution arises when one of several parties who are liable to a common debt or obligation discharges the same for the benefit of all. . . .
