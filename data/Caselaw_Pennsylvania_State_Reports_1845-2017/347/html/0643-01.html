It is, as section 4 provides, <em>“. . . . </em>an instrumentality of the Commonwealth” created for the purpose of locating, constructing and maintaining a state highway between designated points on terms specified. On October 10, 1938, the Commission adopted a location over the land involved, title to which was “vested in the Commonwealth” but which was occupied and used by Somerset County Institution District for public purposes.</p>
