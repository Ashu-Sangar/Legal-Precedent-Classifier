Cochran was insured against liability<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> by Union Indemnity Company of New York. Before the judgment was paid, the Indemnity Company failed and went into liquidation during the course of which its receiver paid plaintiff, $1,410.78 on account, the last payment being made August 26, 1938. In 1941, the plaintiff issued against defendant a scire facias to revive and an attachment execution attaching defendant’s property in the hands of garnishees. Cochran, in his answers in both proceedings, set forth that after verdict and before judgment, the plaintiff executed and delivered a release “. . . of and from all and all manner of action and actions, cause or causes of action or actions, suits, damages, judgments, claims and demands whatsoever ... by reason of a certain accident which occurred . . . whereby [plaintiff] was injured, when a passenger in a car owned by A. B. Cochran . . .” By that release, Boocks terminated his right to collect from Cochran the verdict he then had against him or the judgment to be entered on the verdict. Cochran moved to open the judgment. The three proceedings were consolidated; the parties waived a jury and proceeded to trial pursuant to the Act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109, 12 PS section 688. Findings of fact were made; exceptions were heard by the court in banc which affirmed the findings. The court allowed the revival of the judgment on condition that it should not be a lien on any property then owned or subsequently acquired by Cochran and that no execution against him be issued. In the attachment execution, judgment for defendant was entered. The rule to open was discharged. The use-plaintiff appealed from the two orders affecting him. Cochran did not appeal from the order of revival nor from the discharge of his rule to open the judgment.</p>

      <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>The court found, inter alia, that after verdict and during the period prior to judgment in which defendant, under the rules of the court, might have filed motions for judgment and for a new trial, Boocks executed the release and that his attorney, with his authority, then delivered it to counsel for the defendant; that defendant’s counsel, relying on the release, refrained from moving for judgment and for a new .trial; that defendant, in the trial of the trespass action, presented his defense in good faith. Counsel for the Indemnity Company had entered their appearance for Cochran, but, when the trial began, declined to participate, apparently on the ground of non-cooperation; the defense was then conducted by Cochran’s counsel. The insurance policy is not in the record.</p>

No fraud was charged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellant’s point, then, comes to this: had the plaintiff power <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>to release the defendant? Appellant’s brief continues that his contract with the defendant should be held against public policy because it “. . . has a tendency to lead to fraud, whereby the rights of third persons may be prejudiced and the public interest is involved . . .; or, should the rule that such contracts are void as contrary to public policy be applied?” '</p>

The relationship of the parties in such transactions is quite different from that which existed between Cochran and Union Indemnity Company at the time the plaintiff settled with Cochran. The Indemnity Company insured, inter alia, against liability. As applied to this transaction, the insurer had agreed (a) that if Cochran damaged another, it would pay the damage and (b) that the person damaged had the right to proceed directly against it to recover on the judgment. Cochran, the insured, might have paid the judgment and required the company to reimburse him, or he could step aside, as he did, and allow the' injured person to proceed against the company on the right conferred on such injured person by the policy: see <em>Rose &amp; Son, Inc. v.
