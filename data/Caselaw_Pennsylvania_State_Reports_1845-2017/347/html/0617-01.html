Pleas No. 1 of Philadelphia County for the appointment of a Receiver to liquidate and wind up the partnership affairs of Lawrence J. Conn and Thomas A. Warner, trading as Colographie Printers. The bill did not aver insolvency. The defendant, Conn, had died and the defendant, Warner, was in the military service. On the same day the court appointed J. Carroll Deisher temporary receiver. This was made permanent on January 11, 1943.</p>

The lease was dated December 26,1939, and there was a balance of rental due at the time of the Receiver’s appointment. The Receiver conducted the business until the end of December, 1942, and all of the assets of the defendant partnership were sold with leave of court on February 4, 1943, at public auction. On February 5, 1943, a petition for confirmation of the Receiver’s sale was filed and the petition was at once granted and the sale confirmed. On the same day a petition for reclamation of the machinery here involved was filed by the Northern Machine Works and this was at once denied. An exception was taken to the last order on February 9, 1943. On March 13,1943, a petition by the Northern Machine Works was filed praying “for leave to begin action in assumpsit against the receiver to recover the sum of $3,065.00, being the proceeds from the sale of (the) petitioner’s chattels.” A rule was granted and answer was filed to the petition, and, upon the hearing, the per curiam order now appealed from was rendered, denying the prayer for <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>leave to sue the Eeceiver to recover the proceeds of the sale.</p>
    <p id="b641-3" data-blocks='[["BL_641.4",641,[210,417,1149,594]]]'>That the sale was with the consent of the Northern Machine Works is not disputed. It is averred that it was so agreed “upon the express condition that the appellants would have the unqualified right to elect either to claim the goods out of the sale or to follow the proceeds.” How they could claim the goods out of the sale after agreeing to the sale is not apparent. The sale of all the assets realized $3859.90, and the Northern Machine Works’ chattels, which they had valued at $2800.00 were bid in at $3065.00. That they can follow the proceeds is not disputed but how to proceed is the question at issue.</p>
    <p id="b641-4" data-blocks='[["BL_641.5",641,[209,1023,1149,474]]]'>The court below said that appellant’s petition was denied “for it is obvious that the orderly liquidation of an estate Avould be unduly delayed if creditors asserting claims of preference could compel the Eeceiver to answer claims in different Courts.” The court further said “that the rights of all the creditors are fully protected and may be properly adjudicated in the ordinary course of these proceedings.” The judgment of the court below must be sustained.</p>

The confusing and conflicting decisions on this subject occur on account of the different ideas entertained by courts as to the character of an order granting leave to sue . . . The decisions, however, all agree upon the general rule that, unless authorized by statute, a suit cannot be brought against a receiver without the permission of the Court which appointed him. This rule is based upon the theory that the court first obtaining jurisdiction and appointing a receiver retains that jurisdiction, as a rule, for all purposes, settling and adjusting, in the same suit, all conflicting interests of whatsoever nature between the parties that grow out of or relate to the subject matter in controversy . . .”</p>
