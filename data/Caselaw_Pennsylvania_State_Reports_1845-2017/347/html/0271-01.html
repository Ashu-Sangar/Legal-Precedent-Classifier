As ground for relief, he alleged that the ex<a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>ecution and delivery of the instrument were obtained by the fraud of the defendant; that he did not assign and transfer to her the assets of said business; that defendant had unlawfully taken possession, changed the locks on the establishment and had excluded plaintiff from the premises.

    <p id="b296-7" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[183,952,1152,1182]]]'>We agree with both of the courts who have considered the instrument, that it is too vague and uncertain to be susceptible of sensible construction by the application of accepted rules: <em>Seiss </em>v. <em>McClintic-Marshall Corp., </em><a href="/pa/324/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="324 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1171320" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0201-01">324 Pa. 201</a>, 204, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20109" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="188 A. 109">188 A. 109</a>. Though entitled “Partnership Agreement,” defendant repudiates all idea of partnership and claims sole ownership. While she had inserted in the paper a recital that the company “has previously been conveyed” to her by plaintiff, she testified that it had not been “previously conveyed,” and in an affidavit filed with the federal government, deposed that the business was transferred to her in October, 1940. If, as she-contends, the instrument gave her title, why should she be “empowered to make all necessary transfers” and to arrange “for prompt incorporation?” If the property was hers, why should she agree “to assume full management and responsibility” when she could do as she pleased with it? If she thought plaintiff intended to transfer the property to her, why did she consider it necessary to change the locks and otherwise prepare to exclude him when he should return from his vacation?</p>
    <p id="b296-8" data-blocks='[["BL_296.7",296,[183,2155,1153,264]],["BL_297.1",297,[207,297,1150,482]]]'>There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that a confidential relationship existed, a conclusion not challenged in appellant’s argument, and that plaintiff’s signature was obtained by fraud. Defendant knew when she went to New York and induced him to sign the paper, <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>that no proceedings had been begun or threatened for income tax delinquency. She testified, “Q. Is it a fact that prior to October 4, 1940, no representative of the government of the United States had any conversation with you with respect to Mr. Brehm’s liability for payment of income tax? A. No, I never discussed it with anyone.” The evidence which establishes the fraud necessarily negatives any possible contention that plaintiff intended to make a gift.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[206,792,1151,263]]]'>Appellant contends that the testimony was not clear, precise and indubitable; the evidence of defendant’s fraud in obtaining plaintiff’s signature is convincing beyond reasonable doubt. Cf. <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Taub, </em><a href="/pa/316/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="316 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="1158972" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0041-01">316 Pa. 41</a>, 43, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20270" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="173 A. 270">173 A. 270</a>, and cases there cited.</p>
    <p id="b297-6" data-blocks='[["BL_297.5",297,[203,1067,1154,1300]]]'>The appellant also contends that plaintiff’s delay bars relief. Though the bill was not filed until January 27, 1942, the court below found that the delay had been adequately explained. As soon as plaintiff returned from his vacation he attempted to take charge of his business, but was excluded by the defendant and her agents. Efforts to adjust their difficulties followed and were carried on for a considerable time. Finally, November 15, 1941, plaintiff’s counsel wrote to defendant’s counsel calling attention to the failure to reach a settlement and saying “. . . that unless a meeting [of clients and counsel] can be arranged without delay I will be compelled to institute a suit.” In reply, counsel for defendant on November 18th suggested a meeting of counsel only. The learned chancellor concluded that plaintiff had acted with reasonable diligence. In <em>Ringer </em>v. <em>Finfrock, </em>340 Pa. Pa. 458, 464, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20348" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="17 A.2d 348">17 A. 2d 348</a>, it was said, “The question of laches is disposed of by the conclusion of the court below that appellant has not been prejudiced by the delay in instituting these proceedings, and that the bill was filed with reasonable promptness . . .” See also <em>First National Bank of Pittston </em>v. <em>Lytle Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/332/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="332 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1186597" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0394-01">332 Pa. 394</a>, 396, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20350" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 A.2d 350">3 A. 2d 350</a>; Restatement, Restitution, section 148, comment (a).</p>
