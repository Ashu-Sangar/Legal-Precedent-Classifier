Of these latter two, Judge Laird took office on the first Monday of January, 1938, and Judge McWherter on January 5, 1942. Judge Keenan took office on February 14, 1936.</p>

All of these cases except six were submitted in 1942, the oldest having been submitted March 16,1942, and the youngest having been submitted March 9 and March 16, 1943, respectively. The petition averred that these cases had remained undecided at the time of the application for the writ of mandamus, thus hindering, delaying and prejudicing the rights of the litigants in those cases. The petition then referred to Rule 93 of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which provides, inter alia, that [Section 4] “If any matter so submitted [to the proper court of common pleas] remains pending and undisposed of at the end of ninety (90) days after its submission, the judge having the matter in hand, or the senior judge of the court en banc to which the matter was submitted, shall forthwith report, in writing, the cause of the delay to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.” [Section 5] “This rule shall apply to all equity, common law and statutory proceedings requiring decision, whether interlocutory or final.”</p>

He then sets forth certain cases which were listed in the Attorney General’s petition as having been argued before the Court in Banc and “voluntarily taken and accepted by his Honor, Judge Keenan, for determination and disposition.” These cases are those numbered in the Attorney General’s petition as 4, 5, 6, 8,11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 25, 26, 27 and 28, making a total of thirteen cases. He admits that the cases we identify as Nos. 30 and 31 in the petition were assigned to him for decision, but that Judge McWherter being disqualified, he, Judge Laird, wrote the opinion in No. 31 and left the decree and opinion in Judge Keenan’s chambers on October 26, 1942, <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>for disposition by Judge Keenan, and to the best of his knowledge the opinion and decree are still in the hands of Judge Keenan.

He further avers that because of the press of other business, opinions and decrees were not prepared or filed in the cases or causes mentioned in this paragraph before the issuing of the writ, and that opinions and decrees concurred in by Judge McWherter were filed June 12, 1943, in the eases we have numbered 33, 34 and 35, respectively, in the Attorney General’s petition. He alleges that it is not physically possible for him to do any more work than he has been doing since January 1,1938, and that he has at all times endeavored <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>to dispose of Ms own work with, dispatch and assist in the disposition of Judge Keenan’s unfinished business. He also avers that in January, February and March, 1942, he sat with Judge Gordon of Philadelphia County, specially assigned by the Supreme Court to Westmoreland County, and with Judge Gordon and Judge McWherter endeavored to dispose of a number of cases which remained undisposed of on Judge Keenan’s desk, and he lists other judicial work which he and Judge McWherter and Judge Fetterhoof, specially presiding, disposed of in Westmoreland County. He also states that the argument list of Westmoreland County in December 1942 contained 37 cases and that Judge Keenan was not present at the argument and did not participate in hearing the same. The list was disposed of by Judges Laird and McWherter hearing and deciding 21 cases and continuing 16 cases until such time as Judge Keenan could be present, namely, January 27, 1943, at which time the 16 cases were disposed of as follows: 9 were continued, 1 settled, 3 assigned to Judge Keenan and 3 to Judge Laird, two of which latter were Kennedy v. Zanarini (No. 36) and Fulcomer v. Penna. Railroad Company (No. 35) of the Attorney General’s petition.</p>

He avers that there is too much legal work in Westmoreland County for <em>two </em>Common Pleas Judges to handle. He says that because of the failure of Judge Keenan to act, decide and dispose of cases and causes presented to him when sitting alone, members of the Bar, Attorneys and Counsel refuse to present matters to Judge Keenan for hearing, holding the same for presentation to Judge McWherter and Judge Laird and thus unduly increasing their work. <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>He concludes by saying that there is nothing on his desk undisposed of except cases argued June 15 and 16,1943, and he prays that he may be dismissed from these charges.</p>

He also sets forth that on or about the 15th day of May, 1943, he received a letter from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, as did Judge Laird and Judge Keenan, directing the immediate disposition of the case of Foley, et al. v. Smay, et al., which had been listed in the courts since 1937. On the receipt of such communication, after consultation with Judges Laird and Keenan, he prepared a “per curiam” opinion which was filed May 25, 1943, adopting substantially the earlier opinion which Judge Keenan had prepared in the case. He says that “Along with Judge Laird I have cooperated in every way possible to relieve the situation which has resulted from the congestion of cases on the desk of President Judge Keenan. For the past year we have handed down many majority opinions without submitting them to the President Judge, in order to avoid the possibility of delay while awaiting the concurrence of the President Judge.” He then submits a schedule of the number of cases disposed of by the several judges of the type indicated requiring opinions and decrees filed between January 5, 1942, and the date of his answer, which is June 25th.

Blackstone in his Commentaries Book 3 Sec. 109, says: “. . . Refusal or neglect of justice, is remedied either by writ of procedendo, or of <em>mandamus. </em>A writ of <em>procedendo ad judicium </em>issues out of the court of chancery, where judges of any subordinate court do delay the parties; for that they will not give judgment either on the one side or the other, when they ought so to do.

A little more than a year and a half ago we assigned Judge Gordon, of Philadelphia County, to Westmoreland County to decide a large number of cases which for an undue period had been undisposed of by Judge Keenan. Judge Gordon executed this assignment in a most satisfactory manner. Other complaints concerning Judge Keenan and his neglect of duty began to be received by this court in May of this year. Under date of May 12, 1943, the Chief Justice of this court wrote Judge Keenan calling his attention to his failure to report under Buie 93 his delay in disposing of twenty-five cases submitted to him for decision more than four months previously, some of them more than a year previously, and pointing out that his neglect of duty “amounted to a denial of justice” and that if he did not proceed to dispose of these cases within ten days “the Supreme Court will take such action as the situation calls for”. This letter was not answered. Under date of May 15, 1943, the Chief Justice of this court wrote Judge Keenan, as follows: “I just have received a letter from Mrs. Lena Smay, of Blairsville, Pennsylvania, a woman seventy-eight years of age, stating that al<a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>though exceptions were filed more than a year ago to the opinion filed in her case by Judge James Gay Gordon, Jr., specially assigned to Westmoreland County at that time, you have not yet handed down an opinion on behalf of the court en banc in that case. Such neglect of judicial duties is a serious breach of trust and unworthy of any judge anywhere. We direct your court to hand down this opinion within the next ten days. Let me know whether or not you propose to do so.” To this letter also Judge Keenan made no reply. (Judges Laird and McWherter disposed of Mrs. Smay’s case on May 25th, though it had been assigned more than a year earlier to Judge Keenan.)</p>
