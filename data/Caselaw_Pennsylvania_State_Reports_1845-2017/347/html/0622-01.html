D. Graham and Company, Inc., is seeking to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by reason of the location and construction of the Pennsylvania turnpike over a strip of ground plaintiff claimed to have owned. The case was tried twice. At the first trial the jurors returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $200 as. damages on the Carrie Weller tract (a tract not involved in the second trial) and also found “the plaintiff does not have title to Folk, Griedline or Glessner tracts.” (The last tract was also not involved in the second trial.) At the last trial the jury awarded the plaintiff $50,000 as damages. The defendant moved for a new trial assigning several reasons, which were all dismissed except the one relating “to the admission of incompetent testimony under the measure <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>of damages”.

Both parties claim title to the land from a common source, to wit, The South Pennsylvania Railroad Company. (Hereinafter referred to as the South Penn Company.) The plaintiff proved title in fee in this Railroad Company by offering the various deeds from the original land owners. Plaintiff then traced its chain of title through tax sales and by adverse possession. To prove its tax title, plaintiff, for the purpose of showing that this right-of-way was in fact <em>unseated </em>land, showed that the South Penn Company discontinued the construction of its railroad on it, that after working on the excavation and grading of this strip for about two and one-half years, it left partially completed cuts, fills, stone culverts and tunnels; “laid no track;” and “no car was ever run on it.” Plaintiff also showed that the South Penn Company left no personal property, or building or other improvements on this land.</p>

P. Railway Co.). This Com<a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>pany bought all the assets of tlie South Penn Company in a judicial sale in proceedings in the State Court, subject, however, to the mortgage from the South Penn Co., to the Union Trust Company. For the years 1891 to 1894, inclusive, the ledger sheets at Harrisburg show the payment or non-payment of the taxes by the South Penn Company and of the S. P. Railway Company, some containing markings on the South Penn Company sheets that “This Company is defunct” — “No Value, This Company is defunct”, and a notation “abandoned — defunct” —marked “by order of John A. Glenn, November 19, 1896”, on the S. P. Railway Company’s reports. The notation beneath the last: “July 29,1904, this company was sold at judicial sale May 14, 1904, to form the Fulton, Bedford &amp; Somerset R. R. Company. See papers on file.” There were offered in evidence letters from Lyman D. Gilbert, President of the S. P. Railway Company to the Auditor General and Attorney General offering compromises of its claim of the Commonwealth against it, all the tax records including capital stock reports and ledger sheets that were in the department for the Fulton, Bedford &amp; Somerset Railroad Company (hereinafter referred to as the Fulton Company) for the years 1904 to 1939, inclusive. The legal purpose of this offer was “to show that the . . . South Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the South Pennsylvania Railway Company . . . was out of operation and defunct from 1890 on,” and therefore that this unseated land was legally subject to local assessment for taxes.</p>

The assessment records for Somerset Township for 1892 and 1893, and for Lincoln Township for 1892, 1893, 1894 and 1895 showed the assessment of the several parcels of land comprising the right-of-way against the South Penn Company and against the original owners, and “the acres are identical.” The County Treasurer’s return taxes for 1892 and 1893 were offered but objected to until proof was made of the cex’tificate <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>from the County Commissioners to the County Treasurer’s record of return of taxes, entitled “Unseated Land Record, Volume 3,” made to the treasurer of Somerset County, as provided by the Act of Assembly of April 30, 1879, showing the sale of these parcels of land to the County Commissioner» on June 11, 1894. This was again objected to until the certificate from the Commissioners to the Treasurer required by law was first produced. Evidence was then offered that the certificate could not be found, and the objection was overruled. This record was followed by County Commissioners’ “Unseated Land Book Vol. 1,” which is a record of purchases from the County Treasurer, and “a notation showing the disposition”; and the County Commissioners’ Sales Records showing the sales of the parcels of land here involved to the purchasers under whom the plaintiff claims title by subsequent conveyance. The minute book of the County Commissioners showing the fixing of the county tax rate for 1891 and 1892 was offered and was followed by the records showing the acknowledgment of the deeds by the County Treasurer in open court on September 26, 1894, as filed in the office of the Prothonotary. The advertisements of both Treasurer’s and the County Commissioners’ sales were offered and admitted over the objection of the defendant. All this record evidence was admitted over the repeated objections of counsel for the Commission. Then followed the evidence that the purchasers from the County Commissioners by deed conveyed the land constituting the rights-of-way to the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad Company (hereinafter referred to as the Somerset Company) in 1905, when this company was granted a charter by the Commonwealth to construct and operate a railroad from Somerset to Ligonier in Westmoreland County. The Somerset Company proceeded to construct and operate its railroad from July 25, 1905, as shown by the advertisement of the Somerset Herald announcing train service, two trains daily each way from Somerset to Ligonier, and Latrobe and Pittsburgh. This serv<a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>ice continued until 1915 when the operation was discontinued. In the meantime on July 7, 1905, the Somerset Company gave a mortgage to the New York Trust Company securing a bond issue of $700,000 covering its railroad and such property as was owned by it. The New York Trust Company assigned the mortgage to the Northern Central Trust Company in June 1919. By equity proceedings in Somerset County the- Trust Company foreclosed the mortgage, and in 1920 the property and franchises were sold to a Bondholders’ First Mortgage Protection Committee, which in turn in 1925 by deed conveyed the property to A. D. Graham &amp; Company, the plaintiff.</p>

    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[224,1516,1149,593]]]'>The Friedline or Miller tract was never sold for taxes, but the plaintiff attempted to prove title to this tract by a deed dated November 11, 1905, to the Somerset Company from the daughter and son-in-law of Moses Friedline for the right of way that was conveyed by Moses Friedline to the South Penn Company on March 3, 1885. The plaintiff’s sole claim of title to this tract is set forth in his statement as follows: “Title in A. D. Graham Company by adverse, continuous and open possession by it and its predecessors in title hereinafter mentioned, since 1905.”</p>
    <p id="b649-6" data-blocks='[["BL_649.6",649,[223,2120,1148,318]],["BL_650.1",650,[188,300,1154,1849]]]'>Then followed the evidence to prove the amount of the plaintiff’s damages for the land condemned and appropriated by the Commission, and the witnesses placed their estimate upon it from the standpoint of adaptability of the strip of ground as a right-of-way for an industrial railroad, railway, a highway, or other public util<a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>ity right-of-way such as a pole or high tension wire line, gas line, aqueduct or water pipe line. Their competency was challenged and the method of arriving at the market value was also objected to because “they were not familiar with the property, never having seen the property before the appropriation, and were not acquainted with land values in the vicinity . . .” and “their estimates of opinion as to its market value immediately before the appropriation are based almost wholly, if not entirely, upon replacement or reconstruction cost as the basis or method of arriving at market value.” These witnesses testified, first, to the fair market value of the entire property from station 305 + 20.17 to station 505 + 30, consisting of 2.14 miles of roadbed. This was the continuous property from the Weller property at Husband westward to the Glessner property. Secondly, to the fair market value of what was designated as Section No. 1, beginning at station 505 + 30, just west of the Carrie Weller property to station 379 -j- 68.09, the eastern line of the Moses Friedline property, 1.34 miles, which includes the William F. Weller, the Mary Etta Kelley, the Harrison Gohn, Charles Baker and William H. Stahl or William G. Stahl properties. Third, they testified to the fair market value of what was designated as Section No. 2 which was the Moses Friedline strip, extending from station 341 -j- 77.71 to station 379 + 68.69, a distance of 3/10 of a mile, and lastly, to Section 3 extending from the west line of the Friedline property at station 341 + 77.71 to the eastern line of the Glessner property at station 315 + 20.71 a distance of 5/10 of a mile. The stations and distances were all taken from the “taking plans” that were prepared by the Commission. The foregoing testimony the Court later properly adjudged to be incompetent.</p>

This was followed by offering in evidence, without objection, the mortgage from the South Penn Company to the Union Trust Company of New York, as trustee, covering this railroad’s entire lands and property, its corporate rights, privileges and franchise dated January 1, 1885. Then followed the evidence setting forth in detail the proceedings to foreclose the mortgage in 1903 by the Union Trust Company against the South Penn Company and the S. P. Railway Company in the then called Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania terminating in the confirmation in June 1904 of the judicial sale of the property covered by the mortgage to Herbert R. Preston and William W. Wood. Soon after, on July 18, 1904, Preston and Wood, by deed, conveyed all the physical property and the corporate rights and franchises of the South Penn Company to the Fulton Company. The Fulton Company’s deed of October 21st, 1938, of all of the rights of way of the South Penn Company to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission was offered and admitted in evidence without objection. There was also offered in evidence the agreement between the Fulton Company and the Somerset Company, dated October 24,1906, wherein it was set forth that each of the companies claimed that it was entitled to the sole use of the right-of-way, but, nevertheless, agreed therein on its use without admitting the claim or rights of the other. Defendant also showed that Moses Friedline, one of the original land owners, died testate, leaving only one child, a daughter who was married to Edward H. Miller, and that by Friedline’s last will he devised only a life estate to his daughter and that she died in 1936, about three years before the appropriation. Defendant also called a number of witnesses to testify to the fair market value of the strip of ground in controversy immediately before the appropriation. Because of the admission of incompetent testimony as to land values, the court below set aside the verdict of $50,000.</p>

      <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>In the interest of bringing this litigation to an end in the next trial we will discuss now <em>all </em>the legal questions involved. The court below in its opinion defined the position of the parties as to the measure of damages, saying: “It is conceded that the correct measure of damages, applied in the trial of the case, is the difference between the fair market value of the land appropriated immediately before the appropriation and unaffected thereby, and its fair market value immediately after the appropriation and as affected thereby. All of the witnesses called, both by the plaintiff and the defendant, were in accord in testifying that the land had no value whatever after the appropriation and as affected thereby. This narrowed the question to the fair market value of the land immediately before the appropriation and unaffected thereby.”</p>

Three of them were consulting engineers and two were real estate experts, and all resided in Pittsburgh. Each of these witnesses testified, under objection, as to the value of the land before and after the appropriation. Two of the consulting engineers testified that they never saw the land prior to the appropriation and not until the turnpike was completed. The third engineer saw parts of it from some of the travelled roads, and from a creek which he fished near the railroad track. He never travelled by train over any portion of it. None of the engineers were acquainted with land values in that vicinity. The only acquaintanceship of these engineers (except “the third engineer” mentioned above) with this strip of land was from the defendant’s maps of survey showing profiles, cross-sections and construction work of the unfinished South Penn Company prior to the appropriation by the Commission, which it furnished to the witnesses. From these maps they testified they were able to calculate the amount of excavations of the earth and fills that went into the South Penn roadbed before the turnpike appropriated it, the number of cubic feet of earth taken from the cuts to fills, including borrowed <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>earth; the number of cubic feet of stone in five stone masonry culverts within the entire strip of land'involved, and the lineal feet of tunnel excavation in connection with a tunnel 288 feet in length on the Friedline property. We agree with the court below that “. . . a careful reading of their testimony clearly shows that their estimates of opinion as to its market value immediately before the appropriation are based almost wholly, if not entirely, upon replacement or reconstruction cost as the basis or method of arriving at market value”. It is obvious that they determined market value by using reproduction costs at 1939 unit costs less depreciation, one of the witnesses expressly stating that “without that (reproduction cost) I wouldn’t know how to arrive at the market value of anything.”</p>

This was assigned as error and we said: “No other evidence is as unsatisfactory as that necessarily received in this class of cases. Courts and juries are given by the witnesses matters of opinion only, the accuracy of which is far more difficult to test than are disputed questions of fact. An endeavor to minimize this uncertainty may excuse the error which appears in the ruling now complained of, and in the single case supposed to sustain it, but it is error notwithstanding. Even those who are but slightly conversant with the subject know that where the building being valued is in a neighborhood which has run down, or where it was erected by an owner for his home, or where it is so located on a large lot as to hinder the proper development of the property after the character of the neighborhood has changed, the replacement value of such house will always be greater than the value of the building as part of the property in its entirety; indeed it may be, and sometimes is, in excess of the market value of the prop<a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>erty, including the building ... It is clear, therefore, that evidence of the replacement value of plaintiff’s buildings should not have been received, unless the circumstances were so peculiar as to render it absolutely essential, in the interest of justice to require its admission. We know of no circumstance which could justify it; certainly none appears on this record.” See also <em>Chatfield v.

That may become a question for the Supreme Court to ultimately decide; but for the purpose of disposing of the motion for a new trial, we are bound to follow the law as declared in the above case.” We find here no circumstance requiring that evidence’s admission. Plaintiff attempted to show that this abandoned right-of-way had a use for particular purposes, but that there was any market for this property for this purpose does not appear. In <em>Hall v.

Unquestionably in a proceeding such as this it is entirely proper to take into consideration an element of damage anything peculiar to the owner’s property that distinguishes it from the other lands in the same neighborhood giving it increased value in the public market before its appropriation. Otherwise the landowner would not be receiving the full compensation for his deprivation which the law intends. If he could convert his land in the general <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>market at the time of its appropriation by the railroad and receive an enhanced price over and above what his neighbors conld receive for theirs lacking the peculiar advantages possessed by his, there is no reason why he should not be correspondingly compensated by the railroad company. And this is equally true where the peculiarity which gives enhanced value to his extends to lands lying in a particular locality, whether owned by one or several. But it is always to be borne in mind that the law does not presume the existence of such peculiarity and the loss on account of its appropriation by the railroad; it always rests upon a party claiming the extraordinary damage first of all to show it, and to show that it was available to him for the purpose of conversion in the public market at the time he was deprived of his land by the railroad company. The mere assertion of any such fact without proof comes to nothing . . .” Evidence of the value of land for a particular purpose is of no avail when there is shown no market for land for <em>such a purpose. </em>For example, a certain kind of timber might be useful in the making of bows and arrows but if there was no market for these implements, the timber’s value for such use could not be shown. The court below correctly held that the admission of this testimony made a new trial imperative.</p>

The Commission commenced the construction of the roadbed for the turnpike, and on November 21,1939, the plaintiff asked for the appointment of viewers to assess damages for the tract. On December 13,1939, the Commission filed its petition asking the court to stay the viewers’ proceedings averring that there was a substantial dispute as to title to nine tracts of land, which is the property here involved, and also asked the court to withdraw this property from consideration of the viewers until such time as the question of title has been determined in some appropriate proceedings for determining title to lands.

However, if, as it undisputably appears from the evidence in this case, that the South Pennsylvania Railroad Company was never constructed or operated and that all activities for the accomplishment of this object ceased about the year 1885, and was never resumed thereafter; and that since said time this right-of-way has been lying dormant and inactive until acquired by the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railway Company about 1905, and that the same were not necessary or indispensable to the exercise of its franchise, then we instruct you as a matter of law that rule as stated has no application, and that such rights-of-way were subject to assessments for local taxation purposes, and in default of the payment of the taxes so assessed, were subject to sale for non-payment of taxes . . To sustain this part of the charge the court below said: <em>. </em>. Certainly it cannot be successfully contended that the property which was the subject of the assessment for local taxes, after the South Pennsylvania Railroad Company had definitely and finally <em>abandoned the construction </em>of its railroad, was necessary and indispensable to the performance of its corporate franchises. It never came into existence as an operating railroad; and neither said company, or its successors in title, can claim that its real estate was exempt from local taxation . . (Italics supplied). It is apparent, therefore, that the court below did not hold that at the time these assessments were made that this roadbed was abandoned. Nor was it disputed that it belonged to the South Penn Company by “lawful and unrestricted purchases” and that this Company had “perfect title”, i. e., the possession, the right of possession and the right of property therein, in 1892 and 1893, for it was the common source of the parties’ title.

In 1878 the original railroad changed the location of its track about 100 feet southeast of the former one, and used it for its main line.

This tract was never assessed for local taxation and was therefore not in the tax sale of 1894. The plaintiff contended that its title to this tract was “by adverse, continuous and open possession by it and its predecessors in title . . . , since 1905.” However, it offered in evidence a deed dated November 11, 1905, to the Somerset Company, its predecessor in title, from Edward H. Miller and wife, the son-in-law and daughter of Moses Friedline for the right-of-way that was conveyed in fee simple by Moses Friedline to the South Penn Company in 1885. The appellant points out that the deed from Miller to the Somerset Company in 1905, only ten years later, recited that “title to said strip of land subsequently to said conveyance by Moses Friedline to South Pennsylvania Railroad Company has become vested in Edward H. Miller . . .” There is no evidence whatever that this property became “vested in Edward H. Miller”. Certainly it did not become vested in him in 1905 by adverse possession even if he claimed by such possession immediately subsequent to the conveyance by his father-in-law to the South Penn Company. Only ten years had elapsed, between the two conveyances. No attempt was made to show a deed from the South Penn Company to Miller. <em>Mow </em>he “became vested” with this title nowhere appears.
