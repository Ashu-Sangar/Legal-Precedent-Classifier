The cases are identical and will be treated as one. The learned court below, being of the opinion that no cause of action had been stated, sustained defendant’s affidavits of defense raising questions of law and entered judgments of non pros., and plaintiffs appealed.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[210,678,1153,1733]]]'>The statements of claim allege that the stockholders of the association agreed, on November 23, 1937, to a plan of voluntary liquidation and unanimously elected Beacom, Cope, and Kurtz, the association’s former president, vice-president, and secretary, respectively, liquidating trustees. Pursuant to the requirements of section 1108 of the Building and Loan Code (Act of May 5,1933, P. L. 457, as amended), each of the trustees furnished to the association a bond, with defendant as surety, in the amount of $5,000, the coverage including “such pecuniary loss as the employer shall have sustained through failure of the employee covered hereunder to faithfully perform his duties.” Kurtz, the former secretary, continued, as liquidating trustee, to collect the moneys due from rents and from the payment of interest and principal on notes and mortgages, but between the time of his entering upon his duties as trustee on April 20, 1938 and January 15, 1940, did not deposit in the trustees’ bank account $18,106.14 of the sums collected by him, having fraudulently appropriated that amount to his own use. The statements of claim further allege that Beacom and Cope, Kurtz’ co-trustees, had failed, over this period of time, to call in and collect the payments due the association, but had permitted Kurtz to do so individually, thereby making it possible for him to embezzle part of the proceeds, and that they had neglected to make a comparison between the records kept by Kurtz of his collections, and the deposit statements of their trustees’ bank account, which would have disclosed the shortage, all of which, it is alleged, amounted to a failure on their part in the faithful performance of their duties.</p>

    <p id="b173-3" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[228,403,1152,1964]]]'>We cannot see how it can be said that Beacom and Cope failed to exercise reasonable care in the administration of the trust or how anything they did or failed to do was not such conduct as could be expected of a prudent man under the circumstances. As trustees their duties were practically the same as those performed by them as officers of the association, and during that time there was no complaint from the stockholders because of anything done by them. In fact, their conduct as officers was approved by the stockholders in electing them trustees, which they did without a dissenting vote. As trustees they continued as before, with Kurtz collecting the moneys due from rents and from the payment of interest and principal on notes and mortgages. Beacom and Cope had no reason to question Kurtz’ honesty. Although the three trustees were equally responsible for the administration of the trust, it was not necessary that each should be a supervisor of the work of the others. Without anything to arouse even a suspicion of dishonesty it was not required that each should act as a detective to watch the performance of the others’ duties. This is particularly true as to the activities of Kurtz, for they also had a right to rely on the periodic examinations of the State Banking Department to disclose any dishonest practices. In <em>Adams’s Estate, </em>supra, at p. 84, it was said: “There was a duty resting on each trustee to exercise prudence and care to insure the safety of the trust funds. In the absence of inculpatory circumstances, he was not required to regard his colleague other than honest, nor to believe that he would not honestly and properly administer the trust.” Under the circumstances of the instant ease, Beacom and Cope committed no breach of trust in permitting Kurtz to continue collecting the money and in trusting to his honesty in making the deposits. There being no dereliction of duty on their part, their surety is not liable.</p>
