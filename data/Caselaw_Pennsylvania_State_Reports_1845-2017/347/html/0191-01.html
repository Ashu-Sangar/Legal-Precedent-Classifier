In February, 1942, the Board increased the assessments, inter alia, by the sum of §618,000, to cover the value of certain additional machinery which had been installed on the premises as an integral part of the mill. This machinery was placed in the mill of the Mesta Company, which was the record owner of the land upon which its mill was located, not on a temporary basis, but instead to enable that company to carry out the very purpose for which it was organized, i. e. the manufacture of heavy equipment for profit. This revised assessment was sustained by the Board; and the Mesta Company, contending that it was not liable for the tax based on the additional assessment for the reason that the company did not own that machinery but merely leased it from the United States <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>government which held title thereto, appealed to the Court of Common Pleas. That tribunal permitted the Federal government to intervene in the proceeding, over the objection of the County. After hearing, the court below entered an order sustaining the appeal, setting aside the assessment as to that machinery and reducing the assessment of the mill of the Mesta Company by the sum of $618,000. From that order, the County of Allegheny has appealed to this Court.</p>

The Mesta Company and the intervenor, the Federal government, to meet the burden thus cast on the company, offered in evidence a contract entered into between them on October 30,1940, whereby the company, on a cost-plus and fixed fee basis, undertook to manufacture heavy field guns for the government. This agreement specifically set forth, among other things, that the machinery, the assessment of which gave rise to this appeal, was the property of the Federal government which leased it to the Mesta Company for an indeterminate period, at the nominal rental of one dollar; that the machinery was to be installed on the land and in a building owned by the Mesta Company for the latter’s use in manufacturing for profit the war <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>material contracted for; and that upon the termination of the contract the Mesta Company was to remove the machinery and ship the same, at the expense of the government, to a point to be designated by a representative of the War Department. This agreement was admitted in evidence over the objection of the.County, which argues that the court below thereby committed error.</p>

L. 853, as amended. In <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Delaware County, </em><a href="/pa/70/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="70 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="1028207" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0381-01">70 Pa. 381</a>, it was held that the land and building, as well as the machinery, which constituted a cotton factory, were taxable as real estate, under the 32d section of the Act of April 29,1844, P. L. 486 (the provisions of which are practically identical with those of section 201 of the Act of 1933, as amended). There the court below said, and its views were affirmed by this Court in a per curiam opinion (p. 383) : “That the property taxed in the case before us is <em>real estate </em>is not, of course, doubted. But the plaintiff thinks <em>this particular hind </em>of real estate was <em>not intended </em>to be taxed. He argues that the enumeration of certain kinds in the act, as ‘houses, lands, lots of ground, ground-rents, mills,’ &amp;c., was to designate precisely what the legislature intended by the preceding terms ‘all real estate’, and that everything not embraced in this enumeration is excluded. But this view seems to overlook the very important language, before referred to, which follows the enumeration: ‘all <em>other </em>real estate.’ . . . Does not the property here taxed fall within the enumeration? The machinery in a mill is as much a part of it as are the <em>walls . . </em>. The plaintiff admits this; but says the legislature did not use the term ‘mill’ in this sense; that while such is the legal signification of the term, the popular meaning is <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>otherwise; and that the legislature must be regarded as adopting the latter. But <em>is </em>the popular meaning otherwise? When a man, of common intelligence and business experience, speaks of 'Mr. Patterson’s Mill,’ what does he mean? The establishment in its completed condition — fitted for its proper use? Or the bare walls? (For there is no intermediate point; all between, from the engines to the spindles, is machinery.) He could hardly mean the latter; for the walls do not constitute a <em>mill, </em>and bear no more resemblance to it, than to a barn.”</p>
    <p id="AYs" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[218,861,1167,1569]]]'>Furthermore, this private arrangement between the Mesta Company, the owner of the land and buildings and operator of the mill, and the Federal government, the owner of the machinery, which treats the equipment as personal property and permits the latter to remove it at the termination of the contract, can in no way change the legal effect of the Act of Assembly which specifically designates machinery, under these circumstances, as real estate for tax purposes. In this connection, it was said in <em>Bemis </em>v. <em>Shipe, </em><a href="/pa-super/26/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="26 Pa. Super. 42" data-case-ids="853866" data-case-paths="/pa-super/26/0042-01">26 Pa.

Without the express permission of the owners of the land to remove the buildings prior to a certain date, if nothing whatever had been said in regard to them in the original lease, they would doubtless belong to the owners of the land at the expiration of the lease, as being part of the real estate, but such permission does not change the physical character of the property, nor does it in any way change its legal status, except as between the parties themselves and those claiming under them and as to the legal machinery through which the title of the lessees may be transferred to creditors or others who desire to secure their rights.” See also <em>Pennsylvania Stave Company’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/236/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="236 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="986618" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0097-01">236 Pa. 97</a>; <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Pittsburg Dry Goods Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/47/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="47 Pa.

      <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>Nov can the Mesta Company, by its private arrangement acknowledging that the Federal government has title to the machinery which is an integral part of the mill of the company, evade the right of the County to assess the company as the owner of the mill erected upon land title to which is in its name upon the public records. The mill of the company was taxable under the statute as real estate, and this necessarily included the machinery essential to the existence and operation of that manufactory. In <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Pittsburg Dry Goods Co., </em>supra, the Superior Court held that the owner of the land and building cannot deny his liability for a portion of the tax because the machinery which composed a permanent and essential part of the manufactory was owned by a tenant who had the right to remove it at the end of his lease. There it was said (p. 401) : “Does the private arrangement between the tenant and the landlord which permitted the former to remove the machinery at the end of the term change the character of the property as affected by the taxing statutes? We think not ... If the machinery is not to be included there is no manufactory to be taxed and the land and building would be liable not as a factory but as ‘other real estate’ as provided in the same section of the statute. The property is either a manufactory or it is not. If a manufactory it is clearly subject to taxation under the specification of that class of property.”</p>

Under the circumstances, he was justified in treating the ground, building and machinery as an entity, a mill or manufactory, and assessing it as such to the Mesta Company, the registered owner of the land.

To exempt this machinery from taxation would not be in relief of the government, but rather in relief of the Mesta Company, and, therefore, it is clear that the machinery is the proper subject of assessment for tax purposes as the property of the Mesta Company even though legal title to it is actually in the Federal government.

The majority opinion cites' authorities which it asserts support the proposition that where the tax is not assessed against the government but against an independent contractor the immunity does not exist. This, it seems to me, is a misconception of the import of those decisions. What they hold is that a state has the right to impose a tax on an independent contractor on property owned, <em>not by the United States, but by the contractor; </em>in other words, the right of a state to tax the property of a citizen is not impaired merely because of the existence of a contract between that citizen and the United States as the result of which the tax indirectly imposes an economic burden on the government.

The court said in language which is here peculiarly apposite (p. 128) : “Undoubtedly where the buildings erected on the land <em>are themselves the subject of taxation, </em>the state will take no notice of private contracts which sever the ownership of the land from that of the buildings; and will hold the owner of the land responsible for the taxes on both. But suppose the buildings <em>are exempt from taxation, </em>— how then? Suppose a church or parsonage, or other building used for charitable purposes, is erected on land with the permission of the owner, he retaining the title to the soil on which it stands; can the owner of the land be taxed for the value of such buildings? Certainly not. If authority is wanting for so self-evident a proposition, I refer to the cases cited by the learned counsel for the defendants in error. . . . But it is said that churches and like buildings are exempt from taxation by <em>express statute. </em>So they are. And the buildings erected by the United States, owned by that government, and used for the lawful purpose of carrying into execution its granted powers, are also exempt from taxation — not by express statute it is true, but by laws as potent and obligatory as if they were written on the statute books of every state in the Union.”</p>

Indeed, it seems to me inconceivable that a state or other local authority should have the power to impede the national effort to win the war by imposing taxes upon the instruments OAvned and needed by the government for that purpose. If the United States had guns stored in various cities of the Union, could such cities, or the states in which they were located, impose a property tax upon those implements of warfare? I realize that there has been a trend in the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States toAvard holding that non-discriminatory taxation by a state, that is to say, taxation which does not single out the United States as a taxpayer, is not invalid; that trend is discussed in <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>

Ct. Rep. 617</a>, 621. But, while a tax discriminating against the United States would certainly be invalid, I do not understand that a tax is valid just because it does not so discriminate; its validity is still subject to the limitation which, resulting from the nature of our federal system, requires that property belonging to the United States, and especially if used by it for the performance of one of its vital constitutional functions, should be exempt from local taxation. If, for example, a property tax were imposed by a state on all courthouse buildings within the state, could the tax be levied on a federal courthouse there located just because it applied to <em>all </em>courthouses, state and federal alike? If a property tax were imposed by a state on guns carried by persons within the state, could the tax be levied, because it was non-discriminatory, on guns carried by soldiers of the United States army within that state? The doctrine of “non-discriminatory” taxation has been applied to taxes on the property of contractors dealing with the government, but it has never been held to justify a tax imposed upon the government’s own property or upon the instrumentalities through which it exercises the powers granted it by the Constitution. Nor is there any merit in the argument that the machinery, together with all the other property in the mill, is presumably given local police and fire protection. Such protection is also afforded to federal postoffices, courthouses, arsenals and other government establishments, but that does not make them liable to local taxation; it is for Congress alone to declare that, because of this consideration, the state or other local authority should be permitted to tax government property.</p>

It need scarcely be said that the inconvenience which might be occasioned to tax assessors arising from any such duty of investigation <em>(Pennsylvania Company, Trustee, </em>v. <em>Bergson, </em><a href="/pa/307/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="307 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="1138161" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0044-01">307 Pa. 44</a>, 51, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.%2032" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="159 A. 32">159 A. 32</a>, 34) is not to be weighed against the right of an exempt owner. As far as private persons are concerned, Pennsylvania may, if it sees fit, — either as a matter of practical expediency or of economic policy,— tax land, building and equipment as a whole, regardless of the fact that parts of the property may be owned by other persons, and even by citizens of other states: <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Errol, </em><a href="/us/116/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="116 U.S. 517" data-case-ids="3516975" data-case-paths="/us/116/0517-01">116 U. S. 517</a>. In the present case, however, we are dealing, not with expediency or policy, but with the constitutional <em>power </em>of Pennsylvania where the owner of part of the property taxed happens to be the United States. It is contended that, although machinery belonging to the government is not taxable so long as it retains its status as personal property, it becomes locally taxable as real property when bolts are driven through it to the floor of the Mesta Company’s mill. It is true, of course, that for certain purposes machinery affixed to a building is regarded by the law as though it were real estate, and, if privately owned, might properly be so regarded for purposes of taxation. Even if, however, it be deemed to be real property, it is real property belonging to the United States and therefore is not taxable. If the United States owned a <em>horizontal </em>islet of land in the middle of the plant, certainly no one would contend that that islet would be taxable; it may not be too fanciful to view this machinery as a piece of <em>vertical </em>real property belonging to the United States, and no more taxable, therefore, than it would be under the hypothesis suggested, for what difference should it make whether the property owned by the government be distinguished from <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>that owned by the Mesta Company by horizontal or by vertical boundary lines? Such a distinction would subordinate actualities to a type of legalism unbefitting'the purpose and art of constitutional interpretation. The important point is that, whatever the technical nomenclature ascribed to it, the machinery is owned by, and is an essential instrumentality of, the United States, and it cannot be deprived of the resulting immunity given it under our constitutional system merely because, in order to facilitate its operation, it is necessary temporarily to fasten it to the floor of a mill. Such fastening still leaves it a distinct, individuated part of the property ; it does not change its ownership, and it is <em>ownership </em>which is the criterion of taxability under the statute by which this tax is imposed. In short, — to state the basic proposition in simple <em>language, </em>— the <em>United States owns a distinct, clearly defined, tangible part of this mill and that part is exempt from local taxation.</em>

The Act of June 4,1901, P. L. 364, provides that all taxes are first liens on the property taxed and that such liens shall be first paid out of the proceeds of any judicial sale of the property. In the admission, therefore, that this machinery cannot be <em>sold </em>by the taxing authority there is inherent the admission that it cannot be. <em>taxed, </em>for, as was said in <em>Mint Realty Company </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/218/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="218 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="999596" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0104-01">218 Pa. 104</a>, 110, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%201130" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="66 A. 1130">66 A. 1130</a>, 1132, “The power to tax implies the power to divest the title by a tax sale when there is default in the payment of the taxes levied,” and in <em>Northern Pacific R.

It follows that, if the assessment of these taxes is valid . . . the sale confers a title paramount to all others, and thereby destroys the lien of the United States for the costs of surveying these lands. If, on the other hand, the sale would not confer such a title, it is because there exists no authority to make it.” As already stated, there is no pretense that the tax here in question was on the interest, equitable or otherwise, of the Mesta Company in the machinery, not only because the company <em>had </em>no such interest apart from its right to use the machinery under its government contract, but because the tax admittedly was on the full value of the machinery and was imposed upon the Mesta Company, not as user or possessor, but as owner of the mill. The situation, therefore, is quite different from that which existed in the case of <em>City of New Brunswick </em>v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/us/276/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="276 U.S. 547" data-case-ids="3901778" data-case-paths="/us/276/0547-01">276 U.

It is interested not only because it expressly contracted to reimburse the Mesta Company for the taxes which the latter might be required to pay, but because, even in the absence of such a contract, the Mesta Company could recover from it the amount- of the tax on the machinery. “As between the real owner and the registered [that is, the nominal or apparent] owner, the latter is secondarily liable and may therefore recover from the real owner sums by him paid on account of the tax”: <em>Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, Trustee, </em>v. <em>Land Title Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/326/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="326 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1174434" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0262-01">326 Pa. 262</a>, 264, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.%20121" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="192 A. 121">192 A. 121</a>, 122.

The taxpayer is the person ultimately liable for the tax itself.” It is therefore clear that, just as in the <em>Van Brocklin </em>case and many others of those hereinbefore cited, the fact that the assessment of the tax is against the Mesta Company, and not the United States directly, is of no significance as far as the validity of the tax is concerned. The United States is the real party in interest, not because of any indirect shifting to it of the economic burden of the tax, but because it is bound, even irrespective of its contract, to reimburse the Mesta Company, and it is therefore the real taxpayer involved. Of course, the Mesta Company also has the right, apart from that of the government, to resist the tax imposed upon it; it is not obliged to submit to an invalid levy and then seek reimbursement from the government.</p>
