        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe plaintiff, an architect, sued for services rendered pursuant to a written contract entitling him to \u201c. . . a fee of six (6) per cent of the cost of the work . . .\u201d in the construction of a hall for defendant society. There was evidence to show performance; that the low bid was |77,659.00; that at defendant\u2019s request he revised the plans pursuant to which the hall could have been constructed for f57,557; that the defendant declined to go on.\nThe defense appears to have been that the \u201cplaintiff stated to the defendant\u2019s officers and members of the building committee that the cost of the proposed structure would not exceed $50,000, according to his plans and specifications, when plaintiff knew such fact to be false, and the defendant believed and relied upon such representation and executed said contract.\u201d\nDefendant failed to lay grounds by evidence clear, precise and indubitable (see Broida v. Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co., 316 Pa. 444, 447, 175 A. 492) for the reformation of the contract and the case was submitted to the jury on the theory, then apparently acceptable to both sides, that plaintiff was entitled to a verdict for all or nothing. The jury was instructed to deduct an item \u201cof $5,800.00 for bowling alleys\u201d from the $77,659. The verdict was at the rate of 6% on $71,859 less $1,300 paid on account, and with interest. The court reduced the verdict by $500 with interest on the ground that there was evidence that the value of services which would have been rendered by the architect if the project had not been abandoned was about $500. Both actions were favorable to defendant.\nIn this court defendant\u2019s counsel stated that he could not object to a judgment based on an assumed cost of the work of $57,557. It now complains that a new trial was refused and that the jury was instructed that if a verdict for plaintiff was found, the base on which his fee should be calculated would be $71,859 instead of $57,557. The court doubtless made the distinction because defendant admitted \u201c. . . that $77,659 was the reasonable estimated cost of the building, based upon the plans, drawings, specifications and details prepared for the defendant, . . .\u201d There is no reversible error.\nJudgment affirmed.\nDefendant offered in evidence \u201c. . . tbe following excerpt from tbe regular meeting of tbe Radiant Society beld on November 8,1936: After a lengthy discussion, Mr. Leczynski moved that the building committee be dissolved and for the time being to forget about the building. Motion passes. Twenty-eight votes for and three against.\u201d",
