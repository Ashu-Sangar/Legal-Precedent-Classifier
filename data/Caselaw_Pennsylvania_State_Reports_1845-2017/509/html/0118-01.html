On the first day of voir dire, the court, without notice, cleared the courtroom because of insufficient room to seat <em>all </em>the jurors and <em>all </em>the members of the news media. (N.T. 2/23/81, p. 98). On the second day of voir dire, the trial court chose to change the procedure and question only four prospective jurors at a time. (N.T. 2/24/81, p. 118). Yet, upon request for an open proceeding, the court ruled that it did not want the jurors, “to come in contact with any extraneous influences while being brought back and forth from the other courtroom.” (N.T. 2/24/81, p. 123). Although the court indicated fire considerations were involved, it expanded the seating capacity for the news media. The court then expressed concern that spectators from the general public would “start eating and opening up Lifesavers and things like that.” (N.T. 2/24/81, p. 124). Finally, on the fourth day of jury selection, upon the defendants’ request for an open voir dire, the <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>trial court refused indicating that the news media would protect the openness of the proceedings.

Never should it be mistaken, misunderstood or misinterpreted, that the news media, electronic, newsprint or otherwise, will ever supplement the sanctity of the general public’s right to access. Furthermore, it is clear from <em>this </em>record that the circumstances did not warrant closure of the jury selection process. In fact, in the appellant’s brief we are not directed to any portions of the record which substantiate any necessity of barring the general public for the voir dire. If sufficient room existed to increase space for the news media, surely sufficient room existed to permit an orderly rotation of a few members of the general public to view the jury proceedings. The fact that the trial itself was open lends support to the proposition that the trial court acted improperly in closing the voir dire.</p>
