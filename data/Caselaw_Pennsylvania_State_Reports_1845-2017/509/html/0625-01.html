In considering the proportionality of appellant’s sentence, this Court looked only at the mitigating and aggravating circumstances which were considered by the jury in reaching its decision. These factors, all of which were part of the trial transcript, were sufficient for us to determine that appellant’s sentence was not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. <em>See Commonwealth v.
