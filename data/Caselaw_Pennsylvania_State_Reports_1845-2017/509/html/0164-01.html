Appellee Arabi, a native of Cuba, having arrived in the United States in May of 1980, verified by his own sworn affidavit a work history in Cuba which met the forty-eight month requirement. No independent verification of such work history was furnished on the excuse of impossibility. In view of our holding, this issue is irrelevant since the foreign employment is not "covered” employment under the Act and any wages earned could not be considered in determining base year wages and rate of compensation.

Initially, the Commonwealth Court attempts to reason by analogy. Thus it is said that “[i]n conjunction with administrative law, i.e. exhaustion of administrative remedies, the term exhaustion does not require that a party have an administrative remedy as a precondition to access to the courts, but merely means that if an administrative remedy exists, the party must first use it.” 82 Pa.Cmwlth. at 120, <a href="/citations/?q=475%20A.2d%20873" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="475 A.2d 873">475 A.2d at 875</a>.

He belongs in court in the first instance; “administrative remedies” and “exhaustion” are simply irrelevant to his case. Where no administrative remedies exist, it is absurd to say that a party may proceed in court <em>because </em>he has “exhausted his administrative remedies.” The concept of exhaustion is utterly meaningless in such a context. The correct statement of the premise in the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning is that “the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not require that a party have an administrative remedy as a precondition to access to the courts, but merely means that if an administrative remedy exists, the party must first use it.” As thus corrected, however, the premise offers no support for the argued meaning of the term “exhausted”.</p>

Describing the statement of purpose contained in Section 401 of the Law, 62 Pa.S. § 401, as establishing a “worthy man” concept, the court concludes that the Appellees have <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>each in one way or another demonstrated that they are not “unworthy”. Whether the Appellees or any other claimant might marshal evidence to convince this or any tribunal that in the abstract or by comparison they are “worthy” to receive benefits as chronically needy persons is of no legal significance. The legislature has done more than state that assistance is to be granted to “worthy” people, it has specifically defined those people whom it considers to be worthy. The court engages in this discussion of “worthiness” ostensibly in aid of ascertaining the proper interpretation of “exhausted”, but the result is even further error. The court notes that each of the Appellees had by his work experience demonstrated “self-dependency and the desire to be a good citizen and useful to society.” Subsection (H), under which the Appellees seek to qualify themselves as chronically needy, requires not only work experience of at least 48 months out of the last eight years, <em>but also </em>exhaustion of unemployment benefits. If the Appellees could demonstrate “worthiness” and therefore eligibility merely by producing evidence of a sufficient work record, the exhaustion language would be surplusage. “Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all of its provisions.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). <em>See also Daly v.

In the case of a statute generally granting benefits, it might well be that in a doubtful case “liberal construction” of the statute would result in a decision in favor of coverage rather than denial of all benefits. In the case of an amendatory statute whose purpose is to limit full benefits to certain categories of recipients while allowing partial benefits to others, “liberal construction” does not mandate that doubtful cases be construed in favor of full coverage. Rather “liberal construction <em>to effect the purpose of the statute </em>...” requires that limitations be construed as limitations, no more, no less.</p>

The Department argues strongly that the Courts should not presume that the Legislature intended that which it declined to say; however, the Department actually maintains that by use of the term “exhausted”, the Legislature meant “received and exhausted”. If that is what the Legislature intended it is certainly familiar with the verb “receive” and could easily have utilized it.</blockquote>

The plurality then ignores its own admonition against “reading words into” the Public Welfare Code in holding that “we must conclude that the Legislature intended ‘exhaust’ to mean the Appellees must have <em>qualified for and received </em>unemployment benefits <em>and depleted </em>their entitlement to same____” At 170-171. I cannot agree that the “plain meaning” of the word “exhausted” is “qualified for and received and depleted”-merely ascribing a meaning to a word and labelling that meaning as the “plain” one does not necessarily make it so. It is the plurality that “reads words into” the Code, <em>not </em>the Commonwealth Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a>

My major disagreement with the plurality is of a more fundamental and philosophical nature as it concerns the plurality’s misguided decision to construe the Public Welfare Code <em>strictly </em>in favor of <em>denial or restriction of benefits </em>to claimants, (“we read our statute and the legislative history behind it to impose stricter standards for claimants to receive benefits under the Act ...” At 171).

The “strict construction” approach advocated today by the plurality is diametrically opposed to the objectives and goals of the Public Welfare Code.

The plurality also suggests that the interpretation of "exhausted” by the Commonwealth Court has violated the “supreme principle of statutory interpretation [that] each word used by the Legislature has meaning and was used for a reason, not as mere surplusage.” At 169. However, the plurality does not elaborate further on this perceived violation of this “supreme principle” and, in fact, takes off in the other direction in reasoning that the Commonwealth Court has “read words into" the Act.</p>
