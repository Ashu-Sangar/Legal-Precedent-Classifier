A trial was initially held without appellant due to lack of notice. Appellant’s absence warranted the granting of a new trial which was held on November 26-28, 1979, in which a verdict on behalf of appellant was returned. Appellee filed a motion for a new trial on December 4, 1979. An amended motion for new trial was filed on January 5, 1981, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>the acquisition of new evidence in the form of testimony as to a telephone conversation between appellant and appellee on March 8, 1980, in which appellant allegedly admitted to perjuring himself at trial.

Appellant and appellee began to see one another regularly during the summer of 1977. At the time, appellant was a resident of Pennsylvania and appellee a resident of New York. Appellee testified that her first moment of intimacy with appellant occurred in Pennsylvania at the end of July, 1977. She further testified that the act leading to the pregnancy at issue transpired between her and appellant in November of 1977, at the home of her friend, Mark Ginsberg. Appellee claims she had no sexual relations with anyone from June of 1976 to July of 1977, and from then on only with appellant until December of 1977. Appellant denied having had sexual relations with appellee during the established period of conception. These allegations and denials were the extent of the evidence presented to the jury, upon which the jury returned a verdict for appellant.</p>
