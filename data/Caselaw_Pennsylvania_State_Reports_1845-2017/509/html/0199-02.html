Upon thorough review of our prior holdings, the change in the attitude of our sister states permitting these actions, and Appellants’ arguments that medical knowledge has advanced since we first formulated our position against the maintenance of those actions, we conclude that the time has arrived for us to join our twenty-eight sister states and the District of Columbia and recognize that survival and wrongful death actions lie by the estates of stillborn children for fatal injuries they received while viable children en ventre sa mere<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>.

Implicit in our holding in <em>Sinkler </em>is the acknowledgement that a child en ventre sa mere is an individual with the right to be free of prenatal injury. If a child en ventre sa mere is an individual at the time of its injury, then, <em>a fortiori, </em>the child is also an individual when those injuries cause its death, and it makes no difference in liability under the wrongful death and survival statutes whether the child dies of the injuries just prior to or just after birth.</p>

The battle lines on this issue have been fairly clearly drawn in prior <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>cases and the arsenals of reasoning amassed on each side have for the most part remained unchanged. I am in agreement with the result and therefore join the majority opinion. Because of the importance of the question, however, I am not satisfied to overrule the previous decisions of this Court, <em>Scott v. Kopp, </em><a href="/pa/494/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="494 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1769102" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0487-01">494 Pa. 487</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="494 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1769102" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0487-01">431 A.2d 959</a> (1981) being of especially recent vintage, without a complete analysis of the competing considerations. The difference is, perhaps, only one of emphasis, but I am convinced that our responsibility to explain the reasons underlying our decisions is not met by simple reference to the holdings of other courts or to previously filed dissenting opinions. Were the trend reflecting a substantial “change in attitude” among our sister states sufficient reason to recognize these actions, <em>Scott v. Kopp </em>would have been decided differently; as the dissenting opinion of Justice Larsen indicated, there were 27 jurisdictions allowing such actions when that case was decided. In the intervening four years, Missouri, North Dakota, Idaho, Iowa, Ohio, and Arizona have been added to the list, but it can hardly be said that the trend is now overwhelmingly different than when we decided <em>Scott. </em>Neither does the lead opinion offer any justification for the present acceptance of the same reasoning which was advanced by Justice Larsen in <em>Scott </em>but did not command a majority. Nor does it address the significance, if any, of the language differences between Pennsylvania’s Wrongful Death Act and the statutes in other jurisdictions, or the distinction between the Wrongful Death and Survival Acts. Consistency and stability, which are among the fundamental interests of our jurisprudence, require a more thorough explanation if substantial change is to withstand rigorous scrutiny.

The action was brought in four counts, by Regina and Joseph each in his own right, and as parents/administrators on behalf of Jennifer under the Wrongful Death and Survival Acts. The trial court granted the Appellees’ demurrers to the counts asserting the wrongful death and survival claims. The Superior Court affirmed on the authority of <em>Scott v. Kopp.</em>

      <em>Carroll </em>involved an action by a plaintiff-father against a defendant physician alleging that in the course of an operation on the plaintiff’s wife the infant had been negligently destroyed in útero. Relying on the derivative nature of wrongful death and survival actions, the Court determined that a fetus did not qualify as an independent life in being which could have instituted the action prior to death. It was also observed that the Wrongful Death Act’s provision for distribution of a recovery according to the rules applicable to intestacy indicated an intent that the Act not apply to stillborn infants. This was said to follow because children <em>en ventre sa mere </em>could not, under Pennsylvania law, take property by devise or descent unless subsequently born alive and thus could not have an estate from which others might take. Noted as additional reasons for denying the cause of action were the problems of proof of causation and damages, considered unreasonably speculative in the case of stillborn children, the punitive character of damages, and the availability of a recovery to the parents in their own independent actions.</p>

The “obviousness” of this conclusion, however, derives not from logical reasoning but from begging the question. In <em>Sinkler </em>we acknowledged that the child developing itself in the mother’s womb “is regarded as having <em>existence as a </em>

(Emphasis added). Apart from the present dispute, this can have no other meaning than that, whether born or unborn, the child is an “independent life”. The question then is whether this “independent life” could have instituted an action prior to death. This inquiry cannot be directed to the physical capacity to comprehend and direct the filing of a complaint, for it cannot be doubted that there are numerous actions maintained by persons acting in a representative capacity for plaintiffs suffering legal disabilities (e.g. infancy, incompetence), or that these actions would survive the death of the disabled plaintiff. Neither can this inquiry be related to whether the cause of action and all damages claimed thereunder “accrued” before the victim died. This notion is belied by the availability to an estate bringing a survival action of damages for loss of earning power. Because they depend on the victim’s having died, these damages would not have been available to the victim <em>prior </em>to his death. Accordingly, I am unable to ascertain how the necessity of “an independent life in being which could have brought the action prior to death” precludes the maintenance of an action by the representative of a stillborn child, unless it be assumed that live birth is a prerequisite to the existence of a cause of action. Yet surely the question of whether a cause of action can accrue to an unborn child cannot be answered by assuming that a cause of action cannot accrue to an unborn child.

By way of example, it is noted that in the present statute and numerous others the word “children” is used without reference to the marital status of the biological parents. From the common understanding of the era and from case law it may be concluded that the General Assembly expressed no intention as to whether “illegitimate” children could come within the word “children”; indeed, if anything it may be said that the intention was almost certainly otherwise. <em>Frazier v.

The admixture of common law and code, of judicial decision and legislative enactment which has characterized our system of justice for centuries surely allows more flexibility. Where the legislature has acted in a particular field and the precise situation which later arises was not or could not have been contemplated, the court fulfills its function by first determining whether the novel situation is generally within the field covered by the legislation or is a separate type of matter within the realm of different legislative authority (or, perhaps, common law rules). Assuming that the situation is within the field covered, the court must determine, in the manner of the common law, whether the new case is so like the cases addressed explicitly by the rule of the statute that the same rule must be applied, or whether it is so different from those cases clearly within the statutory terms that the rule should not govern. This analysis, of course, is accomplished by reference to and ascertainment of the legislative intent.</p>

As previously indicated, wrongful death statutes were unanimously enacted in rejection of the presumed common law rule barring recovery for an obvious wrong which made it “more profitable for the defendant to kill the plaintiff than to scratch him.” W. Prosser, Law of Torts, § 127 (4th Ed.1971). Given our determination that a child in the womb may be the victim of a legally cognizable injury separate from any injury to the mother, this salutary objective of the statute is frustrated if we fail to apply it in this situation. Stated quite simply, the physician who, in treating a pregnant woman, makes a slight mistake which would expose him to liability were the child to survive to live birth, would <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>have a legal disincentive to allow such survival.

Compensatory damages, in all cases of civil injury or breach of contract, are those damages awarded to give compensation for pecuniary loss; that is, to put the plaintiff in the same position, so far as money can do it, as he or she would have been if the contract had been performed or the tort not committed. Sedgwick on Damages (9th ed., p. 25). Chief Justice Shippen, in <em>Bussy v.

Palmer, </em><a href="/pa/14/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="258" data-cite="14 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="405980" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0096-01">14 Pa. 96</a>, 97 (1850), Chief Justice Gibson observed, “The measure is the actual, not the speculative loss. The primary end of damages is compensation; and not of every injurious consequence that may have been suffered ..." Chief Justice Gibson further observed that the "machinery of law” that the “legal injury" sets in motion “is necessarily imperfect; for much suffering, vexation, and anxiety is often inflicted, which cannot be subjected to its action." Thus, as noted in <em>Kountz </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick &amp; Lyons, </em><a href="/pa/72/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="259" data-cite="72 Pa. 376" data-case-ids="434772" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0376-01">72 Pa. 376</a>, 387 (1872), "[actual] compensation being the true purpose of the law, it is obvious that the means employed, in other words, the evidence to ascertain compensation must be such as truly reaches this end." <em>See generally Incollingo </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em><a href="/pa/444/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="260" data-cite="444 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="1938647" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0263-01">444 Pa. 263</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20206" class="citation" data-index="261" data-cite="282 A.2d 206">282 A.2d 206</a> (1977).</p>

I note that Justice Zappala in his concurring opinion implies that if the child survives, both mother and child could each bring an action for this same injury citing this Court’s decision in <em>Sinn v.

I must confess that I do not understand the applicability of <em>Sinn </em>in this context. In <em>Sinn </em>mother and child were assaulted by distinctly different forces, albeit arising from the same incident. The child was struck by the vehicle itself, whereas the mother’s emotional distress arose from the impact of the event. <em>See generally, Niederman v. Brodsky, </em><a href="/pa/436/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="264" data-cite="436 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1926120" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0401-01">436 Pa. 401</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=261%20A.2d%2084" class="citation" data-index="265" data-cite="261 A.2d 84">261 A.2d 84</a> (1970). Additionally, there is no question as to the mother’s right to recover for the emotional distress. The trauma was to her body thus under the impact rule emotional distress resulting therefrom is unquestionably recoverable. W. Prosser &amp; W.
