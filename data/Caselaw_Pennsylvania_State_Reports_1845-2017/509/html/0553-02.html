(Coatesville-appellant) in its action in assumpsit and trespass against appellee, Borough of Ridley Park (Ridley Parkappellee).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Coatesville initiated the action seeking to recover additional compensation in excess of the contract price called for in an excavation contract between the parties. Reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the appellant,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the record establishes the following:</p>

The pre-bid on-site inspection revealed an area that was once a lake, but at that time was filled with silt. There was a small stream flowing through the area of silt giving the appearance of a meadow or a field. After making the inspection, appellant prepared and delivered its bid for the excavation job. The bid was submitted on official bid documents provided by appellee. Among other things, the bid documents set forth specifications for the removal of silt from the lake site. Paragraph 1 of the specifications provided:</p>

The contractor shall remove silt and debris from areas as herein and shown on the plan.</blockquote>
    <p id="b624-4" data-blocks='[["BL_624.4",624,[244,454,1139,450]]]'>The appellant was the low bidder and was awarded the contract. In November, 1977, after receiving notice of its successful bid, Mr. John Fallon of Coatesville made another inspection of the lake site with a view toward getting the job started. On this second inspection the job site was found to be in a condition similar to that observed at the September pre-bid inspection. The lake bed was still full of silt and the small stream continued to run through the silt area.</p>
    <p id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[241,931,1141,1075]]]'>In late March, 1978, appellant received notice from Ridley Park to begin work on the job. Responding to the notice, appellant sent workmen to the job site to commence operations. When appellant’s workers arrived at the site, it was discovered that the lake was completely filled with water. John Fallon of Coatesville immediately notified the borough engineer, Jack Damon, of the unexpected water condition. Mr. Fallon informed the appellee that appellant had a couple of days work to do in other portions of the job site away from the main body of the lake and could get started on those other areas even though the lake was filled with water. Mr. Fallon indicated, however, that at such time when the appellant’s work progressed to the lake, it would be necessary that the appellee have the lake drained of water and kept in the drained condition appellant observed in its September and November inspections, and which was called for by the bid documents and contract specifications.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Based upon Mr. Fallon’s conversations with the borough engineer, appellant reasonably concluded that the appellee would take the steps necessary to remove the water from the lake and work was commenced.</p>

From time to time, borough employees would go out on the lake in a boat and, with long poles, try to open a valve, ostensibly to accelerate the flow of water out of the lake. These efforts were consistently unsuccessful. Appellant continued on the job during this time and eventually, in early August 1978, considered its performance completed. Appellant billed Ridley Park for an additional $17,000.00 over and above the contract price, most of which had already been paid. The added $17,000.00 represented additional costs allegedly incurred by appellant because the lake was filled with water and remained that way while appellant performed its work under the contract.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Appellee disputed appellant’s assertion that the job was finished and insisted that further work had to be done before the contract was completed. After negotiations between the parties over the question of whether appellant’s performance was complete, the appellee agreed to hire a subcontractor to drain the water from the lake. The subcontractor engaged by appellee successfully drained the lake in March, 1979. Appellant returned to the job site after the lake had been drained and did the additional work insisted upon by appellee. Subsequently, Ridley Park refused to pay the invoice for additional expenses in the sum of $17,000.00 and appellant filed suit. At the close of appellant’s case, the trial court granted appellee’s motion for a compulsory nonsuit. Appellant’s timely motions to <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>remove the nonsuit and for a new trial were denied. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed. Appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal to this Court was granted.</p>

When appellant submitted its bid both parties knew the lake was drained of water. Likewise, when the contract was awarded to appellant both appellant and appellee knew the lake was in a drained condition as set forth in the contract specifications. When, however, the appellant was notified by appellee to proceed with the contract work, the lake was not in the drained state as contemplated by the agreement. On the contrary, the lake was completely filled with water. This condition constituted an interference with the contract work required to be done by appellant. The appellant immediately notified appellee of the water condition and appellee’s engineer led appellant to reasonably believe that the condition would be corrected. Ridley Park’s notification to appellant to proceed with the excavation work when it was known that the lake was filled with water invalidated the exculpatory provisions of the contract. See <em>Gasparini, supra. </em>In <em>Gasparini </em>the contractor was awarded a contract for the construction of a portion of the northeastern extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The contract specifically provided that during the time the contractor was performing its work thereunder, other contractors would be involved in slushing operation at the site. The contract also provided that: “No claims for damages or extra costs due to delay to the contractor’s work caused by the work of slushing contracts will be allowed and it is agreed that the contract prices are submitted on this basis.” On June 6, 1955, the contractor received official notice to proceed with its work. Under the agreement all of its work was to be <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>completed by September 1, 1956. At the time the contractor was notified to start work, slushing operations were in progress on the job site. These slushing operations prevented the contractor from proceeding with its work. It was not until November, 1955 that the contractor was able to get on with its performance. In the contractor’s claim for additional compensation alleged to be due because of the delay, we held that the exculpatory provisions apparently relieving the Commonwealth of any claim for extra costs were ineffective as a defense. We noted that the contractor was ordered to start work and prepared to do so by, among other things, moving equipment to the site. The work area, however, was not available to the contractor in that it was occupied by others engaged in slushing operations. The Superior Court distinguished <em>Gasparini </em>by pointing out that there the contractor was physically denied access to the work area by the presence of other contractors on the job site. In contrasting <em>Gasparini </em>to the instant case the Superior Court observed that Coatesville was never denied physical access to the work site. After receiving notice to commence, the appellant was able to and did put its workmen and equipment on the job site and immediately began work under the contract even though the lake was filled with water. Additionally, the Superior Court found significant that appellant did not invoke the protective procedure provided by the contract. Under certain circumstances Article IV, paragraph 2 (supra.) entitles the contractor to seek an extension of time for completing the job by submitting written notice to a committee of any work delay or hindrance resulting from causes entirely beyond the control of the contractor. Instead, the court concluded, appellant opted to forego an authorized extension of time and decided to commence work at its own risk. We believe the Superior Court was in error on both counts.

Appellant was led to reasonably believe that corrective measures would be taken by appellee to have the lake drained. Appellee never denied its responsibility to drain the lake and keep it drained. It was understood that keeping the lake drained was the responsibility of appellee and appellant’s work began and continued on that basis.</p>

Moreover, the evidence shows there was failure in the essential matter of the appellee not having the lake in a drained state when work was ordered to commence. The exculpatory provision of the contract cannot be raised as a defense to the appellant’s claim for additional compensation occasioned by appellee’s interference and failure to act in an essential matter as noted. The lower court erred in granting a compulsory nonsuit and continued its error in refusing to remove the nonsuit.</p>

Appellant’s witness, John Fallon, testified that appellant was forced to employ a method of digging and excavating which was different than that originally planned at the time of the bid. The water in the lake interfered with excavation. The excavating bucket could not be filled to more than one-half capacity because the water would cause overflow. Full loads could not be taken by the trucks. The excavated materials would slosh around in the truck bed and seep through the tailgate and sides. This made maintenance of the roads much more difficult in that the appellant was required to constantly clean the highways and streets. Additionally, because of the water, the appellant had to keep building up the shore and lake area with heavy ballast to make it stable. Further, the appellant was on the job from the end of March to early August and then went back in March of the following year to do additional work even though the contract called for performance in sixty working days.</p>
