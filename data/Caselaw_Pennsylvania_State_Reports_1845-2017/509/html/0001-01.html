The Commissioner had extended a policy term to provide coverage to one of appellant’s insureds for an automobile accident. The Commissioner held the policy covered the accident despite the insured’s failure to respond to premium notices until after the policy and its grace period had expired and the accident occurred. The Commissioner held for the insured and ignored appellant’s three premium notices because they were not in the precise form required by a regulation prescribing the content of an insurer’s notice of either intent to cancel or refusal to renew at the end of a policy term. 31 Pa.Code § 61.5.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant contends the regulation has no application here where the cancellation is for nonpayment of premiums.

On the facts before us, we disagree with this result. Although an insurance company may itself initiate cancellation of coverage under an automobile insurance policy for nonpayment of premium at the end of its nominal six-month term only by using the Commissioner’s prescribed notice, cancellation of policy coverage for nonpayment of premium before the anniversary date is nevertheless effective if the insurer can show that the insured knowingly refused to pay a properly charged premium, thus manifesting by overt acts his own intent to cancel the policy. Section 6(2) of the Act, 40 P.S. § 1008.-6(2). An insurer who does not use the prescribed notice must prove that the insured knew his premium was due and refused to pay it. On the stipulations and administrative findings in this record, it is plain the insured had this knowledge. On the facts of this case, the Commissioner’s attempt to avoid subsection 6(2) of the Act by reference to another of his regulations, which states that mere nonpayment of premium does not trigger subsection 6(2), effectively deletes the subsection 6(2) exemption from the statute and is inconsistent with the Section 4 express statement permitting cancellation for nonpayment of premium.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We therefore reverse Commonwealth Court.</p>

The insured did not pay. On April 18, 1979, appellant sent a second notice which stated that payment made on or before April 28, 1979 would result in coverage retroactive to the April 13 expiration date.

It has no relevance to this case. Section 4, 40 P.S. § 1008.4, which is relevant, restricts the reasons for which an insurer may cancel to nonpayment of premium, suspension of the driver’s license or registration of the principal driver, or concealing a material fact.

The Insurance Department agrees with appellant that no notice of cancellation is needed once there is an offer to renew. However, the Department argues that the definitional language of subsection 1(2) implies that “renewals]” can only be made after a policy period of twelve months. Under the Department’s view, the notice sent out in this case was a nullity as an offer to renew under subsection 6(1) because the statute required the insurer to continue coverage for the offered six-month period and it was also insufficient under that subsection as a notice to cancel because it did not follow the form prescribed by the regulations issued pursuant to Section 5.</p>

If an insured does not wish to continue the policy, he is always free to do so. He can cancel at any time and, indeed, did so here two months after his accident. Likewise, while the insurer cannot refuse to renew a policy within twelve months of its issuance, it can cancel the policy for the reasons given in Section 4, which include nonpayment of premium.</p>

However, these purposes are not implicated when an insured wishes to cancel. The question then is what objective conduct should be required to manifest the insured’s intent to do so.

Mr. Monn’s conduct involves more than “mere nonpayment of premiums.” The appellant here has shown not “mere” nonpayment but knowing nonpayment. The facts found by the Commissioner, namely, that Mr. Monn knew his policy had expired for nonpayment of premium before his accident, establishes more than “mere” nonpayment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Such a knowing refusal to pay is an overt act.
