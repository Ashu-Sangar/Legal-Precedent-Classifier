In August 1975, Jackson received notice from the District’s School Board indicating that the Board would seek to terminate her employment on the grounds of mental derangement, <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>incompetency, and persistent negligence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> Several hearings were held throughout the fall of 1975. On November 27, 1975, the Board of Directors of the Centennial School District held a hearing without the presence of Jackson’s attorney, and voted to discharge Jackson for the above charges. On appeal, the Secretary of Education reversed the discharge on the basis that Jackson’s right to due process was violated when the Board conducted the dismissal hearing in the absence of her attorney. The Secretary remanded the case to the Board of School Directors. After additional hearings were held, the Board again discharged Jackson on July 28, 1977. This discharge was upheld on Appeal by the Secretary of Education. An untimely appeal to the Commonwealth Court from the decision of the Secretary was voluntarily discontinued by Jackson on March 6, 1978 and was quashed on March 8, 1978.</p>

Jackson moved for summary judgment and the Centennial School District filed a cross motion for summary judgment alleging lack of jurisdiction, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The trial court found for Jackson and granted her motion for summary judgment. The School District appealed to the Commonwealth Court which affirmed the trial court’s conclusions that Jackson could maintain an action in assumpsit and that such action was not barred by <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> <a href="/pa-commw/81/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="81 Pa.
