As in any such inquiry, the finder of fact must examine the surrounding circumstances and the entire course of police conduct with respect to the suspect in evaluating the voluntariness of his statements.

No further purpose is served by imputing “taint” to subsequent statements obtained pursuant to a voluntary and knowing waiver.

Both of these findings were within the responsibility of that court and, while one is not obliged to agree with them, if they are supported by the evidence they are the facts of the case. The Superior Court chose to accept one finding, that appellant was “in custody”, and not the other, that the request for counsel was waived. The panel reasoned that while the suppression court’s findings are solid rock, they are not required to reach the same conclusion from the same facts. Neither are we. I believe the conclusion reached by the Superior Court panel on the facts presented by the suppression court constituted an unnecessary reach for a view instead of a logic.</p>

On July 13, while at home, he told his probation officer, Mr. McCool, who had consulted with him on July 12, that what he told the police on July 12, was a lie. Mr. McCool told him he best tell the police that he lied. Appellant called the police and he and Mr. McCool arranged to meet at the station house. They did, and appellant confessed again. One need not go further. Appellant was literally awash in <em>Miranda </em>warnings; he was allowed home and returned of his own accord, without counsel, either to correct a lie or tell the truth. Whatever his reason, no one forced him. Indeed, the case is sterile of any shadow of coercion and the <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>suppression court so found. It is a salutary rule that once counsel is requested, all questioning initiated by the police should cease.

(Hubble did not own a car.) Hubble himself testified that that the police told him that if he made a statement, police would allow him to go home. N.T. 326-327. Moreover, it was only because Hubble and his wife insisted on staying in the state police barracks, <em>as they were on their way out the door to be taken </em>home, that the confession of July 12, 1977 occurred at all. And when Hubble called an advisor (his probation officer) from the police station, the probation officer, testified: “I told him that I wasn’t sure whether [the public defender’s office] would represent him <em>until he was arrested </em>or not, but I told him to call them and find out.” N.T. 251. (Emphasis added). On these facts, it cannot be said that Hubble was in custody. He was being taken home when he insisted on staying in the police facility, where he subsequently gave a confession; just before he gave the confession, police offered to take him home; neither the police nor Hubble’s own advisor thought that he had been arrested; and Hubble himself testified that after making statement he expected to be taken home.</p>

As <em>Edwards </em>states, once counsel has been requested, the suspect is not subject to further custodial interrogation “unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.” 451 U.S. at 485, 101 S.Ct. at 1885, 69 L.Ed.2d at 386.</p>

Therefore, the subsequent confession of July 13, which was given freely and after renewed <em>Miranda </em>warnings, reaffirmed the confession of July 12, and would be admissible (along with the text of the July 12 confession). I quite agree with Mr. Justice Larsen that the fact that Hubble “let the cat out of the bag” on July 12 during what was, for the sake of argument, an improper police questioning, does not preclude the use of the July 12 confession where it was subsequently ratified during permissible police questioning on July 13. <em>See Oregon v.

The opinion announcing the judgment of the Court attempts to justify its determination that this request is not clear enough to invoke <em>Edwards </em>by reference to the fact that appellee first called a private attorney, instead of the public defender, and finally his probation officer when the private attorney was unavailable. That opinion states he did not call the public defender after being encouraged to do so. That “encouragement” included the statement of the interrogators that they did not think the public defender would be available to him because he had not been arrested. <em>See </em>R.R. at 114a (quoted in opinion announcing the judgment of the Court, <em>supra, </em>509 Pa. at 510-511, 504 A.2d at 173).

It does not support a finding that he was advised of his right to free counsel before giving a statement to police. It is on this “encouragement,” given after appellee’s unambiguous request for counsel, that the opinion announcing the judgment of the Court concludes appellee’s request was not clear because he did not follow up on it by calling the public defender.</p>

      <em>Supra, </em>at 509 (emphasis in original). This conclusion is a non-sequitur on this record.

The United States Supreme Court subsequently held in <em>Beckwith </em>that the focus test is not alone sufficient to invoke <em>Miranda. </em>One year later, we suggested that we would follow <em>Beck-with </em>in <em>Commonwealth v.
