There is no indication that the informant knew about the drugs in appellant’s car, and, although he had given credible information regarding other current prosecutions, there is nothing to show any specific information about appellant’s current activity.

In such cases, because of the reliance our society’s organs of law enforcement place, in conducting criminal trials and investigations, upon theretofore clear prior law more narrowly stating those rights, the courts refused to apply the newly expanded rights because of the disruption it would create in society if large numbers of persons who had been found guilty under settled law were left to go free, even though the absence of the newly expanded right did not implicate the truth-determining aspect of their trials.</p>
