Common Pleas had affirmed the action of the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment in denying the appeal of the Highland Park Community Club and others (appellees before us), protesting the action of the City Zoning Administrator. The Administrator had approved a certificate of occupancy for six dwelling units in appellant’s property, which is located in a residential district zoned for one and two family residences, on the assumption that the passage of time had converted an improper nonconforming use into one that was lawful. While reaching opposite conclusions, both Commonwealth Court and Common Pleas considered the landowner’s “vested right” to this multiple occupancy certificate the principal issue in the case. The record does not show appellant attempted to obtain a valid permit. He used the premises in violation of safety regulations until and after the regulatory authorities notified him of those violations. We hold he did not obtain a “vested right” to his nonconforming use and affirm the Commonwealth Court.</p>

In this case, the Zoning Administrator apparently approved the issuance of a certificate of occupancy in 1979 on the assumption that it was a continuation of a previously approved nonconforming use. There is nothing in this record, however, to indicate that he had confirmed such an assumption by a review of the pertinent records of previously approved nonconforming uses. A permissible nonconforming use is defined in the Code as: “A use of a structure or land other than a sign, <em>lawfully </em>existing on the effective date of this zoning ordinance or subsequent amendment <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>hereto, which was erected or altered for a use that does not completely conform to the use regulations applicable in the district in which it is located.” Section 903.02(h), Ordinance No. 95, 1979 (emphasis added). The Code prohibits any changes from a conforming use to a nonconforming use and specifically voids any use subsequently discovered to be dependent on an erroneously issued permit. Section 905.03, Ordinance No. 15, 1979. Thus, the issuance in this case of a certificate of occupancy for more than two families was in violation of the use limitations the Code establishes for R2 Districts, and its approval by the Administrator was an error of law unless the doctrine of “vested rights” applies.</p>

Once prodded by the Bureau of Building Inspection, appellant here paid the two dollar application fee for a certificate of occupancy and an additional five dollars for a building permit to construct one of the several features required for his tenants’ safety. Record, Exhibits 1 and 16. Then he let the building permit lapse in January 1977 by failing to begin construction. In November of that year, he again applied for a building permit for the furnace enclosure and by mid-December of 1977 he appears to have hired a contractor to install a second egress system for the building in the form of fire escapes. There is no record of any building permit for construction to shield the interior staircase, an additional <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>requirement in the letter of June 4, 1976 denying appellant’s occupancy permit. It was July of 1979 when appellant again applied for an occupancy permit, which was granted in December 1979. The granting of this permit and the testimony before the Zoning Board of Adjustment permit us to infer that the furnace enclosure and the fire escapes were eventually installed.

No such “good faith” or analogous “reliance” on official representation has been demonstrated here.

It follows that the use of the premises for six or seven dwelling units has been an unlawful, impermissible use from its inception. The Zoning Administrator’s approval of such occupancy is, therefore, an error of law and the Zoning Board of Adjustment’s finding of a “vested right” in appellant is not supported by substantial evidence in this record.

The majority holds that “[t]he Board’s allowance of appeal was both correct and appropriate,” rejecting the Appellant’s argument that the protest challenging the issuance of the occupancy permit was untimely.

Mr. Crawford [another protestant and attorney for the group of protestants] and I were chatting about the neighborhood and he told me that he had discovered that a Certificate of Occupancy had been issued to Mr. Holzapfel. I was surprized [sic] — and upset — and told him that I would like to join in an appeal.” More importantly, this affidavit was not sworn to until eighteen days <em>after </em>the Zoning Board hearing on the appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
