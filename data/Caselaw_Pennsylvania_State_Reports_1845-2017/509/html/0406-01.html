A new trial was commenced before a jury presided over by the Honorable Albert F. Sabo, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, on December 5, 1979. The jury returned its verdict of guilty on December 12, 1979, and Motions for New Trial and in Arrest of Judgment were denied on July 28, 1980, whereupon Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment and this appeal followed.</p>

Officer McNally arrived at 9:25 a.m., and was told by the neighbors that on the ninth, at about 10:00 a.m., they had heard an argument and screams coming from the Silo residence. They stated that Appellant and his mother had lived there together for many years. They saw the Appellant come outside at about 2:40 p.m., on the ninth, and sit on the porch steps. Soon, he was taken by a rescue squad vehicle to the nearby John F. Kennedy Hospital for treatment of chest pains.</p>
    <p id="b476-8" data-blocks='[["BL_476.7",476,[264,1843,1139,308]],["BL_477.1",477,[156,322,1139,94]]]'>The neighbors were concerned because they had not seen Mrs. Silo leave for work at her usual time, around 3:00 p.m., on the ninth, and that an upstairs window had been open all night, although it was Mrs. Silo’s habit to close it.

    <p id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.5",477,[153,771,1141,576]]]'>Armed with these facts, Officer McNally concluded that exigent circumstances existed which required that he get into the house as quickly as possible to aid Mrs. Silo if she were there and unable to help herself. He arranged by phone with hospital personnel to get Appellant’s key, went to the hospital, picked up the key, called for back-up assistance, and returned to the house by 10:00 a.m. and, with other police officers and detectives who had since arrived, entered the Silo home. Once in the house, they discovered the body of Mrs. Silo lying on the kitchen floor amidst a pool of blood. She had been stabbed repeatedly.</p>

We have carefully reviewed each of these challenges and, finding no merit in any of Appellant’s arguments, affirm the sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
