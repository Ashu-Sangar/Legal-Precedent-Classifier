The first order established timetables for the reduction of the prison population and the elimination of double and triple-celling of inmates. The second held the appellants in contempt for noncompliance with those schedules and imposed monetary sanctions. Our review herein is limited to a determination of the proper standard to employ when adjudging whether the overcrowding of prison inmates amounts to cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. U.S. Const. Amend. VIII. For the reasons which follow, we must vacate the contempt order and remand this matter to the Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings.</p>

In February 1971 five (5) prisoners in the Philadelphia prison system filed a class action in equity against City officials<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas seeking injunctive relief from conditions of confinement alleged to violate the prisoners’ constitutional and statutory rights. A three (3) judge panel heard extensive testimony and, on <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>April 7, 1972 issued an opinion and decree <em>nisi </em>holding that the prisoners’ conditions of confinement violated their constitutional and statutory rights<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and amounted to cruel and unusual punishment under the federal and state constitutions. The panel’s conclusion that conditions in the prison system were unconstitutional was based upon findings of overcrowding coupled with inadequate facilities and staff. Specifically, it was found that cells were drafty, cold, damp, dirty and infested with roaches and other vermin; that a shortage of guards increased the danger of assault; that an effective inmate classification system was lacking; that personal hygiene, medical and psychiatric needs were inadequately attended to; that food served did not provide adequate nutrition; and that drug addicts suffering withdrawal symptoms were not given proper treatment. The panel ordered the defendants to take immediate action to improve conditions and, in addition, ordered the appointment of a special master to assist the court in fashioning appropriate relief. After the defendants’ exceptions had been dismissed and the decree made final, the defendants appealed to the Commonwealth Court. That court affirmed the denial of exceptions except as to the portion of the decree providing for the appointment of a master. <em>Hendrick v.

We limited our jurisdiction in this appeal to the "one man, one cell" issue and confined the arguments of the parties thereto, therefore we cannot make a final determination as to any of the other matters involved in the June 22, 1984 order, <em>see supra </em>n. 5, without affording the parties the opportunity to first raise those additional issues in the Court of Common Pleas. Moreover, in view of the nature of the subject matter, the fact that this cause has existed to date fourteen years is not of serious significance. Any change of circumstance which may occur requires a continuing review of equitable degrees which are designed to apply over a long period of time.</p>

As the Majority aptly sets forth, this case has been in litigation for over fourteen years. In that time a more than ample record has been produced from which we can evaluate and determine a constitutional violation. My review of the record indicates that although a constitutional violation may have been present at the inception of this litigation, as the matter now stands, it is clear that the conditions of the prison system do not reach constitutional infirmity. Accordingly, I see no basis or necessity for remanding this matter for further proceedings.</p>

The majority has wrongly chosen to believe Appellants’ version of the basis for the June 22, 1984, order which imposed a population cap on inmate population: that it is based on a “one man, one cell” principal, and that no constitutional or statutory basis exists for the decision. Appellees’ contention that the trial court, in all the hearings and opinions herein, applied a “totality of the circumstances” standard for the purpose of alleviating unconstitutional conditions is supported by the record. Appellants’ contention that the “one man, one cell” standard was applied is in error.</p>

Throughout this lengthy history, appellate courts have continually upheld the equitable powers of the trial court in their attempts to implement a structured population cap in the prison systems.</p>

Regardless of whether the standard was explicitly reviewed through these multitudinous appellate appearances, it is time to end this litigation. The majority’s statement that no appellate ruling exists in this case on the question of a statutorily or constitutionally required “one man, one cell” standard should not be the basis for our opinion or a remand order. The record discloses a “totality of the circumstances” argument was employed in the decision to implement a population cap among the inmates. This fact alone is sufficient for our Court to exercise a “hands off” policy, particularly where the trial court has dealt very competently in handling the inadequate conditions of the prison system.</p>
