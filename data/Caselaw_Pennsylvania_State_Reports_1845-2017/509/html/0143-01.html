      <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>In the spring of 1974, appellee met with an agent of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to discuss an audit of South-side’s 1973 corporate income tax return which appellee had prepared. The agent indicated that Southside owed additional tax liability for 1973 but made an offer to accept a bribe of $1,500 in return for a. “no-change” audit. In July, 1974, appellee related this offer to the owners of Southside and advised them that, in his opinion, it would be cheaper to pay the bribe than to risk the additional tax liability. Appellee did not conduct an independent review of the 1973 tax return or of the IRS audit to determine the exact amount of any additional tax liability.</p>

At the request of the IRS, he agreed to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of the errant IRS agent and others. His cooperation included wearing a “body wire” to tape record several conversations. As a result of appellee’s cooperation, two IRS agents pleaded guilty to criminal charges in federal district court. Appellee also testified in federal court in 1976, under a grant of immunity, against his former business partner, Stanley Stein, who was convicted of federal charges. For obvious reasons, the partnership had dissolved and appellee began a sole proprietorship in 1975.</p>

In prosecuting this disciplinary action, the Board reviewed appellee’s testimony from the 1976 federal jury trial and learned, for the first time, of appellee’s participation in the 1974 bribery involving Southside. On September 16, 1981, the Board issued a citation and notice of hearing to appellee, charging him with violations of section <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>9.9a of the C.P.A.

Appellee’s answer additionally asserted the affirmative defense of laches, stating that he “will be severely prejudiced in his defense and in raising vital mitigating circumstances, because of the passage of over seven (7) years since the occurrence of the events set forth in the citation.” Appellee also requested the Board to consider the “vital mitigating factors” in determining the “ultimate discipline to be imposed,” including that “his prior single incident of professional misconduct does not adversely reflect on his current fitness to practice ... accounting” and his “staunch cooperation with the prosecuting authorities ____”</p>

Appellee testified at this hearing and admitted that he had delivered the bribe money to the IRS agent on behalf of Southside and had kept $500 of the money for himself. He also acknowledged that his testimony in the 1976 trial was truthful and accurate. In his defense, however, appellee testified as to his voluntary cooperation in the IRS investigation. He was not able to recall all of the details of that cooperation, nor were the IRS agents involved in the investigation able to recall details of appellee’s participation or locate the IRS files involved.</p>

Law and the rules of professional conduct promulgated by the Board, and ordered that appellee’s certificate and permit to practice accounting be suspended for one year. The Board rejected appellee’s defense of laches, holding that there was not undue delay in initiating the disciplinary proceeding and that appellee was not prejudiced in his defense by the delay because, despite the lack of complete recall on the part of appellee and the IRS agents, the Board fully accepted appellee's assertions as to his voluntary cooperation in the IRS investigation. The Board took into account the lapse of time since appellee’s criminal conduct, his subsequent clear record, and his voluntary cooperation in the IRS investigation in arriving at its “rather lenient sanction” of a one year suspension.</p>

Appellee has not demonstrated a lack of due diligence on the part of the Board in initiating this disciplinary action. Appellee concedes that the Board did not actually learn of his misconduct until 1980 during the disciplinary proceeding against his former partner and that the Board acted promptly thereafter. However, the Commonwealth Court accepted appellee’s argument that the Board should be charged with knowledge of his participation in the 1974 bribery misconduct because of the public nature of his testimony in the 1976 federal prosecution of his former partner.</p>

Stein had been prosecuted in 1976, and that Weinberg had testified at Stein’s public trial.” 76 Pa.Cmwlth. 216, <a href="/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%201210" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="463 A.2d 1210">463 A.2d at 1212</a>. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the 1976 federal trial was so notorious or the publicity (if any) so pervasive that the Board should have been aware of the trial and of appellee’s testimony given during that trial. There are scores of trial courts in this Commonwealth including all of the courts of common pleas and the federal district courts. To charge the Commonwealth as a matter of law with knowledge of every criminal proceeding in every court, as the Commonwealth Court has done, is unwarranted. Due diligence is a factual determination to be decided under the circumstances of the case, and appellee has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the Board did not act with due diligence. <em>Cf. Heidorn’s Appeal, supra </em>(knowledge of open and conspicuous zoning ordinance violation would be imputed to municipality for purposes of determining whether municipality acted with due diligence in attempting to enforce ordinance) <em>and Commonwealth ex rel. Margiotti v.

The Board fully accepted appellee’s testimony regarding his cooperation in the IRS investigation and considered it a mitigating factor, as is reflected in the rather lenient one year suspension imposed for appellee’s admitted serious misconduct. The faded recollections and unavailable IRS files are inconsequential since the Board completely credited appellee’s testimony in this regard. As to appellee’s third assertion, there is also no prejudice demonstrated. Appellee states that the “lengthy inaction of the Board induced his detrimental reliance” in establishing a sole proprietorship. Brief for Appellee at 22. The short answer to appellee’s assertion is that the Board’s delay could not so have “induced his detrimental reliance” since he established his sole proprietorship in 1975 before he had even testified against his business partner in federal court.

Thomas, </em><a href="/pa/473/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="473 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="1730311" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0193-01">473 Pa. 193</a>, 201, <a href="/pa/473/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="473 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="1730311" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0193-01">373 A.2d 1329</a>, 1333 (1977): “Laches is founded on some change <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>in the condition or relations of the parties which occurs during the period the complainant unreasonably failed to act. (citations omitted) It cannot be based on a change of position taking place before the complainant could have and reasonably should have brought suit.” Appellee’s establishment of his sole proprietorship in 1975 was not induced by the Board’s “inaction”, nor did appellee rely on the Board’s “inaction” to his detriment. The Commonwealth Court erred, therefore, in holding that appellee had been prejudiced by the Board’s delay in instituting disciplinary proceedings.</p>

As the Commonwealth Court in the instant case has pointed out, the Insurance Department has promulgated regulations requiring agents and brokers who have been convicted of, or have plead guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>to charges of “the type of criminal conduct which reflects on the honesty and integrity of the agent or broker”, to report such fact to the Department within ten days. 31 Pa.Code § 33.19(b).

Law and Board regulations. I find the unexplained five-year delay in this case to institute an action against Appellee to constitute a lack of due diligence on the part of the Board.</p>

Since the Board is charged with the responsibility of monitoring the ethical and professional conduct of those it licenses, I believe it has an affirmative duty to keep abreast of public information regarding the unprofessional conduct of those subject to its discipline.</p>

I disagree. Appellee did begin to change his position of opening a sole proprietorship after he began cooperating with the federal authorities and before he testified against his former partner, but had a good reason to rely on the Board’s inaction as indicative of its intent not to take disciplinary action against him. As Commonwealth Court noted:</p>

Weinberg was not prosecuted nor penalized by the IRS for arranging the bribe of Maker. We think that he had reason to believe that the Board had also not acted against him because of his extensive cooperation with the authorities.</blockquote>

Appellee’s change of conditions (confession, grant of immunity, testifying against his old partner and starting a new practice) are all close enough in time to when the Board had an affirmative duty to investigate Appellee and file its own charges against him, that not having done so for five years should act as a bar on their present attempt to discipline him.</p>
