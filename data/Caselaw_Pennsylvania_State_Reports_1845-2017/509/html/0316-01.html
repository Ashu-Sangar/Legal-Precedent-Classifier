Brown to consider the propriety of a Commonwealth Court panel’s affirmance of Sgt. Brown’s dismissal from the Pennsylvania State Police. Sgt. Brown was charged with violating state police field regulations concerning unbecoming conduct, conformance to laws and competence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>facts are aptly set forth in the lower court opinion as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.6",387,[202,430,1098,830]]]'>The first two charges arose out of an incident which occurred on February 23, 1983. Although there is conflicting testimony regarding the events of that evening, substantial evidence supports the board’s findings that during an altercation between Brown and a female acquaintance on a street in the city of Lancaster, Brown engaged in threatening and physically abusive action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">4</a> His actions and loud words prompted people nearby to summon the Lancaster police. Brown argued with the responding officers, who took him into custody for disorderly conduct, but soon released him without filing formal charges. The board concluded (1) that Brown had conducted himself in a manner unbecoming a police officer, and, (2) having engaged in disorderly conduct under section 5503 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, was therefore in violation of the conformance-to-laws field regulation.</blockquote>

We, thus, directed the state police to redesign their disciplinary procedures to prevent the Commissioner’s review of investigative reports in advance of the imposition of discipline.

This argument is without merit. The court-martial board is the body charged with the responsibility to hear all evidence, resolve issues of credibility and make factual findings, 71 P.S. § 251(b)(2) (Supp.1985). Because the Governor’s involvement is limited to review of written statements, he is powerless to resolve the issues of credibility that would necessarily result from being presented with two versions of the underlying incident. Thus, presenting the Governor with the employee’s version of the incident out of which court-martial proceedings are urged cannot further a determination of the question whether seeking the employee’s termination from the force is warranted. As artfully stated by Judge Craig, below: “The Governor’s role at this level is not to weigh conflicting evidence and issue an ultimate adjudication of guilt or innocence, but only to make a preliminary determination as to whether the charges warrant convening the court martial board, analogous to a determination of probable cause to issue an arrest warrant. <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>
      <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 119.

    <p id="b390-8" data-blocks='[["BL_390.8",390,[256,1723,1139,623]],["BL_391.1",391,[194,343,1138,733]]]'>Given that it is the court-martial board which swears witnesses and hears testimony, fact finding in court-martial proceedings is accomplished by the board. The board’s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of discipline are then forwarded to the Commissioner for imposition of appropriate discipline. Under the circumstances, working with only a cold record from the proceeding below, the Commissioner will usually not be in a position to render independent findings of fact. In imposing discipline, however, he must review the record, findings and conclusions of the court-martial board. In connection with his independent review, he could determine that some <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>or all of the findings and conclusions of the board were without support in the record, or resulted from a mistake of law, as could any reviewing court. When the Commissioner imposes discipline, he may disregard the recommendation of the board and render discipline which is either more or less severe than that recommended by the board. His ultimate decision, accepting or rejecting the board’s recommendation, could be based upon an independent policy determination regarding the suitability of the discipline, or upon his determination of the propriety of the findings and conclusions of the board. In either case, unless the Commissioner states the reasons for the imposition of the discipline chosen, the precise basis for that determination is unknown by the employee so disciplined.</p>
    <p id="b391-4" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[192,1098,1140,1149]]]'>2 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 defines “adjudication” as “[a]ny final order, decree, decision, determination or ruling by an agency affecting personal or property rights, privileges, immunities, duties, liabilities or obligations of any or all of the parties to the proceeding____” Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 202, No. 53, § 5 (Supp.1985). Thus, it is obvious that it is the decision of the Commissioner finally imposing discipline in the matter which forms the adjudication in court-martial proceedings. See, <em>Begis v. Industrial Bd. of the Dept. of Labor and Industry, </em><a href="/pa-commw/9/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="9 Pa.

The requirement of § 507, that all adjudications contain the “findings and reasons for the adjudication,” can only be met when the Commissioner’s decision contains a statement whether he adopted the findings and conclusions of the board or made his determination on some other basis. This was not done in this case. Instantly, the Commissioner’s adjudication merely stated whether the board found appellant guilty or not guilty of each of the charges, reiterated the board’s recommendation of dismissal, and ordered that appellant be dismissed. Whether the Commissioner adopted the board’s findings and conclusions is unknown on this record.</p>
