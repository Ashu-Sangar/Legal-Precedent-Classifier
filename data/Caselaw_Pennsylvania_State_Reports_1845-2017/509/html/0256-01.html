This recommitment as a technical violator was founded upon two separate breaches of term and condition 5(c). The first was his assault of a store manager after having been <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>caught by the manager and a security guard trying to steal goods from the store.

We affirm the Commonwealth Court’s resolution of appellant’s challenge to the length of his period of recommitment as a convicted violator. Appellant asserts that the Board violated its own regulations by recommitting him as a convicted parole violator for a period allegedly thirty-eight months in excess of the maximum of the presumptive range for his violation, despite the presence of mitigating factors and without sufficient written justification for going beyond the guidelines. <em>See </em>37 Pa.Code 75.1. Appellant was recommitted as a convicted violator for a period of seventy-eight months. He contends that the maximum period of recommitment within the presumptive range is forty months. This contention is incorrect. Convictions for rape, attempted involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and robbery each have a maximum presumptive range of at least forth months. <em>See </em>37 Pa.Code § 75.2. Each one of these convictions may be considered as a separate parole violation by the Board and the presumptive ranges of each may be aggregated. <em>Corley v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, </em>83 Pa.Cmwlth. 529, <a href="/citations/?q=478%20A.2d%20146" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="478 A.2d 146">478 A.2d 146</a> (1984). Thus, the seventh-eight month period of recommitment was within the presumptive range.</p>
