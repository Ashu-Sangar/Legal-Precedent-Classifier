I am in agreement that the directive of this Court forbidding partisan political activity on the part of any court employee is constitutionally permissible, and that relinquishment of Appellant’s right to run for partisan political office constitutionally could be made a condition of public employment. That determination, however, is not dispositive of the constitutional issue in this case. The Court has not answered nor even addressed the question of what compelling governmental interest is served by further burdening Appellant’s fundamental right of political expression by denying Appellant unemployment compensation benefits. Appellant has established good cause for her “voluntary” termination of this particular position. Appellant did not voluntarily leave employment, she merely left this particular position as she was required to do in order to run for political office. However, she at all times remained in the labor market and available for suitable full-time work. Denying unemployment benefits to Appellant because she was compelled to leave this specific employment in order to exercise her First Amendment Right of political expression clearly constitutes an impermissible restraint. Appellant was required to choose between this job and candidacy. Such compulsion was properly justified on the basis of a compelling governmental interest. However, to deny her unemployment benefits unduly burdens Appellant in the exercise of First Amendment Rights.</p>

The Court fails to address the question of whether the denial of unemployment benefits to judicial employees pursuing elective office impermissibly burdens their fundamental rights of political expression and association. I believe that it does.
