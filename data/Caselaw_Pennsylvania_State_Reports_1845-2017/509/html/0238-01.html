A child, Faith, was born on January 18, 1975. Following marital difficulties, the couple separated on December 12, 1975. Appellant took Faith with her to Aliquippa to live. At the time of the separation, Appellant was three months pregnant with the second child, Victoria, who was born on June 19, 1976. Appellant and the two children resided at the home of her parents in Aliquippa until January, 1981, at which time Appellant remarried.

The Appellee and the Appellant were divorced by a decree of the Court of Polk County, Wisconsin, dated November 4, 1976, effective October 26, 1976. The Appellee remarried on April 30, 1977, and he and his present wife have continued to reside on the Wisconsin dairy farm.

That child has now been adopted by the Appellee following involuntary termination proceedings in Wisconsin against that child’s natural father. Appellee and his present wife also have two children of their present marriage.

On March 15, 1977, the Appellee filed a petition with the Orphans’ Court for a writ of habeas corpus for the two children, reciting inter alia, the decree of divorce of the Wisconsin Court, which included an order that the custody of the two children should be in the Appellee. A hearing was held on April 20, 1977 at which time Appellant also served a complaint of support against Appellee. Following a pre-hearing conference, the lower court concluded that the Wisconsin Court had no jurisdiction with regard to the custody of the two children and that it would be inappropriate to give the order of that court full faith and credit. Subsequent to that hearing, the parties and their attorneys agreed to an arrangement for the custody and visitation of the children whereby the custody would remain in the natural mother, with liberal visitation for the Appellee in Wisconsin. The agreement also provided that the Appellee would post a $1,500 cash bond to guarantee compliance with the return of the children from Wisconsin to Pennsylvania and further that the Appellee would comply with an agreed upon support order. That support order involved the payment of $130 per month for the two children.</p>

The court, however, concluded that the contents of the order were in fact the result of an agreement. The court further found that the Appellee remained in the Butler area during the day of April 21, 1977, and that the custody orders were signed and delivered on that day to the attorney for Appellee. Neither Appellee nor his attorney requested any further hearing on the matter and did not appeal the orders of April 21, 1977. Appellee completely ignored those orders by failing to provide any support for <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>his children and further by failing to visit or attempt to visit his two children.</p>

His testimony indicated he is the owner of a 360-acre farm worth $150,000 with a house, dairy barn, loading barn, shop and three silos. His 182 cattle are valued at $40,000 and his equipment at $65,000, bringing the total value of assets in his dairy business to $255,000. Against this, Appellee averred that he had debts of $235,000. His gross income in 1977 was $65,000; in 1978 it was $70,000; and his estimated gross income for 1982 was $60,000. He averred that his expenses would exceed his income in 1982. Approximately ten years prior to the date of the termination proceedings, he had purchased his farm from his grandmother for $30,000 and the equipment for $22,000. He paid for each of these in cash. During those ten years, he has improved his dairy farm buildings, constructed a new shop building, installed three silos, and substantially renewed and expanded his farm equipment. Also, the court found he had properly maintained and supported his second wife and the three children of that marriage. From this the court specifically concluded that with the assets and cash flow of his business, he had the ability to pay the $130 per month toward the support of his first two children. The court went on to note that at his request, Appellee’s present wife has sent each of the two children small gifts on their birthdays and at Christmas, but that none of these gifts were of any value for support or maintenance. It was Appellee’s testimony that he did not try to visit the two children subsequent to the visitation of April 21, 1977, because he was afraid of being found in contempt of the Orphans’ Court’s order with respect to support. He made one telephone call to Faith, the older daughter, on January 18, 1979, her fourth birthday, and he was allowed to visit with her by telephone. He made no other calls and has sent no correspondence to either child. <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>The court specifically found that while Appellee testified that he was unable to raise and deposit the $1,500 cash compliance bond provided for in the visitation order of the court, he made no attempt to request the court modify the order due to his alleged financial circumstances. The court further found that Appellee had been able to afford legal services to terminate the rights of the natural father of the child of his second wife and to adopt that child. From this the court concluded that Appellee was well aware that a natural father who does not fulfill his parental duties may have his parental rights terminated.</p>

Additionally, while complaining of the great distance between himself and his children and his lack of funds to bridge that distance, he never attempted to communicate with his children on a regular basis through the relatively inexpensive means of personalized letters and photographs. Indeed, his only arguable contact with his children was indirect in that on several occasions he forwarded small gifts purchased by his second wife and later small amounts of money to Appellant for the purpose of purchasing Christmas or birthday gifts; failing even then to take the time to attempt to personalize the relationship by chosing the gifts himself.</p>
