The [appellant] filed an application for Unemployment Benefits which was denied by the local office of Employment Services (OES) under Section 402(e) of the Unemployment Compensation Law (Act). Mr. Peak filed an appeal and a hearing was held before Referee Paul Sneed at which the employer, [appellant] and several witnesses testified.</blockquote>

The employer permitted Peak a one hour lunch break which [appellant] could take at his discretion. (NT p. 10) In November or December, 1981, Peak and Russell Hedland, a co-worker went to lunch together leaving an inexperienced employee at the warehouse. (NT p. 27) After learning of this, the employer instructed Peak and Hedland not to leave the warehouse unless there was an experienced employee available to watch it. (NT pp. 28, <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>35) Four months later, on March 17, 1982, Peak and Hedland again went to lunch together.

The employer, on the other hand, contends that he told Peak and Hedland many times that when one went out to lunch, the other must remained behind.

Nevertheless, both the Board and the referee determined that these reasons were not causes of a necessitous and compelling nature. We reversed, holding that, in the absence of proof that construction workers customarily moved about on such jobs, the uncertainty of steady work coupled with the expenses of traveling and staying within a reasonable commuting distance of the job site, were “cause[s] of a necessitous and compelling nature” which justified that claimant’s refusal under the language of that section of the Act. 43 P.S. § 802(b) (Supp.1985).</p>

      <em>Treon </em>is readily distinguishable from this case with its conflicting evidence. The Board’s resolution of the conflicting evidence on this record compelled its result. <em>Treon </em>involved the additional issue of whether distance and expense of travel justify refusal of a job offer. That conclusion involved a determination of whether the work offered was “suitable work” under Section 4(t) of the Act, <em>as amended, </em>43 P.S. § 753(t). We determined that work of uncertain duration far removed from home was, unsuitable absent evidence that such relocation was customary in the industry. Here, if the employer’s testimony that he repeatedly told this claimant not to take lunch at the same time as one of his co-employees is believed, the conclusion, that he engaged in willful misconduct when he and the co-employee did go to lunch together, follows as a matter of course.</p>

To the extent <em>Treon </em>does impose such a requirement, its purpose is to ensure an adequate basis for judicial review. On this record, the Board’s reason for reversing the referee is plain enough. Unlike the referee, it chose to believe the employer, not the employee. It disagreed with the referee’s factual resolution of conflicting evidence, a power it has under Section 504 of the statute, <em>as amended, </em>43 P.S. § 824 (Supp.1985).</p>

Rather, the referee made a specific finding of fact that the employer had indeed instructed appellant not to take his lunch break with Russell Hedland, but <em>concluded </em>that appellant’s interpretation of these instructions was reasonable.</p>
    <p id="b349-4" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[176,650,1140,672]]]'>It cannot be said, therefore, that the Board substituted its own judgment on a determination that was solely one of credibility of witnesses and resolution of conflicting testimony. In reversing the referee’s determination, the Board expressly adopted the referee’s <em>findings </em>that the employer had specifically instructed appellant not to take his lunch break with Mr. Hedland and that the two employees had believed that their conduct on March 17, 1982 would not violate the employer’s instructions. The Board’s point of departure with the referee’s determination was not, therefore, with his resolution of conflicting testimony but with his conclusion that the employees’ conduct was reasonable. The Board stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b349-5" data-blocks='[["BL_349.5",349,[219,1343,1098,734]]]'>The claimant was discharged for violating a direct order from his employer that he should not take a lunch break at the same time as another employe ... and there is nothing in the record to show that he had good cause for his violation. <em>While the Referee granted benefits on the theory that the claimant was not unreasonable in interpreting that the employer meant only that the warehouse should be properly covered, the Board does not agree with this reasoning. The employer’s instructions were specific and the claimant did not have authority to decide who was capable of covering the warehouse. </em>The Board can find no justification for his substitution of his judgment for his employer’s [judgment] ____</blockquote>

This was well within the powers of the Board under the Unemployment Compensa<a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>tion Law to modify or reverse a determination of the referee on the basis of the evidence previously submitted. 43 P.S. § 824. Since the issue of the authority of the Board to substitute its judgment of credibility of a witness for that of the referee’s is not before us, the majority’s discussion and resolution of the issue is, in effect, an advisory opinion which I do not subscribe to.</p>
