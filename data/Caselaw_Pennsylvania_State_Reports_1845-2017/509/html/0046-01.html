They left in Clawson’s pick-up truck; Clawson was driving. As the pair travelled on County Line Road, on the border of Fayette and Westmoreland Counties, Rose noticed <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>two people standing at the right edge of the road, near John Coccioletti’s cabin. There is no indication in the record that Rose could identify these individuals. An instant after passing them, Rose heard a loud “bang”. Clawson slumped over and lost control of the truck. It left the highway, and crashed into a tree. After the truck stopped, Rose saw a hole in the back of Clawson’s head. Pathological investigation showed that a bullet of unknown caliber had passed through Clawson’s head and caused his death. Evidence showed that the bullet was fired from the right and rear of Clawson at a slightly lower elevation, roughly at the location where the two individuals • were standing. Two spent .45 caliber shells were found at the berm of the road; ballistic evidence showed that they came from a gun registered to Coccioletti.</p>

He drove them to Coccioletti’s cabin and took the keys to their vehicle. Coccioletti’s cabin is located on County Line Road in the vicinity where Clawson was shot. Shortly after returning to Seven Springs Eckels got a call from appellee. Appellee asked Eckels to come back to the cabin because “John’s going crazy.

The majority held that since the inculpatory statements that counsel hoped to exclude were admitted, his strategy was no longer valid. At this point, Superior Court reasoned, counsel and client had nothing to lose by putting appellee on the stand. Through appellee the exculpatory statements “John’s going crazy. He took the .44 and went outside” could be introduced; and, since appellee had no prior convictions and a good reputation, he could not be easily damaged. Thus, it found counsel’s fear that appellee would not perform well and his desire to keep the record clean for appeal meritless. We granted the Commonwealth’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>
