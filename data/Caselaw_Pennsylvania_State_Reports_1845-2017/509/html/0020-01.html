In <em>Whitaker, </em>this Court first addressed the manner of computing time under Rule 1100 in a matter which was voluntarily terminated by the Commonwealth. There, with two days left for the commencement of trial within the period prescribed in Rule 1100, the Commonwealth moved for leave to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>on grounds it had no admissible evidence with which to prosecute the case. The lack of evidence resulted from suppression of certain of appellee’s statements to police and the unexpected refusal of a co-defendant to testify. This Court rejected the Commonwealth’s suggestion that a <em>nolle prosequi </em>should toll the running of the speedy trial time period specified in Rule 1100. Instead, we held that, on the record in <em>Whitaker, </em>the <em>nolle prosequi </em>“was simply an effort to gain an extension of the time period during which [the Commonwealth] was required to bring [the defendant] to trial,” <em>Commonwealth v. Whitaker, <a href="/pa/467/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="467 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1717283" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0436-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/467/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="467 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1717283" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0436-01">467 Pa. at 443</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="467 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1717283" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0436-01">359 A.2d at 177</a>, and, as such, was an impermissible substitute for compliance with the extension of time provision of Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(c). We ruled that the speedy trial period should be computed from the date of the complaint, and that Whitaker’s trial was, ultimately, untimely.</p>

Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/487/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="487 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1759043" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0197-01">487 Pa. 197</a>, 204, <a href="/pa/487/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="487 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1759043" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0197-01">409 A.2d 308</a>, 311 (1979) (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, where a prosecution is voluntarily terminated, and the record shows an attempt to manipulate or evade the requirements of Rule 1100, the speedy trial time period will be computed from the date of the original complaint. But where the record does not show that the Commonwealth’s termination of the prosecution was designed to manipulate or evade the requirements of Rule 1100, the time for computing the speedy trial period runs from the date of the later' complaint.</p>

The charges against appellant were withdrawn because, due to the victim’s inability to identify appellant, the Commonwealth suddenly found itself unable to establish a prima facie case at the preliminary hearing. Although, as noted <em>supra, </em>the precise reason why appellant’s co-actor was unavailable to testify at the preliminary hearing is not in the record before us, absent some support in the record for the conclusion the Commonwealth’s motion to dismiss was motivated by an intent to evade Rule 1100, we will not presume such a motive. <em>Quod fieri debet facile praesumitur. </em>As the record shows that the Commonwealth’s motion to dismiss was based on lack of evidence and not any bad faith, the time for computing the speedy <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>trial period under Rule 1100 is properly calculated from the date of the second complaint.</p>
