That Act provided immediate salary increases to commissioners, sheriffs, treasurers, controllers and auditors, part-time district attorneys, recorders of deeds, registers of wills, prothonotaries and clerks of courts, coroners and jury commissioners of counties of the second through eighth classes “when permitted <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>by the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” In 1978, appellees brought an action in mandamus to compel appellants, Snyder County’s commissioners and treasurer, to pay appellees increases in salary in accordance with Act 223. Appellants defended the action on the ground that mid-term salary raises to county officers contravened Art. Ill § 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. That provision states: “No law shall extend the term of any public officer, or increase or diminish his salary or emoluments, after his election or appointment.” Similar disputes had arisen elsewhere in the Commonwealth; and, in reliance upon a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County, on November 21, 1978, Common Pleas Court held PA.

      <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>The term “res judicata” is often sweepingly used, by courts and litigants alike, to refer to the various ways in which a judgment in one action will have a binding effect in a later action. “Res judicata” encompasses the modern principle of issue preclusion (traditionally known as estoppel), which is the common law rule that a final judgment forecloses relitigation in a later action involving at least one of the original parties, of an issue of fact or law which was actually litigated and which was necessary to the original judgment. <em>State Hospital for Criminal Insane v. Consolidated Water Supply Co., </em><a href="/pa/267/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="267 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="1057765" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0029-01">267 Pa. 29</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.%20281" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="110 A. 281">110 A. 281</a> (1920).

One is the concept that the outcomes of similar legal disputes between the same parties at different points in time should not be disparate. The other is that the outcomes of similar legal disputes being contemporaneously determined between different parties should be resolved according to the same legal standards. Applying issue preclusion invokes the first of these concepts, treating temporally separated controversies the same way at the expense of applying different legal standards to persons similarly situated at the time of the second litigation. The problem is illustrated by the situation where a taxpayer’s liability for tax in a certain transaction in one tax year is determined according to a particular interpretation of the tax law, and that interpretation is thereafter abandoned in favor of another interpretation. If issue preclusion is applied in a subsequent tax year, the taxpayer will receive treatment different from that accorded to other taxpayers similarly situated at that time. On the other hand, refusing to apply issue preclusion invokes the second concept of equality. Thus, in the situation posed, if the taxpayer’s liability in subsequent years is determined according to the new interpretation of the law, the taxpayer will be treated in those years in the same way as other taxpayers but in a way inconsistent with the determination previously made with respect to him. Comparable problems can arise in other types of transactions in which the same fact pattern presents itself in adjudications occurring over the course of time.</blockquote>

The action of mandamus, while denominated an action at law, is subject to equitable considerations as are also all petitions to open a judgment. Since our decision in <em>Bakes v.

It would be equally inequitable to require the county to pay salary increases which are unconstitutional. Therefore, I believe the original decision does not constitute the law of the case insofar as the continuing payments are concerned and that <em>res judicata </em>is inapplicable to them. I note that this view, on the facts of this case, is consistent with Restatement of Judgments 2d, § 328, and join the majority’s disposition.</p>
