In that case, we declined to recognize a common law absolute privilege, just as the General Assembly has declined to do in the instant case by providing exceptions in the statute. In <em>Matter of Pittsburgh, </em>we gave what we were asked, to wit, inspection of communications between the victim and personnel of PAAR. Now we are asked for the right to inspect the entire file. The rationale for such a request is the same rationale underlying the right granted in <em>Matter of Pittsburgh, </em>to inspect prior statements of a victim or witness.

The majority in <em>PAAR, </em>therefore, did conduct a “careful balance” of competing interests, including the Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses, and limited defense counsel’s access to the rape crisis counselor’s files as outlined above. Defense counsel was not permitted to rummage through the files for any “matters that could be helpful”, but was only permitted to inspect statements which defense counsel had specifically requested and which the trial court identified as substantially verbatim accounts of the victim, an item (prior statements) that has traditionally been available and highly beneficial to the defendant for use in cross-examining a witness. The need by the defendant for such specific information contained in PAAR’s files was felt to outweigh the victim’s and Commonwealth’s interests in maintaining confidentiality, but the <em>in camera </em>procedures set forth in <em>PAAR </em>were carefully crafted to tread as lightly as possible upon that confidentiality and to extract only that specific information requested by counsel and historically recognized as necessary and beneficial in the cross-examining of witnesses.</p>

In the majority’s view, the Sixth Amendment “counters” (the right to confront adverse witnesses and to compulsory process of witnesses) are so heavy as to require unrestricted access by a defendant to scrutinize an entire confidential file in the possession of a child protective service agency <em>merely </em>because the defendant has vaguely suggested that there may be material in there that <em>could be </em>helpful.

Trial, November 7, 1979 at 81-82, 105-106. Counsel was permitted to cross-examine the victim at length about the incident of September, 1978.

Appellee was present in another room of their residence when the CWS investigator questioned the victim.

Defense counsel sought to impeach the witness by introducing evidence of his juvenile burglary record and his probationary status, not to impeach his credibility generally but to cast the suspicion for the burglary of the safe to Green himself, and to indicate a motive for testifying against Davis.

However, we cannot determine on the record before us whether the September, 1978 incident involved sexual assault, or whether the CWS files which appellee sought to inspect related to that incident or any incident(s) of sexual assault. The indications that do appear of record are to the contrary. I would instruct the lower court that, if the CWS files in fact pertain to incidents of sexual assault, then the unqualified privilege against <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>disclosure of confidential communications would apply if the terms and provisions of § 5945.1 are otherwise applicable.</p>
    <p id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[176,448,1139,1325]]]'>Finally, I must emphasize my distress over the probable impact of the majority’s decision. In allowing unfettered access to defense attorneys to fish through the files of child protective service agencies, counselors, guardians and parents will not be able to comfort the innocent and abused young victims with the security that the information they tell the agency personnel in confidence will not be scrutinized by their abusers. Nor will the confidentiality of the identity of those reporting suspected child abuse — a critical factor to the success of the Child Protective Services Law— be guaranteed; thus, the neighbor, relative, friend or acquaintance who suspects or witnesses child abuse might well decline to report such abuse if he or she knows that the abuser will be able to discover his or her identity so easily. Permitting review of these records on no more than the barest assertion that they “might be helpful” destroys the confidentiality of the records and thoroughly frustrates the stated legislative purposes “to encourage more complete reporting of suspected child abuse and to ... providfe] rehabilitative services for children and parents involved so as to ensure the child’s well-being and to preserve and stabilize family life wherever appropriate.” 11 P.S. § 2202. I urge the legislature to act swiftly to shore up the confidentiality provisions that have been substantially discarded by the majority today.</p>

In the instant case we do not address the issue of whether the common law would or should recognize an absolute privilege for confidential communications between child protective service agency personnel and abused children, for the legislature has spoken and has created a qualified privilege against disclosure of confidential records maintained by child protective service agencies.</p>

While I find it unlikely that any of the information in the CWS file is relevant to issues raised in the trial, I accept the Superior Court’s explanation as to its <em>arguable </em>relevance. That court stated “that in view of the fact that Jeannette was permitted to testify that the sexual abuse had been going on for about four years, statements made by her regarding abuse at the time of the CWS examination are at least potentially relevant.”</p>
