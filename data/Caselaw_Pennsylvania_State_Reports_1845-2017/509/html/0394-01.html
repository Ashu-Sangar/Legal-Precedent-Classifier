Even then, it was acknowledged that the issue could not properly be considered except in the context of ineffective assistance of prior counsel for failure to raise it. Indeed, post-trial counsel apparently abandoned the argument that his predecessors had been ineffective, neither raising it in his brief nor arguing it to the court. Such action was, of course, eminently reasonable in light of the state of the law at the time of counsel’s representation. Because <em>Williams </em>had not been decided at the time the motion to suppress was filed, first counsel could not be deemed ineffective for failure to anticipate its effect, <em>Commonwealth v. Triplett, </em><a href="/pa/476/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="476 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1736902" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0083-01">476 Pa. 83</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="476 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1736902" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0083-01">381 A.2d 877</a> (1977); and because <em>Miller </em>was the controlling precedent at the time of post-trial motions, second and third counsel cannot be faulted for not pursuing efforts to have <em>Williams </em>applied retroactively.</p>

It is recognized that <em>Johnson </em>was a federal case arising out of the Central District of California. It would be erroneous, however, to view that decision as simply an exercise of the Supreme Court’s supervisory power over federal courts not binding on us. By its terms, <em>Johnson </em>applies to “all cases.” Although hardly a paradigm of clarity, the Opinion in <em>Johnson </em>offers several indications that state as well as federal cases are contemplated. <em>See, e.g., </em><a href="/us/457/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="457 U.S. 537" data-case-ids="6191611" data-case-paths="/us/457/0537-01">457 U.S. at 557, n. 17</a>, <a href="/us/457/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="457 U.S. 537" data-case-ids="6191611" data-case-paths="/us/457/0537-01">102 S.Ct. at 2591, n. 17</a>; <a href="/us/457/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="457 U.S. 537" data-case-ids="6191611" data-case-paths="/us/457/0537-01">457 U.S. at 562, n. 20</a>, <a href="/us/457/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="457 U.S. 537" data-case-ids="6191611" data-case-paths="/us/457/0537-01">102 S.Ct. at 2594, n. 20</a>. More to the point, in an analogous situation not involving the Fourth Amendment the Court recently reversed the Louisiana Supreme Court which had refused to give retroactive effect to a United States Supreme Court decision filed while the case was pending appeal in the state court. <em>Shea v.
