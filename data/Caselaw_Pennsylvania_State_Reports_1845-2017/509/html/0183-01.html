I write separately to voice my disagreement with the holding of the Majority that the classification of speed timing devices is a question of law. In my view, this is a pure question of fact as clearly set out in the explanation of the expert witness, Tolbert V. Prowell. It is a fact that the ESP machine contains electronic components, thus making it an electronic device. An electric light switch, which turns lights on and off, has no electronic components. It is, therefore, an electrical device. These are facts and no legal theories are needed to answer the question.</p>

We are not here faced with a challenge to the accuracy of this device nor is it questioned that this is an approved timing device under section 3368(d), 75 Pa.C.S. § 3368(d).
