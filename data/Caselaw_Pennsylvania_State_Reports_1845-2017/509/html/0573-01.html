Keller, be disbarred from the practice of law in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Board found, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(3) (illegal conduct involving moral turpitude) and Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(4) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After hearing testimony in the matter, the Hearing Committee recommended the imposition of the sanction of disbarment. The Board, after review of the entire matter, adopted that recommendation and recommended further that Respondent be ordered to pay the cost of the investigation and prosecution of this matter. Pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Disciplinary Enforcement (“Pa.R.D. E.”) 208(e) we are now called upon to determine the appropriate sanction, if any, to be imposed in this matter. For the following reasons we are constrained to conclude that the sanction of disbarment is appropriate and, therefore, accept the recommendation of the Board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Respondent was represented throughout by counsel. The report of the Hearing Committee was filed January 25, 1985 in which the Hearing Committee adopted sixty findings of fact proposed by the Petitioner and nine findings of fact proposed by the Respondent. The Hearing Committee concluded that Respondent violated ten disciplinary rules including DR 1-102(A)(3) and DR 1-102(A)(4). The Committee recommended to the Board that Respondent be disbarred.</p>

In its Conclusions of Law the Board, <em>inter alia, </em>affirmed the conclusion reached by the Hearing Committee that Respondent had violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(3) and 1-102(A)(4).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Briefs were filed by both parties in this Court and Respondent timely filed a request pursuant to Pa.R.D.E. 208(e)(2) requesting oral argument which was granted.

It is alleged that Respondent deposited that check with the forged endorsement in his trust account and thereafter converted those proceeds to his own use. Further, Respondent commingled his own funds with entrusted funds to make restitution from his trust account for the monies due to Miriam Scheetz. Finally, Respondent misrepresented to his client, the Administrator of the Estate, the cause for Ms. Scheetz’s not having promptly received said monies.</p>

Respondent neglected to pay those obligations for which the funds were being held in a timely fashion.

This argument, as will be seen from our discussion, is a little more than a transparent makeway. The real defense in this matter is the contention that this misconduct would not have occurred but for the serious mental and emotional disfunction that Respondent was experiencing during the period of time in which this misconduct occurred. Respondent is in fact urging that the sanction of disbarment, in view of his emotional condition at the time, is too harsh a <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>result and has urged this Court to consider the imposition of a period of suspension.</p>

These are the two most severe types of discipline that this Court is empowered to impose for misconduct by a member of our bar.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Both of these punishments involve the withdrawal of the offending attorney’s privilege to practice law before the courts of this Commonwealth. Suspension is the withdrawal of the privilege of practicing law for a specified period not to exceed five years. Disbarment requires the withdrawal of the privilege for at least five years. <em>See </em>Pa.R.D.E. 218(b).</p>

There is a qualitative difference between these sanctions. Although reinstatement is provided for in the case of suspension (exceeding three months) and disbarment, Pa.R.D.E. 218, the entitlement to reinstatement under the two sanctions is materially different. In the case of suspension the withdrawal of the privilege to practice law is for a specified period of time. After the expiration of that period a suspended attorney can resume the practice of law upon a demonstration of his or her fitness to practice. In contrast, where disbarment has been imposed, the length of the withdrawal of the privilege <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>to practice law has not been previously determined. In disbarment the only expression as to the length of the withdrawal of the license to practice is that it must extend for a period of at least five years.</p>

In the case of disbarment there is no basis for an expectation by the disbarred attorney of the right to resume practice at some future point in time.

As a result of this breakup, Respondent’s mental and emotional well-being was substantially impaired and thereafter he began exhibiting irrational behavior daily, continuing throughout the period encompassing the charges against him. Additionally, Respondent’s witness, Dr. John C. Turoczi, a psychologist who had treated him for over a two-year period, testified that Respondent’s emotional condition at the time the violations occurred was such that he was delusionary, irrational, and not responsible for his errant behavior.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

It is clear that he was aware that the estate check entrusted to him was the property of Ms. Scheetz and that he had no personal interest in it. When he used these funds his comments to Ms. Aaron reflect his awareness of guilt. The misrepresentations made to excuse his delay in turning the funds over further evidence a deliberative quality which would justify a finding of accountability for this conduct. The same awareness is reflected in the Molinaro’s matter. In this instance there was no question that Respondent merely held this money as stake holder without any personal interest in that fund. He placed it in his trust account and allowed these funds to be disipated to the detriment of those individuals entitled to these monies. There is no suggestion of a delusion that would have caused Respondent not to be aware of his responsibility in this regard. If in fact this was a result of the irrational behavior ascribed to Respondent by his medical expert, Respondent’s response when a complaint was filed would appear to attest to the theraputic effect of the disciplinary process, which would be lost if we were to accept Respondent’s contention that he should be held blameless for these derelictions.</p>

These serious breaches of trust cannot be ignored because of the mitigating circumstances offered by Respondent in his defense. It is to Respondent’s credit that he recognized that he was in trouble and sought professional help. However, he also had the responsibility to protect his clients’ interests during this period, such as associating with another counsel who could assist in the handling of these matters.
