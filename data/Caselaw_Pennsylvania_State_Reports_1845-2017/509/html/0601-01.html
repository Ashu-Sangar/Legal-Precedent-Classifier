This Court held that this silence constituted a waiver of Rule 1100 until the announced trial date. The waiver was held to be informed and voluntary since defendant had already expressly and validly waived his rights under Rule 1100 for a period of time at a prior date, and it was beyond question that when the new trial date was set the defendant already understood the nature and scope of his Rule 1100 rights, as well as the consequences of waiving those rights. A defendant has no right to mislead the court and the Commonwealth as to the suitability of a particular trial date once that date has been set. <em><a href="/pa/497/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="497 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="1775308" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0007-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/497/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="497 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="1775308" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0007-01">497 Pa. at 11-12</a>, <a href="/pa/497/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="497 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="1775308" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0007-01">438 A.2d at 594</a>.</p>

My disagreement with the majority’s summary disposition of these cases in no way involves consideration of the ultimate merits of the Commonwealth’s claim that a Brown-type waiver of defendant’s Rule 1100 rights occurred. The incomplete records evidence scenarios in which a waiver could have occurred, but until the relevant transcripts are made a part of the appellate record or it is determined that transcripts of the relevant proceeding cannot be made available to supplement the record, there is no legitimate basis upon which to decide the merits of the issue.</p>
