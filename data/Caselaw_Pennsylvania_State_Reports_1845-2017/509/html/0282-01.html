      <em> </em>The Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County, in arriving at an order of equitable distribution in the course of these divorce proceedings, held that three rings given by appellee husband to appellant wife were a part of the marital property and subject to equitable distribution. A divided Superior Court panel, <a href="/pa-super/331/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="331 Pa.

The couple separated in October 1976 after several years of marital disharmony. On August 5, 1980, the husband instituted an action for divorce under Section 201(d) of the Divorce Code. The wife counterclaimed for equitable distribution of the marital property, alimony, alimony pendente lite, and counsel fees. The case was referred to a Master. He recommended a divorce and then held separate hearings on the economic issues. The court considered his report and granted the divorce on May 4, 1981. However, a decision on the other matters did not occur until June 7, 1982, when Common Pleas entered various orders dealing with the financial aspects of this divorce. These latter orders are the subject of this appeal. In them, Common Pleas ordered that the marital property <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>be split, with 56% awarded to the husband and 44% to the wife. The court also ordered the husband to pay the wife rehabilitative alimony for a future period of three years for the specific purpose of covering educational expenses, not to exceed $2,750 per year. The court refused to award alimony pendente lite, but did award appellant wife counsel fees and costs of $3,910.00. On appeal, Superior Court affirmed.

Nothing in the statutory definition excludes gifts between spouses, nor does their special nature require exclusion. The words “bequest, devise or descent” following the term “gift” in the phrase modifying and limiting this excluded property do not show us an intent to limit this exclusion to property received from a third person.

For example, § 401(e)(2) allows spouses to exclude specific properties from the pool of marital property by agreement. § 401(e)(3). A contrary interpretation including inter-spousal gifts as marital property would deprive § 401(e)(2) of much of its meaning.</p>

She said that she based her valuation on the property’s use as two separate residential parcels, although it would be better suited for a subdivision if sewer hook-ups were available.

Having concluded that the three rings were a gift properly excepted from the definition of "marital property” under § 401(e)(3), we need not discuss their valuation. The record discloses that an appraisal of these items found them to be worthless. They have no material impact on the economic circumstances of the parties which the court should consider under § 401(d)(10) over and above the necessary effect of their elimination from the pool of marital property and the items charged against the wife’s share of that pool for property received.</p>

While the giving of a washing machine or other household item may not be the epitome of selfless gallantry, if it is a gift, it is a gift. A gift can be a unique moment in life, the selfless desire to please, to mend a slight, fend a loss, gain an end or to share in the good it will bring to the life of another. The question ought not to be what is the subject or the purpose of the gift, but rather was it intended as a gift, delivered and accepted.</p>
