The case was tried before a jury panel, presided over by the Honorable Lawrence Prattis of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia.

    <p id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[277,555,1143,1622]]]'>The underlying facts, as adduced at trial, establish the following. At the time of the accident appellee, Paul Rimmeir, owned a dilapidated property which adjoined the Sirianni residence. In March, 1977, Rimmeir rented the property to Carmen Fichera under a lease purchase agreement. In accord with this agreement Fichera was permitted to demolish the property. Fichera attempted to tear down the structure, but proceeded in an extremely dangerous manner. Eventually, Fichera abandoned his efforts, leaving the property structurally unsound, but still in the possession of Rimmeir. Thereafter, Rimmeir was advised by a city building inspector that the property constituted an imminent danger and that it would have to be immediately demolished. The City listed the property for emergency demolition and solicited telephone bids from contractors on their emergency demolition list. As a result of this process Nugent Brothers was awarded the bid. This award was made despite the fact that Nugent Brothers did not have proper insurance coverage, and had previously been removed from the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority’s list of approved demolition experts. In addition, there was evidence at trial that Nugent Brothers did not have the necessary qualifications to be on the emergency list at all. Nevertheless, on August 11, 1977, Nugent Brothers began the demolition work, and, but for a cursory visit by a city employee who was to determine when the contractor had begun, the project was permitted to proceed without the presence of a city inspector. The contractor proceeded in a dangerously unprofessional manner, ramming a front end loader into the wall adjoining the Sirianni property, thereby causing the accident.</p>
