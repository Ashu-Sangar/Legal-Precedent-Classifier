    <p id="b276-9" data-blocks='[["BL_276.9",276,[239,971,1163,742]]]'>On November 26, 1976, a vacancy was created in Magisterial District 05-2-13 (City of McKeesport, Allegheny County) by the death of the elected District Justice. Petitioner, Clifford W. Flegal, filed nominating petitions seeking to have his name placed on the 1977 primary ballot as a candidate for this office. Respondent, F. Kenneth Dixon, as Director of the Allegheny County Department of Elections rejected these petitions because petitioner had not completed a course of instruction as required by Sections 502 and 503 of the Magisterial District Reform Act, Act of July 15, 1976, P.L. 1014, No. 204, (42 P.S. §§ 2502, 2503). Petitioner is otherwise qualified to file nominating petitions for the office of District Justice.</p>
    <p id="b276-10" data-blocks='[["BL_276.10",276,[233,1743,1161,586]]]'>Petitioner then filed a Complaint in Mandamus in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County seeking to compel respondent to accept his nominating petitions. This request for relief was denied on March 4, 1977. This appeal, brought pursuant to the Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, Art. II (17 P.S. § 211.205), followed. We reverse the orders of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County and the determination of the Director of the Allegheny County Department of Elections, and order that the nominating petitions of Clifford W. Flegal be accepted.</p>

This implementing legislation is known as the “Magisterial District Reform Act.” Section 502 of that Act provides:</p>

The department shall make the course of instruction available at such times as determined by it and the board, so as to insure that any district justice, to be elected or appointed may qualify to assume office as soon as possible. By regulation the board shall direct the department to conduct the course at such time, at such places and in such manner as it shall prescribe.

Any such interested person who successfully completes the course and passes the examination shall secure an appropriate certificate from the department and file same as set forth in section 505.”</blockquote>

We agree. The Constitution requires only that “ . . .a course of training and instruction . . . [be completed] and . . . examination [be taken and passed] <em>prior to assuming office.” </em>Thus, the most that the Constitution requires is that such training be obtained prior to taking office. By prohibiting a person from filing nominating petitions until he or she “ . . . has successfully completed the course of training and instruction and passed the examination . . .”, the Act goes beyond what is necessary to implement the constitutional provision, and imposes restrictions upon candidates to the office of District Justice that do not exist in the Constitution. The constitutional provision can be fully implemented by al<a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>lowing the instruction to be completed after the election, so long as the examination is taken and passed before assuming office. The Act’s imposition of the additional requirement that the instruction and examination be completed before filing nominating petitions is therefore unconstitutional.</p>
