The contract provided that the conveyor system would be capable of handling 25,000 cases of alcoholic beverages in an eight hour period. Federal executed a $875,300 bond conditioned upon Rapistan’s performance. Subsequently, the PLCB contracted with Holt Hauling and Warehousing Systems, Inc.

A dispute arose soon thereafter because the system was unable to handle 25,000 cases per eight hour period. The PLCB refused to make payment of the final $95,000 due to Rapistan under their contract. It also entered into two agreements modifying its original contract with Holt. The PLCB agreed to reimburse Holt for additional costs incurred due to the faulty equipment and to increase the contract rates for handling the cases. <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>Holt agreed to withdraw a claim it had filed against the PLCB before the Board of Arbitration of Claims.

The facts alleged support this claim. The convey- or system, according to the complaint, does not meet contract specifications, and, as a result, the cost of handling the cases is more than originally contemplated and the number of warehouse employees needed is greater. The PLCB was therefore forced to renegotiate its contract with Holt at considerable expense. The PLCB’s losses are directly attributable to the breach of contract by Rapistan. It is therefore entitled to recover from Rapistan so long as the damages were “reasonably foreseeable” at the time of contracting and can be proved with reasonable certainty. <em>Macchia v.
