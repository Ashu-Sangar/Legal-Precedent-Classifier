During the trial of this case, appellant sought disclosure of certain materials in the possession of the prosecution because he believed they contained exculpatory evidence. The trial judge accepted the Commonwealth’s assertion that the materials contained no such evidence and on that basis denied appellant’s request. A trial judge may not rely solely on such a representation. If there is any basis for believing that the requested material contains exculpatory evidence, a trial judge should examine those materials in camera before ruling on the request.</p>

The district attorney, claiming to have no sample of appellant’s voice, sought a court order compelling appellant to provide a voice exemplar for comparison with a tape recording of a telephone call made to the state police. The court ordered the accused to make an exemplar, using the same words found on the tape of the telephone call. Throughout this and all subsequent proceedings, the Commonwealth failed to disclose the existence of a recording of appellant’s voice made when he was first questioned by the state police. Only at trial did the existence of this “secret tape” become known when the Commonwealth’s expert witness indicated that he had examined this tape. This witness further testified that a comparison of the “secret tape” with the incriminating telephone call was inconclusive. The Commonwealth’s failure to inform the defense of the tape’s existence deprived him of a fair trial. <a href="/pa/471/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="471 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1725144" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0223-01">Id.</a> (concurring opinion).

The majority has completely misunderstood the issue in <em>Agurs. </em>The Court’s purpose was to establish a standard for evaluating <em>Brady </em>claims after a defendant has been convicted. The specific holding in <em>Agurs </em>is that in the absence of a focused request for exculpatory evidence by the defense, a high standard of materiality must be met before the prosecution’s failure to disclose evidence violates due process and requires a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>
      <em>Agurs </em>simply does not stand for the proposition that the determination whether the prosecution must disclose evidence to the defense under <em>Brady </em>is left to the unfettered discretion of the prosecutor. Indeed, the Court noted that “. . . if a substantial basis for claiming materiality exists, it is reasonable to require the prosecutor to respond either by furnishing the information or by submitting the problem to the trial judge.” <a href="/us/427/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="427 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6174831" data-case-paths="/us/427/0097-01">427 U.S. at 106</a>, <a href="/us/427/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="427 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6174831" data-case-paths="/us/427/0097-01">96 S.Ct. at 2399</a>.</p>

I agree that only the trial judge and not the prosecution can make a final determination as to what materials the defense is entitled to see, I should like to add, however, that if the prosecution’s file contains any statements of prosecution witnesses, defense counsel must be allowed to see such statements. As we said in <em>Commonwealth v. Grayson, </em><a href="/pa/466/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="466 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="1714990" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0427-01">466 Pa. 427</a>, 429, <a href="/pa/466/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="466 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="1714990" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0427-01">353 A.2d 428</a>, 429 (1976):</p>
    <blockquote id="b620-7" data-blocks='[["BL_620.8",620,[299,1598,1111,520]]]'>“whether the statements of the prosecution’s witnesses would have been helpful to the defense is not a question to be determined by the prosecution or by the trial court. They would not be reading the statements with the eyes of a trial advocate engaged in defending a client. Matters contained in a witness’s statement may appear innocuous to some, but have great significance to counsel viewing the statements from the perspective of an advocate for the accused about to cross-examine a witness.”</blockquote>
