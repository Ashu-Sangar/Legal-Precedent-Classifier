    <p id="b234-7" data-blocks='[["BL_234.7",234,[248,1891,1155,422]],["BL_235.1",235,[213,286,1148,1016]]]'>Yet another source of delay can be laid at the feet of appellant’s first attorney. After the motion to suppress was denied, the case was ready for trial on November 30, 1972. The attorney, Mr. Moore, at that time requested a medical examination to determine if appellant was able to stand trial. The case was again listed for December 18, 1972, after it was determined that appellant was fit to stand trial. However, Mr. Moore then <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>began a program designed to expedite the processing of his large caseload.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> As part of this program, he was not scheduled for murder trials until the spring of 1973. The first such case to be called was the instant one. However, Mr. Moore requested a delay so that the court could hold a hearing concerning the results of the December medical examination. Shortly after this, appellant dismissed Mr. Moore and his present counsel was appointed. Based upon this series of events and the testimony by the Commonwealth witnesses that the prosecution was at all times ready for trial, the court below concluded that “the record indicates that the actual delay in bringing the Defendant to trial was not caused by the Commonwealth, but rather was caused by Mr. Moore’s unavailability for trial and the delays occasioned by the motion to suppress and the motion for a competency hearing.” Upon a review of the record, we agree that the greater amount of the delay is attributable to appellant and not to the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[211,1340,1149,367]]]'>Nonetheless, appellant, relying upon <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, supra, </em>argues that the delay is attributable to the state because it is the duty of the Commonwealth to bring a defendant to trial and the duty of the court to control an attorney’s calendar.

As part of the ‘priority program’ initiated to expeditiously dispose of the substantial criminal backlog in the Philadelphia courts, a courtroom and assistant district attorneys were assigned to appellant’s counsel. The record establishes that subject to the court’s ultimate power and duty to control its calendar, scheduling of the cases was left to the parties. According to the testimony of an assistant district attorney assigned to the program: ‘We wanted to take the easier cases, so we just simply put the homicides aside and we didn’t even discuss them. . . . ’ This prosecutorial conduct resulted in appellant’s case not even being considered for more than two years.

The court had no control over his appointment and the Commonwealth could not interfere in this choice in any manner.

To the extent, however, that the Court holds or implies that a defendant is entitled at trial to raise the issue of <em>unnecessary </em>delay between arrest and preliminary arraignment, and argue to the jury that <em>unnecessary </em>delay is a factor to be considered in assessing the voluntariness of a confession, I disagree.

There was a significant dispute between Haley’s version as to the treatment he received at the hands of the officers prior to the confession and that testified to by the police officers. Haley stated that he had been beaten and his testimony was corroborated by the fact that the clothing he wore at the time was torn and bloodstained.

But they show such a callous attitude of the police towards the safeguards which respect for ordinary standards of human relationships compels that we take with a grain of salt their present apologia that the five-hour grilling of this boy was conducted in a fair and dispassionate manner.
