The signal characteristic of this type of project is the ability of the electric producing unit, the generator, to be reversed so that, when outside electricity is applied, it acts as a pump. Water released from the high level reservoir drives turbines, which drive the generators, producing electricity. When the process is reversed, electricity is applied to the generators, which then act as motors to drive the turbines in reverse, pumping water back to the high level reservoir. A pump storage project manufactures electricity during peak demand periods on weekdays. During low demand periods, at night and on weekends, water is pumped up to restore the high level reservoir to its proper level.</p>

By its terms, Article VIII, section 4 removes the historical exemption of public utility realty from local real estate taxes. It does not, however, contemplate direct local taxation of utility realty. Rather, it contemplates a plan whereby an amount equivalent to what local taxing authorities could have raised is collected by the Commonwealth and distributed among local taxing authorities in an equitable manner. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Board of Assessment Appeals and Review, </em><a href="/pa/461/0716-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="461 Pa. 716" data-case-ids="483852" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0716-01">461 Pa. at 726</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0716-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="461 Pa. 716" data-case-ids="483852" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0716-01">337 A.2d at 849</a>. Distribution of an amount not less than the gross amount which local taxing authorities could have raised by direct taxation of utility realty, is in lieu of such taxation. <em>School Districts of Deer Lakes and Allegheny Valley v.

Thus, although the PURTA tax is imposed and collected by the Commonwealth, it requires a distribution to local taxing authorities of the equivalent of “the gross amount of real estate taxes which the local taxing authorities could have imposed upon such real property but for the exemption herein provided.” Pa.Const. art. VIII, § 4. This amount is described in PURTA as the total “realty tax equivalent.” 72 P.S. § 3272(f) (Supp.1976). “Realty tax equivalent” is defined as “the total amount of taxes which a local taxing authority could have imposed on utility realty but for this act.” <a href="/pa/463/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="463 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="1708056" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0554-01">Id.</a> The total “realty tax equivalent” is determined by adding the “realty tax equivalent” from all local taxing authorities, and it is this amount which must be distributed under PURTA. 72 P.S. § 3277 (Supp.1976).</p>

The stipulation, relevant portions of which are set forth in the margin, establishes: (1) Philadelphia Electric is involved in the manufacture of electricity, and the dam, dikes, and canal at the Muddy Run Project serve directly in the manufacture of electricity; (2) the dam, dikes, and canal are necessary and integral parts of the manufacturing process; and (3) the improvements are used solely for effectuating the manufacturing purpose, and are of no benefit to the land generally.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

We cannot agree with the Commonwealth Court that the different definitions of taxable realty in PURTA and the county assessment laws reflect a legislative intent to make property, exempt under the other acts, taxable under PURTA. The definition in PURTA is specifically directed to industrial realty of the type owned by utilities. Thus, it refers to railroad rights-of-way, transmission towers, poles, pipes, and lines — types of property more commonly used in the operation of utilities than other industrial establishments. It also differs from the more general definition in the county assessment laws by not including items such as non-commercial property, which are irrelevant to a tax on utility realty. These differences merely reflect the narrower focus of the PURTA tax. They do not suggest any reason why the common exclusion of machinery and equipment should be interpreted differently in PURTA than in the county assessment laws.</p>
