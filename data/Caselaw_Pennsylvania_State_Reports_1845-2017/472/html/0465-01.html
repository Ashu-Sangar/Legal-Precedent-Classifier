After a hearing the PCHA court entered an order on October 29, 1974, granting Lopez leave to file an appeal nunc pro tunc for that reason but otherwise denying relief.

In the absence of any eyewitness who could testify on this point, the Commonwealth relied in its case in chief on statements given by Lopez after his arrest. On appeal, Lopez argues that these statements were inadmissible for several reasons: (1) the statements were obtained in violation of Pa.R.C.P. 130 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> which directs that a suspect shall be arraigned without “unnecessary delay,” (2) the statements were the product of a warrantless arrest which was illegal because not based on probable cause and (3) the statements were involuntary.

At 6:45 a. m. he was given the required <em>Miranda </em>warnings<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> by Detective Raymond Dougherty of the Philadelphia Homicide Division, who then interviewed him until 7:10 a. m. During this period Lopez denied any participation in the shooting of Johnson. Lopez was then given coffee and a sandwich and left alone until 7:35 a. m. when Officer Dougherty asked him whether he wanted to go to the bathroom. From 7:39 to 8:15 a. m. another brief interview took place. The record then shows only that Lopez was left alone in an interview room furnished only with a table and some chairs from 8:15 a. m. until 9:10 p. m. Another police officer, Officer Thornton, then again advised Lopez of his constitutional rights, which were waived, and proceeded to question him until 10:00 p. m. During this interview Lopez admitted that he had been in the vehicle driven by Danby at the time the fatal shot was fired, but insisted that he had been in the front seat and that Mackey, who had been in the back seat, had fired the shot. From 10:00 p. m. until 4:05 a. m. the next day, while the police investigated the whereabouts of Mackey, appellant was again left alone in an interrogation room.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> At 4:05 a. m.

With a group of customers, he had left the bar to see what was causing some noise outside; he was shot and lightly wounded by some persons who he assumed were members of the Zulu gang. Later that day he had purchased a rifle from someone who visited the bar. When he entered the car driven by Arthur Danby, whom he knew as “Snooty,” he took the gun into the car with him.
