Hedgeman related that when he took the receiver and placed it to his ear, the caller asked “Is Bea dead?” According to his testimony, Hedgeman replied she was in the hospital and requested the caller to identify himself, whereupon the caller stated, “She better be dead from what I put on her,” and hung up.</p>

The record also indicates that Wheeler handed Hedgeman the receiver immediately upon recognizing Carpenter’s voice and that Hedgeman did not have to wait for the caller to speak. Finally, it is significant that Hedgeman’s testimony was preceded by the testimony of Edwards and Mrs. Lewis, the substance of which was that Carpenter made similar incriminating statements on two other occasions. Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion the inference that it was Carpenter who spoke to Hedgeman was entirely reasonable. The possibility someone replaced Carpenter at the other end of the line during the transfer of the receiver from Wheeler to Hedgeman is remote at best, and certainly not sufficient to make the conclusion that Carpenter was the speaker a matter of conjecture or speculation. As such, it was not error for the trial court to per<a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>mit Hedgeman to testify as to the substance of the telephone conversation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

This contention is also without merit. At trial Mrs. Lewis testified she knew Carpenter and had conversed with him approximately five or six times in person, as well as three or four times on the telephone. Further, she testified she was able to recognize his voice. This evidence was clearly sufficient to support a finding by the jury that it was Carpenter who telephoned Mrs. Lewis, and as such, established the foundation requisite to permit testimony as to the substance of the conversation. <em>Commonwealth v.

We are of the view, however, the evidence complained of instantly was not false. Williams testified initially from memory alone and the record indicates his answers to questions concerning the dates and number of occasions, prior to June 8, 1974, on which he had gone to apartment 11-D were repeatedly qualified as being less than certain recollections.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> After careful study of the record we are <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>convinced that, except for the three dates substantiated by the incident reports, Williams did not clearly remem<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>ber exactly when he went to apartment í 1-D and his testimony was at worst mistaken in this respect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Compare <em>Commonwealth v.

Williams also offered an explanation which, if accepted by the jury, was adequate to cover the other incidents he recalled, but for which no records were produced. With regard to this latter point, it is also worth noting that Carpenter was in custody only part of the months of December 1973 and May 1974, particularly since Williams testified that the frequency of the disturbances was erratic, “sometimes maybe once or twice a week, or two times a day.” Williams’ testimony can therefore be reconciled with the dates of Carpenter’s confinement. Since Williams’ testimony was not false, we are not persuaded the Commonwealth breached its duty by failing to correct false testimony. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Sweeney, </em><a href="/pa/464/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="464 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1710401" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0425-01">464 Pa. 425</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="464 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1710401" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0425-01">347 A.2d 286</a> (1975); <em>Commonwealth v.

Carpenter made no attempt to avoid disclosing his prior imprisonment or to mitigate the potential prejudice thereof after his motion for a mistrial was denied. Notwithstanding the trial court’s expressed willingness to entertain a stipulation, Carpenter failed to request a stipulation to the effect he could not have been involved in any disturbance at apartment 11-D between December 8, 1973 and May 10, 1974. Nor did he at any time request cautionary instructions as to the limited purpose for which the evidence of his imprisonment could legitimately be considered. In an effort to totally discredit Williams’ testimony before the jury, Carpenter made a tactical choice to reveal his incarceration, obviously with the idea that it would have a more dramatic effect on the jury in their evaluation of Williams’ credibility. Having opted for what he considered to be the most effective means of making his point, Carpenter cannot now complain he was prejudiced thereby. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Furthermore, after Williams clarified his testimony on recall, Carpenter failed to renew his motion for a mistrail or to raise any further objection manifesting a continuing dissatisfaction with the evidence. Notwithstanding the trial court’s expressed willingness to entertain a stipulation, Carpenter failed to request a stipulation to the effect he could not have been involved in any disturbance at apartment 11-D between December 8, 1973 and May 10, 1974. The record is barren of any effort by Carpenter to seek corrective action after Williams testified on recall. Thus, assuming arguendo Williams’ testimony could be characterized as containing an element of falsity, it is questionable whether Carpenter did not waive his objection to any impropriety by his inaction.

It is, of course, the prosecutor’s duty to take corrective measures when false testimony appears. <em>Giglio v.
