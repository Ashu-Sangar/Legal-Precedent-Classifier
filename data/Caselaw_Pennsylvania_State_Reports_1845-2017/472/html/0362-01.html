On that date, Valentino Francioni, a truck driver employed by David Tesone Trucking Company and assigned to a 1957 White tractor with a Gilmore trailer attached, lost control of the tractor-trailer while driving down a highway in North Mahoney Township, Indiana County, Pennsylvania. The vehicle crashed through a highway guardrail and came to rest on its side in a creek at the bottom of an embankment. At the time of the accident, Francioni was on the business of his employer. The tractor was leased by David Tesone Trucking Company from Gibsonia Truck Corporation.</p>

Two causes of action, negligence and strict liability in tort pursuant to Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts-, were pleaded. With regard to the latter, it was alleged in the complaint that the accident was caused by a defect in the steering component of the tractor. At the close of plaintiff’s case, the lower court granted defendant’s motion for a compulsory nonsuit on the 402A count. <em>See </em>Act of June 3, 1971, P.L. 120, No. 6, § 1, 12 P.S. § 645; Pa.R.Civ.P. 224.

At trial appellant, a truck driver of at least eight years experience, consistently and repeatedly pointed out that the truck had “always,” even prior to the repairs occasioned as a result of the December 26, 1967 “breakdown”, been “rough and hard to steer,” that he had to fight to keep it on the road, and that he complained to the appropriate persons about the difficulty, but that nothing was done to remedy the situation. He testified that after the repairs were made to the truck, it drove a little better than usual when unloaded, but that when it was loaded the steering “wandered . . . like it did when I had the truck before,” that it was “rough steering . . . like the old truck before they put this other axle underneath it, <em>that it never did steer right” </em>(Emphasis added). As to the precise cause of the accident and appellant’s resultant injuries, appellant testified that he careened off the highway when the steering failed. The appellant’s expert witness also testified that the cause of the accident was a failure of the steering mechanism.

The theory of liability of the supplier of chattels is premised upon the recognition that he has so dealt with the goods that they are likely to come into the hands of another and to do harm if they are defective. Originally, liability was based solely upon negligence. However, the trend towards finding a ground for strict liability began in approximately 1905 as a consequence of the national concern over the marketing of defective food. Prosser, Law of Torts, 4th Ed., Ch. 17, §§ 97, 98, pp. 650-658. Attempts to rely on a theory of “implied warranty” have proven ineffective because of the traditional concepts of contract law.</p>

Appellee contends that its leasing arrangement with David Tesone Trucking Company was actually a method of financing equipment and not a conventional, commercial lease. The essence of appellee’s argument is that the rule of strict liability does not extend to finance lessors engaged in the business of finance leasing. We agree with the appellee that the finance lease <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>is <em>sui generis </em>and that the policy considerations justifying an extension of the concept of strict liability to the true lease are not present when the lessor is not “marketing” or “supplying” the product but is, in fact, <em>merely a secured party, or financier, </em>whose collateral is the “product.” The distinction between finance and conventional leasing has been described in the following manner:</p>

Although extensive repairs were made to the truck, this fact is not sufficient to warrant the conclusion, <em>as a matter of law, </em>that the repairs severed the chain of causation from any prior defect.
