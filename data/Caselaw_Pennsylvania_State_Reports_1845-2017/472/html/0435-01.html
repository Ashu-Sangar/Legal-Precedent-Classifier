That evening, she again met appellant and Ferguson while en route to the home of Frank Geter. Weems was looking for her friend Daisy Pough and thought she might be at Geter’s house. Appellant and Ferguson accompanied Weems and waited at the street corner near Geter’s home. Weems entered Geter’s house, learned that Pough was not there and left a message for her. She departed and again encountered appellant and Ferguson. One of the men asked her if Geter had any money at home. During the ensuing conversation, the men discussed robbing Geter. After ten or fifteen minutes, Weems left.</p>

The information provided, that appellant’s nickname was Tubby, is not the type of evidence which can reasonably be expected to have greater impact on the factfinder because it was admitted by appellant rather than his four sisters. In addition, considering the source of the evidence, i. e., appellant’s sisters called as defense witnesses, the untainted evidence was effectively beyond dispute. Finally, while it may be unusual for the prosecution to develop the untainted evidence during cross-examination of defense witnesses, we are convinced that on the facts of this case the untainted evidence in no way derived from the allegedly tainted evidence. Appellant’s sisters surely did not take the stand in response to the detective’s challenged testimony; nor do we find it conceivable that they would not have testified if the detective’s testimony had been ruled inadmissible.

Five witnesses testified that they were with appellant at a party in honor of his birthday at the time the crime was committed. Over defense objection, the prosecutor asked two of these witnesses, during cross-examination, whether they had ever gone to the police to tell them that appellant was at a party with them on the night Frank Geter was killed. Appellant asserts that these questions were improper because the law imposes no duty upon a person who may become an alibi witness to come forward to the police. This contention is without merit.

That they had no duty to come forward does not render the question improper or irrelevant. Their failure to come forward could support an inference that their alibi testimony was fabricated for trial. Thus, these questions on cross-examination were permissible because they tended to impeach the witnesses’ credibility. See J. McCormick, Evidence § 29 (2d ed. 1972); 2 G.

Whether that conclusion is reached as a result of a finding that the impact of the challenged evidence is <em>de minimis </em>or whether the evidence supports a fact already established and is therefore no longer in dispute, the final result is identical in both cases. <em>See Milton v.

    <p id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[187,875,1148,1460]]]'>Additionally, I am compelled to comment upon Part III of the majority opinion concerning the admissibility of the notes of testimony from the preliminary hearing. First, the majority appears to accept a per se rule that prior testimony from a preliminary hearing of an unavailable witness is admissible at trial provided that defendant had counsel to cross-examine the witness during the earlier proceeding. While I am in agreement that such testimony should be admissible provided there has been a full opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the prior hearing, I believe that such an opportunity usually does not exist at this proceeding. As expressed in my concurring opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Stasko, </em><a href="/pa/471/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="178" data-cite="471 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="1725157" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0373-01">471 Pa. 373</a>, <a href="/pa/471/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="179" data-cite="471 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="1725157" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0373-01">370 A.2d 350</a> (1977), due to the limited opportunity for pre-trial discovery in this jurisdiction, the preliminary hearing has become a vehicle through which the defense attempts to glean information from the Commonwealth’s witnesses. Rarely, however, is it used for the purpose of impeaching these individuals. Therefore, before such evidence is admissible at trial, there should first be a thorough review of the testimony of the witness during the preliminary hearing. Only if it is determined that cross-examination was in fact employed to attack the witness’ credibility at that proceeding should the testimony be admitted. However, I need not make a judgment in the instant case since I do not believe the witness was unavailable at the time of trial.</p>
