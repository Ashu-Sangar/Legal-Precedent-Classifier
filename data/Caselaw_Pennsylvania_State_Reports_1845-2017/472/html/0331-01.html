Realty, Inc., seeking specific performance of a written option agreement for the sale of a parcel of land and damages for an alleged breach thereof. The dismissal of the complaint was precipitated by appellant’s refusal to supply certain information to appellees in response to their [appellees’] depositions of appellant as directed by the Chancellor. Although the lawsuit has been unnecessarily complicated by a long and involved procedural and factual history, the immediate precise issue raised rests upon a determination of the propriety of permitting a counterclaim seeking injunctive relief and damages under the theories of malicious use and abuse of process in response to appellant’s complaint in equity. For reasons which will be set forth hereinafter, we hold that the Chancellor erred in dismissing appellant’s complaint and order that the complaint be reinstated and that the cause be remanded to the court below for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>

Appellees ingeniously attempted to distinguish between the counts of the counterclaim which sets forth the alleged tortious conduct from what they chose to term a count in equity which seeks “a piercing of the corporate veil and an injunction against vexatious litigation.” It is obvious that the so-called count in equity is no more than a request of the court to exercise its equitable powers to remedy the continuing alleged tortious violations.</p>

Appellant’s complaint sought specific performance of an option to purchase real property. Appellees’ counterclaim alleged that appellant had brought a series of vexatious lawsuits against appellees in an effort to force appellees to sell the property to appellant at a depressed price. Thus, both appellant’s complaint and appellees’ counterclaim arise out of the sale of the real property in question. Indeed, the facts asserted in the counterclaim could support the defense of “unclean hands.”</p>
