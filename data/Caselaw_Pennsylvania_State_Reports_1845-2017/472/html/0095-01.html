In the- first statement appellant stated that he “didn’t mean to kill [the victim].” He stated that he climbed in a window of Carol Benson’s home and threw something around her neck, and that Benson then fell back, hitting her head. The second statement was in more detail. In it Wiggins stated that he had climbed in -the victim’s bathroom window in order to get “some money or a TV;” that the victim awoke and began screaming; that a struggle ensued between Wiggins and Benson during which the victim was pushed to the floor; and that Wiggins then fled. A medical examiner for the Commonwealth testified that Carol Benson’s death was caused by injuries to her head from a blunt instrument. Review of these facts, and the entire trial record, satisfies us that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction of murder in the first degree.</p>

Two arguments are advanced: first, Wiggins was neither advised that he was a murder suspect nor given <em>Miranda </em>warnings when the focus of the investigation shifted <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>from rape, for which he originally had been arrested and charged, to homicide; and second, the statements were obtained as a result of a period of unnecessary delay between arrest and preliminary arraignment.</p>

They are as follows: Wiggins was arrested at 5:45 a. m. on November 21, 1973 for rape and related offenses. He arrived at the South Detective Division in Philadelphia at 6:05 a. m., and at 6:30 a. m. was warned of his constitutional rights, which he waived. During preliminary questioning of appellant between 6:35 a. m. and 8:00 a. m., he made an incriminating oral statement in which he admitted involvement in ten rapes in the Tasker Area Housing Project. After a 45 minute break, appellant accompanied police to the Project Area where he pointed out the locations of the rapes to which he had earlier confessed. The taking of a formal statement began at 11:45 a. m. after Wiggins had been rewarned of his rights. After two hours Wiggins was allowed to rest and attend to his physical needs. The taking of the formal statement resumed at 2:30 p. m. and was completed at about 4:30 p. m.</p>
    <p id="b128-5" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[216,1648,1170,699]],["BL_129.1",129,[232,259,1152,151]]]'>At some point during the second half of the taking of the formal statement, the police became suspicious that appellant was involved in an unsolved murder, that of Carol Benson. This belief arose from the similarity between the method, as described by Wiggins, that he had used to attack the rape victims, and the manner in which the murder victim had been attacked. In addition, the rapes and the homicide occurred in the same general area. Their suspicions thus aroused, the police informed Wiggins at about 4:30 p. m. that he would be transferred to homicide headquarters for investigation concerning the murder of Carol Benson. At this point appellant exclaimed, “I didn’t mean to hurt her.” He was not then <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>questioned concerning this statement. Wiggins was allowed to eat and rest, and at 5:45 p. m. he was transported to the Police Administration Building.</p>

Wiggins was searched, asked several questions for background information and left alone. At 7:10 p. m. he again received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, again waived his rights, and was interrogated until 8:30 p. m. During this session Wiggins denied involvement in the Benson murder. At 8:30 p. m. appellant agreed to submit to a polygraph test, which was completed at 9:55 p. m. He was then left alone for 30 minutes until 10:25 p. m. Interrogation then resumed, and by 12:30 a. m. on November 22, 1973 Wiggins admitted his involvement in the murder. Preliminary arraignment took place some time after 3:30 a. m.</p>
