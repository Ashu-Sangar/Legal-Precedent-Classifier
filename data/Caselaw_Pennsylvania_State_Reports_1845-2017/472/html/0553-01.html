The police can be expected to act with due diligence in locating and apprehending an accused in all situations because it is their duty to do so as public officials. Furthermore, while the exercise of diligence or the lack of it will not be monitored by Rule 1100 where a warrantless arrest is involved, but will be monitored where an arrest is made pursuant to a warrant, the distinction is justified. In the situation of an arrest pursuant to a warrant, the complaint is filed prior to arrest, and thus considerations such as disruption of employment, curtailment of associations, subjection to public obloquy, and creation of anxiety, <em>Commonwealth v. Hamilton, </em><a href="/pa/449/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="449 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1945648" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0297-01">449 Pa. 297</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20127" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="297 A.2d 127">297 A.2d 127</a> (1972); <em>Commonwealth v.

On the other hand, in the situation of a warrantless arrest, these same considerations do not arise until the time of arrest. Since some of the considerations underlying the right of a speedy trial are present in the former situation and not present in the latter, the monitoring of delay under Rule 1100 is justified in the former situation and unnecessary in the latter.</p>

    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[215,1085,1150,747]]]'>Detective McGurk apparently became ill and was soon to retire. As a result on October 29, 1975, Detective Lyons replaced him. Lyons received a phone call from Mitchell’s parole officer on October 29 and was informed that Mitchell was receiving public assistance benefits. Lyons then arranged to be present when Mitchell picked up his check at a bank. On November 19, 1975, Mitchell was apprehended pursuant to Lyons’ arrangements. Furthermore, Mitchell relies on these facts: that he was receiving such checks for the entire period during which police were attempting to locate him; that he picked up the checks regularly from July 18, 1975 until arrested; and, that he was employed under his own name from October 9, 1975 until arrested.</p>

The error in such reasoning is that nothing in the record indicates that the police had any indication prior to October 29 that Mitchell was obtaining public assistance. Further, Mitchell did not become employed until October 9, 1975 and the police had no reason to know he had obtained such employment and no di<a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>rect connection with the employer by which to learn that fact. Finally, when arrested, Mitchell had in his possession a social security card bearing the name Herbert Nash and he remarked, “How did you find me? I never thought you would catch me.” Clearly such evidence is sufficient to permit the inference that Mitchell actively concealed his whereabouts when considered with the fact that he rented an apartment under the name Nash.</p>

Instantly, McGurk knew an address, which information he pursued on numerous occasions, and he had a photograph of Mitchell, which he circulated within the police department.
