Following the court’s instructions to the jury, the defense, in conformity with Rule 1119 of the Pennsylvania Rules <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>of Criminal Procedure,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> noted an exception to the court’s failure to include a specific charge to that effect. The trial judge declined to further instruct the jury, stating that he would have done so if the request had been made prior to the charge, but that he believed the point would be “unduly emphasize [d] ” if made at that time. We believe, in view of the specific defense request, that the refusal to charge the jury that the Commonwealth has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element of the criminal conduct charged was prejudicial error. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of sentence and remand for a new trial.</p>

In the instant case the court informed the jury several times of the presumption of innocence and burden of the Commonwealth to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. These were accurate statements of the law. In addition, the court correctly defined the requisite elements of the crime of murder of the first degree. Nowhere, however, in the entire charge did the court explain that the presence of each of the elements of the conduct charged must be proven by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt. In fact, no direction at all was given as to the proper application of the burden to the component parts of the crime in question.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The defense had an absolute right to have the jury instructed not only as to the quantum of proof required to establish guilt but also that the requirement extended to each of the material elements of the offense. The function of elucidating the relevant legal principles belongs to the judge, and the failure to fulfill this function deprives the defendant of a fair trial. <em>See Commonwealth v. Johnny Wortham (Commonwealth v. Dorothe Wortham), </em><a href="/pa/471/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="471 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1725188" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0243-01">471 Pa. 243</a>, <a href="/pa/471/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="471 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1725188" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0243-01">369 A.2d 1287</a>. It is entirely possible that, as a <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>result of the charge as it was given, the jury concluded that the Commonwealth might meet its burden if the <em>cumulative </em>evidence of guilt was such that they were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt although they were not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt as to one or more of the elements of the offense. This is not the correct standard and differs significantly from the requirement that each and every element of the crime meet this same measure of substantiation.</p>
