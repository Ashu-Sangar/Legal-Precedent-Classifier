In <em>Jackson, </em>the trial court admitted the prior testimony into evidence, and this Court merely held that the lower court’s ruling, under the facts there presented, did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Jackson, <a href="/pa/463/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="463 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="1708007" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0301-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/463/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="463 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="1708007" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0301-01">463 Pa. at 306</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="463 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="1708007" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0301-01">344 A.2d at 844</a>. Simply because in <em>Jackson </em>we held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the prior testimony does not mean that in another case, involving facts which <em>may </em>indicate an equally diligent effort to locate a witness, the trial judge automatically abuses his discretion by refusing to allow the prior testimony to be admitted. Whether or not there is an abuse of discretion is an issue which must be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>

In upholding the trial judge’s determination that this evidence was sufficient, we noted that “[t]he trial court could reasonably conclude that any search would be futile.” <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 306 n. 2, <a href="/pa/463/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="463 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="1708007" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0301-01">344 A.2d at </a>844 n. 2. In the present case, in contrast, the only facts which appear are that defense counsel subpoenaed a witness who failed to appear on the day he was scheduled to testify. Defense counsel requested a continuance which was denied,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> but at the same time the trial judge offered to <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>have a bench warrant issued for the witness. This invitation was declined by defense counsel<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> whereupon the court ruled that the witness could be put on the stand “at any time before the speeches to the jury.” Since rebuttal witnesses remained to be called, the defense, as it turned out, in effect was given four days within which to secure the attendance of the witness. During this time period defense counsel twice attempted to make contact with Anderson by telephone. Both times he was told that the witness was out of town and his whereabouts unknown. At no time during these four days, however, did counsel inform or attempt to inform the court that he was having difficulty in locating the witness. Under these circumstances I am simply unable to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it ruled that Anderson was not “unavailable” and, therefore, refused to allow his prior testimony to be introduced into evidence.</p>

The store was well lighted; the robbers were in the store before they announced the holdup 10 minutes, possibly longer . . .; Goldsleger first spoke with them in front of the meat case, face to face.” Appellee’s Brief at 4. In addition, Goldsleger testified that it was Leo Walloe who pistol-whipped him, thereby giving the witness further opportunity to identify Walloe as his assailant.</p>

Furthermore, Anderson’s testimony at the first trial relative to this encounter with Goldsleger was of minimal substance and importance; Anderson never testified that Mr. Goldsleger addressed him as Leo Walloe.

In <em>Jackson, </em>a majority of this Court concluded that the prosecution had made such a good faith effort. That conclusion was based upon the following factual situation.</p>
    <blockquote id="A6W" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[245,1112,1102,801]]]'>“Here, the absent witness was living at St. Michael’s School for Boys near Scranton, Pa. When notified by the District Attorney’s office that he would be called as a witness, his grandmother contacted the school authorities who released the boy into her custody. He arrived at her home in Philadelphia the evening before trial. As the grandmother was preparing to leave for court the next morning, the child disappeared. When the grandmother could not find him, she came to court alone and informed the District Attorney of the boy’s disappearance. A subsequent phone check to the grandmother’s home went unanswered. To establish unavailability, the Commonwealth called the grandmother who, in addition to the facts outlined above, testified that the child had a history as a runaway.”</blockquote>

      <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>Defense counsel in the instant case had subpoenaed the missing witness, the witness had appeared at trial on Monday, April 16, 1973, and was ready to testify. The prosecution argues that appellant has no right to object at this stage because at the time the witness was first discovered missing, defense counsel declined the court’s suggestion that a bench warrant issue. At that point, however, defense counsel had no reason to disbelieve the explanation that had been given to him concerning the missing witness’ whereabouts. Counsel stated to the court that a telephone call to the witness’ home had revealed that the witness was taking his sick daughter to the hospital. That version óf the witness’ activities came on Thursday, April 19, 1973. Defense counsel could reasonably have believed that a warrant was unnecessary to produce the witness and could reasonably have declined to have it issue in order to avoid unnecessarily antagonizing his own witness. On Monday, April 23, 1973, counsel informed the court that the witness still remained absent, and that counsel’s efforts to locate him over the weekend had revealed that the earlier version of his whereabouts had been fabricated by someone at the witness’' home.</p>

Furthermore, in the instant case, unlike <em>Jackson, </em>there are no countervailing Sixth Amendment considerations which might operate against the use, at a second trial, of testimony taken at a prior hearing. The prior testimony, therefore, should have been admitted.</p>

I cannot conclude that the omission of the evidence was error beyond a reasonable doubt. The complainant in this case was the only eyewitness to the crime for which appellant was accused. That testimony placed appellant at the store at the time of the robbery. The testimony of the missing witness tended to weaken the complainant’s contention that he recognized appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime charged. The jury was entitled to have this evidence of the complainant’s alleged misidentification before it when called upon to decide whether or not the complainant’s identification of appellant was accurate.</p>

      <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[249,1638,1153,719]]]'>. Mr. Justice MANDERINO in the opinion supporting reversal argues that defense counsel’s action in declining to have the warrant issued at this time was justified since he “could reasonably have believed that a warrant was unnecessary to produce the witness and could reasonably have declined to have it issue in order to avoid unnecessarily antagonizing his own witness.” (Opinion in Support of Reversal, <em>post </em>at 793). With respect, I consider this analysis specious. First, it is highly questionable whether any antagonism engendered by issuing a warrant would have been significant. Anderson was not a voluntary witness but had to be subpoenaed. Second, even if Anderson might have been antagonized by the warrant, it does not follow that he would have refused to testify or that his testimony would have been any less effective and forthright. While counsel may have felt that he could secure Anderson’s presence without the aid of the court, such a decision, in my view, must be considered a calculated gamble which failed; counsel should not later be heard to complain of judicial error when the result complained of was due in large measure to his own unsuccessful tactics.</p>
