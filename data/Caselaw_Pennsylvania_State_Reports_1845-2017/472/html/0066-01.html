Brakeman, was involved in an accident when his motorcycle collided with an automobile operated by David Baker in Mead-ville Pennsylvania. ■ The Baker automobile was owned by Edwin Baker, David’s father. David, a seventeen-year-old licensed operator, was insured under an automobile liability insurance policy maintained by the elder Baker with the appellant, The Potomac Insurance Company [hereinafter Potomac]. As a result of the accident, Brakeman allegedly suffered permanent disability and loss of income. Potomac did not receive written notice of the accident until October 6, 1970, after the Bakers had received a letter from Brakeman’s attorney stating that suit against David Baker was being instituted. Potomac refused to defend against Brakeman’s suit or accept any liability flowing from the accident, stating that Baker breached the insurance contract by failing to provide Potomac with timely notice of the accident. Brakeman filed suit against Baker on February 24, 1971, in the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County. Baker retained his own counsel and on January 10, 1972, a ver<a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>diet in the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), the exact amount of Baker’s insurance coverage, was directed by the Court in favor of Brakeman and against Baker by agreement of the parties and without actual trial.</p>
    <p id="b95-4" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[214,515,1154,585]]]'>Brakeman then brought the instant action against Potomac in the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County to recover the amount of the consent judgment. A jury returned a general verdict in favor of Brakeman for ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). The court, however, subsequently granted Potomac’s motion for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>on the ground that Baker’s written notice to Potomac, some seven months after the accident, was unreasonable and in violation of the clause in the insurance policy requiring notice of the accident “as soon as practicable.”</p>

As such, our prior decisions are in line with the rule applied in a majority of jurisdictions. See Annot. <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.L.R.%202d%20443" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="18 A.L.R. 2d 443">18 A.L.R.2d 443</a> (1951); 8 J. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>§ 4732 (1962), and cases cited therein. Our research indicates, however, a trend of late in several jurisdictions away from the classic contractual approach towards a view that considers prejudice to the insurance company as a material factor in determining whether to relieve the insurance company of its coverage obligations by virtue of late notification. Even in these last mentioned jurisdictions, however, there is no agreement as to whether the insurer has the initial burden of <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>demonstrating prejudice.

We are of the opinion, however, that this argument, based on the view that insurance policies are private contracts in the traditional sense, is no longer persuasive. Such a position fails to recognize the true nature of the relationship between insurance companies and their insureds. An insurance contract is not a negotiated agreement; rather its conditions are by and large dictated by the insurance company to the insured. The only aspect of the contract over which the insured can “bargain” is the monetary amount of coverage. And, as we have recognized, notice of accident provisions, such as that with which we are concerned instant<a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>ly, are uniformly found in liability insurance policies. <em>Meierdierck v.

        <em>Drug Stores, Inc., </em>supra. Notwithstanding a specific jury response to a special interrogatory that sufficient extenuating circumstances existed to excuse the seven-month delay in the instant case, the trial court ruled to the contrary in granting Potomac’s motion for judgment n. o. v. Brakeman contended that there were two extenuating circumstances to excuse the seven-month delay. He argued 1) that Edwin Baker gave oral notice of the accident to Potomac’s agent, Gelvin, Jackson &amp; Starr, within a few days after the accident and 2) that David Baker was a minor at the time of the accident. The Court rejected the first contention on the ground that the jury specifically determined in response to special interrogatories that the first written notice to Potomac was given on October 6, 1970, and that no oral notice had been given prior to that time. The court also rejected the second contention on the ground that “if the operator is old enough to be licensed to drive a motor vehicle he is old enough to be held to comply with the requirements of the policy protecting him.” In support of that conclusion, the court pointed out that David Baker was in fact only five months short of majority age at the time of the accident.</p>

We need not and do not decide whether Potomac would have been otherwise estopped to contest the basic questions of Baker’s liability and Brakeman’s damages and bound by the consent verdict because of its initial refusal to defend Baker. Potomac argues that Brakeman cannot recover on the consent judgment because of the “actual trial” provision in the insurance policy. Brakeman, on the other hand, contends that Potomac’s initial re<a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>fusal to defend Baker repudiated the policy and Potomac should not be allowed the benefit of a policy provision that is predicated on the willingness of the insurance company to defend its insured.

Baker. Mr. Baker’s son, David, was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which appellee, Allan E. Brakeman, was injured. The accident occurred on March 3, 1970, but Potomac did not receive written notice of the accident until October 3, 1970, and refused to defend its insured in the action brought by Brakeman because of late notice of the claim. <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>Brakeman and the insured reached a settlement after the jury was sworn but before evidence was presented.

Brakeman then brought this action against Potomac as a third party beneficiary of the policy for the amount of the judgment against the insured. The jury returned a verdict of $10,000 against Potomac but the trial court granted judgment n. o. v. on the ground that late notice by the insured relieved Potomac of any obligation.</p>

An insurance carrier should be required to prove that the failure to comply with the notice provisions of the policy prejudiced its position. Because this Court announces a new rule of decision, I also agree that this case should be remanded to the trial court to afford Potomac an opportunity to establish prejudice. Unlike the majority, however, I am not persuaded that Potomac’s alleged reliance on past case law justifies allowing Potomac a second opportunity to litigate its insured’s liability or the amount of Brakeman’s damages.</p>

After Potomac refused to defend against Brakeman’s claim, the insured was entitled to settle; by breaching its promise to defend, Potomac lost its right to control the suit. The purpose of an insurance policy is to ensure that if claims are brought against the insured, the insurer will defend and pay the amount of a settlement or judgment. If the insured’s late notice did not relieve Potomac of its obligations under the insurance policy, it is unfair to give Potomac a second opportunity to absolve itself of liability. Allowing Potomac to litigate liability and damages is also unfair to Brakeman. By settling with the insured, Brakeman chose the certainty of settling for the amount of the policy and sacrificed the possibility of a higher verdict against the insured. Moreover, to penalize both the insured and the injured party for a good faith settlement because the insurance company relied on prior cases is contrary to public policy which favors good faith settlements of claims.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

In effect it would preclude the insured from in good faith compromising an action against him when the insurer has refused to settle or defend it, contrary to its agreement. The insured, in order to protect himself, must permit the issue to be tried, and a judgment rendered, or must take his chances of being able to prove, in the action against the insurer, that he was in fact liable in the original action. This would be an ungrateful and often a difficult task. It would mean that the insured must establish his own negligence. Nor does it seem right that a settlement made in good faith by the insured, when the result of the case is in doubt, though it be to the advantage of both the insured and the insurer, should relieve the insurer from liability for its breach of contract, unless the insured proves affirmatively that it was liable in the case settled. If there was bad faith, if the action at the time it is compromised appears clearly to be without merit, so that the payment of any sum is a mere gratuity, we can readily concede that the amount paid cannot be recovered of the insurer. But where the insurer has agreed to settle or defend all claims within the policy . . . and has refused to do either, thus breaching its contract, and compelling the <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>insured to defend the action, we hold that the insured may in good faith make a settlement of the action, and may recover the amount paid on such settlement of the insurer, unless it is made to appear affirmatively that there could have been no recovery had the action been tried.”</blockquote>

As discussed infra, an insurance carrier is not absolutely bound by the settlement between the insured and the injured party. In order to bind the insurer, the settlement must have been made in good faith. E. g. <em>Butler Bros. v.

Indeed, a majority of the jurisdictions in this country still adhere to the traditional approach. <em>See </em>Annot., <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.L.R.%202d%20443" class="citation" data-index="166" data-cite="18 A.L.R. 2d 443">18 A.L.R.2d 443</a> (1951); 8 J. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>§ 4732 (1962), and cases cited therein. Moreover, under the unnecessarily broad and sweeping language of the majority in this case, virtually any clause in an insurance contract could easily be held to be unenforceable, even though it is neither unconscionable nor against public policy. I therefore cannot join in the majority’s analysis in the case at bar. Thus is not to say, however, that some change in our prior law is not called for in light of the practices and expectations that presently characterize the purchasing of liability insurance.</p>

The purpose of a requirement that an insurer be given reasonably prompt <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>notice of accident was described in <em>Hachmeister, Inc. v.

[Citation omitted]. The possibility that a settlement or a verdict more favorable to an insurer might be achieved if prompt notice had been received by it, cannot be discounted.” A somewhat fuller statement of purpose of a notice provision in an insurance policy has been given by a well-known commentator as follows:</p>

An adequate investigation often cannot be made where notice is long delayed, because of the possible removal or lapse of memory on the part of witnesses, the loss of opportunity for examination of the physical surroundings and making photographs thereof for use at trial, and the possible operation of fraud, collusion, or cupidity. Such a requirement tends to protect the insurer against fraudulent claims, and also against invalid claims made in good faith. And further, if the insurer is thus given the opportunity for a timely investigation, reasonable compromises and settlements may be made, thereby avoiding prolonged and unnecessary litigation.” 8 J.

Recognizing the validity of these purposes, however, should not serve to relieve an insurer of its obligations under the policy or to deprive an insured of coverage if in a particular case the purposes of the notice clause have in fact been satisfied, albeit the notice is untimely. Thus if the insurer is not prejudiced by a tardy <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>notice, so that it can make as effective a defense or settlement as it could have made had timely notice been given, the purposes of the clause are fulfilled and the insurer should not, solely because of untimeliness of notice, be relieved from its contractual obligations. Thus insofar as a majority holds that prejudice to the insurer is a “material factor in determining whether to relieve the insurance company of its coverage obligations by virtue of late notice,” opinion of the Court, <em>ante </em>at 195, 196, I concur in the opinion.</p>

    <p id="b118-5" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[225,950,1161,639]]]'>The Court holds, however, not only that prejudice to the insurance carrier is a prerequisite to avoidance of carrier liability in notice of accident cases, but also that the burden of affirmatively proving such prejudice is upon the. carrier. In so holding the majority reasons that “[i]n view of the facts that an insurance contract is not a truly consensual agreement, that what is involved is a forfeiture and it is the insurance company who chooses to disclaim its obligations under the policy, it is more equitable to place the burden of showing prejudice on the insurance company.” Opinion of the Court, <em>ante </em>at 198 (footnote omitted). I must disagree.</p>

As noted above, prompt notice provisions are not only reasonable and necessary, but they also serve to protect the interests of individual insureds and insureds as a group. Moreover, the fact that the ultimate result of any given case may be a “forfeiture” is no reason to allocate the burden to one party or another. In fact, the new requirement that lack of timely notice be prejudicial to the insurer before liability is excused is designed to prevent unjust forfeitures of cov<a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>erage. Finally, while the carrier is indeed seeking to avoid or minimize liability, the insured is also seeking to avoid, without reasonable excuse, the plain and unambiguous terms of the policy upon which coverage in the first instance was granted. In short, the mere invocation of such concepts as adhesion contracts, forfeiture, and avoidance of liability should not be held determinative of the issue.</p>
    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[251,730,1147,313]]]'>To my mind, it makes far more sense, both in terms of equity and the realities of an accident situation to require the insured to demonstrate that unreasonable delay in giving notice of accident, unexcused by any extenuating circumstances, was not prejudicial to the insurer’s position. Appleman puts the matter in perspective:</p>
    <blockquote id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[298,1074,1102,791]]]'>“Many courts have adopted the rule that it is unnecessary for the company to show that it was prejudiced by the neglect of the insured in order to assert this policy defense, it being frequently stated that prejudice is presumed under these circumstances. This does not mean that upon a showing of delay, alone, the insurer walks out of court free of potential claims. It means, rather, that prejudice being a difficult matter affirmatively to prove, it is not required to make such proof. Prejudice may be presumed, with the burden upon the one seeking to impose liability to show that no prejudice did, in fact, occur — for example, that a complete investigation was made by another insurer or by competent persons who turned over the results to the ‘late notice’ insurer.</blockquote>

Placing the burden of proving prejudice upon the insurer would essentially be similar to requiring it to disprove a negative. The insurer’s <em>lack of knowledge </em>of particular facts helpful to a defense may also operate to make it impossible for the insurer to show the underlying prejudice.” <em>Brakeman v. Potomac Ins.

Indeed, the majority of this Court concedes that “prejudice is a difficult matter for the insurance company to prove affirmatively. .” Opinion of the Court, <em>ante </em>at 198. In contrast, while it may well be difficult for an insured to demonstrate a lack of prejudice, common sense indicates that the insured will havé more relevant facts within its knowledge concerning the accident than an untimely notified carrier, and therefore will be in a better position to meet its burden of proof. Moreover, it should be remembered that it is the insured who is seeking to be excused from failure to comply with the timely notice requirement of the policy. I have no. doubt whatever that it is more equitable to place the burden of proof on the breaching party than on the other. <em>See </em>Restatement of Contracts, Second, Section 255 (Tentative Draft <em># </em>7, 1972); <em>Brakeman v.
