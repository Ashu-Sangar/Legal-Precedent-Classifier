On June 17, 1966, he arrived at work approximately 6:00 P.M. and parked his automobile in the lot adjacent to the building. At that time, he specifically observed two other vehicles on the premises. One was owned by appellant and the other was being used at the time by one Anthony DiPasquale. After alighting from his car, McGrath noticed appellant looking out onto the parking lot from the window of a second floor office normally used by other union officials. The witness then entered the building and proceeded to the second floor to commence his duties. Appellant was still seated by the window when McGrath entered that office. Sullivan inquired about the janitor’s presence and instructed McGrath to wait until Sunday night to clean, since a union meeting was scheduled for that date and the building would require cleaning after the gathering. <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>McGrath ignored the suggestion and continued collecting the trash from the offices.

McGrath then began cleaning the conference room, located approximately 75 feet from Gorey’s office. Shortly thereafter, Gorey appeared and had a brief conversation with McGrath. Immediately after Gorey left the conference room, appellant appeared in the doorway, through which Gorey had just passed, and again questioned McGrath about the cleaning and suggested he defer his activities until Sunday afternoon. During this brief conversation, Gregory Carchidi, another janitor, entered the conference room. No conversation ensued between Carchidi and Sullivan but Carchidi repeated appellant’s urgings to leave the work until Sunday. Sullivan then left the room through the same door which Gorey had exited but Carchidi remained and seated himself behind the desk.</p>

McGrath drove off but returned to the premises within 15 minutes. Only Gorey’s car remained in the lot.

A second line with a different call number had been prearranged by Gorey to ring in his office so that he could receive an anticipated call from Joseph Vernick at 7:00 P. M. One Irene Glenn testified for the Commonwealth that she dialed the regular union phone number about 6:15 P.M. that evening and a man answered identifying himself as Gorey. A scrap paper found in the wastebasket alongside the desk where appellant had been seated prior to the victim’s arrival contained Ms. Glenn’s name and telephone number. It was uncontested that the handwriting was that of appellant. Moreover, one Joseph Vernick testified that he called Gorey’s office at a specially arranged time but received no answer despite his repeated attempts between 7:15 and 8:15 P.M.

After lengthy discussion as to the admissibility of the statement, the witness was permitted to testify concerning Carchidi’s remark. The lower court permitted the evidence on several bases: 1) that it was admissible under the co-conspirator’s declaration exception to the hearsay rule, 2) that it was admissible under the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule, and 3) that even if the statement was improperly admitted, it was not prejudicial to appellant.</p>

First, the testimony establishes that there was no dual representation in the true sense of the term, i. e., the same counsel actively represented co-defendants. Mr. Peruto testified that it was Mr. (now Judge) DiBona who served as chief counsel for appellant during trial and made all decisions relevant to Sullivan’s defense while he, Peruto, was merely assisting. These functions were reversed at the trial of the co-de<a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>fendants where Mr. Peruto was chief counsel and Judge DiBona the assistant. Thus, Judge DiBona served only a minor role in the trial of the co-defendants while devoting his primary efforts to the Sullivan case. This conclusion is supported by Judge DiBona’s statements that his stewardship was in no way affected by the consideration of the co-defendant’s cases but was solely a product of what he considered to be the best course in his representation of Sullivan. We therefore hold that there is absolutely no evidence that a conflict existed.</p>

Mr. Peruto, who served as co-counsel during trial and sole counsel before this Court, also had no recollection of a brief being filed.

However, even assuming arguendo these decisions apply retroactively and that counsel should have possessed the foresight to anticipate them, we believe this reliance is misplaced. In <em>Archambault, supra, </em>we announced a new rule that the trial judge could no longer express an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused. There is no evidence that the trial judge expressed such an opinion with respect to Sullivan and thus that case is inapplicable. In <em>Goins, supra, </em>the accused had admitted committing the homicide but asserted the defenses of intoxication and insanity in an effort to lessen the degree of guilt. Four members of this Court expressed the view that it was inappropriate for the court to comment upon the degree of guilt where that was the only issue for the jury to decide. See <em>Commonwealth v. McNeill, </em><a href="/pa/462/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="183" data-cite="462 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="485190" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0438-01">462 Pa. 438</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="184" data-cite="462 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="485190" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0438-01">341 A.2d 463</a>, 465 (1975). Sullivan however conceded at trial that the crime amounted to first degree murder but based his defense upon the theory that the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt. Thus the principle announced in <em>Goins, supra </em>is likewise inapplicable here.</p>

The salutary procedures of post-conviction relief have been misapplied so as to wipe out, by the well-meaning but misguided order of a common pleas judge, a decision of and opinions previously filed by this Court. More specifically, this Court has been told by the common pleas court — which the majority now says had the right so to do — that the legal counsel who represented the defendant in his earlier appeal to this Court was ineffective in that representation, and that therefore <em>the trial court </em>is granting the defendant the right to file a new direct appeal, nunc pro tunc, from the judgments of sentence. This unprecedented procedure produces, moreover, the bizarre spectacle of the defendant being granted by the trial court something he had previously been twice denied by this Court, viz., a reargument of his direct appeal. Thus by the stroke of the pen of a court of inferi- or jurisdiction is prior appellate action in the same case rendered nugatory.</p>

In my personal judgment, the brief here in issue was just that.

Moreover, in no appeals from orders rendered in PCHA proceedings do we permit oral argument except by special order of court, notwithstanding that all such cases appealed as of right to this Court involve felonious homicides.

I cannot agree with the Court’s opinion <em>(ante, </em>472 Pa. p. -, 371 A.2d p. 474) to the effect that a claim of denial of the constitutional right of a defendant to representation by competent counsel may be entertained only by a trial judge in a post-conviction hearing. While that forum is appropriate for most claims of ineffectiveness, nothing that I have seen indicates that the PCHA in Section 3(6), 19 P.S. § 1180-3(6), was meant to include appellate counsel in a case where counsel had purportedly finished his task. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murray, </em><a href="/pa/452/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="264" data-cite="452 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="574479" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0282-01">452 Pa. 282</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%2033" class="citation" data-index="265" data-cite="305 A.2d 33">305 A.2d 33</a> (1973).

If factual determinations are involved relative to matters not of record nor within the direct knowledge of the appellate court, that may be accomplished in a proper case by reference to a master or to a <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>trial court to perform a master’s function.

In addition, I wish to express my amazement and dismay at the majority’s approval of the use at trial of the color slide photographs depicting the bodies of the victims in the instant case. I have viewed these photographs. ' If these photographs do not warrant a reversal and remand for new trial, no retrial will ever be granted because of the admission of inflammatory photographs. Every prior case of this Court granting a new trial because of the admission of inflammatory photographs is <em>sub silentio </em>overruled by the majority’s holding that the photographs admitted in this case do not warrant reversal. These photographs are more gruesome than any other color slides or photographs which I have seen in any previous appeal before this Court. They can accurately be described as a “horror show.” Such a show must have affected the jury greatly. Very few persons exposed to full color slide photographs of blood smeared bodies, with bullet riddled faces, lying in literal pools of blood, could dispassionately decide whether the prosecution had sustained its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the perpetrator of such crimes was, in fact, the same man accused of committing them. Because of the serious disagreement among the members of this Court as to the sufficiency of the evidence in this case, we should be particularly careful to avoid condoning something which may have unfairly tipped the scales of justice against the appellant at trial.</p>

These slides were shown to the jury for a total time of eighteen minutes and twenty-seven seconds. On the average, therefore, each slide was projected for almost thirty seconds. The group of thirty-nine slides can be divided roughly into four categories. The first category, consists of eight slides depicting the outside of the building in which the victims’ bodies were found, a window with a bullet hole, the layout of the parking lot outside the building, the victim Janda’s purse, a brown paper lunch bag sitting on the window sill, and some severed telephone lines. The second group of photographs contains various shots indicating the relative position in which the victims’ bodies were found. This group includes overall views of the room, scenes showing the relative locations of the desk, various chairs and other office equipment, and the bodies. The third group consists of eight close-up photographs of the head and body of the victim, Gorey. The last group consists of fifteen close-up photographs showing the victim, Janda’s head and body in various positions. It is these latter two groups which are particularly objectionable here.</p>

These five photographs show the victim lying on his back on the floor with his head up against the wall, with eyes closed, chin on shoulder, left hand on chest. Plainly visible is a bullet hole in the middle of the forehead just above the eyebrows; a bullet wound in the corner of the left eye; blood coursing from the bullet wound of the forehead; blood coursing from the bullet wound of the eye; blood, dried and caked in layers coursing from the nose; blood flowing from the right ear; the entire collar and part of the shoulder of the shirt stained and splattered with blood; blood flowing from a bullet wound in the abdominal area just to the left of the navel; <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>and a bullet wound just to the left and above the navel.

The remaining two photographs of the victim, Gorey, depict almost identical close-up shots of the victim’s face; both reveal in horrid detail the bullet wound to the center of the forehead and the bullet wound to the left eye. In both shots fully one-half of the victim’s face and neck is completely covered with blood.

There is only one photograph in the first group. It depicts the victim lying on her left side on the floor (the desk under which she was found having apparently been removed for purposes of the photograph) in a pool of blood extending from near the top of her head down to her waist. The group of photographs depicting the victim’s torso consists of seven photographs. Three of these are almost identical. They show the victim lying on her left side with her face on the floor, surrounded by dried, caked, blood. These photographs also reveal three bullet wounds to the right side of the head: one in the hair above and to the rear of the right ear; one just in front of the right ear at about the point where the jaw bone connects to the skull; and one to the right temple, just to the rear and above the right eye.

Two of these photographs are almost identical views of the victim’s face and chest area showing her to be <em>completely </em>covered with blood from near the top of her head to her waist. In fact, her blouse is saturated with blood over the entire area of her chest. In one of these photographs the victim’s shirt has been opened to reveal her brassiere, saturated with blood, and a bullet wound to the lower abdomen several inches below and to the right of her navel.

The third is a close-up of the victim’s face, neck and upper chest revealing a bullet hole to the right temple, a bullet hole in the left corner of the right eye, blood flowing from the right ear, and blood staining the hair bright red.

It reveals the bullet wound to the right temple, with the blood that once flowed from it across the forehead now dried and caked. It also reveals the bullet wound to the left corner of the right eye, a mass of dried, caked blood in the hair just in front of the right ear, and blood staining the entire area of her cheek, forehead, and neck. The next is an identical close-up of appellant’s face taken from the right, this time with some of the blood removed to more clearly reveal the bullet hole in the left corner of the right eye, the bullet hole in the right temple, the dried and caked blood in front of the right ear, and blood staining the victim’s blonde hair red at the top of her forehead. The last of this group of photographs shows the left side of the victim’s face, the left side of her neck and her right breast, indicating the blackened, swollen, left eye, blood flowing from the nose, and blood flowing from the left ear.

We felt that such photographs were highly inflammatory. In the instant case we have almost three times as many photographs shown to the jury for almost twice as long a period of time, depicting the bodies of the victims, revealing in horrible detail how they were mutilated by the perpetrator of the homicide. The inflammatory effect of the photographs in the instant case was significantly greater, it seems to me, than was condemned in <em>Scaramuzzino.</em>

The same is true in the instant case. Those photographs depicting the physical scene of the crime, while some of them were gruesome to the extent that they depicted the blood flowing across the floor, and were objectionable for that reason, could have been taken after the blood had been cleaned. Those photographs which were introduced to show the jury the nature and extent of the wounds were completely unnecessary because the pathologist’s testimony provided the jury with that information. Furthermore, if the prosecution felt it desirable, schematic drawings of the victim’s bodies, showing the relative position of the various bullet wounds could also have been provided for the jury’s benefit. The same is true of their ostensible evidentiary value to show that the perpetrator possessed the intent to kill necessary to convict of murder in the first degree. Testimony by the pathologist as to the number and nature of the wounds was more than adequate to prove this element of the crime. As in <em>Scaramuzzino,</em>
