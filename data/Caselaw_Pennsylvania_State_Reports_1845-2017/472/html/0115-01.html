The ferrous sulfate and sulfuric acid thus formed are washed off the coal mine walls into the ground water flowing through the mine, where further hydrolizing or oxidizing occurs and ferric iron and additional acids are formed.

The Commonwealth Court, however, was of the opinion that the fugitive water in this case was no longer mine drainage but rather ‘the natural flow of “waters of the Commonwealth.” ’ We believe that, even though the fugitive water is included within the definition of ‘waters of the Commonwealth,’ it is still mine drainage. Mine drainage does not cease to be mine drainage once mining has ceased in the mine from which it continues to drain.” <a href="/pa/452/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="452 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="574950" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0077-01">452 Pa. at 91</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=306%20A.2d%20308" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="306 A.2d 308">306 A.2d at 316</a>.</blockquote>
