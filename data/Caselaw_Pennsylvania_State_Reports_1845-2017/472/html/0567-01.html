This is, indeed, an unreasonable conclusion. The Board was well aware that the instant action was in mandamus; the most reasonable interpretation of the objection was that appellees lacked standing to seek enforcement of the order by mandamus because they had not been parties to the suit in which the order had been issued.

It is this impingement upon prosecutorial discretion which explains the apparent inconsistency between the remoteness analysis in <em>Linda R.S. </em>and other standing cases not involving enforcement proceedings.

It is clear that the nexus between the action complained of and the plaintiffs’ injury in <em>SCRAP </em>was far more tenuous than in <em>Linda R.S., </em>where it was undisputed that the prosecutor would routinely have brought charges against a former spouse, providing a strong incentive for the father to provide support and avoid punishment. As Professor Davis has noted, absent the consideration of prosecutorial discretion, the two cases would be more easily reconcilable if each had been decided the other way. K.

The majority sidesteps the standing issue, saying that the question need not be considered. Mr. Justice Roberts would hold that appellees lack standing because <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>they have no “judicially cognizable interest” in having the Liquor Code enforced. I would hold that appellees do have standing in this case and would therefore decide their appeal. Consideration of the merits of that appeal, however, leads me to conclude that appellees have failed to sustain their burden of showing, in a mandamus action, that they had a clear right to the remedy requested, because they failed to show that the agency had acted in a manner not authorized by law. I believe that the Liquor Control Board, contrary to the opinion of the Commonwealth Court, has the authority to modify an order, as was done in this case. I would therefore, reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and enter judgment for appellants.</p>
