His will, dated August 14, 1974, was admitted to probate on November 4, 1974, and letters testamentary were issued to appellant, Patience C. O’Connell. Decedent’s will provided in part that the residue of his estate be distributed: a three-twentieth share to appellant “in lieu of and for the services she will render as the executrix of my Estate,” a one-twentieth share to Harry Hill, decedent’s nephew, and an eight-tenths share to appellant in trust for appellee, decedent’s son, Jeffrey K.

Appellee then filed a petition for a supplementary inventory alleging that the proceeds of two savings accounts which were inventoried as assets of the estate should not have been included as estate assets. Appellee claims that the savings accounts were tentative or totten trusts which should have been transferred to him immediately upon decedent’s death. Appellant contends that decedent orally revoked the totten trusts and that the savings accounts were therefore assets of the estate. After a hearing, the trial court, relying on the “Dead Man’s Statute,” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> ruled that appellant was incompetent to testify regarding decedent’s alleged oral revocation of the totten trusts. The trial court held that appellant had not established that the totten trusts were revoked and ordered appellant to transfer the proceeds of the savings accounts to appellee.</p>

The executrix in <em>Moore </em>sought to preserve the distribution of decedent’s estate in a manner consistent with decedent’s intention as manifested in his will. Moreover, the assets subject to dispute were clearly assets of the estate. As executrix of the estate, she represented decedent’s interest, and her status as a beneficiary under the will did not make her interest adverse to decedent’s interest, but merely made her interest adverse to decedent’s husband who sought to elect against the will.</p>
