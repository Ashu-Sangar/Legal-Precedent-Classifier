Detective Scanzello was assigned to investigate the case and spoke with Joseph Clarke, Jackson’s fifteen-year-old grandson, on the same day of the occurrence.

Taylor told them he was twenty-one years of age and also gave the officers his address, date of birth, place of employment and social security number. Verbrugghe advised Taylor that he was being questioned with regard to the “homicide by shooting of Elaine Jackson, forty-seven, Negro female, residence, 1534 Parrish Street, and the robbery of a Premier Food Market that occurred on Friday, August 30, 1974, inside the food market.” Taylor was advised of his constitutional rights but indicated he did not wish to remain silent and did not wish to have a lawyer present.

One of the persons from whom Dale was choosing, namely Popeye, was known to Dale. Thus, where no evidence exists to show otherwise, as is the case instantly, we can hardly conclude the pretrial identification was not suggestive, and that the Commonwealth has met its burden of so showing.

Taylor argues that Clarke’s description of Taylor included “clean-shaven” and that, since Taylor had a mustache when arrested, the information given Scanzello by Clarke does not serve to establish probable cause. First, five days passed between the day of the crimes and Taylor’s arrest. Second, even assuming Taylor had a mustache on the day of the crimes, his face might <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>otherwise have been clean-shaven, and further, this one possible contradiction is not sufficient to discount the numerous other facts supplied by Clarke which were corroborated.</p>

Taylor argues Franklin’s observations of him may not serve to establish probable cause because a time lapse of “at least ten minutes” exists between the crimes and Franklin’s observations. Taylor’s estimation of the time lapse is founded on the following: Franklin lived two and one-half blocks from the market; his sister apparently learned what occurred in the market when she congregated outside the market; when she learned Jackson had been shot, she went to tell Franklin; Franklin then set out toward the market and made his observations on the way — approximately one block from his residence and one and one-half blocks from the market. Even assuming ten minutes lapsed, such a lapse does not require us to disallow the information supplied by Franklin. The time lapse is relatively short, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em><a href="/pa/457/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="457 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="477854" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0423-01">457 Pa. 423</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="322 A.2d 119">322 A.2d 119</a> (1974), and does not render Franklin’s account any less reliable because it is entirely consistent with Franklin’s account that Taylor was hiding in the alley awaiting a bus.</p>

Since we reverse because of the admission of the in-court identification testimony, we need not pass on the admissibility of Dale’s testimony as to his out-of-court identification of Taylor which was elicited in front of the jury during cross-examination, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em><a href="/pa/462/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="462 Pa. 578" data-case-ids="485168" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0578-01">462 Pa. 578</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="462 Pa. 578" data-case-ids="485168" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0578-01">342 A.2d 84</a> (1975), despite the fact that defense counsel had no prior knowledge or notice thereof.

The Commonwealth does not address the question of whether Taylor was entitled to counsel at the line-up; rather, it argues, in effect, that the line-up, if illegal, did not taint the in-court identification.
