Thus, as framed by the pleadings, the issue in <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>the lawsuit was whether appellant’s vehicle did in fact strike the person of the plaintiff thereby causing the alleged injury.</p>

It is urged that it was not the trial judge but the appellee who “introduced” the alternative theory of negligence into the case through the testimony of the defense witness Russell McKeen.

In each of the above cited cases where this Court applied the principle urged by appellant, the evidence sought to be used to support recovery was not in conflict with plaintiff’s theory of recovery. Thus, in <em>Husvar, </em>we permitted recovery by a plaintiff who had rested his case simply showing an unexplained accident where the defendant assumed the unrequired burden of negating negligence and in so doing adduced evidence which supported the inference of its negligence.</p>

At the time that the plaintiff <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>rested his case, a compulsory nonsuit would have been justified. The defendant then presented evidence which benefited the plaintiff. On appeal, this Court held that such evidence was to be considered regardless of its source. In <em>Silberstein, </em>the Court rejected the trial court’s appraisal of plaintiff’s case based solely on the testimony of the witness offered by the plaintiff but also considered evidence introduced by the defendant in support of plaintiff’s position. Again in <em>Devlin, </em>we permitted testimony introduced by the defense to be used in support of the claim advanced by the plaintiff.

While a discussion of the doctrine of sudden emergency in relationship with the reasonableness of Mr. Hrivnak’s conduct was indeed proper, another dimension was added when the trial court on its own initiative proceeded to relate this concept to a theory of liability against appellee which was totally irreconcilable with the theory advanced by appellant. If the explanation of the sudden emergency doctrine had been confined to appellant’s inability to avoid the impact with the vehicle, the discussion of this subject would have been entirely appropriate under the factual issues raised. In such context it would have been clear to the jury that these remarks were directed to their appraisal of the actions of Mr. Hrivnak immediately preceding the contact with the Perrone vehicle and were intended to provide them with a basis for determining whether Hrivnak’s actions were in anyway negligent, and whether his negligence may have contributed to the accident. However, the statement that even absent a touching, Perrone might still be held liable for the injuries, does not relate to the possibility of appel<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>lant’s contributory negligence but rather offers an entirely new theory upon which the jury could predicate liability against appellee.</p>
    <p id="b382-4" data-blocks='[["BL_382.4",382,[264,464,1154,905]]]'>It is suggested that the language of our opinion in <em>Auerbach v.

We do not agree. A careful reading of the <em>Auerbach </em>decision satisfies us that it is fully in harmony with the views expressed herein. There the plaintiff alleged that she was struck by the defendant’s vehicle which transgressed the pavement upon which she was standing. The trial court instructed the jury that the plaintiff could prevail even if the vehicle itself had not mounted the curb but had driven so close that the overhang from the bus had come in contact with the person of the plaintiff. In either event it was the intrusion of the bus into an area properly occupied by the plaintiff that would have caused the mishap. Both factual versions would have been consistent with the theory advanced by plaintiff that the bus usurped the sidewalk.</p>

An analysis of our decision in <em>Auerbach </em>indicates that it was nothing more than a reiteration of the principles announced in <em>Devlin, Northern Trust Company, Silberstein </em>and <em>Husvar. </em>Permitting the jury to return a finding for the plaintiff in the event that it determined the intrusion upon the pavement on which plaintiff was standing was caused by the overhang of the bus, as opposed to the vehicle actually mounting the sidewalk, was entirely consistent with the fundamental theory offered by the plaintiff that the bus had negligently usurped the area where she was legally standing. This <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>is therefore in accord with the general principle that a plaintiff may receive the advantage of testimony of the opponent which merely supplies gaps in his proof or further corroborates his version.

Further, even if we assume for the sake of argument that it would have been appropriate for the jury to conclude from the evidence that appellee backed up in a negligent manner, it would still be necessary before recovery could be sustained under this theory to find that appellee’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing the injuries sustained by Hrivnak. Here again, to reach this conclusion the jury would have been required to disregard plaintiff’s express denial that he fell to the ground in an attempt to avoid the Perrone vehicle. Moreover, the jury would have been required to discount the testimony of plaintiff’s medical witness who emphasized that the injuries sustained were compatible with a forceful impact as opposed to a fall to the pavement. Thus, to allow Hrivnak to recover under this theory would be tantamount to permitting the moving party to sustain his claim where the jury had totally discredited the evidence <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>offered by him in support thereof.
