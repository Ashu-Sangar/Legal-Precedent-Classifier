Niccoli, who was then 54 years of age, divorced, and living with his 86-year-old father and next door to his 56-year-old brother, appellee Emil V. Niccoli, voluntarily signed himself into the Leech Farm Veterans Administration Hospital [Leech Farm] as a psychiatric patient after a violent physical altercation with his brother over the type of food that ought to be given to their invalid father. On October 23, 1975, while Albert Niccoli was still a patient at Leech Farm, Emil Niccoli filed a petition in the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County seeking the civil commitment of his brother pursuant to section 406 of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966 [the Act] ,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The petition <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>represented: “Petitioner believes that Respondent is in need of treatment because of his conduct and actions which constitute not only a disturbance and threat to members of his immediate family and to the public, but also a threat to Respondent’s own well-being, and that his examination or commitment to a proper facility in accordance with the provisions of said Act is necessary for his welfare and protection.” It further represented that “Petitioner has made efforts to individually secure care and treatment for Respondent, but Respondent has refused to undergo any treatment.” The petition also suggested that Respondent be committed to Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic [Western]. The court directed the sheriff to produce Albert Niccoli for a hearing on October 28. Appellee’s counsel noted on the sheriff’s form that appellant was to be picked up at Leech Farm.</p>

Appellee testified that on October 16 appellant had attacked him with a crowbar after objecting to the soup he was feeding their father and that he, appellee, was subsequently cut in a struggle over a knife that was lying on the floor, that his brother had physically attacked him on a number of previous occasions, that ap<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>pellant had frequently threatened harm to both him and their father and was frequently destructive in the house and given to throwing out food he considered unhealthy. Appellee further testified that his brother had previously been hospitalized as a mental patient on a number of occasions, but that he had refused voluntary out-patient treatment. He did not testify that appellant had voluntarily signed himself into Leech Farm and that he had remained there until the hearing, nor were these facts brought out on cross-examination. Appellant testified in his own behalf, but he appeared to have difficulty focusing on recent events and instead continuously returned in a rambling fashion to the past history of his family. At the conclusion of appellant’s testimony, the court ordered him returned to Leech Farm overnight and then taken on the following day to Western to be examined and observed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> A second hearing was scheduled for November 7.</p>

      <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>At the November 7 hearing Dr. Stanley Peal testified that he had examined and observed appellant regularly during his stay at Western, that he had diagnosed appellant as suffering from a “manic depressive psychosis” which lessened his “self control, judgment and discretion,” that he required in-patient care, and that his condition presently made him dangerous to himself and others. Dr. Peal further testified that appellant recognized his need for further hospital treatment, that he was willing to return to the veterans hospital on a voluntary commitment, and that Leech Farm was willing to accept him as a voluntary patient, but the doctor also stated that “even with his good intentions at this time” it was unlikely that appellant would <em>remain </em>willing to stay at the hospital voluntarily because of an inability to carry out his intentions characteristic of his mental disorder. The hearing judge also admitted into evidence, over appellant’s objection, a written evaluation by another examining physician stating that appellant “should return to Leech Farm where he is willing to go and receive the necessary help.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant himself testified that he felt he would benefit from further treatment at Leech Farm, that he was willing to sign himself in voluntarily and accept the treatment recommended by the doctors there, and that he had done so previously before he was brought to court. Appellant also called as a witness Michael Gildea of the county mental health department, who testified that it was the position of the county that when a facility is willing to accept a patient on a voluntary basis, there is no basis for an involuntary commit<a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>ment under section 406 except in “extraordinary circumstances.” The hearing judge, nevertheless, indicated that he would rely solely on the testimony of Dr. Peal, and he proceeded to commit appellant to Leech Farm involuntarily for an indefinite term with no provision for subsequent judicial review. After the court en banc dismissed appellant’s exceptions, this direct appeal followed.</p>

The record is unclear as to whether appellant was originally voluntarily admitted (section 402) or voluntarily committed (section 403) to Leech Farm, and as to what his status would have been had the court permitted him to return on a voluntary basis. Appellant’s brief suggests that under this voluntary arrangement he would have been free to leave at any time, while Dr. Peal testified that it was his understanding that appellant was willing to be voluntarily committed, which under section 403 would have permitted the facility to deny him immediate release. Since, with regard to the restraints or lack thereof placed upon a person committed by the court under section 406, the Act places broad discretion in the facility director and the Department of Public Welfare <em>after </em>commitment (see sections 418-20), we believe that considerable weight should have been given to the facility’s determination of the appropriate status for appellant in view of its previous experience with him. If that status would have been one of voluntary commitment, the possibility that he might subsequently choose to leave the facility prematurely would seem less significant, since the director would then have been able to detain him long <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>enough to initiate new commitment proceedings under section 406, should that have been deemed necessary. If the status would have been one of voluntary admission, his freedom to leave the facility at any time would have had to be evaluated in light of the extent of the <em>immediate </em>dangerousness to himself and others he would present were he to sign himself out before commitment proceedings could have been initiated, whether emergency proceedings under section 405 (50 P.S. § 4405) or new proceedings under section 406.</p>
      <p id="b430-11" data-blocks='[["BL_430.2",430,[274,1759,1125,568]]]'>We recognize that “voluntary” hospitalization may be subject to abuse, particularly in cases where for reasons of administrative convenience the patient is coerced into signing himself into a facility in lieu of his procedural rights in a judicial commitment hearing. Such arrangements, of course, are not truly voluntary. See generally J. Gilboy and J. Schmidt, ‘Voluntary’ Hospitalization of the Mentally Ill., 66 Nw.L.Rev. 429 (1971) (examining and criticizing voluntary procedures in Illinois). Compare MHPA, § 203, 50 P.S. § 7203. On this record, however, we find no evidence of such coercion and no indication that appellant’s willingness to be hospitalized and treated was anything but voluntary. Further, the provisions of section 402 and 403 that would have been applicable to appellant obviate against lengthy involuntary hospitalization without judicial proceedings.
