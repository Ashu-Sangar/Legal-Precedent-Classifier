Post-verdict motions were denied, and this appeal followed.</p>

Appellant arrived at the 20th and Pennsylvania Avenue Police Precinct Building at approximately 7:20 p. m. Upon learning that the victim had died as a result of the shooting, police transported the appellant to the Homicide Division at the Police Administration Building, where they arrived at approximately 8:40 p. m. During this time appellant was not questioned by the police. At 9:00 p. m. appellant was told that he was being questioned about the homicide of Samuel Goggins, and was read <em>Miranda </em>warnings from a standard police interrogation card. Appellant was then interrogated from 9:25 p. m. until 10:30 p. m., during which time he denied any knowledge of or participation in the homicide. Appellant was then left alone from 10:30 p. m. until 12:05 a. m., July 20, 1972, at which time <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>he was taken to the polygraph room. A polygraph examination was conducted, during which appellant was interrogated from 12:05 a. m. until 3:05 a. m., July 20,1972. At 3:05 a. m. appellant orally admitted his involvement in the homicide.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[233,552,1164,695]]]'>Appellant’s oral admission came in response to information supplied by police to him that he had “failed” the polygraph examination. Questioning continued until 3:30 a. m. when appellant was fed and taken to the men’s room. From 4:05 a. m. until 4:50 a. m., appellant was left alone. From 4:50 a. m. until 5:00 a. m. a “verification polygraph examination” was given. Appellant was again left alone from 5:00 a. m. until 7:00 a. m. At 7:00 a. m. <em>Miranda </em>warnings were repeated, after which a formal written statement was typed, read, and signed by appellant. The taking of the formal statement concluded at 8:15 a. m., July 20, 1972. Appellant was arraigned at approximately 3:00 p. m., July 20, 1972.</p>

The purpose of requiring that an accused be brought before a magistrate is to assure an independent review of the facts alleged to provide probable cause for arrest. An accused is entitled to such a review, and in this case, was not afforded that right until twenty hours after his arrest. During that period of time police conducted an ongoing investigation into the shooting in order to substantiate their version of appellant’s involvement in the homicide.</p>
    <p id="b439-4" data-blocks='[["BL_439.4",439,[252,875,1152,959]]]'>The prosecution argues that the police had an obligation either to substantiate the information received or to exculpate appellant before deciding whether to arraign or release him. Even if we assume that the police conduct in this case was not designed to produce inculpatory statements but rather aimed at the possible exculpation of the accused, we cannot accept the argument that the arraignment of an accused can be unreasonably delayed for that purpose. Under the prosecution’s argument, arraignment could be delayed indefinitely while an investigation continues to prove the accused innocent. Unless the accused’s innocence can be quickly established, that person, is entitled to be taken to a magistrate for arraignment following necessary administrative processing. <em>See Commonwealth v. Whitson, </em><a href="/pa/461/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="461 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="483753" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0101-01">461 Pa. 101</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="461 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="483753" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0101-01">334 A.2d 653</a> (1975).

Since no justification has been established for the delay, we must conclude that it was unnecessary. <em>Commonwealth v. Futch, supra. See also Commonwealth v. Cherry, </em><a href="/pa/457/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="457 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="478247" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0201-01">457 Pa. 201</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=321%20A.2d%20611" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="321 A.2d 611">321 A.2d 611</a> <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>(1964). The statements made at 3:05 a. m., were a direct result of that unnecessary delay, and were therefore, inadmissible at trial. It follows that the formal written statement taken at approximately 7:00 a. m., in which statement appellant substantially repeated the oral admissions made at 3:05 a. m., is also inadmissible.</p>
