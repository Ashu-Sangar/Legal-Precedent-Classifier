        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Robert J. Royster, was tried by a judge sitting with a jury and was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree for the shooting death of Charlotte Jami-son. Postverdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. This appeal followed.\nThe facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. On October 31, 1973, appellant entered Sonny\u2019s Lounge, Philadelphia, and began to argue with the barmaid, Mildred Cerdan. During this argument the decedent, Charlotte Jamison, joined Mrs. Cerdan in arguing with appellant. Appellant made some violent threats and brandished a revolver during the argument. \u2022 Appellant then walked toward the door, turned and fired the gun, the bullet fatally striking the decedent, Charlotte Jami-son.\nAppellant first argues that the court below erred in failing to compel production of the complete police investigative file pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum. We do not agree. Appellant bases his argument on the United States Supreme Court decision in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), which dealt with the suppression of evidence favorable to the defense.\nIn the instant case, defense counsel subpoenaed Detective Twyman, the chief investigating police officer for this case. The subpoena duces tecum requested the investigative file concerning the Jamison homicide.\nAt a sidebar conference defense counsel stated \u201cthat the defendant is entitled to those statements and [the case cited by defense counsel] implies in the cases behind it that . . . the information will tend to bear on his guilt or punishment . . . \u201d The district attorney responded that he had complied with the mandates of Brady, supra, by furnishing to defense counsel all the exculpatory evidence in the district attorney\u2019s file.\nThe United States Supreme Court in United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 392 (filed June 24, 1976), in discussing the scope of discovery mandated by Brady, stated:\n\u201cThe Court of Appeals appears to have assumed that the prosecutor has a constitutional obligation to disclose any information that might affect the jury\u2019s verdict. That statement of a constitutional standard of materiality approaches the \u2018sporting theory of justice\u2019 which the Court expressly rejected in Brady. For a jury\u2019s appraisal of a case \u2018might\u2019 be affected by an improper or trivial consideration as well as by evidence giving rise to a legitimate doubt on the issue of guilt. If everything that might influence a jury must be disclosed, the only way a prosecutor could discharge his constitutional duty would be to allow complete discovery of his files as a matter of routine practice.\n\u201cWhether or not procedural rules authorizing such broad discovery might be desirable, the Constitution surely does not demand that much. While expressing the opinion that representatives of the State may not \u2018suppress substantial material evidence,\u2019 former Chief Justice Traynor of the California Supreme Court has pointed out that \u2018they are under no duty to report sua sponte to the defendant all that they learn about the case and about their witnesses.\u2019 In re Imbler, 60 Cal. 2d 554, 35 Cal.Rptr. 293, 301, 387 P.2d 6, 14 (1963). And this Court recently noted that there is \u2018no constitutional requirement that the prosecution make a complete and detailed accounting to the defense of all police investigatory work on the case.\u2019 Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 795, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 2568, 33 L.Ed.2d 706. The mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nMoreover, this Court in Commonwealth v. Martin, 465 Pa. 134, 165, 348 A.2d 391, 407 (1975) (a plurality opinion by Mr. Justice Pomeroy joined by former Mr. Chief Justice Jones and Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien), in discussing the duty of the trial court to conduct an in camera inspection of the Commonwealth\u2019s files, stated:\n\u201cIn the case at bar the Commonwealth agreed to supply to appellant any evidence of an exculpatory nature. See n. 12 supra. No such material was forthcoming, however, for the prosecution represented to the trial court, as it does in this Court, that in fact it had in its possession no evidence that would tend to exculpate Martin. Martin contends that it should be the court\u2019s judgment, not that of the prosecution, which controls in a matter of such importance. The trial court declined to conduct an in camera inspection of the results of the prosecution\u2019s investigation in order to make its own independent appraisal of the evidence. We agree that it had no obligation so to do. As the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has put it, the rule of Brady \u2018does not make it incumbent upon the trial judge to rummage through the file on behalf of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)\nIn the instant case, appellant sought complete disclosure of a police investigative file. We are of the opinion that neither Brady nor Pa.R.Crim.P. 310 relating to pretrial discovery required such disclosure.\nAppellant next argues that the court below erred in permitting the introduction into evidence of his gun when it could not be established that the weapon was involved in the instant homicide. We do not agree.\nThe facts surrounding the above issue are: On November 14, 1973, two weeks after the shooting, at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing defense counsel promised to deliver the questioned weapon to the district attorney. Although the offer to surrender the weapon was made during a discussion of the amount of bail, the record does not indicate any stipulation or limitation upon the Commonwealth\u2019s subsequent use of the revolver. The Commonwealth performed ballistics tests but because of the failure to find the bullets that actually killed Jamison, no comparison could be made with appellant\u2019s weapon.\nIn Commonwealth v. Yount, 455 Pa. 303, 314 A.2d 242 (1974), in discussing the admissibility and relevancy of a pen knife found on the defendant\u2019s person, but not conclusively shown to be the weapon used in the slaying, this court stated:\n\u201c . . . \u2018The fact that the accused had a weapon or implement suitable to the commission of the crime charged, such as a knife ... is always a proper ingredient of the case for the prosecution.\u2019 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 157 at 289-90 (13th ed. C. Torcia 1972).\n\u201cThis relevant evidence clearly was admissible. As this Court recently held in Commonwealth v. Ford, 451 Pa. 81, 84, 301 A.2d 856, 857 (1973): \u2018[Positive testimony that the knife in question was actually the murder weapon is not required prior to introduction into evidence. . . . If a proper foundation for the admission of the evidence has been laid, as here, then admission into evidence is permissible. . . . The fact that the knife could not be positively identified affects the weight of such evidence, but not its admissibility. . .\nSee also Commonwealth v. Bederka, 459 Pa. 653, 331 A.2d 181 (1975) (dealing with the admission into evidence of a shotgun not proven to be the weapon used in the homicide).\nOn direct examination Detective Twyman identified the weapon as appellant\u2019s and the one surrendered to Twyman by defense counsel. The Commonwealth further established through the testimony of the barmaid-eyewitness to the shooting that the weapon was of the type that appellant had on the night of the fatal shooting. Detective Twyman, on cross-examination by defense counsel, testified that the Commonwealth could not establish that this gun was the murder weapon.\nWe are of the opinion that the court below did not err in admitting into evidence appellant\u2019s revolver, since the inability of the Commonwealth to establish this weapon\u2019s use in the homicide goes to the weight, not the admissibility, of the evidence.\nAppellant next argues that the court below did not charge the jury that the Commonwealth had the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of the crime. We do not agree.\nOur review of the charge reveals the following excerpts:\n\u201cIn reaching a verdict, the jury must consider all of the evidence to determine the guilt or the innocence of the defendant, since the Commonwealth has the burden throughout the trial to establish the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury will weigh the evidence in th\u00e9 light of that burden in reaching a verdict.\n\u201cEvery man comes to the bar of the Court presumed to be innocent of the charges against him and the . Commonwealth has the burden of proving that the defendant is guilty of the crime as charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant is under no obligation to establish his innocence\n* * #\n\u201c . . . The defendant is presumed to be innocent, like every defendant in a criminal court and the burden is on the Commonwealth to establish his guilt and every essential element of the crime charged against him beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nThe court then continued to charge as to elements of the degrees of murder and voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Our review does not reveal that the court below omitted from its charge the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof.\nAppellant next argues that the court below erred by not charging the jury that two of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses allegedly violated the court\u2019s sequestration order and further that one of the two witnesses committed per j ury. We do not agree.\nAt the beginning of appellant\u2019s trial, the court below imposed a sequestration order, part of which prohibited witnesses from discussing the case or their testimony with anyone. During the first day of the trial, appellant\u2019s counsel informed the court that he had information that Detective Twyman, the chief investigating officer on this case, and Mildred Cerdan, the eyewitness to the shooting, were seen talking outside the courtroom. Immediately an in camera hearing was held during which both Detective Twyman and Mrs. Cerdan testified that they did in fact talk during the luncheon recess but that the conversation was centered around generalities and did not concern either the case or the other\u2019s testimony. The trial judge was satisfied with this explanation and accordingly found no violation of his sequestration order. Appellant now contends that the court below should have charged the jury that a violation did occur and that in fact perjury was committed by one of the witnesses.\nWe do not reach the merits of appellant\u2019s claim because of the failure to request such a charge or to specifically object during the court\u2019s charge to its omission. Therefore, the issue has not been preserved for appellate review. See Commonwealth v. McNeil, 461 Pa. 709, 337 A.2d 840 (1975).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nEAGEN, C. J., concurs in the result.\nNIX, J., files a concurring opinion.\nROBERTS, J., files a dissenting opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joins.\nMANDERINO, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. The record is unclear as to whether Detective Twyman received the subpoena. Since he was in court with the file we need not decide that factual question.\n. Detective Twyman and Mrs. Cerdan were both unclear as to whether there were two conversations or one conversation fragmented into two parts. This confusion as to the number of conversations is what appellant contends is perjury.",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent. During the trial of this case, appellant sought disclosure of certain materials in the possession of the prosecution because he believed they contained exculpatory evidence. The trial judge accepted the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the materials contained no such evidence and on that basis denied appellant\u2019s request. A trial judge may not rely solely on such a representation. If there is any basis for believing that the requested material contains exculpatory evidence, a trial judge should examine those materials in camera before ruling on the request.\nIn Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-97 (1967), the Supreme Court held that:\n\u201csuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d\nUnder Brady, the prosecution has a duty to produce evidence which is materially favorable to the accused. E. g., Williams v. Dutton, 400 F.2d 797 (5th Cir. 1968); see Commonwealth v. Powell, 449 Pa. 126, 295 A.2d 295 (1972); Lewis v. Court of Common Pleas, 436 Pa. 296, 260 A.2d 184 (1969).\nBlanket acceptance by a trial court of the prosecution\u2019s assertion that it possesses no such evidence does not adequately protect the rights of the accused. As Judge Frankel has observed:\n\u201c[t]he unfortunate defect in this course is that it leaves with one (the more powerful) of the adversaries a critical period of unilateral control that must . exact an unacceptable toll of unfair convictions.\u201d\nUnited States v. Gleason, 265 F.Supp. 880, 885 (S.D.N. Y.1967). A defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the production of exculpatory evidence \u201ccannot depend upon the benevolence of the prosecutor.\u201d Williams v. Dutton, 400 F.2d at 800 (footnote omitted). Accord, United States v. Deutsch, 373 F.Supp. 289 (S.D.N.Y.1974).\nThis Court has recently been presented with a case in which the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpatory evidence. In Commonwealth v. Topa, 471 Pa. 223, 369 A.2d 1277 (1977), the Commonwealth sought to use a voiceprint comparison to connect appellant with a murder. The district attorney, claiming to have no sample of appellant\u2019s voice, sought a court order compelling appellant to provide a voice exemplar for comparison with a tape recording of a telephone call made to the state police. The court ordered the accused to make an exemplar, using the same words found on the tape of the telephone call. Throughout this and all subsequent proceedings, the Commonwealth failed to disclose the existence of a recording of appellant\u2019s voice made when he was first questioned by the state police. Only at trial did the existence of this \u201csecret tape\u201d become known when the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness indicated that he had examined this tape. This witness further testified that a comparison of the \u201csecret tape\u201d with the incriminating telephone call was inconclusive. The Commonwealth\u2019s failure to inform the defense of the tape\u2019s existence deprived him of a fair trial. Id. (concurring opinion). As the Topa case illustrates, the Commonwealth can make mistakes or become overzealous in its efforts to secure a conviction.\nThe majority dismisses appellant\u2019s claim with a quotation from United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 108-09, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2399-400, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). The majority has completely misunderstood the issue in Agurs. The Court\u2019s purpose was to establish a standard for evaluating Brady claims after a defendant has been convicted. The specific holding in Agurs is that in the absence of a focused request for exculpatory evidence by the defense, a high standard of materiality must be met before the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose evidence violates due process and requires a new trial. Agurs simply does not stand for the proposition that the determination whether the prosecution must disclose evidence to the defense under Brady is left to the unfettered discretion of the prosecutor. Indeed, the Court noted that \u201c. . . if a substantial basis for claiming materiality exists, it is reasonable to require the prosecutor to respond either by furnishing the information or by submitting the problem to the trial judge.\u201d 427 U.S. at 106, 96 S.Ct. at 2399.\nAppellant here sought materials he believed contained exculpatory evidence. His request was necessarily broad because he could not know the contents of the requested material. When faced with such a request for production of exculpatory evidence, a trial judge has the duty to determine whether counsel can make the request with more specificity. The mere fact that the request is framed in general terms is no ground for its summary denial. See Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 668 n.12, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1013 n.12, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957).\nIn my view, if there is a basis for believing that the requested material contains exculpatory matter, the trial judge should review such material in camera. State v. Brown, 98 Idaho 209, 560 P.2d 880 (1977); see United States v. Agurs, supra; Flanagan v. Henderson, 496 F.2d 1274 (5th Cir. 1974); United States v. Barket, 64 F.R.D. 573 (W.D.Mo.1974). But see e. g., United States v. Cobb, 271 F.Supp. 159 (S.D.N.Y.1967). In camera examination may reveal that the requested material contains neutral or damaging evidence, in which case it need not be produced. Or it may disclose the existence of exculpatory evidence which must be given the accused. The examination itself enhances the fairness of the trial proceedings.\nThe trial court\u2019s summary response to appellant\u2019s request here was inadequate. It left to the Commonwealth\u2019s unfettered discretion the determination whether it possessed exculpatory evidence. I would vacate the judgment of sentence and remand the case to the trial court for in camera inspection of the requested material. If the court\u2019s inspection revealed material evidence a new trial should be ordered. If, however, it revealed no such evidence, the judgment of sentence should be reinstated. See Flanagan v. Henderson, supra. State v. Brown, supra. I therefore dissent from the majority\u2019s refusal to grant such relief.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\n. \u201c[I]f the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist, constitutional error has been committed.\u201d 427 U.S. at 112, 96 S.Ct. at 2401-02. The Court also discussed the standards of materiality which apply when (1) the prosecution uses or condones the use of perjury, id. at 103, 96 S.Ct. at 2397, and (2) the prosecution fails to disclose exculpatory evidence after a focused request by the defense, id. at 105, 96 S.Ct. at 2398. See generally Note, The Prosecutor\u2019s Constitutional Duty to Disclose Exculpatory Evidence, 14 Am.Crim.L.Rev. 319 (1976).\n. Appellant sought disclosure of all \u201crecords, memos, statements and reports of investigation, [and] photographs pertaining to the police department\u2019s investigation and the death of one Charlotte Jamison . . . and all reports of the incident which occurred at Sonny\u2019s Bar,\u201d because he believed they contained exculpatory evidence. Appellant was not seeking nor could he have obtained these materials during pre-trial discovery of evidence held by the Commonwealth. There has been substantial debate concerning the propriety and scope of pre-trial discovery in criminal cases. See Y. Kamisar, W. LaFave, and J. Israel, Modern Criminal Procedure 1207-16 (4th ed. 1974). However, here appellant sought only that evidence which the prosecution had a constitutional duty to produce, not the entire investigative file, as the majority asserts.\n. Defense counsel is certainly better able to evaluate whether the requested evidence is exculpatory. See Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969); Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966); Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L. Ed.2d 1103 (1957); Commonwealth v. Grayson, 466 Pa. 427, 353 A.2d 428 (1976). However, as the majority correctly observes, Brady, does not require that the prosecution make a complete accounting of its investigation to the defense. See United States v. Agurs, supra; Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 33 L. Ed.2d 706 (1972). See generally Pa.R.Crim.P. 310. Thus, the only feasible check upon the prosecutor\u2019s discretion is in camera review by the trial court after the defense makes a focused Brady request.\n. When the defense has requested specific items, the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose requires reversal if the evidence \u201cmight have affected the outcome of the trial.\u201d United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. at 104, 96 S.Ct. at 2398.",
