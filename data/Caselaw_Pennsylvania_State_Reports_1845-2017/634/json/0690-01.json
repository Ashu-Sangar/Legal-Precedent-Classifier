        "text": "OPINION\nJustice STEVENS.\nThis is a capital direct appeal from the judgment of sentence imposed after a jury convicted Patrick Ray Haney (\u201cAppellant\u201d) of, inter alia, first-degree murder. For the following reasons, we affirm Appellant\u2019s conviction and judgment of sentence.\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nOn September 13, 2011, Heather Forsythe (\u201cForsythe\u201d) and Appellant presented at Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgan-town, West Virginia with Forsythe\u2019s four-year-old son, Trenton Lewis St. Clair (\u201cTrenton\u201d). N.T. 3/10/14, jury trial, at 41, 49, 133. When Trenton arrived, he had neither a pulse nor signs of life. N.T. 3/11/14, jury trial at 162-63. Forsythe and Appellant told emergency personnel that Trenton had fallen down a flight of stairs. Id. at 170. Dr. Hollyn Larabee (\u201cDr. Larabee\u201d), a doctor at Ruby Memorial Hospital\u2019s Department of Emergency Management, immediately attempted to resuscitate Trenton and was able to restart his heart four times; however, she was not able to keep the heart beating. Id. at 163. After an hour and twelve minutes of attempting to resuscitate him, Dr. Larabee pronounced Trenton dead. Id. at 164.\nAt trial, Dr. Larabee testified that it was \u201cimmediately evident that the child had been beaten. He was covered in bruises. There was blood around his mouth.\u201d Id. at 163. As a result of these observations, Morgantown Children and Youth Services and Morgantown State Police were summoned to the hospital. State Police Troopers James Pierce, Daniel Barnhart, and Charles Morrison arrived at the hospital at approximately 9:55 p.m. and interviewed Dr. Larabee, For-sythe, and Appellant. N.T. 3/10/14, jury trial, at 133-34. Appellant initially told troopers that Trenton had fallen down the stairs at approximately 1:00 a.m. that day and that the child \u201cseemed fine\u201d until approximately 2:00 or 3:00 p.m. that afternoon when he began to throw up and act \u201cfunny.\u201d Id. at 134-35. Appellant further told troopers that Trenton had fallen off a desk and had fallen off a drawbridge at the park a few days prior to his death. Id. 135.\nDuring her interview with the troopers at the hospital, Forsythe requested to speak with the officers at the police barracks, as she was afraid that Appellant was outside the room listening. Id. at 52, 137. At trial, the Commonwealth introduced text messages Forsythe sent her step-niece as she was being transported to the police barracks which read: \u201cNot good. I\u2019m doing myself in as well as\u2014as soon as I do what I got to do. I have no reason here anymore.\u201d Id. at 58. Forsythe continued in another text:\nI\u2019m on my way to the police station now. Trenton was beat they told me and that he was choked, that is the reason he is dead, because I would never hurt my baby. I only know that I feel in my heart that the bruises all over him\u2014I would never hurt my baby. He would tell me when he would have a new bruise or something and Pat would say he fell or he was climbing and shit. What else can I say.\nId. at 58-59. Upon arrival at the barracks, Forsythe gave a written statement to police explaining that she had observed Appellant physically abusing Trenton on September 10, 2011. Id. at 54.\nThe state police transported Appellant to the police barracks, and Trooper Pierce testified that while transporting him, Appellant engaged in conversation with the troopers, speaking about his childhood, where he grew up, and how he met Forsythe. Id. at 136. However, Appellant did not mention Trenton at any point. Id. Once at the barracks, Appellant was placed in an interview room where he sat while the troopers interviewed Forsythe. After Forsythe gave her written statement to police, at approximately 3:30 a.m. Trooper Pierce provided Appellant with his Miranda rights, which Appellant acknowledged. Id. at 137-38. Trooper Pierce then informed Appellant that Trenton was deceased and asked if he knew how it had happened, to which Appellant responded that Trenton had fallen down the steps. Id. at 141.\nTrooper Pierce explained to Appellant that Dr. Larabee had indicated she believed that Trenton\u2019s injuries were caused by abuse, not by multiple falls, and the trooper provided Appellant with a copy of Forsythe\u2019s written statement. Id. At trial, Trooper Pierce testified that upon reading Forsythe\u2019s statement, Appellant \u201cdropped his head and he appeared to start crying. I asked [Appellant] if he ever struck Trenton and he replied that he struck Trenton on the back of the head and slapped him across the face.\u201d Id. 142. When asked why he would strike Trenton, Appellant replied that Trenton wouldn\u2019t listen and that the slaps were meant to discipline him, not to hurt him. Id. When Trooper Pierce questioned whether Appellant felt remorse for Trenton\u2019s death, Appellant replied, \u201c[o]f course I feel remorse, he was only four years of age.\u201d Id. Appellant was charged with first-degree murder and child endangerment.\u2019\nAt trial, Forsythe testified that in early September of 2011, she and Trenton were living in a home on Morgantown Road in Point Marion with Appellant and his father, Patrick Ray Haney, Sr. Id. at 41. In the first few weeks of September, Forsythe began noticing bruises on Trenton\u2019s body. When Forsythe questioned Appellant about the origin of the bruises, Appellant \u201cwould say he fell, or he was climbing, or fell, or running, tripped, whatever.\u201d Id. at 42-43. In the week leading up to Trenton\u2019s death, Forsythe noticed the bruises were increasing in number, but Appellant would again provide similar explanations for the injuries. Id. at 43.\nOn September 10, 2011, Forsythe arrived home after attending a funeral, \u201cheard a ruckus upstairs\u201d and observed Appellant standing above Trenton. Appellant was hitting, slapping, and kicking Trenton, while the child cried. Id. at 44. Forsythe testified that the incident left red marks on Trenton\u2019s body. Id. at 45. In the days after this attack, Trenton complained of a stomach ache. Forsythe testified that during this time Appellant would not allow her to leave the home or make any phone calls. Id. at 45-46.\nOn September 18, 2011, Trenton\u2019s condition worsened and he began vomiting. Forsythe testified she sent a text message to Appellant around 4:00 p.m. that day that read:\nMy son has bruising all over him. He can\u2019t keep even water down or food. I can\u2019t take him to the doctor. I am a piece of shit mother. I can\u2019t even say how these bruises got there and I\u2019m not going to take and lose him because of him [sic].\nId. at 48. Shortly thereafter, Appellant agreed to take Trenton to the hospital, but did not allow Forsythe to call 911, claiming that he could get them there faster. While driving to the hospital, Appellant repeatedly told Forsythe he was sorry and that he was going to go to jail. Id. at 49. During the drive, Forsythe and Appellant decided to tell the hospital staff that Trenton had fallen. Id. at 50. Trenton stopped breathing on the way to the hospital, and Forsythe attempted to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (\u201cCPR\u201d) in the car. Id. at 48.\nThe Commonwealth presented testimony from Dr. Matrina Schmidt (\u201cDr. Schmidt\u201d), whom both parties accepted as an expert in the field of Forensic Pathology, regarding her autopsy of Trenton. Dr. Schmidt recited Trenton\u2019s injuries as follows:\nOn the forehead, in the face, there were contusions. There [were] contusions on the forehead, there [was] a contusion below the right eye, there were contusions on the right jaw line extending onto the neck, there were contusions on the left cheek, the left face, the left jaw line, and also on the left side of the neck. There were contusions on the chest, the abdomen, there were contusions on the back and the buttocks and there were contusions on the right and left arms and right and left legs.\nId. at 83. Dr. Schmidt continued to explain that contusions are considered bruises, and that some of the many bruises on Trenton\u2019s body were circular in nature and consistent with finger impressions. Id. at 84. The Commonwealth showed Dr. Schmidt pictures taken of Trenton prior to the autopsy and asked that Dr. Schmidt explain the external injuries portrayed in each picture. Id. at 84-89.\nDr. Schmidt testified to the findings she made during her internal examination. Specifically, Dr. Schmidt explained that the internal examination revealed a deep scalp hemorrhage, an exudate on the small intestines, a contusion on the small intestine, a hematoma on the right side of the abdomen, and acute inflammation of the small intestines, large intestines, and bladder. Id. at 91-93. Dr. Schmidt further testified that she found \u201cearly formation of fibroblast formation, fibroblast coming in a form of supporting membrane\u201d in some of Trenton\u2019s injuries, which is a sign of healing. Id. at 93-94. Dr. Schmidt further explained that \u201cthe hematoma that was found in the abdominal cavity occurred at a different time than the peritonitis or the exudate that I saw, observed on the intestines.\u201d Id. at 94. Dr. Schmidt testified that Trenton would have been experiencing lethargy, a fever, nausea, vomiting and severe abdominal pain due to the peritonitis. Id. at 95.\nDr. Schmidt testified she determined Trenton\u2019s death to be caused by \u201cperitonitis due to closed abdominal injury due to battery,\u201d and although she could not rule out a fall down the steps as the cause of the peritonitis, the injuries that she observed on Trenton were not consistent with injuries that would be found on a four-year-old child who had fallen. Id. at 96, 101. Dr. Schmidt explained, \u201cthe bruises are scattered all over in [a] pattern and some of them are circular that look like finger impressions, and you wouldn\u2019t expect to see bruises, like, just from a fall.\u201d Id. at 96-97. Accordingly, Dr. Schmidt stated with a reasonable degree of certainty within the forensic pathology field that the manner of death was homicide. Id. at 97.\nDr. Larabee also testified at trial as an agreed upon expert in the field of Emergency Medicine. Dr. Larabee testified that Trenton was \u201cessentially dead\u201d when he arrived at the hospital, and that \u201cit was immediately evident that the child had been beaten.\u201d N.T. 3/11/14, jury trial, at 162-63. Dr. Larabee described Trenton\u2019s external injuries, as described by Dr. Schmidt, and added that Trenton\u2019s stomach was noticeably distended, meaning it was firm and pushed out, a condition which is not normal for a thin, healthy child. Id. at 167.\nWhen asked to describe the significance of bruises that are circular in nature, Dr. Larabee explained:\nThese injuries appear to a trained physician to obviously be secondary to intentional trauma. They appear to be secondary to fingerprints to the hand. It is very unusual to see circular bruises to those parts of the body to soft tissue, the neck, the stomach, the chest, the buttocks are not areas, the low back, where you should see bruises on children. You should see them on elbows and on the shins from normal activities.\nId. at 169-170, On cross-examination, Dr. Larabee conceded that she could not give an opinion as to whether a man or woman would have caused the circular bruises. Id. at 175.\nMoreover, Dr. Larabee testified as to the abnormality of an abdominal bruise:\nSo most bruises whether its children or adults occur when the skin is caught between a hard surface and a bone. So the bruise is because you fall and hit something and so the bone and the surface contract and the skin is caught between and that causes the bruise. It\u2019s unusual specifically over the abdomen, there\u2019s no bones to create that bruise against so it\u2019s much harder, it takes a great deal of force to create bruises over a soft tissue like the abdomen, the buttocks, the neck.\nId. at 170. When asked whether the injuries that she observed on Trenton were consistent with a child that had fallen down the stairs, Dr. Larabee responded, \u201cIt is absolutely not consistent with a child falling down the steps.\u201d Id. at 171. On cross-examination, Dr. Larabee reiterated that she has never seen an injury pattern like Trenton\u2019s from a fall down the stairs. Id. at 177. Dr. Larabee was further questioned whether any of Trenton\u2019s injuries could have been consistent with a fall off a jungle gym or a child who fell off an all-terrain vehicle (\u201cATV\u201d), to which she consistently responded in the negative. Id. at 171-72. Dr. Larabee further testified that Trenton\u2019s bruises appeared to be different ages, with some appearing to be not more than two to three days old, while others appeared to be not less than six to twelve hours old. Id. at 173.\nDr. Larabee testified that peritonitis is very treatable when detected at an early stage, and had Trenton been brought to the hospital earlier, he \u201clikely would have survived.\u201d Id. Ultimately, Dr. Larabee determined that Trenton died of \u201cintentional injury, non-accidental trauma, child abuse.\u201d Id. Finally, Dr. Larabee testified that \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about this. It\u2019s without a doubt the wors[t] case I\u2019ve ever seen and I have had other children die of non-accidental traumas. This is the wors[t] ease I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Id. at 174.\nThe Commonwealth initially sought to introduce twenty photographs of Trenton\u2019s deceased body into evidence and allow the jury to view the photographs during deliberations. Appellant filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude all photographs of Trenton\u2019s body from being viewed by the jury. The trial court granted the motion as to Exhibit 10, which depicted Trenton\u2019s open skull, and as to Exhibits 38 through 47, which showed medical equipment attached to Trenton. The trial court denied the motion as to Exhibits 1 through 9, finding that the photographs of Trenton\u2019s body exhibiting the injuries were \u201cprobative in establishing a pattern of repetitive abuse\u201d and their \u201cprobative value outweigh[ed] any inflammatory effect.\u201d Id. at 186.\nThe defense made various attempts to discredit Forsythe\u2019s testimony. Specifically, on cross-examination, the defense questioned Forsythe\u2019s contention that Appellant would not allow her to leave the home between September 10 and September 13, indicating that Forsythe told police she had gone to the Family Dollar store on September 11. N.T. 3/10/14, jury trial, at 62. Forsythe responded, that while she did visit the Family Dollar store, she could not recall when she went. Id. The defense also questioned Forsythe\u2019s contention that Appellant prevented her from using her phone, citing to the text message Forsythe sent Appellant on September 13, 2011, quoted supra. Forsythe explained that she sent the text while she was sitting next to Appellant. When questioned further, Forsythe clarified that while Appellant \u201cwatched when I called other people,\u201d she was able to send a \u201cfew\u201d text messages from her phone. Id. at 63. The defense further elicited testimony from Forsythe that, in August of 2011, she slapped Trenton because he was asking too many questions about a movie. N.T. at 63-64.\nThe defense called only two witnesses, Appellant and Melissa Leadbeater (\u201cLeadbeater\u201d). Leadbeater testified that she saw Trenton at her husband\u2019s funeral with Forsythe on September 10, 2011, suggesting that Trenton was not home alone with Appellant while Forsythe attended the funeral as she had testified. N.T. 3/11/14, jury trial, at 187-89.\nAppellant testified that, on September 10, he heard a bang come from Trenton\u2019s bedroom, and when he went to investigate, he noticed Trenton had some small scratches on his body. Appellant theorized that Trenton had fallen off a desk while he was trying to get one of his cats. Id. at 192. Appellant denied laying a hand on Trenton in the days leading up to his death, and he further testified that he did not see Trenton fall down the stairs on September 13, as he had been in bed all day and had no contact with Trenton until he took him to the hospital. Id. at 195. Moreover, Appellant testified he had not seen any of the bruises on Trenton\u2019s body until they cut his clothes off at the hospital. Id. at 200. While Appellant testified that he did not see Forsythe hit Trenton in the days preceding his death, he did witness her grab his shoulders and shake him. Id. at 201.\nWhen questioned about his statement to Trooper Pierce that he struck Trenton in the head and slapped him across the face, Appellant denied making this statement, claiming instead that he was trying to explain what Forsythe had accused him of doing. Id. at 202. Appellant further testified that Trooper Pierce\u2019s report was \u201cmistaken\u201d in as much as it indicated that Appellant told the trooper he had seen Trenton fall down the stairs. Id. at 203.\nAfter two days of testimony, the jury found Appellant guilty of first-degree murder and endangering the welfare of children. The trial then proceeded to the penalty phase, where the Commonwealth offered two aggravating factors for the jury to consider, namely, that the killing was by means of torture and that Trenton was under the age of twelve. The Commonwealth called Trooper Pierce to testify as to the date of Trenton\u2019s birth, as verified by his birth certificate, to establish that Trenton was, in fact, under the age of twelve. Trooper Pierce confirmed that Trenton\u2019s date of birth was February 17, 2007, making Trenton four years old at the time of his death. N.T. 3/12/14, sentencing phase, at 16-17. To support the contention of killing by means of torture, the Commonwealth asked the jury to consider the testimony of Drs. Schmidt and Larabee, which had been presented during the guilt phase.\nAppellant testified during the penalty phase, and the defense called four additional witnesses: Appellant\u2019s grandmother, Appellant\u2019s counselor at the Fayette County Prison, Appellant\u2019s cousin, and Appellant\u2019s mother. The jury ultimately sentenced Appellant to death, unanimously finding, as the two aggravating factors, that the victim was under the age of twelve and the offense was committed by means of torture. The jury found no mitigating circumstances. This timely direct appeal followed wherein Appellant raised the following issues:\na) Whether the pretrial hearing court erred in failing to grant [Appellant\u2019s] Motion to Quash the charges of first[-]degree murder and third[-]degree murder[?]\nb) Whether the pretrial hearing court erred in failing to dismiss the aggravating factor of torture during the Omnibus Pre-Trial Motion Hearing[?]\nc) Whether the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to prove that the defendant committed the crime of criminal homicide beyond a reasonable doubt[?]\nd) Whether the trial court erred in failing to grant [Appellant\u2019s] Motion for Judgment of Acquittal at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, when the Commonwealth failed to sustain its burden of proving that [Appellant] had the specific intent to kill the deceased beyond a reasonable doubt[?]\ne) Whether the trial court committed reversible error in permitting nine (9) photographs of the body of the victim to be viewed by the jury during deliberations over defense counsel\u2019s objections that the photographs were highly prejudicial?]\nf) Wdiether the trial court erred in permitting the aggravating factor of torture to be decided by the jury when there was no evidence of torture presented by the Common-wealthi?]\nII. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\nAppellant alleges that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the crime of criminal homicide. Moreover, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his Motion for Judgment of Acquittal, which he made at the end of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, as the Commonwealth failed to prove that Appellant had the specific intent to kill Trenton beyond a reasonable doubt.\nWhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court is tasked with determining whether the evidence at trial, and all reasonable inferences derived therefrom, are sufficient to establish all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner. Commonwealth v. Powell, 598 Pa. 224, 238, 956 A.2d 406, 415 (2008) (citing, Commonwealth v. Bridges, 563 Pa. 1, 12, 757 A.2d 859, 864 (2000)). Evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction of first-degree murder where the Commonwealth establishes that: (1) a human being was unlawfully killed; (2) the defendant is responsible for the killing; and (3) the defendant acted with malice and the specific intent to kill. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 615 Pa. 354, 369, 42 A.3d 1017, 1025 (2012) (citations omitted).\nAppellant argues that, although it was not disputed that Trenton perished as a result of injuries caused by abuse, Appellant has consistently denied that he abused Trenton or caused his death. Appellant emphasizes that, while Dr, Schmidt determined Trenton died from \u201cperitonitis due to closed abdominal injury due to battering,\u201d she also testified that the bruises on his body did not contribute to his death. N.T. 3/10/14, jury trial, at 96, 101. Moreover, Appellant stresses that Dr. Schmidt could not rule out that the injury to the abdomen was caused by a fall down the stairs, a fall off a jungle gym, or an ATV accident. Id. at 101-02. Appellant further asserts that neither Dr. Schmidt nor Dr. Larabee could opine as to whether Trenton\u2019s alleged abuser was a man or woman.\nAppellant also attacks the credibility of Forsythe by first highlighting the testimony of Melissa Leadbeater, who testified that Trenton was at her husband\u2019s funeral with Forsythe on September 10, 2011, thereby disputing Forsythe\u2019s claim that she had witnessed Appellant abusing Trenton when she returned home. Appellant next claims that, although For-sythe originally testified Appellant would not allow her to leave the home between September 10 and September 13, she later admitted she was at the Family Dollar Store on September 11, 2011. Appellant further alleges Forsythe admitted that, the day after Trenton died, she told a Children and Youth Services caseworker she did not observe Appellant hit Trenton. Finally, Appellant contends the only evidence presented at trial that linked him to Trenton\u2019s abuse came from Forsythe, and her testimony was not credible.\nThe Commonwealth responds by first suggesting Appellant\u2019s main argument that Forsythe was not credible is without merit, as \u201cdeterminations of credibility are within the sole purview of the jury as finder of fact.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 4. The Commonwealth next dismisses Appellant\u2019s argument that the Commonwealth failed to establish that Appellant delivered the blows to Trenton\u2019s torso and abdomen which were the cause of the peritonitis. The Commonwealth compares the instant case to Commonwealth v. Chambers, 602 Pa. 224, 980 A.2d 35 (2009) wherein the appellant repeatedly abused the victim and her siblings. The victim died after an exceptionally brutal episode of abuse during which appellant threw her into a radiator and then threw her between the bed and the wall, leaving her to suffocate to death. The medical examiner in Chambers concluded that the cause of death was due to a combination of factors, including the child\u2019s weakened state, blunt force trauma, and asphyxia. The appellant argued that because the medical examiner did not testify that his final blow to the three-year-old victim was sufficient to cause her death, the conviction could not stand. This Court rejected the so-called \u201cfinal blow\u201d argument and upheld appellant\u2019s conviction.\nThe Commonwealth contends that the evidence at trial clearly established strong circumstantial evidence that Appellant did, in fact, deliver the fatal blows which caused Trenton\u2019s peritonitis. Specifically, the Commonwealth explains that Appellant admitted to striking Trenton on the back and slapping his face, and \u201c[t]he same finger shaped marks found on the head and chest, parts of the body [Appellant] admitted to striking, were found on the abdomen, torso, lower back, buttocks, indeed, the remainder of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 5.\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence sufficiently establishes each element of first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus we find the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of guilt on the first-degree murder charge.\nFirst, the Commonwealth had the burden of establishing that Trenton\u2019s death was a homicide, which the Commonwealth aptly established through testimony of Dr. Larabee and Dr. Schmidt. Appellant stresses that Dr. Schmidt acknowledged that the bruises on Trenton\u2019s body did not contribute to his death and she could not rule out that the injury to his abdomen was caused by a fall down the stairs, a fall off a jungle gym, or an ATV accident. As the Commonwealth indicated, however, this Court has consistently rejected the \u201cfinal blow\u201d argument in instances of child abuse. See, e.g. Powell, 598 Pa. at 241-42, 956 A.2d at 417 (where this Court found the verdict of first-degree murder was supported by the evidence of appellant\u2019s pattern of abuse despite the lack of evidence of a final blow which caused the child\u2019s death). Moreover, while Dr. Schmidt conceded she could not positively rule out the possibility that Trenton\u2019s injuries were caused by multiple falls, it was her opinion that Trenton\u2019s injuries were not consistent with a four-year-old child who had fallen. N.T. 8/10/14, jury trial, at 96, 101. Ultimately, Dr. Schmidt testified that Trenton died of \u201cperitonitis due to closed abdominal injury due to battery,\u201d and declared within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the manner of Trenton\u2019s death was homicide. Id. at 96-97. Similarly, Dr. Larabee determined that Trenton\u2019s cause of death was \u201cintentional injury, non-accidental trauma, child abuse.\u201d N.T. 3/11/14, jury trial, at 173. Accordingly, the evidence supported the jury\u2019s conclusion that Trenton\u2019s death was a homicide.\nSecond, the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was responsible for killing Trenton, which the Commonwealth proved through the testimony of Dr. Schmidt, Dr. Larabee, Trooper Pierce, and Forsythe. As outlined supra, Dr. Schmidt and Dr. Larabee consistently testified that Trenton\u2019s injuries were consistent with battery. Appellant suggests that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he was Trenton\u2019s abuser, as neither Dr. Schmidt nor Larabee could determine whether the injuries were caused by a man or a woman. Appellant ignores, however, that our standard of review tasks us with viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner. The Commonwealth elicited testimony from Trooper Pierce and Forsythe that sufficiently proved that Appellant abused the child. Specifically, Trooper Pierce testified that Appellant confessed to striking Trenton, and Forsythe testified that she witnessed Appellant physically abusing Trenton three days prior to his death. N.T. 3/10/14, jury trial, at 44, 141-42. Appellant contends that Forsythe\u2019s testimony was not credible; however, the jury was free to find this evidence to be credible. See Commonwealth v. Hornberger, 441 Pa. 57, 61, 270 A.2d 195, 197 (1970) (\u201cIt is well settled that a jury or a trial court can believe all or a part of or none of a defendant\u2019s statements, confessions or testimony, or the testimony of any witness.\u201d) (citation omitted). Thus, viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could properly conclude that Appellant was responsible for Trenton\u2019s death.\nFinally, the Commonwealth had the burden to prove that Appellant acted with the requisite malice and specific intent to kill. For first-degree murder, an intentional killing is a \u201c[k]illing by means of poison, or lying in wait, or any other willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(d). The Commonwealth may prove specific intent through purely circumstantial evidence. Johnson, 615 Pa. at 369, 42 A.3d at 1025 (citation omitted). \u201cSpecific intent to kill can be proven where the defendant knowingly applies deadly force to the person of another.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 549 Pa. 352, 368-69, 701 A.2d 492, 500 (1997) (citing Commonwealth v. Meredith, 490 Pa. 303, 311, 416 A.2d 481, 485 (1980)).\nHere, Appellant\u2019s repeated attacks on four-year-old Trenton during which he inflicted blows to vital parts of Trenton\u2019s body, such as his head and stomach, over a period of at least three days, and his refusal to allow Trenton to receive timely medical attention while the child endured lasting effects of Appellant\u2019s abuse, proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant acted with malice and specific intent to kill. See Johnson, 615 Pa. at 370, 42 A.3d at 1026 (finding the Commonwealth sufficiently proved specific intent where the appellant repeatedly abused a two-year-old child for a period of 45-60 minutes, inflicting 150 bruises and injuries and causing internal injuries which lead to the victim\u2019s death.); Powell, 598 Pa. at 241, 956 A.2d at 416-17 (stating \u201c[t]he extensive physical injuries [the] appellant inflicted on the child, his cold-hearted failure to timely seek medical assistance, and the contradictory explanations [the] appellant offered as to how [the child] sustained his injuries ... were sufficient to support the inference that [the] appellant intentionally caused the child\u2019s death.\u201d).\nAppellant further asks this Court to reverse his judgment and grant him a new trial on the basis the trial court erred in denying Appellant\u2019s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief since the Commonwealth failed to prove that Appellant acted with specific intent to kill Trenton. As outlined supra, we find that the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant acted with the requisite malice and specific intent to kill.\nAppellant also contends that the pretrial hearing court erred in failing to quash charges of first-degree murder and third-degree murder, as the evidence offered was insufficient to prove that Appellant caused any of Trenton\u2019s injuries. As the Commonwealth indicates, however, because a jury determined that Appellant committed first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt, this contention is moot. See Commonwealth v. McCullough, 501 Pa. 423, 427, 461 A.2d 1229, 1231 (1983) (stating \u201c[t]his fact is clearly immaterial where at the trial the Commonwealth met its burden by proving the underlying felony beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Lee, 541 Pa. 260, 270, 662 A.2d 645, 650 (1995) (\u201c[Defendant\u2019s] adjudication of guilt renders moot any allegation that the Commonwealth failed to establish a prima facie case with respect to the homicide [at the preliminary hearing] ... \u201d).\nIII. ADMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPHS\nAppellant next posits the trial court erred in permitting nine photographs of Trenton\u2019s body to be viewed by the jury during deliberation over defense counsel\u2019s objections that the photographs were highly prejudicial. Specifically, Appellant argues the photographs inflamed the minds and passions of the jury and were cumulative evidence to the testimony of Drs. Schmidt and Larabee. Appellant alleges that \u201cthe jury was unable to look past the images of the child on a medical table when the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to prove [Appellant\u2019s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18.\nThe Commonwealth responds that the photographs were properly admitted, as they \u201cexhibited the injuries and bruising that were testified to as the manner and cause of death.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 7. Moreover, the Commonwealth argues that, in this particular case, the jury needed to view the injuries inflicted on Trenton to determine whether Appellant committed the beatings with the requisite mens rea.\nThe Commonwealth sought to introduce twenty photographs to the jury, and Appellant filed a motion in limine seeking to keep the photographs from being viewed by the jury. The trial court ultimately granted the motion with respect to one photograph which showed Trenton\u2019s exposed skull, as well as ten photographs, which depicted medical devices attached to Trenton\u2019s body. The trial court found the remaining photographs to be inflammatory, but possessing evidentiary value sufficient to warrant their admission.\nAt trial, defense counsel categorized his motion in limine as an objection to the photographs being displayed to the jury, not an objection to their admission to the record. N.T. 3/11/14, jury trial, at 183. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s Opinion in Support of Jury Verdict did not discuss the admissibility of the photographs, but rather the trial court analyzed whether the photographs were properly displayed to the jury. In so doing, the trial court determined that the photographs were \u201cnecessary to show the amount of deadly force[ ] the Appellant used on vital parts of Trenton\u2019s body to enable the jury to infer an intent to kill.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, dated June 5, 2014, at 14.\nWhile Appellant consistently maintains that he does not challenge the admissibility of the photographs, his motion in limine and appellate brief analyze the test used to determine the admissibility of photographs. For the sake of clarity, we will discuss both the admissibility of the photographs and the decision to allow the jury to view the photographs during deliberation.\n\u201cPhotographs of a murder victim are not per se inadmissible.\u201d Commonwealth v. Cox, 546 Pa. 515, 534, 686 A.2d 1279, 1288 (1996) (citing Lee, 541 Pa. at 278, 662 A.2d at 654). In reviewing a challenge to the trial court\u2019s admission of photographs, we employ the abuse of discretion standard. Commonwealth v. Pruitt, 597 Pa. 307, 327, 951 A.2d 307, 319 (2008) (citation omitted). A trial court must engage in the following two-step analysis when considering the admissibility of photographs of homicide victims:\nFirst a [trial] court must determine whether the photograph is inflammatory. If not, it may be admitted if it has relevance and can assist the jury\u2019s understanding of the facts. If the photograph is inflammatory, the trial court must decide whether or not the photographs are of such essential evidentiary value that their need clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors.\nCommonwealth v. Tharp, 574 Pa. 202, 222, 830 A.2d 519, 531 (2003) (citation omitted).\nAccepting the trial court\u2019s finding that the photographs are inflammatory and after having viewed the photographs, we find that the evidentiary value of the photographs outweighed the likelihood of inflaming the passions of the jurors. Appellant maintains that the photographs were cumulative evidence to the testimony of Drs. Schmidt and Larabee and \u201cinflamed the jury to the point where they could not possibly review the evidence presented in the trial in a fair and impartial manner.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18. This Court consistently has held, however, that \u201cthe fact that a medical examiner can describe the victim\u2019s wounds to the jury does not render photographs of those wounds irrelevant.\u201d Commonwealth v. Karenbauer, 552 Pa. 420, 443, 715 A.2d 1086, 1097 (1998) (citation omitted); See Johnson, 615 Pa. at 384, 42 A.3d at 1034 (\u201cEven if the nurse and the pathologist could have testified as to these injuries, a witness\u2019s ability to testify as to the condition of the body does not render photographs per se inadmissible.\u201d).\nMost recently, in Commonwealth v. Woodard, 634 Pa. 162, 129 A.3d 480, 2015 WL 7767271 (2015), this Court found that the trial court did not err in admitting into evidence twelve color photographs depicting a two-year-old child\u2019s external injuries and one black and white photograph portraying the child\u2019s lacerated liver. The appellant in Woodard was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death as a result of the heinous beating he administered on the two-year child who was left in his care. The appellant claimed that he only hit the child once, and the cause of death was an accidental drowning after he sent the child upstairs to take a bath. In finding that the trial court properly admitted the photographs of the child, this Court concluded that the images were necessary to illustrate the \u201cnature and extent of [the child\u2019s] injuries\u201d and the photographs \u201crelated directly to the requisite elements of first[-]degree murder .., and that [ajppellant possessed the specific intent to kill.\u201d Woodard at 187, 129 A.3d at 495, 2015 WL 7767271, at *10.\nSimilarly, a crucial portion of Appellant\u2019s defense at trial was that Trenton was a clumsy child and many of his bruises were caused by accidental falls. The photographs, while troubling to view, were admissible to explain the nature and extent of Trenton\u2019s injuries. The photographs depict the severity of Appellant\u2019s attacks on Trenton\u2019s four-year-old body and tend to prove that Appellant beat Trenton with the necessary mens rea. See Karenbauer, 552 Pa. at 442, 715 A.2d at 1096 (\u201cIt is well established, and of particular importance to our analysis, that photographs of the victim\u2019s wounds may be relevant to show the assailant\u2019s intent to kill\u201d) (citation omitted).\nHaving found the photographs were properly admitted, we turn now to Appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in allowing the photographs to be viewed by the jury. Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 646 states, in pertinent part, \u201cUpon retiring, the jury may take with it such exhibits as the trial judge deems proper...,\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 646(A). This Court has interpreted this Rule as committing the determination of what objects may be viewed by the jury during deliberations to the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will not reverse that determination absent an abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Rucci, 543 Pa. 261, 285, 670 A.2d 1129, 1141 (1996). An abuse of discretion \u201cis not merely an error of judgment, but if in reaching a conclusion the law is overridden or misapplied, or the judgment exercised is manifestly unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill will, as shown by the evidence of record, discretion is abused.\u201d Id. (quoting Melzer v. Witsberger, 505 Pa. 462, 475, 480 A.2d 991, 997 (1984)).\nHere, the trial court found the probative value of the photographs clearly outweighed any potential for prejudice, as the photographs were necessary to demonstrate the amount of deadly force that Appellant used on Trenton. Appellant does not suggest that the trial court\u2019s decision was the result of partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill will; but rather, he argues the photographs inflamed the passions of the jury. Having viewed the photographs, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the jury to view these nine photographs. Accordingly, this issue affords Appellant no relief.\nIY. AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TORTURE\nAppellant next contends the trial court erred in permitting the aggravating factor of torture, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(8), to be decided by the jury, as the Commonwealth did not present any evidence that Appellant assaulted Trenton in any manner, let alone tortured him. Appellant further argues that Drs. Schmidt and Larabee could not opine how long the acts of abuse took place, and emphasizes that there was no evidence that a weapon was used.\nThe Commonwealth suggests that in an abuse case which culminates in the beating death of the victim, the entire course of the conduct can establish the aggravating circumstance of torture. The Commonwealth highlights the testimony of Drs. Larabee and Schmidt that the bruises covering a substantial portion of Trenton\u2019s body were of different ages, suggesting that Trenton sustained abuse over a period of time. Moreover, the Commonwealth indicates that the abuse was severe enough to cause internal injuries. Finally, the Commonwealth stresses that Trenton would have been experiencing painful symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, fever, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and increased urine output in the days leading to his death.\nThe trial court found that Trenton\u2019s injuries were \u201cpainful, sustained over a period of time, and all were inflicted prior to death.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, dated June 5, 2014 at 17. Moreover, the trial court reasoned if Appellant simply had wanted to kill Trenton, he easily could have done so, but instead he chose to beat the child to death over a period of time; therefore, the evidence amply supported the jury\u2019s finding of torture. Id.\nIn order to establish the aggravating circumstance of torture, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally inflicted on the victim a considerable amount of pain and suffering that was unnecessarily heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.\u201d Karenbauer, 552 Pa. at 447, 715 A.2d at 1099 (citing Commonwealth v. Whitney, 550 Pa. 618, 637, 708 A.2d 471, 480 (1998)). \u201cThe linchpin of the torture analysis is the requirement of an intent to cause pain and suffering in addition to the intent to kill.\u201d Commonwealth v. Ockenhouse, 562 Pa. 481, 493, 756 A.2d 1130, 1136 (2000) (citing Commonwealth v. Edmiston, 535 Pa. 210, 236, 634 A.2d 1078, 1091 (1993)). In other words, the Commonwealth must prove the defendant was not satisfied with the killing alone. Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Caldwell, 516 Pa. 441, 448, 532 A.2d 813, 817 (1987)). It is not enough for the Commonwealth to prove, however, that the victim endured pain before dying. Commonwealth v. Brode, 523 Pa. 20, 28, 564 A.2d 1254, 1258 (1989).\nThis Court has enumerated a number of factors to guide our determination as to whether a murder was committed by means of torture. These factors include, but are not limited to: \u201c(1) the manner in which the murder is committed, including the number and types of wounds inflicted; (2) whether the wounds were inflicted in a vital or non-vital area of the body; (3) whether the victim was conscious during the episode and (4) the duration of the episode.\u201d Ockenhouse, 562 Pa. at 493-94, 756 A.2d at 1137.\nThis Court previously has considered the applicability of the torture aggravator in the context of a murder of a child by a caretaker. For example, in Powell, we determined that the finding of torture was warranted where the child\u2019s multiple injuries, administered at the hands of his father, including blows to vital and non-vital parts of the child\u2019s body, were distinct from the traumatic brain injury that led to his death. Moreover, the evidence in Powell established that the child\u2019s injuries were \u201cpainful, sustained over a long period of time, and the vast majority, if not all, were inflicted prior to death.\u201d Powell, 598 Pa. at 257, 956 A.2d at 426. Similarly, in Karen-bauer, this Court held the finding of the torture aggravator to be appropriate, explaining that had the defendant:\nintended to simply kill the victim, he could have used his prohibitive size advantage and the knife in his possession to do so far more expeditiously than he actually did. Instead, he elected to cause eighteen separate wounds ... not deep enough to cause fatal injury, but certainly deep enough to cause pain to the victim, who remained conscious throughout her ordeal.\nKarenbauer, 552 Pa. at 448, 715 A.2d at 1099.\nMost recently, in Woodard, this Court concluded that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the appellant tortured the child. Specifically, this Court found \u201cthe sheer number of injuries inflicted upon nearly every surface of [the child\u2019s] body both fatal and nonfatal, over the course of hours, would cause unimaginable pain to the young child who had been placed in [ajppellant\u2019s exclusive care.\u201d Woodard at 205, 129 A.3d at 506, 2015 WL 7767271, at *19.\nThe record establishes that herein the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was accompanied by the circumstance of torture. Appellant argues that neither Dr. Schmidt nor Dr. Larabee gave an opinion as to how long the abuse occurred. Both doctors testified, however, that Trenton\u2019s bruises appeared to be of different ages, \u201cwith some appearing to be not more than two to three days old, and others not less than six to twelve hours old,\u201d indicating that Trenton had endured abuse over a period of time. N.T. 3/11/14, jury trial, at 173. Moreover, Forsythe testified that in the weeks leading up to Trenton\u2019s death, she began noticing unusual bruising on his body. Forsythe further testified that following the incident of abuse she discovered on September 10, Trenton began complaining of a stomach ache. Dr. Schmidt confirmed that in addition to severe abdominal pain, Trenton would have been experiencing lethargy, a fever, nausea, and vomiting. Forsythe also stated that Appellant refused to allow her to seek medical attention for Trenton until he became unresponsive approximately three days after the attack. Dr. Larabee verified that if Trenton had presented at the hospital earlier, he \u201clikely would have survived,\u201d as peritonitis is treatable in its early stages. Id. Moreover if Appellant wished to simply kill Trenton, a four-year-old child, he easily could have done so. Instead, like the victim in Powell, Trenton sustained injuries to vital and non-vital parts of the body that were distinct from the blow to his abdomen which caused the peritonitis, indicating that Appellant sought to cause Trenton additional pain and suffering. See Ockenhouse, 562 Pa. at 495, 756 A.2d at 1138 (bruises on non-vital parts of the body may indicate \u201can intent to cause pain and suffering in addition to the intent to kill.\u201d). Accordingly, we find that the Commonwealth proved the aggravating circumstance of torture beyond a reasonable doubt.\nFinally, Appellant argues that the pretrial hearing court erred in failing to dismiss the aggravating circumstance of torture and failing to bar the Commonwealth from seeking the death penalty, as the Commonwealth failed to present evidence that Appellant tortured Trenton. As the Commonwealth indicates, however, the jury found the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to prove torture as an aggravator, and therefore this claim is moot. See Commonwealth v. Walter, 600 Pa. 392, 401, 966 A.2d 560, 565 (2009) (\u201cAny claims of inadequacy [the ajppellant alleges with respect to pre-trial matters have been rendered moot by the subsequent independent judicial judgment confirming the existence of the aggravating circumstance in this case.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\nV. STATUTORY REVIEW\nHaving concluded that Appellant\u2019s claims are without merit, we are required to affirm the judgment of sentence unless we determine that \u201c(i) the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; or (ii) the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d).\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711 (h)(3)(i)\u2014(ii).\nInstantly, the jury found two aggravating circumstances: the offense was committed by means of torture (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(8)), and the victim was a child under the age of 12 (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(16)). At trial, Trooper Pierce testified to the date of Trenton\u2019s birth, as verified by his birth certificate, to establish that Trenton was, in fact, under the age of twelve. Trooper Pierce confirmed that Trenton\u2019s date of birth was February 17, 2007, making Trenton four years old at the time of his death. Moreover, as discussed at length supra, the Commonwealth proved the aggravating circumstance of torture beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAfter careful review of the record, we find Appellant\u2019s death sentence was not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence is affirmed.\nJustice EAKIN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustices BAER and TODD join the opinion.\nChief Justice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. This Court automatically reviews direct appeals from the imposition of death sentences pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(1).\n. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4304(a)(1).\n. Following her statement to police, Forsythe was initially charged with homicide and child endangerment. Forsythe later pled guilty to child endangerment, and the Commonwealth agreed to drop the homicide charges in exchange for her testimony against Appellant. N.T. at 59.\n. The Commonwealth further introduced into evidence the content of a text message Forsythe sent to Appellant on September 3, 2011, ten days prior to Trenton\u2019s death. The message read:\nI'm depressed and you yell at me and shit rather than notice\u2014you notice or not. You have been belittling me. You treat me at times like I\u2019m stupid. You make comments that you hate kids, you can't stand them and you don\u2019t want any. What if I get knocked up, Pat? Do you not see it from my side? Trenton is my only child, he is my miracle, and you say things like that to me. There is [sic] many times I could have lost him. He is my miracle and I love my son with all my heart, nothing can change that. Then you talk about shit about sending him away from me. That would be like asshole taking him from me. It would feel the same way to me. He loves you and hears you say them [sic] things and cry to me that you want him to leave and he asks me if I\u2019m going too. He\u2019s only four. He has a lot to learn. You\u2019re the only dad he has.\nId. at 72-73.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(8).\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 971 l(d)(16).\n. It is the practice of this Court to perform a self-imposed duty to review the sufficiency of evidence underlying the first-degree murder convictions in all death penalty direct appeals, even in the absence of a sufficiency challenge. See Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 26, 454 A.2d 937, 942 n. 3 (1982) cert. denied, 461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983).\n. A review of the record reveals that, while Forsythe concedes that she told police she was at the Family Dollar Store, she could not recall the date. N.T. 3/10/14, jury trial, at 64.\n. The record reflects that Forsythe testified that she did not recall making such a statement. Id. at 66.\n. In his dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Saylor suggests that the instant case and Woodard may cause \u201cconfusion in the area of the law in terms of what this Court means by the word 'inflammatory[,]\u2019 \u201d as the Woodard majority credited the trial court\u2019s finding that the photographs discussed supra were not inflammatory, while we instantly credit the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the photographs of Trenton were inflammatory. Dissenting Opinion at 719-20, 131 A.3d at 42 (Saylor, C J.). We respectfully disagree. As noted supra, the standard of review for the admission of photographs is an abuse of discretion standard. Accordingly, absent a finding that the trial court misapplied the law or the judgment rendered was manifestly unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will, a trial court's evidentiary ruling will stand. Commonwealth v. Davido, 630 Pa. 217, 106 A.3d 611, 645 (2014).\n. Section 971 l(c)(l)(iv) of our Death Penalty Statute \"provides that if the jury finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances, then the verdict must be death. Thus, so long as one aggravator was sustainable, if there were no mitigators, the statute requires the death sentence must be upheld.\u201d Powell, 598 Pa. at 257, 956 A.2d at 426 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Accordingly, if we were to find that the Commonwealth did not establish the aggravating circumstance of torture beyond a reasonable doubt, Appellant would not be entitled to a new penalty phase, as the jury found two aggravating circumstances to apply and no mitigating factors, and Appellant does not dispute that Trenton was under the age of twelve years old at the time of the murder. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(16).\n. The Prothonotary of this Court is directed to transmit to the Governor\u2019s office a full and complete record of the trial, sentencing hearing, imposition of sentence, and the opinion and order of our Court in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 971 l(i).",

Woodard, 634 Pa. 162, 129 A.3d 480, 2015 WL 7767271 (2015), which I incorporate here by reference, I respectfully dissent. In both Woodard and the present case, I would hold that the trial courts erred in admitting into evidence color photographs of nude, battered, open-eyed, deceased children taken during autopsies, encompassing full body portraits and facial closeups. As I explained at greater length in Woodard, I believe that such graphic, visceral portrayals of dead children create an unacceptable risk of influencing jurors to reach conclusions based on factors other than a strict application of the law to the facts. See id. at 212-15, 129 A.3d at 510-12, 2015 WL 7767271, at *24-26 (Saylor, C.J., dissenting). The impact is heightened in the present case, given that the trial court apparently permitted the jurors to have unfettered access to these pictures during their deliberations, see N.T., March 11, 2014, at 265. Accord Woodard, 634 Pa. at 187, 129 A.3d at 494-95, 2015 WL 7767271, at *10 (highlighting, as a factor favoring affirmance of the trial court\u2019s decision to admit autopsy photographs, the fact that \u201cthe jury was not given the photographs to examine during deliberations!;.]\u201d).\n. This case and Woodard suggest the potential for confusion in this area of the law in terms of what this Court means by the word \"inflammatory.\u201d The Woodard majority credited a trial court\u2019s finding that one set of autopsy photographs of a naked, battered child were not inflammatory, see Woodard, 634 Pa. at 186-88, 129 A.3d at 494-95, 2015 WL 7767271, at *10; whereas, the present majority credits another trial court\u2019s finding that similar pictures were inflammatory, See Majority Opinion at 712, 131 A.3d at 37-38. The majority, however, provides no explanation for why the visceral impact of the two sets of photographs upon lay jurors may have been different.\nFrom my own point of view, having reviewed both sets of pictures, I fail to see any material difference in this regard.",
