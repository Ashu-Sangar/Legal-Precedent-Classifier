The statute provides that “[pjarents are liable for the support of their children....” 23 Pa.C.S. § 4321. As both parties concede, the support statute and its corresponding rules do not define “parent” or “child.” However, we reject both parties’ suggested definition of “parent” for purposes of this case. Mother would like us to adopt the definition found in the Child Protective Services regulations, 55 Pa.Code § 3490.4 (defining “parent” as “[a] biological parent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian”), while Stepfather proposes a competing definition found in the Liability for Tortious Acts of Children chapter within the Domestic Relations Code. 23 Pa.C.S. § 5501 (defining “parent” as “natural or adoptive parents”). Although the subjects of child protective services and tortious acts of children both deal with children, neither chapter is more than tenuously related to child support.

Moreover, <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>accepting either definition would ignore the definition of a parent for support purposes as it has developed in our case law.

Rather, courts have looked to whether a nonparent has taken affirmative steps to act as a legal parent so that he or she should be treated as a legal parent. For instance, employing the common-law doctrine of paternity by estoppel, we have found a stepparent could be liable for child support where he has held a child out as his legal child. <em>Fish v.

The doctrine of paternity by estoppel provides that where a party assertively holds himself out as a child’s father, that party may be estopped from subsequently denying this status. The rationale behind the doctrine is “achieving fairness as between the parents by holding them, both mother and father, to their prior conduct regarding the paternity of the child” because children should be secure in knowing who are their parents. <em><a href="/a2d/741/0721-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="741 A.2d 721" data-case-ids="11655939,837096" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0721-01,/pa/559/0523-02">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/741/0721-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="741 A.2d 721" data-case-ids="11655939,837096" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0721-01,/pa/559/0523-02">at 723</a>.</p>

Biological paternity obviously is a primary means of establishing legal parentage, <em>accord </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 4343 (providing for genetic testing as a means to establish paternity); adoption is another avenue. <em>See In re Davies’ Adoption, </em><a href="/pa/353/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="353 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="466036" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0579-01">353 Pa. 579</a>, 590, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.2d%20252" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="46 A.2d 252">46 A.2d 252</a>, 257 (1946). Beyond that, the common law has recognized a presumption of paternity and the doctrines of paternity by estoppel, <em>see generally K.E.M. v. P.C.S., </em><a href="/pa/614/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="614 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="4207418" data-case-paths="/pa/614/0508-01">614 Pa. 508</a>, 523-30, <a href="/pa/614/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="38 A.3d 798" data-case-ids="4207418,7297060" data-case-paths="/pa/614/0508-01,/a3d/38/0798-01">38 A.3d 798</a>, 806-11 (2012), neither of which appears to be the basis for the majority’s decision or an appropriate ground for establishing legal parenthood under the facts of the present case.</p>
    <p id="b687-7" data-blocks='[["BL_687.8",687,[175,1406,1154,464]]]'>Instead, the majority seems to apply a looser equitable construct. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 641, 130 A.3d at 771 (“Equity prohibits Stepfather from disavowing his parental status to avoid a support obligation to the children he has so vigorously sought to parent”). In this regard, the majority premises Appellee’s status as a parent on his “instigating] litigation to achieve all the rights of parenthood at the cost of interfering with the rights of a fit parent.” <em>Id. </em>at 641, 130 A.3d at 771.</p>
    <p id="b687-8" data-blocks='[["BL_687.9",687,[176,1907,1154,476]]]'>I differ with the majority’s approach for several reasons. First, I note that Appellant’s complaint for child support was dismissed at the pleadings stage. Thus, there is no developed evidentiary record available to support a full and balanced inquiry into the overarching equities involved. <em>Cf. K.E.M., </em><a href="/pa/614/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="614 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="4207418" data-case-paths="/pa/614/0508-01">614 Pa. at 529</a>, <a href="/pa/614/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="38 A.3d 798" data-case-ids="4207418,7297060" data-case-paths="/pa/614/0508-01,/a3d/38/0798-01">38 A.3d at 810</a> (limiting the application of paternity by estoppel to instances in which “it can be shown, <em>on a developed record, </em>that it is in the best interests of the involved child” (emphasis added)).</p>

      <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>I also observe that, in order to succeed in securing custody rights, Appellee was required to demonstrate clear and convincing reasons to overcome the strong presumption that custody should have been awarded to Appellant. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 5327(b). Furthermore, at least per the view of the family court, Appellant has engaged in a course of “contemptuous” conduct relative to her treatment of the parties’ prior custody agreement. <em>See A.S. v. I.S., </em>No, 2010-0038, <em>slip op. </em>at 4 (C.P. Montgomery July 8, 2013). At the very least, to the degree that this case should turn on equitable factors, it would seem to me that there is a fuller range of these considerations to be evaluated by a fact-finder.</p>
    <p id="b688-5" data-blocks='[["BL_688.4",688,[269,992,1157,575]]]'>More broadly, I am uncomfortable with the majority’s fashioning of a new doctrine of parentage. The Legislature has seen fit to accord standing to pursue custody to those <em>in loco parentis </em>to children in furtherance of the children’s best interests. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 5324(2). The Assembly has not, however, concomitantly adjusted the law of support. As there are mixed policy considerations involved, <em>see, e.g., </em>Leslie Joan Harris, <em>The Basis for Legal Parentage and the Clash Between Custody and Child Support, </em><a href="/citations/?q=42%20Ind.%20L.%20Rev.%20611" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="42 Ind. L. Rev. 611">42 Ind. L. Rev. 611</a> (2009), I believe it is the Legislature’s purview to consider whether such adjustments should be implemented.</p>
    <p id="b688-6" data-blocks='[["BL_688.5",688,[268,1589,1153,363]]]'>As an aside, I note that in some jurisdictions, while an individual who voluntarily accepts custody of a stepchild may be held liable for support, such a person has the option of surrendering custody to alleviate the support obligation. <em>See, e.g., Foust v. Montez-Torres, </em><a href="/sw3d/456/0736-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="2015 Ark. 66" data-case-ids="6880417" data-case-paths="/sw3d/456/0736-01">2015 Ark. 66</a>, <a href="/sw3d/456/0736-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="2015 Ark. 66" data-case-ids="6880417" data-case-paths="/sw3d/456/0736-01">456 S.W.3d 736</a>, 738 (2015).

The award of equal, shared, physical and <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>legal custody to a non-parent (as opposed to visitation) over and against a fit parents wishes does, in my mind, raise serious constitutional concerns.
