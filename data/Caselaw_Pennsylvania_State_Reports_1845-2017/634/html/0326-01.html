Specifically, the Department declared that if an officer was properly notified at least 48 hours ahead of time of a court appearance on a scheduled day off, and the case was continued until the next day, the officer would not be entitled to the premium overtime, even if he did not receive additional notification. The Department reasoned that, as the officer had been notified, there was no disruption to his or her personal schedule. In response, the FOP filed grievances pursuant to the grievance arbitration clause of the Agreement, seeking a determination that the Department did not properly comply with Section 14 of the 2009 Award. While those grievances were pending, however, the FOP also sought an immediate hearing before the Panel to resolve issues which arose from the City’s implementation of the 2009 Award’s court notice provisions, pursuant to the retainer of jurisdiction provision. 2009 Award, § 22.</p>

      <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>In response, the City submitted a proposal, 11 days before the hearing, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>that the City be permitted to provide officers notice of court appearances electronically through a telephone number or email. As background, evidently as far back as 1999, when the Department received notice from the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, or a subpoena from private counsel, that a police officer was needed to appear in court, notification to the officer was provided in person, through the officer’s platoon commander, who was required to ensure that the officer received and signed the notice. In rare instances, officers were notified by messenger or telephone, if time or circumstances did not permit notification by the platoon commander. If the officer did not comply with the notice, he or she could have been subjected to discipline. The Department’s proposed notification procedures changed this system, and included a process by which notification was deemed to be sufficient if a message was left on an officer’s voicemail, and, further, such notice was considered to be sufficient for all court appearances, not just those to be completed within 48 hours.</p>
    <p id="b375-4" data-blocks='[["BL_375.4",375,[193,1430,1155,960]]]'>The FOP responded that the Panel did not have the jurisdiction or authority to grant the City’s request, as the proposal implicated the manner of notice, which was not the subject of Section 14, and, further, that implementation of Section 14 was the only issue then before the Panel. The City asserted that, by returning to the Panel (in interest arbitration) concerning the implementation of Section 14, the FOP brought the manner of notification within the Panel’s jurisdiction and authority. Moreover, the City claimed that the manner of notification was linked to the issue of payment of the premium overtime for late notification, as well as the relaxed residency requirements in Section 6. More specifically, with respect to the second point, the City maintained that, in light of the relaxed residency requirement for officers, electronic notification was required to ensure that greater than 48 hours notice was given to officers so that their lives would not be disrupted and so that the City would not have to pay premium overtime for tardy notice.</p>

The Panel majority recognized that the notice issue was not before the Panel during the 2009 interest arbitration, but, nevertheless, believed it was “part-and-parcel” of Section 14’s implementation. The POP-appointed arbitrator filed a vigorous dissent, asserting that the majority had changed what he believed to be a grievance arbitration proceeding into an interest arbitration proceeding, and, thereby altered the terms of the 2009 Award without proper authority.

The court, after determining that the matter was an appeal of an interest arbitration award, and not the appeal of a grievance award, opined that the Panel did not exceed its powers in issuing Paragraph 4 of the 2011 Award, as, in its view, the issue of manner of notification was properly before the Panel. More pointedly, the court determined that the Panel did what the FOP requested the Panel to do—resolve issues surrounding the implementation of Section 14 of the 2009 Award, a matter for which the Panel specifically retained jurisdiction. Like the Panel, the trial court concluded that the manner of notification and payment of premium overtime were linked, and, as the Panel was not limited to addressing whether the premium overtime pay provided for in Section 14 could be given, it possessed the authority to include Paragraph 4 in the 2011 <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>Award in crafting the appropriate relief.

Moreover, the majority pointed out that the 2011 Award regarding how notices are delivered relates directly to how the court notification provision is implemented. Further, the majority opined that, as the method of delivery of notice was not explicitly provided for in the 2009 Award, Paragraph 4 of the 2011 Award did not impermissibly alter the prior award. Thus, the majority concluded the Panel did not exceed its authority, and it affirmed the arbitration award.</p>

In interest arbitration, an arbitration panel determines the terms and conditions of employment after the parties fail to reach an agreement through collective bargaining negotiations. Interest arbitration is, in essence, the process by which the parties, through a neutral arbitrator or panel, create a collective bargaining agreement. This process may be contrasted with grievance arbitration, in which the parties dispute the proper interpretation or application of provisions contained in an existing collective bargaining agreement. Thus, while interest arbitration leads to the creation of a collective bargaining agreement, grievance arbitration is the process by which the parties settle disputes concerning the interpretation or application of an extant collective bargaining agreement. In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>it appears that there was some controversy below as to whether this appeal involved interest arbitration or the review of a grievance arbitration award. Before us, however, the FOP does not seriously dispute that the issue should be considered a vestige of an interest arbitration award, 43 P.S. § 217.7, and, thus, we proceed accordingly.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

This approach, as asserted by the FOP, is based in notions of adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard, as well as based in Act 111 which requires the submission of the issues in dispute at least 110 days prior to the start of the fiscal year. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 217.2. Applying these guidelines, the FOP maintains that at no point during the negotiations or the 2009 interest arbitration proceedings did the City or the FOP seek modification of the existing manner of officer notification. The FOP asserts that, in 2011, the Panel did not limit itself to the narrow issue before it—whether, in implementing Section 14 of the 2009 Award, the City had violated the Agreement by failing to pay officers who had received less than 48 hours’ notice for court at 2.5 times their pay. Rather, the Commonwealth Court ignored these limiting principles and impermissibly expanded the concept of notification to <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>include manner of notice which, according to the FOP, rewrites a section of the Agreement which was never placed at issue by the City or the FOP. The FOP claims that compensation for court appearances is distinct from the manner of notification, and, according to the FOP, the Panel had the authority only to require that the 2009 Award be implemented. The FOP offers that, under the Commonwealth Court’s approach, any issue which remotely touches an issue already decided may be revisited, and completely re-written, and, in the instant case, expanded, as the notice provision applies now to all court appearances. The FOP stresses that this requires officers, at their own expense, to purchase smart phones and answering machines, and face discipline if they do not comply. Finally, the FOP warns that such an open-ended approach to arbitration will disrupt the finality sought by the legislature when it enacted Act 111 and its dispute resolution process.</p>

Lutz Lodge No. 5, </em><a href="/a3d/84/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="84 A.3d 343" data-case-ids="7264800" data-case-paths="/a3d/84/0343-01">84 A.3d at </a>351 n. 11, looking back to the 2009 Award proceedings and offering that the FOP’s proposal requested that no discipline be imposed on an employee for less than 48 hours <em>vnitten </em>notice. The Panel did not include this limitation in its Award. This, according to the City, placed the issue of court notices, and the manner of notification (in writing) of court notices before the Panel in 2009. The City also claims that the manner of notification had never been part of a collective bargaining agreement, but was memorialized in a “Department Directive,” which was a unilaterally-adopted management policy, and, thus, was evidence that the Panel did not disrupt an existing agreement. Related thereto, the City points out that the FOP invoked the Panel’s jurisdiction to resolve differences between the parties on the implementation of the 2009 Award, and, after the FOP’s request for a hearing, the FOP did not object to the City’s subsequent submission regarding electronic notice in the hearings which culminated in the 2011 Award. Thus, the City argues the Panel did not <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>exceed its authority as the issue of the manner of notification was at all times properly before the Panel.</p>
    <p id="b384-4" data-blocks='[["BL_384.4",384,[264,453,1152,726]]]'>Similarly, the City maintains that the 2011 Award dealt with implementation of the 2009 Award, which subsumed the issue of manner of notification, as the 2009 Award, which granted premium overtime and allowed officers to live outside of the City, substantially increased the financial and operational burden on the Department to deliver court notices to officers. Moreover, the City offers that, once an issue is properly in dispute, the arbitration panel may resolve that issue in a fair manner within the total context of the award. Therefore, the City argues that, once the FOP sought to reconvene the Panel regarding notice implementation issues, the City, to save resources and avoid unnecessary litigation, permissibly chose to place its proposed changes to the manner of notification before the Panel as well.</p>

Further, the City maintains that, in its 2011 Award, the Panel did not create new terms out of whole cloth, but merely addressed implementation issues which were before it, and that the 2011 Award was not inconsistent with any contract term between the parties. Thus, the City argues the Panel did not “re-write” the Agreement, as alleged by the FOP. Moreover, the City contends that, because police officers were previously required to provide a telephone number for emergency notification, the electronic delivery of notices is not a significant change in the parties' existing non-contractual practice. Further, the City emphasizes that the FOP offered no evidence at the hearing as to any burden on the officers due to the proposed electronic notification. Thus, not only was the 2011 Award consistent with the prior Act 111 procedures, according to the City, the actual award was consistent with, and a mere logical expansion of, existing practice. Finally, contrary to the FOP’s claims, the City argues that the 2011 Award complied with the FOP’s <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>due process rights, as the FOP invoked the Panel’s jurisdiction, had notice of the issues in advance of the hearing, was represented by counsel, and had the opportunity to present evidence.</p>

Specifically, Act 111 requires that collective bargaining “shall begin at least six months before the start of the fiscal year of the political subdivision ... and any requests for arbitration, as herein provided, shall be made at least one hundred ten days before the start of the fiscal year.” 43 P.S. § 217.2.

Specifically, when impasse is reached, “either party to the dispute, after written notice to the other party containing specifications of the issue or issues in dispute, may request the appointment of a board of arbitration.” 43 P.S. § 217.4. While this Court has not spoken directly to this issue in this context, the Commonwealth Court has for decades indicated that Act 111 arbitrators may decide only those matters submitted to them, and an award outside of the issues presented is unenforceable. <em>See, e.g., City of Wilkes-Barre v.

Indeed, we reject the City’s, and the Commonwealth Court’s, somewhat technical reasoning that, because the FOP requested “48 hours written notice,” that the method of delivery was at issue in 2009, as written notice was part of the existing practice regarding delivery at that time. Rather, the discrete issue of the manner of notification came to the fore only when raised by the City at the time the FOP sought to enforce implementation of the 2009 Award. Related thereto, the jurisdictional basis for the Panel’s consideration of questions of implementation, by its plain language, is limited to the implementation of the terms of the 2009 Award. <em>See </em>2009 Award, § 22 (“The Panel shall retain jurisdiction over this Award in order to resolve any disputes <em>regarding implementation of its terms.” </em>(emphasis added)).

The 2009 Award did not address in any fashion the manner in which notices were to be distributed. The 2011 Award, however, made drastic changes to the existing and long-standing manner of notification procedure. Yet, the timing of notification and premium overtime compensation for an officer’s court appearance are simply not directly related to, or even dependent upon, the manner of notification. The manner of notifica<a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>tion is not implicit in, nor inherently comingled with, the distinct issue of notice compensation.

Generally, the question of whether a tribunal has jurisdiction to decide an issue focuses upon whether that tribunal is competent to determine controversies of the general class to which the case presented for its consideration belongs. <em>Heath v. WCAB (Pa. Bd. of Prob. &amp; Parole), </em><a href="/pa/580/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="580 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1100633" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0174-01">580 Pa. 174</a>, <a href="/pa/580/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="860 A.2d 25" data-case-ids="1100633,9145571" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0174-01,/a2d/860/0025-01">860 A.2d 25</a>, 29 (2004). Consistent therewith, our Court has explained that the question of an Act 111 arbitrator's jurisdiction traditionally poses the single question: "did the decision-maker in the adjudicatory process act in that general class of controversies that the law empowers it to consider.” <em>City of Philadelphia v. Int’l Ass’n of Firefighters, Local 22, </em><a href="/pa/606/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="606 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="4198867" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0447-01">606 Pa. 447</a>, <a href="/pa/606/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="999 A.2d 555" data-case-ids="4198867,7287773" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0447-01,/a2d/999/0555-01">999 A.2d 555</a>, 564 (2010). We find that the Commonwealth Court below properly concluded that "jurisdiction is not at issue since there is no question that the Panel was initially convened and subsequently reconvened to resolve disputes arising out of the [Agreement’s] court notice provision.” <em>Michael G. Lutz Lodge No. 5, </em><a href="/a3d/84/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="84 A.3d 343" data-case-ids="7264800" data-case-paths="/a3d/84/0343-01">84 A.3d at 351</a>.

The Panel explicitly retained jurisdiction in Section 22 of the 2009 Award, and thus the FOP properly asked the Panel to resolve issues surrounding implementation of Section 14 of the award. The FOP’s dissatisfaction with the result claims the relief granted went beyond the relief requested, but interest arbitration panels are not limited to granting the relief requested by the party raising the issue. <em>See City of Philadelphia v.

Certainly timing and manner are not synonymous, but neither are they unrelated. The 2009 Award explicitly provided consequences for failing to comply with the policy on time and manner of notice, demonstrating the two issues are intertwined. Further, implementation of the 2009 Award’s new residency requirements, allowing certain officers to live outside the city limits, would have an obvious effect on the logistics of notice. If the Department were now obliged to send uniformed officers to wherever an officer lives, the operational and financial costs to the City could be significant; without modification, it could mean taking officers off patrols to drive outside the City simply to hand-deliver court notices.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> In this day of technological sophistication and ubiquitous cell phones and messaging, the manner of notice, particularly given the bargained-for expansion in geographic distribution of those to whom notice is given, seems a proper matter for the Panel—I cannot find that connection unreasonable.</p>

I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority’s application of that settled law to the facts presented. Here, the 2009 interest arbitration award provided for overtime pay to police officers who did not receive timely notice of court appearances scheduled to occur on their days off. Notably, the panel expressly retained jurisdiction to resolve disputes regarding implementation of the 2009 award. Various disputes, in fact, arose, one of which involved the method of providing notice of court appearances, particularly because the 2009 award also permitted certain police officers to live outside the City of Philadelphia, thereby making personal notice impracticable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

Accordingly, I do not believe that the 2011 interest arbitration panel exceeded its authority by adjudicating the precise implementation issues that it retained jurisdiction to resolve.</p>

    <blockquote id="b391-4" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[238,505,1110,311]]]'>Effective January 1, 2010, officers who do not receive notification at least 48 hours in advance of the time they are directed to appear for a required court appearance (other than preliminary hearing) scheduled for a date the officer is not scheduled to work, shall be paid a minimum of 4 hours overtime at a rate of 2.5 times the employee’s regular rate.</blockquote>
    <p id="aja-dedup-0" data-blocks='[["BL_391.5",391,[194,835,1157,894]]]'>2009 Interest Arbitration Award dated December 18, 2009, § 14. Section 14 was intended to address concerns that police officers were receiving notices to appear in court the night before or the morning of a scheduled hearing on an officer’s day off, thereby disrupting the officer’s personal plans for that day. The next relevant provision in the 2009 award stated that officers with five or more years of service as a police officer no longer have to reside in the City of Philadelphia. <em><a href="/pa/606/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="999 A.2d 555" data-case-ids="4198867,7287773" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0447-01,/a2d/999/0555-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 6. Finally, and most significantly, Section 22 of the 2009 award provided that the interest arbitration panel “shall retain jurisdiction over this Award in order to resolve any disputes regarding implementation of its terms.” <em><a href="/pa/606/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="999 A.2d 555" data-case-ids="4198867,7287773" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0447-01,/a2d/999/0555-01">Id.,</a> </em>§ 22. The panel presumably retained jurisdiction to assist the parties, as an extension of the interest arbitration process, in resolving issues that were not identifiable prior to entry of the award and which, instead, surfaced as a direct result of a provision of the award.</p>
    <p id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.6",391,[196,1758,1152,630]],["BL_392.1",392,[267,338,1151,292]]]'>The record establishes that both parties invoked the interest arbitration panel’s retained jurisdiction to procure review of issues arising from the implementation of the 2009 award. In March of 2010, the Michael G. Lutz Lodge No. 5 of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) specifically requested that the interest arbitration panel exercise its authority under Section 22 to resolve implementation issues that had arisen regarding Section 14’s grant of overtime for insufficient notice to police officers. Specifically, the FOP objected to a statement issued by the Philadelphia Police Department (Department) indicating that if an officer was notified at least 48 hours before a court appearance on a scheduled day off and <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>the case was continued until the next day, the officer would not be entitled to overtime, even if additional notification for the next day was not given. The FOP objected to the Department’s reasoning that, under those circumstances, there was no disruption to the police officer’s personal schedule because the officer received sufficient notice.</p>
    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[266,657,1157,558]]]'>In response, the City raised its own implementation issue regarding court notices mandated by the 2009 award, and advocated for electronic delivery of notices through telephone or email. It contended that Section 14’s requirement that overtime must be paid to officers notified within 48 hours of court appearances, coupled with Section 6’s changed residency requirement applicable to enumerated police officers, made it more difficult and costly to effectuate notice, as discussed in footnote one, <em>supra. </em>A hearing was held, at which both parties provided testimony and evidence in favor of their respective positions on the delivery of notice issue.</p>
    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[266,1235,1153,556]]]'>The majority acknowledges these facts, but concludes that the 2011 interest arbitration panel exceeded its authority by addressing the manner of notification issue because the parties did not raise it before the 2009 interest arbitration panel, and because this issue is not “reasonably subsumed in, or ‘part-and-parcel’ of, the overall notice compensation question.” Majority Opinion at 343, 129 A.3d at 1231. It concludes that “the timing of notification and premium overtime compensation for an officer’s court appearance are simply not directly related to, or even dependent upon, the manner of notification.” <em>Id. </em>at 343, 129 A.3d at 1231.</p>

Leaving the manner of <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>notification untouched would be a dereliction in the Board’s responsibility to resolve issues pertaining to the implementation of the Award’s substance”); Trial Court Opinion, Mar. 6, 2013, at 14-15 (holding that “the issue of how court notices are delivered relates directly to how the court notification provision is implemented ... the method of that notification is an inseparable and inherent part of the process”); Commonwealth Court Opinion, Jan. 2, 2014, at 15 (holding that the 2011 interest arbitration panel proceeding, which examined the method of affording notice of court appearances “directly related to the 2009 Award of mandatory premium overtime in instances when the City fails to give proper notice”).</p>
    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[207,993,1154,953]]]'>I further depart from the majority’s conclusion that because the 2009 award did not address how notices should be delivered, the 2011 interest arbitration panel exceeded its powers in entertaining the inquiry. The lack of guidance on how the City must provide the notice to avoid the payment of substantial overtime is precisely why the issue of delivery of notice constitutes an issue regarding implementation of the 2009 award, which the interest arbitration panel retained jurisdiction to resolve. Moreover, during the proceedings leading up to the 2009 award, the City argued vigorously against requiring the 48-hour notice of court appearances. Thus, it had no reason to propose changes to existing notice procedures until after receiving the arbitration panel’s decision. As the trial court noted, “[sjince the full impact of the 2009 Award could not be determined until it was actually issued, the FOP’s complaint that the City failed to address and seek changes to the practice before the 2009 Award was issued and implemented was absurd.” Trial Court Opinion at 15.</p>
    <p id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[206,1970,1156,405]]]'>Accordingly, I would hold that the 2011 interest arbitration panel did not exceed its authority in addressing the delivery of notice issue, but decided an implementation issue properly before it pursuant to its retained jurisdiction. Given our narrow <em>certiorari </em>standard of review in Act 111 arbitration cases, I would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed the trial court’s denial of the FOP’s petition to vacate the 2011 interest arbitration award.</p>

In this regard, it is important to appreciate that so long as all police officers lived within City boundaries, officers conducting roving patrols could, if necessary, deliver notice at officers’ homes while performing routine police activities. When the officers were permitted to live outside the City’s confines, however, personal notice would require officers to travel to whatever distant points an officer chose to reside, potentially placing a substantial and costly burden upon the City.</p>
