UPMC also maintains a controlling interest in an “insurance holding company” which includes the “UPMC Health Plan” which covers approximately 2 million people in western Pennsylvania. <em>Id. </em>As explained by the Commonwealth, under this arrangement, UPMC operates an “integrated health care delivery system” whereby one entity provides health insurance, and, also, delivers health care services through physicians, hospitals, and other ancillary medical care facilities. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>

Commonwealth Court Opinion, 6/29/15, at 3 n. 3; Commonwealth Petition for Review, 6/27/14, at 5. Highmark’s health care insurance plans are sold, commercially, to businesses and individuals, and, at the time of the <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>filings in this matter, were utilized by more than 60 percent of the people in the western Pennsylvania region's health care market.

Stipulations Between the Commonwealth and UPMC, 5/27/15, at 1, However, in the Spring of 2011, UPMC announced it would not agree to renew or renegotiate these provider agreements with Highmark, the majority of which were set to expire on June 30, 2012. <em>Id. </em>UPMC cited as its reason Highmark’s proposed affiliation with the West Penn Allegheny Health System, which would create another integrated health care delivery system in competition with the UPMC system. Commonwealth Petition for Review, 6/27/14, at 5-6. The Commonwealth considered the expiration of these agreements as having deleterious consequences for members of Highmark’s health insurance plans because, according to the Commonwealth, these members would be subjected to “significantly higher out-of-network charges for their health care needs unless they either switched their health care provider away from UPMC or their health plan away from Highmark to one of the health insurers with which UPMC had contracted, albeit at higher prices.” <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>

This global amendment also provided that UPMC and Highmark would “negotiate rates and terms for continued Highmark member access to certain UPMC services on an in-network basis effective upon termination of the Medicare Advantage Provider Agreements, including Western Psychiatric, certain oncological services, UPMC Bedford, and UPMC Northwest.” Amendment to Medicare Advantage Provider Agreements, 9/13/12, at 2. Additionally, the global amendment specified that the provider agreements could not be terminated before December 31, 2014, and that, subsequently, each provider agreement would automatically renew from year to year, unless either party provided notice of termination no later than April 1 of that year.

Insurance Department Order, 4/29/13, at 22. Thereafter, the already strained relations between UPMC and Highmark deteriorated precipitously.

The Commonwealth noted that, rather than attempting to negotiate over these matters, the parties escalated their dispute and “engaged in extensive and costly lobbying, advertising campaigns, and litigation which ... contributed to the public’s confusion and misunderstanding.” <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>

In the letter, Highmark informed UPMC that, effective April 1, 2014—the date on which the provider agreements were set to renew—it would be revising its outpatient fee schedule under its commercial and Medicare Advantage policy to reduce the fees it paid for the administration of the drugs due to objections raised by its customers, public officials, and other members of the community to these billing practices.

As specific relief, the Commonwealth requested, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commonwealth Court find the public to be a third-party beneficiary and, also, require the parties to enter into a variety of agreements to settle disputed issues regarding access to medical care at UPMC facilities by Highmark subscribers after the expiration of the provider agreements on December 31, 2014.

Commonwealth Court Opinion, 6/29/15, at 5. Consequently, attorneys representing the Commonwealth parties were forced to engage in what the OAG termed “shuttle” diplomacy, Brief of the Attorney General at 12, whereby they would ferry offers and counteroffers back and forth between the parties. Eventually, the Commonwealth secured a comprehensive agreement between the parties in the form of a consent decree, but, because the parties refused to sign a common document, two final separate consent decrees were prepared—one for High-mark and one for UPMC (collectively, the “Consent Decrees”). Each party’s decree has identical provisions except for the fact that Highmark’s Consent Decree requires Highmark to comply with its terms, and UPMC’s Consent Decree requires UPMC to comply with its terms.

President Rice-Johnson testified that the vulnerable populations clause was the subject of extensive back and forth negotiations between the parties, and that the second sentence of that clause had originally included Medicare Advantage, but that Highmark requested that program be deleted from that sentence because Highmark wanted to ensure that it was protected if it offered other Medicare Advantage programs such as its Community Blue program. <em>Id. </em>at 210-11, 215.

Consequently, in her view, because the third sentence of the vulnerable populations clause obligated UPMC to treat all Medicare participating consumers as “In-Network,” and the Consent Decree further defined “In-Network” as when a health care provider “has contracted” with the insurer to provide health care services at negotiated rates, this sentence required UPMC to be in contract with Highmark for the duration of the Consent Decree. <em>Id. </em>at 215, 270, 273-74.

She noted that Highmark had claimed only that it had the right to change fee schedules under the provider agreements in April 2014, when those agreements were renewed with those changed fee schedules, but she denied that Highmark took the position that it had the right to change such rates under the Medicare Advantage contracts during the term of the Consent Decree. She testified that Highmark viewed the Consent Decree as limiting its ability to make any further such changes: “Once we entered into the arrangement with the Consent Decree, that limited our ability to do so.

Had the drafters intended to limit UPMC’s duty to give in-network treatment only to Medicare participants, it easily could have stated ‘Medicare’ instead of ‘Medicare participating consumers’ as it does in the first sentence. However, the first sentence groups together Medicare and [Medicare Advantage] participants, and this grouping reappears as the phrase ‘Medicare participating consumers’ in the third sentence.

Yet, the parties agree that these rates are set exclusively by CMS and cannot be abrogated by private contract.

UPMC refers to an internal strategy discussion by Highmark Senior Vice President Gray in which she discussed the impact the terminations would have on their business. According to UPMC, the fact that Gray discussed this fact was evidence of High-mark’s belief that UPMC had the right to execute such a termination. UPMC also cites a March 13, 2015 letter from the Chief Legal Officer of Highmark, Thomas Van Kirk, to the Chief Legal Officer of UPMC, Thomas McGough, in which it agreed to refrain from making unilateral changes to rates and fees in its Medicare Advantage contracts if UPMC agreed to keep them in effect for the duration of the Consent Decree.</p>

UPMC points to the fact that the Consent Decree provides that it is not to be construed as a contract extension. UPMC Brief at 37 (quoting Consent Decree at 1(A)). With respect to the third sentence of the vulnerable populations clause, UPMC argues that it appears as it did throughout the original negotiations of the Consent Decrees; thus, it contends that the absence of any change to the phrase “Medicare participating consumers” indicated the parties’ intent to give that term its original meaning—i.e., traditional Medicare as used in the first sentence of the vulnerable populations clause. UPMC points out that Medicare and Medicare Advantage are defined separately in that sentence, and, if Medicare and Medicare Advantage were to be considered to be the same program, then there would have been no need to define them separately. UPMC argues that the term Medicare cannot be given different meanings in adjacent sentences. In UPMC’s view, construing Medicare and Medicare Advantage distinctly would be consistent with how the federal government treats both programs since they are created by different statutes and are governed by different regulations, and a subscriber cannot be in both programs at once.</p>

UPMC further avers that, if all Medicare related programs are included within “Medicare participating consumers,” such as Medi-gap, which is also a Medicare related program, then it would render coordination of benefits impossible as a matter of law.

Highmark argues that Judge Pellegrini properly recognized that the fundamental purpose of the negotiation and entry of the Consent Decree was to ensure that vulnerable populations, such as senior citizens, would be provided with medical services, and the Consent Decree served to lessen the anxiety of those vulnerable populations who were Highmark subscribers by securing in-network access to UPMC physicians and facilities until 2019.</p>

Highmark contends that the third sentence of the vulnerable populations clause serves the purpose of providing that protection to these individuals “by requiring UPMC to treat ‘all Medicare participating consumers,’ which includes Medicare Advantage members, as In-Network.” Highmark Brief at 28.

Highmark highlights that, as Rice-Johnson’s testimony showed at the hearing, the reason that Medicare Advantage was deleted from the second sentence was so that it could offer its Community Blue program without being accused of making a unilateral change to its Medicare Advantage program in violation of the restrictions of that sentence. Highmark asserts that, in making this deletion, it had no intention to exclude the subscribers to its existing Medicare Advantage programs— Security Blue and Freedom Blue—from the protections of the vulnerable populations clause, and that it considered those subscribers to still be protected under the third sentence of the clause.</p>

In order to ensure that those covered or eligible to be covered by these Medicare Advantage programs, and all other individuals considered vulnerable populations, would have long-term access to UPMC facilities beyond the time periods established by the parties in the provider agreements then in place, the Commonwealth specifically requested that the Commonwealth Court order the parties into a new agreement, and also to provide a mechanism—last best offer arbitration—whereby the rates for such access would be determined if the parties, as anticipated, could not negotiate such rates.

Critically, both Sampson’s testimony, as well as the official materials from the federal agency which administers the Medicare program, CMS, establish that, in the view of the federal government, if an individual is enrolled in Medicare Advantage program, that individual is still considered to be in the federal Medicare program.

As Highmark President Rice-Johnson’s testimony at the hearing established, which was not otherwise disputed, there is no negotiation between the federal government and a health care provider who agrees with the federal government to become a participating provider in Part A and B of the Medicare program. The provider must accept the participating provider rates paid by CMS. Thus, as Judge Pellegrini found, if the phrase “Medicare participating consumers” is restricted to only those participants in Medicare Parts A and B, the Consent Decree would purport to allow negotiation of those rates, even though such rates are determined by CMS and not subject to negotiation under federal law. Such an interpretation would, therefore, be illegal as Judge Pellegrini determined. Since we do not countenance the interpretation of a contract which would render it illegal or incapable of performance, but, rather, construe a contract to give legal effect to every provision therein, we likewise refuse to interpret the third sentence in this manner. <em>Murphy; see also </em>Restatement of Contracts (2d) § 203(a) (“an interpretation which gives a reasonable, lawful, and effective meaning to all [contractual] terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>part unreasonable, unlawful, or of no effect.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">21</a>

The third sentence, while not using the same “continue to contract” terminology, nevertheless obliges UPMC to treat those participants in Highmark Medicare Advantage programs as “In-Network,” and, thus, requires it have a contract with High-mark that establishes negotiated rates for treatment of those in Medicare Advantage programs for which Highmark cur<a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>rently has provider contracts with UPMC, or, if negotiations are fruitless, then such rates will be set by arbitration under Section IV(C)(1)(a)(iii) of the Consent Decree.</p>

Specifically, UPMC claims that Highmark took this position: in the complaint regarding the rates it paid UPMC for oncology drugs it filed in the Allegheny County lawsuit; in a pleading filed on July 9, 2015 in the AHLA arbitration proceedings; in a letter Highmark sent to UPMC on March 13, 2015, in response to UPMC’s notice to Highmark of its material breach; and in an interview in a Medicare Advantage journal.

Highmark avers that, to the contrary, since the time of the entry of the Consent Decree, it has consistently taken the position, as reflected in the aforementioned trial testimony of Rice-Johnson, that it considers itself bound by the rate terms of the Consent Decree, and that, from the time of the entry of the decree forward, it repeatedly averred that it would not change any rates unless it was agreed upon by both parties or arbitrated. Highmark argues that the record reflects it has adhered to this understanding of the scope of the Consent Decree and contends that any actions it took regarding the disputed fees for the oncology drugs, and any public statements related to its right to reimbursement, were regarding the pre-Consent Decree provider agreements between it and UPMC—i.e., the Medicare Advantage provider agreements which renewed before the entry of the Consent Decree on April 1, 2014, and which UPMC is terminating as of December 31, 2015. Highmark argues that the Consent Decree cannot reasonably be read as curtailing its rights to take positions on matters which occurred prior to its entry.</p>

The Commonwealth defends Judge Pellegrini’s interpretation of this sentence as not prohibiting Highmark from challenging the pre-Consent Decree action it took to change the oncology fee schedule prior to the April 1, 2014 renewal deadline. The Commonwealth proffers that it would be absurd to allow UPMC to escape the Consent Decree by citing actions Highmark took before its entry, as such an interpretation would allow UPMC to unilaterally exit the Consent Decree at any time, rendering it an illusory and unenforceable agreement.</p>

As we have discussed, the third sentence of the vulnerable populations clause, set forth above—that “UPMC shall treat all Medicare participating consumers as In-Network”—requires that UPMC and High-mark maintain a contractual relationship which sets “In-Network” reimbursement rates for medical treatment provided to participants in Highmark’s Medicare Advantage plans. Consequently, we read the phrase “these arrangements” appearing in the very next sentence as referring to this contractual relationship.</p>
    <p id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[184,1044,1153,885]]]'>Correspondingly, then, we must construe the phrase “if Highmark should take the position that it has the authority to revise the rates and fees payable under those arrangements unilaterally and materially” to refer to a situation where Highmark takes the position that it has the right to unilaterally and materially change the rates and fees payable to UPMC under the Medicare Advantage plans. We find this phrase to be unambiguous. The phrase’s use of the words “if Highmark should take the position” denotes a conditional future occurrence; thus, as Highmark and the Commonwealth argue, this condition was intended to prospectively apply, from the time of the entry of the decree forward. In other words, it is triggered if Highmark should take the position that it has the right to unilaterally alter the rates and fees it pays to UPMC for patient care under the Medicare Advantage agreements from the date of entry of the Consent Decree through its termination.</p>

However, the record supports the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that Highmark did not consider itself to possess the right to take such unilateral action once the Consent Decrees were entered. To the contrary, the record reflects the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that Highmark consistently disavowed that it had any such right under the Consent Decree to make such changes, and it considered the decree’s specified mechanisms for setting rates for its Highmark Advantage plans, i.e., negotiations and arbitration, to be controlling,</p>
    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[261,892,1153,903]]]'>Highmark’s stance on this subject is best reflected by Rice-Johnson’s testimony at the hearing in the Commonwealth Court: “Once we entered into the arrangement with the Consent Decrees, that limited our ability to [change fee schedules]. So during the period of the Consent Decree forward, we will not change rates unless they are mutually agreed upon or agreed upon through arbitration.” N.T. Hearing, 5/27/15, at 186. Judge Pellegrini credited this testimony in finding the express terms of the Consent Decrees specifically account for, and explicitly recognize Highmark’s right to seek, resolution of the pre-Consent Decree dispute over oncology drug reimbursements. <em>See </em>Consent Decree, § IV(C)(l)(a)(i)(ii) (referring to “rates currently being arbitrated” by UPMC and Highmark).

The clear language of VP-3, when read in conjunction with the defined term “In-Network,” merely provides that “regardless of whether [the consumers] have Medicare as their primary or secondary insurance[,]” “UPMC shall treat” the consumers “as In-Network,” which pertains to “where a health care provider has contracted with a Health Plan to provide specified services <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>for reimbursement at a negotiated rate.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> UPMC Consent Decree, §§ IV(A)(2), II(I). The definition of “In-Network” further operates to protect the consumer by limiting the amount the member can be charged to “no more than the copay, co-insurance, or deductible charged by his or her Health Plan” and instructs that the member “shall not be refused treatment for the specified services in the contract based on his or her Health Plan.” <em>Id. </em>Finally, it provides that the negotiated rate “shall be payment in full for the specified services.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>
      <em>Id. </em>Thus, VP-3 limits the out-of-pocket expense of an individual who has both Medicare (which would pay no <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>more than the CMS designated rate) and another health plan (which would pay up to the in-network rate).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a>

First, I reject the reading of VP-3’s term “Medicare participating consumer” to include consumers with Medicare Advantage. Maj. Op. at 138-41, 129 A.3d at 465-68; Cmwlth. Ct. Op., June 29, 2015, at 27-28. It is beyond cavil, and all parties agree, that Medicare Advantage is an integral part of the Medicare system as Part C, along with the federally operated Medicare Parts A and B. Thus, unmoored to the language of the current provision, it would be eminently reasonable to refer to someone who has Medicare Advantage as a “Medicare participating consumer.” However, the negotiated language of VP-1 distinguishes between “Medicare” and “Medicare Advantage,” such that the term “Medicare,” for <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>purposes of this provision, applies only to the federally operated Medicare Parts A and B, and is distinct from Medicare Advantage, the private-insurer-operated Medicare Part C, Under our rules of contract interpretation, we cannot recognize the drafters’ distinction between the two terms in VP-1 and ignore it in VP-3. <em>See Maloney v. Glosser, </em><a href="/pa/427/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="427 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1910412" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0548-01">427 Pa. 548</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20607" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="235 A.2d 607">235 A.2d 607</a>, 609 (1967) (observing that Williston on Contracts instructs that “a word used by the parties in one sense is to be interpreted as employed in the same sense throughout the writing in the absence of countervailing reasons”); 11 <em>Willi-ston on Contracts </em>§ 32:6.</p>

Maj. Op. at 141, 129 A.3d at 467-68; Cmwlth. Ct. Op., June 29, 2015, at 28. My colleagues accept Highmark’s argument that reading the term “Medicare participating consumer” to mean only a consumer participating in Medicare Parts A and B would require the legal impossibility of UPMC negotiating rates with Medicare. This is a straw man argument created to obfuscate the analysis. As discussed above, VP-3 is not requiring UPMC to negotiate regarding rates but instead dictates the rate that a health care provider can charge for a customer’s treatment and directs that the “in-network” rate of the health plan applies regardless of whether Medicare is the primary or secondary insurer. This plain reading does not suggest any need to negotiate payment rates with Medicare, which all agree are set by the CMS.</p>

Ct. Op., June 29, 2015, at 27-28. Respectfully, the drafters could not have used only the term Medicare because the provision is addressing the consumers, not the plan. Specifically, the sentence is addressing consumers who have multiple insurance coverages, one of which is <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>Medicare. Thus, “Medicare participating” is an adjective phrase describing the consumer. It would eliminate the purpose of the phrase to use the term “Medicare,” which describes the plan, not the person. The phrase cannot be drafted in any more limited fashion than “Medicare participating consumers.”</p>

Moreover, Medicare Advantage participants should have been included in the protections provided by the Consent Decree. Indeed, they were included in the protections of the “continue to contract” provision, until the term was deleted at High-mark’s request during negotiations. It is not within this Court’s authority to reinsert the protection for Medicare Advantage into the Vulnerable Population Provision when it was specifically removed by the parties. We also cannot read an otherwise clear sentence addressing a separate concept as ambiguous merely to correct a concession made during difficult negotiations. I find no ambiguity in VP-3, which simply addresses a problem that arises in a coordination of benefits situation.</p>

In summarizing its argument in regard to VP-3, Highmark states, "[t]he Consent Decree defines ‘In-Network’ to mean that UPMC 'has contracted with’ Highmark.” Highmark Brief at 28. The definition of In-Network does not state that UPMC has or has not contracted with Highmark, nor does it inform whether UPMC currently has a contract with Highmark; it merely describes what happens if a health care provider, like UPMC, has contracted with a Health Plan, like High-mark. Moreover, as noted <em>supra </em>in note 2, the Consent Decree addresses the situation where there is no current negotiated in-network rate.

Highmark Brief at 34-35. As noted above, VP-3 does not contain any language requiring UPMC to contract with any entity, but merely defines the rates to be applied if a patient has two insurers. Additionally, there would be no reason to require UPMC to contract for in-network rates with Medicare because, as all have acknowledged, CMS sets non-negotiable rates for Medicare. Therefore, if VP-3 can only apply to Medicare Advantage, as Highmark argues, Highmark Brief at 32-33, the parties should have used that term rather than Medicare.</p>
