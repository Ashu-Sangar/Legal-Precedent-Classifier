It submitted that the reprieve lacked a determinable end date as it was uncertain when the Task Force report would be issued, what its concerns would be, and when the Governor’s personal level of satisfaction would be met regarding palliative measures to address those concerns. The Commonwealth emphasized that the reprieve was not issued to allow Williams to pursue an available legal remedy as he had already exhausted his right to direct and collateral review and the Pardon Board had denied him a commutation and <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>pardon.

Governor Wolf refuted the Commonwealth’s suggestion of a separation of powers violation by contending that he was not encroaching upon the judiciary or legislative branch, but rather was exercising a constitutional reprieve power granted exclusively to the executive branch. Alternatively, Governor Wolf requested that the Court order full briefing and schedule oral argument to consider the issue in a more deliberative manner. Williams likewise opposed the Commonwealth’s emergency petition on grounds similar to those raised by Governor Wolf. He further emphasized that the reprieve was valid as it was issued in Williams’ specific case for the defined purpose of reviewing the Task Force’s recommendation regarding the validity of the death penalty.</p>

It further alleges that time is of the essence because Governor Wolf should not be afforded the opportunity to delay execution when all avenues of review have been exhausted in Williams’ case, including a petition for clemency rejected by the Board of Pardons. The Commonwealth also points out that this Court has invoked its King’s Bench jurisdiction previously to review the constitutional validity of a Governor’s exercise of power. <em>See Creamer v.

Further, the Commonwealth maintains, the Governor has no authority to declare a moratorium on all capital sentences merely by labeling his order a “reprieve.” The Commonwealth contends that the chief executive’s actions in this regard violate Article IV, Section 9(a) because they amount to a unilateral and categorical commutation of death sentences, without the consent of the Board of Pardons. <em>See </em>Pa.

Conversely, the Commonwealth contends, a purported reprieve that is effective “until decided otherwise,” as alleged in the instant case, lacks the defining characteristics of a reprieve, and, thus, is not a reprieve at all. It is the Commonwealth’s position that Governor Wolf may not deviate from the accepted definition of reprieve in Pennsylvania, as stated in <em>Morganelli, </em>and allow the stay to <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>continue infinitely until he, alone, is personally satisfied that the concerns of the Task Force have been addressed.

The PDAA offers a historical summary of the constitutional provision and asserts that while the Governor once enjoyed unfettered power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, the citizens of the Commonwealth limited <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>the clemency power through constitutional amendments, especially in death cases.</p>
    <p id="b351-4" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[195,452,1155,894]]]'>For example, the PDAA asserts that by constitutional amendment in 1874, commutations and pardons were first made subject to the requirement of a recommendation by a group of officials that eventually became known as the Board of Pardons. In 1997, the PDAA submits, Article IV, Section 9 was again amended to require that a commutation or pardon in a case involving a sentence of life imprisonment or death must be subject to the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Pardons, a diversified body constituted by the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General, a crime victim, a corrections expert, and a doctor of either medicine, psychiatry or psychology. Pa. Const. art. IV, § 9(b). The PDAA gleans from this historical perspective that the citizens of this Commonwealth prefer a balanced view where the Board of Pardons determines when to recommend a pardon or commutation of sentence, instead of reserving such decision solely to a single chief executive elected through the political process.</p>
    <p id="b351-5" data-blocks='[["BL_351.5",351,[195,1369,1155,891]]]'>According to the PDAA, this Court should look to the time of the adoption of the reprieve power in the Constitution of 1790, when the framers adhered to English common law, which defined a reprieve as the temporary withdrawal of a sentence for a specific interval in one of three scenarios: (1) where the convict requires time to apply for either an absolute or conditional pardon based on some defect in the particular case; (2) where a female convict is pregnant and in need of time to allow the child to be born before execution of the judgment; and (3) where the convict becomes temporarily insane between the judgment and execution. <em>See </em>Brief of PDAA at 23-25 (citing 2 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>312 (1848)). In each instance, the PDAA asserts, the reprieve was available for only a finite interval and for a definitive reason specific to the convicted prisoner.

According to the PDAA, the Task Force recommendations would only be the starting point for prolonged political and legislative debate, adding years to the duration of the reprieve, which the Governor proposes will continue until the Task Force recommendations are satisfactorily addressed. For these reasons, the PDAA requests a declaration that the Governor’s alleged suspension of the death penalty by use of the reprieve power is unconstitutional and that the reprieve issued to Williams is void.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

Viewing the constitutional history of Article IV, Section 9, Williams highlights that after each constitutional amendment, the plain language of the reprieve clause remained the same, <em>ie., </em>affording virtual unfettered authority solely in the Governor’s hands. <em>See </em>Pa. Const. art. IV, § 9(a) (providing, <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>“[i]n all criminal cases except for impeachment, the Governor shall have power to ... grant reprieves”). He contrasts this with a Governor’s authority to pardon or commute a sentence, which has since been limited by constitutional amendment. For centuries, he submits, Pennsylvania Governors have granted reprieves for either definite or indefinite durations, and for political, personal, or religious reasons, or no express reason at all. Comparing the Pennsylvania reprieve power with that set forth in other state constitutions and the United States Constitution, Williams contends that the Pennsylvania Constitution provides the most robust and unencumbered executive power. He maintains that no court in the nation’s history has invalidated an executive reprieve, and the Commonwealth’s arguments clearly do not justify the adoption of a radical new course on the basis of the Pennsylvania constitutional reprieve power.</p>
    <p id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[208,1209,1155,1047]]]'>Examining the clear terms of the reprieve issued by Governor Wolf, Williams emphasizes that it is identified expressly as a “temporary reprieve” and that its legal effect is to continue the vitality of this Court’s affirmance of his judgment of sentence of death. The express reprieve language acknowledges that Williams has been convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death, and that his sentence has been affirmed on direct appeal. Because Williams remains on death row under sentence of death, he contends there is no merit to the Commonwealth’s contention that the Governor’s actions amount to a pardon or commutation of sentence without the unanimous consent of the Board of Pardons. He suggests that the reprieve does nothing more than postpone his execution and is, thus, a valid exercise of power under the plain language of Article IV, Section 9. Even assuming a reprieve must be limited in duration and purpose, Williams contends that Governor Wolfs reprieve satisfies these requisites as it postpones his execution temporarily until the Task Force report is complete and any recommendations are addressed.</p>

He argues that the crux of the <em>Morganelli </em>decision was simply that a governor could not grant a reprieve before the death warrant was issued because, at that point in time, there was no scheduled execution to stay. Here, unlike <em>Morganelli </em>a death warrant was issued to Williams and Governor Wolf took the subsequent action of issuing a formal reprieve. For this reason, Williams asserts, any discussion in <em>Morganelli </em>describing a reprieve as limited in time and purpose constitutes <em>dicta. </em>Further, he posits, the Court’s language in this regard was merely referencing a 1979 edition of Black’s Law dictionary which described a reprieve as “ordinarily an act of clemency extended to a prisoner to afford him an opportunity to procure some amelioration of the sentence <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>imposed.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1170 (5th ed.1979).

Governor Wolf asserts that this broad and unfettered executive power has been reflected in both constitutional text and historical practice since the Commonwealth’s earliest days.

Governor Wolf has acknowledged that Williams has been convicted of first degree murder, that his sentence of death has been affirmed by this Court, and that Williams remains on death row under sentence of death. For this reason, we disagree with the Commonwealth’s suggestion that the reprieve unconstitutionally altered a final judgment of this Court; rather, the execution of the judgment is merely delayed.</p>

The instant facts illustrate this point. Here, Governor Wolf issued the reprieve on February 13, 2015, indicating that it will continue until the Task Force’s report is issued and any concerns raised therein are addressed. The Commonwealth initiated an action in this Court five days later, seeking to invalidate the reprieve as unconstitutional. At this time, when the Task Force report has yet to be issued, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that the effect of the reprieve is to permanently suspend Williams’ sentence.</p>

Such a legal presumption is inappropriate. The triggering event rendering the reprieve temporary is well-defined and is capable of coming to fruition. It is beyond the purview of this Court to surmise that future action taken by Governor Wolf, if any, would encroach upon our judicial authority.

Once at a secluded spot in a cemetery Appellant stole $20 from Mr. Norwood. While Mr. Norwood begged for his life, Appellant tied his hands together, tied his legs together and stuffed socks in his mouth. Appellant beat Mr. Norwood with a tire iron until Mr. Norwood was dead, hid the body behind two tombstones, covered the body with loose brush and later that evening soaked Mr. Norwood’s body in gasoline and set it on fire.</p>

    <p id="b368-5" data-blocks='[["BL_368.5",368,[267,731,1151,200]]]'>Article II section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution states: “The legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.” PA.

PA. CONST. art. IV, § 2. Thus, a Governor has a constitutional duty to make certain the laws shall be carried out. Therefore, once a statute is duly passed and signed by the Governor, that becomes the law of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b368-7" data-blocks='[["BL_368.7",368,[267,1341,1152,458]]]'>Any Governor who is elected and personally opposes such law, no matter how distasteful to him or her, violates one of our country’s basic principles should that Governor refuse to enforce the law. As John Adams stated during the early days of our country: we are a “government of laws, not of men.” John Adams, “Letters of Novanglus No. 7,” <em>Boston Gazette </em>(1774). In other words, the Executive Branch cannot unilaterally and arbitrarily nullify a valid, existing statute by refusing to enforce it.</p>

Indeed, juries listen to horrific facts and after due deliberation, such as in this case, make the decision to employ the penalty of death. If the death penalty is to no longer apply in Pennsylvania, that decision should come from the elected members of the Pennsylvania House and Senate and not from nullification by an Executive or by fiat by the Judiciary.</p>

Who determines if any recommendations are “satisfactorily” addressed?” My concern is that by conditioning the reprieve on a speculative event and requiring concerns be “satisfactorily” addressed, the reprieve is not truly temporary in nature. It has already been four years since the passage of Senate Resolution No. 6, <em>supra, </em>and thirty-one years since Amos Norwood was robbed, tortured and murdered.</p>
