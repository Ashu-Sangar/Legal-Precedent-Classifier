The PCRA further cited Dr. Wright’s testimony that, in his opinion, Appellant “does not have a diagnosis of mental retardation,” and “in order to make a diagnosis of mental retardation, there must be testing prior to the age of eighteen.” <em>Id. </em>at 29. Reiterating that the additional school records of Appellant and his siblings which were presented at the PCRA hearings “are devoid of [Appellant] being tested,” and “do not identify [Appellant] as mentally retarded,” the PCRA court concluded: “the fact remains that no credible evidence exists to establish [Appellant’s] intelligence quotient or mental retardation prior to the required pre-eighteen age of onset.” PCRA Court Opinion, 1/17/14, at 30-31.</p>

Mildred, Harry, Joseph, and Ruth were given IQ tests when they were 9 to 11 years of age, and, after receiving test scores below 75, they were placed in the Special Education Program. The IQ test scores for Appellant’s siblings were recorded on their permanent records, but were not listed on the yearly attendance registers or their report cards.

Although both the 1957-1958 attendance register and Appellant’s 10th grade report card identify Appellant as being in the Special Education Program, they do not indicate Appellant’s IQ score, a fact repeatedly emphasized by the PCRA Court. <em>See </em>PCRA Court Opinion, 1/17/14, at 25-26 (noting that Dr. Sheetz testified that, if he administered an IQ test to a student, the results would have been placed in the student’s folder and that, generally, “school permanent records stay in the school,” and observing that “Dr. Sheetz offered no testimony or explanation as to why there were no records in [Appellant’s] folder indicating he had been tested”). However, Purcell, the Solicitor for the Frazier School District, explained that, although the School District tries to retain all student records, some of its records had been lost in a flood, and even some of the records that were copied showed evidence of moisture or water damage. <em>Id. </em>This uncontradicted evidence may account for the absence of a complete set of records for Appellant, including a permanent record containing information for more than a single school year, and, at any rate, undermines the PCRA court’s focus on Dr. Sheetz as having offered no explanation as to why there were no records indicating Appellant had been given an IQ test. In light of all of the above, we conclude there was no basis for the PCRA court to discount Dr. Sheetz’ testimony that Appellant could not have been placed in the Special Education Program unless he had been given an IQ test which resulted in a score of 75 or below.</p>

As noted above, the PCRA court criticized Dr, Jacquin’s reliance on specific information provided by Dr. Sheetz, including his testimony that state regulations precluded any student with an IQ above 75 from being placed in the Special Education Program, because "Dr. Sheetz could not testify that he or anyone else tested [Appellant], or that <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>[Appellant] had a pre-eighteen IQ of mental retardation.” PCRA Court Opinion, 1/17/14, at 26. Appellant contends that the PCRA court misapplied Pa.R.E. 703 to preclude Dr. Jacquin from relying on the state regulations to conclude Appellant’s intellectual disability manifested prior to age 18, Appellant’s Brief at 38, and that the PCRA court erred in refusing to admit Dr. Jacquin’s report into evidence, and improperly discounting Dr. Jacquin’s opinion on this basis. <em>Id. </em>at 40.

Of course, in ordinary post-conviction proceedings centered on the stewardship of counsel, it may not be essential for the court to make a full assessment of every facet of the underlying merits; rather, as a general rule, the court need only proceed to the point of determining the "arguable merit” of claims. However, in the discrete <em>Atkins </em>setting, and where "arguable merit” and prejudice are established, it would seem to be grossly inefficient to refrain from assessing the full merits of whether the prisoner actually suffers from intellectual disability (since this alternative would entail considering relief in terms of whether a new <em>Atkins </em>proceeding should be awarded, as an intermediate step to determining whether the death-sentence should be vacated and a life sentence imposed). Indeed, in collateral review cases where an <em>Atkins </em>claim has been pursued without the ineffectiveness overlay, PCRA courts have contemporaneously made the ultimate determination of intellectual disability and vacated the sentence of death. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Moreover, as indicated above, at the point at which intellectual disability is established, it seems highly problematic to consider denying relief on reasonable-strategy grounds. Thus, some adjustments to the conventional approach to post-conviction claims may be in order for this unique species of claim.</p>
