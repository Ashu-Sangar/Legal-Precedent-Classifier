At nineteen years of age, Hayley was overwhelmed with being a mother and relied upon Appellant to watch her children on occasion. While Hayley thought of Appellant as a friend, the two had previously been intimate and Appellant desired more than friendship. Hayley had assured Appellant that she would retrieve her children later that day, but did not do so. When Hayley still had not come to pick up her children the next morning, November 7, 2011, Appellant grew angry and called his neighbor, Niesha Mayes, looking for Hayley. In a very agitated tone, Appellant told Mayes that Hayley better come get her children or she would be sorry.</p>

      <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>While at the hospital awaiting word on Jaques’s fate, Appellant stated that Hayley had dropped off the children the day before to stay with him for a few hours, but never returned and did not respond to his attempts to contact her. He explained that because Jaques had defecated and smeared it on the kitchen floor, Appellant had “popped him,” suggesting that he struck the child, pulled him up by his ear, and sent him upstairs to the bathtub to clean himself. Appellant indicated that he found Jaques slumped over and unresponsive in the bathtub minutes later.</p>

Dr. Daniel Carney, the trauma surgeon on duty, also examined Jaques, finding him to be cold with a distended abdomen and showing no signs of life. Life-saving measures ultimately ceased and Jaques was pronounced dead at 3:05 p.m.</p>

Accordingly, while Appellant was at the hospital, the officer entered his residence for the sole purpose of checking on the welfare of any children left behind. Officer Kohler did not find any children in the home, did not move or collect any evidence, and did not take photographs. Shortly thereafter, neighbor Della Smith informed Officer Kohler that she was caring for Jaques’s baby sister and needed to go into Appellant’s home to get diapers for the baby. Officer Kohler thereafter reentered the home and did a cursory look for diapers, finding none. Again, the officer took no evidence or photographs and did not manipulate anything in the home. At 5:20 p.m., officers obtained a search warrant, purportedly for Appellant’s home. Prior to executing the warrant, however, the officers realized that the address on the warrant was not Appellant’s, but rather was that of the neighbor’s home from where the 911 call was made. A corrected search warrant was obtained and executed at 5:40 p.m. At that time, police took photos of the crime scene and <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>recovered, <em>inter alia, </em>pieces of a leather belt, a bong and baggie containing a leafy green substance, clothing, paperwork, a mobile phone, and a laptop.</p>

He explained to detectives why he was caring for Hayley’s children and denied that he hurt Jaques intentionally. Appellant admitted, however that he slapped the child for defecating himself, pulled him up by his ear, and directed him to go to the bathtub. He stated that he found the child slumped over and unresponsive in the bathtub less than ten minutes thereafter.</p>

The detective informed Appellant that he was not under arrest and that the interview would be audio and video recorded. After Appellant sat down, he told Detective Clarkson that he had spoken to Attorney Alan Rutt on an unrelated matter two days before and that Attorney Rutt had warned him not speak to the police without an attorney present. Transcript of Interview, Nov. 11, 2011, at 2, 59. Appellant did not, however, request that Attorney Rutt or any other attorney be present during the interview, nor did he indicate that he did not want to speak with police without an attorney present.</p>

Appellant indicated that he understood his rights and stated, “[b]elieve me, there’s no reason for a lawyer here.” <em>Id. </em>at 16. He then began to explain the events that took place on November 7, 2011. Specifically, Appellant stated that he slapped Jaques for defecating on the floor, pulled him by the ear to lead him upstairs for a bath, <em>id. </em>at 25-26, filled the tub with a few inches of water, and left Jaques in the bathtub alone. <em>Id. </em>at 29. Appellant explained that when he returned to the bathtub a <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>few minutes later, Jaques was slumped over and unresponsive. <em>Id. </em>at 30. He stated that it did not look like Jaques’s face was in the water. <em>Id. </em>at 31. Appellant explained that when he retrieved the child from the bathtub, Jaques vomited. <em>Id. </em>at 35.</p>
    <p id="b218-5" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[255,607,1151,625]]]'>Frightened, Appellant stated that he carried Jaques to his neighbor’s house across the street, and had someone call 911. Pursuant to the 911 responder’s direction, Appellant stated that he administered CPR on Jaques, and medical emergency personnel arrived and continued the CPR. <em>Id. </em>at 45-46, 50. When asked how he believed Jaques died, Appellant responded that he thought the child must have drowned in the bathtub because no abuse occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 113. When the interview concluded, Detective Clarkson asked Appellant to take a voice stress test, which the detective explained “senses deception,” and Appellant refused, asserting that he wanted to speak to Attorney Rutt first. <em>Id. </em>at 120,122-23.</p>
    <p id="b218-6" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[252,1255,1154,942]]]'>Appellant was not arrested for Jaques’s murder until more than four months later on March 20, 2012, after police received the autopsy report, which indicated that the cause of Jaques’s death was blunt force trauma and that the manner of death was homicide. While still handcuffed after the arrest, Detective Clarkson again interviewed Appellant. The detective read <em>Miranda </em>warnings and Appellant reiterated that he understood his rights. When asked if he wanted to make a statement, he responded, “I’ll answer whatever you want, you know, I could care less. I already told you that.” Interview Transcript, Mar. 20, 2012, at 3. Appellant then reiterated the events of the day of the murder, as outlined above. When the detective confronted Appellant with the findings in the autopsy report, he denied any physical abuse or wrongdoing. After the interview was completed and Appellant was told what would happen to him later that evening, Appellant stated that his attorney was Clarence Allen, and that he had just seen Attorney Allen at the corner barber shop. <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>

Appellant also sought to suppress all physical evidence seized from his home. The trial court conducted a suppression hearing on October 23, 2012, and November 1, 2012, after which it denied Appellant’s suppression motion, finding that he waived his right to counsel and voluntarily made the statements to police. The trial court further held that no physical evidence was seized from Appellant’s residence until after a valid search warrant had been obtained. Additionally, Appellant filed a pretrial motion seeking dismissal of the charge of first degree murder for lack of evidence of a specific intent to kill, which the trial court denied. He further filed a pretrial motion to quash the aggravating circumstance of torture for lack of evidence, which the trial court also denied after conducting an evidentia-ry hearing.</p>
    <p id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.4",219,[204,1256,1155,525]]]'>The Commonwealth subsequently filed a pretrial motion <em>in </em>limine, seeking to admit various autopsy photos. Appellant objected to the admission of the photos, contending that any probative value in determining the nature of the victim’s injuries and the cause of death was outweighed by the photos’ prejudicial impact. Following a hearing where expert medical testimony was presented, the trial court granted the Commonwealth’s motion and ruled that thirteen autopsy photos (twelve color and one black and white), from a much larger array of pictures, were admissible at trial.</p>
    <p id="b219-6" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[205,1804,1157,578]],["BL_220.1",220,[255,342,1150,199]]]'>At trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of forensic pathologist, Dr. Samuel Land, who had performed Jaques’s autopsy the day after the murder. Utilizing the autopsy photos, Dr. Land summarized the multitude of injuries that he documented over the child’s entire body. He noted at least ten to twenty bruises, a significant number of which had been inflicted within hours before Jaques’s death, as demonstrated by the fact that blood poured out of the bruises when cut. N.T. (Trial), Volume IV, Oct. 22, 2013, at 894, 926. The bruises appeared on Jaques’s face, forehead, left eye, cheeks, jaw, left ear, right side and back of his head, <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>chest, shoulder, abdominal region, back, buttocks, arms, hips, and thighs. <em>Id. </em>at 893, 898, 910, 919, 922, and 924. Dr. Land opined that the injuries resulting in the various bruises would have caused considerable pain to Jaques. <em>Id. </em>at 933.</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[254,563,1152,781]]]'>Dr. Land found that the most significant injury to Jaques’s torso was the laceration to the victim’s liver, extending almost completely through the liver, which occurred several hours before Jaques’s death. <em>Id. </em>at 925, 927. He acknowledged that it would take a significant amount of force to lacerate the child’s liver, such as would occur in a severe motor vehicle accident. <em>Id. </em>at 903. Dr. Land stated that the injury to Jaques’s liver would have caused severe pain and also nausea, vomiting, and loss of bowel control, and could not have been caused by the life saving measures attempted by emergency medical technicians. <em>Id. </em>at 929, 937. He further observed that due to the tear in the liver, a fairly significant amount of blood pooled in Jaques’s abdomen, causing the abdomen to be extended abnormally. <em>Id. </em>at 924. It was Dr. Land’s opinion that the damage to the liver was a fatal injury.</p>
    <p id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[254,1367,1152,360]]]'>Dr. Land also found there was significant injury to Jaques’s adrenal gland caused by Jaques being struck in the back several days prior to death. <em>Id. </em>at 901-02. Although Dr. Land also observed a fresh hemorrhage in the right adrenal gland, which was inflicted near the time of death, he concluded that the adrenal gland injury was not, itself, fatal. <em>Id. </em>at 902, 926-27, 932.</p>
    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[253,1752,1154,623]]]'>Finally, Dr. Land explained the significant injuries to Ja-ques’s head. He stated there were bruises inside Jaques’s scalp, unobservable from the surface of the skin, which resulted from recent blows to the head. <em>Id. </em>at 893. He indicated there were bilateral subdural hemorrhages, which Dr. Land explained to be thin bleeding on both sides of the brain caused by blunt force trauma. <em>Id. </em>at 896-97. Dr. Land testified that Jaques’s brain trauma could have occurred by striking Ja-ques’s head or by hurling the child’s head about in a forceful manner. <em>Id. </em>at 898. He opined that the head injury was the final injury inflicted at the time of death, and was fatal. <em>Id. </em>at 926-27, 931.</p>

      <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>Dr. Land considered, but ruled out death by drowning, explaining that drowning is diagnosed by excluding every other possibility and the presence of lethal head trauma and lethal trauma to the torso established that drowning was not a possibility. <em>Id. </em>at 934. He clarified that a two-and-a-half-year-old child would not be in a bathtub slumped over with his face in the water because, if neurologically intact, such child would be able to extricate himself from that position and would simply sit up. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Land concluded that Jaques was beaten to death, i.e., that the cause of the victim’s death was multiple blunt force trauma, and that the manner of death was homicide. <em>Id. </em>at 942, 953.</p>
    <p id="b221-4" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[193,996,1154,571]]]'>Appellant did not testify on his own behalf. He presented the testimony of pathologist, Dr. Richard Bindie. Contrary to Dr. Land’s medical opinion, Dr. Bindie opined that Jaques’s brain hemorrhaging was not fatal and that the head injuries could have resulted from the child hitting his head during a fall several days before his death. N.T. (Trial), Volume V, Oct. 23, 2013, at 1151-52. He testified that Jaques’s severely lacerated liver was caused by aggressive and prolonged CPR and other life-saving measures. <em>Id. </em>at 1145-46, 1154.

It reasoned that the jury was free to infer Appellant’s specific intent to kill from his use of deadly force on Jaques’s body. The court relied on the autopsy photos depicting Jaques’s extensive and recent bruises, Dr. Land’s comprehensive testimony on the cause and manner of death, and the fact that Appellant was about four times the size of the two-year-old victim. Based on the medical evidence, the trial court opined that Appellant placed Jaques in the bathtub after fatally beating him, evidencing an attempt to mask the true cause of death by suggesting that the child drowned accidentally in the bathtub.

When viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as verdict winner, there is sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Appellant intentionally inflicted a considerable amount of pain and suffering upon Jaques that was unnecessarily heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity, beyond a mere intent to kill. It is beyond cavil that the sheer number of injuries inflicted upon nearly every surface of Jaques’s body, both fatal and nonfatal, over the course of hours, would cause unimaginable pain to the young child who had been placed in Appellant’s exclusive care. In addition to the myriad of non-fatal blows to Jaques’s body, and several hours before Jaques died, Appellant struck the toddler’s abdominal area with such force that his liver was nearly lacerated completely, which caused him significant pain, nausea, vomiting, and loss of bowel control. The jury could infer from this evidence that Jaques endured severe pain from the lacerated liver and the various contusions and abrasions until he was rendered unconscious hours later by Appellant’s final fatal blow to Jaques’s head. <em>See </em>N.T. (Trial), Volume IV, Oct. 22, 2013, at 27, 29-30 (referencing Dr. Land’s opinion that Jaques suffered a lacerated liver several hours before death, which caused substantial pain and discomfort, and that a blow to Jaques’s head at or near the time of death rendered him unconscious). Rather than seeking immediate medical attention for the ailing toddler, Appellant left Jaques in the bathtub to succumb to his injuries. We conclude that this evidence is sufficient to establish that Jaques’s killing was committed by means of torture.</p>

To my knowledge, however, there are no rational metrics available for the assessment; rather, the analysis generally proceeds in the form of a series of rather abstract and conclusory pronouncements. <em>Cf. </em>Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., 22A Fed. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Proc.

Such dispositions are vulnerable to the reasonable criticism that they are grounded more upon “instinct and folk knowledge” than upon the psychological impact of graphic photographs upon lay jurors.

Critically, there also is evidence that the emotional influence “probably operates outside of jurors’ conscious awareness,” <em>id. </em>at 1028, thus raising questions about the ameliorative effect of limiting instructions issued by trial judges. The studies suggest a significant possibility that conventional judicial attitudes concerning the degree of impact of graphic depictions of death upon decision-making by lay jurors may be misplaced.</p>
