We recognize that, in one instance, Section 1797 utilizes the term “challenge” as a broader shorthand encompassing the services of provider attorneys in advancing and vindicating a court challenge. <em>See 75 </em>Pa.C.S. § 1797(b)(6). We have previously noted, however, that Section 1797 is not clearly written throughout. <em>See Herd, </em><a href="/pa/619/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="619 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="4233568" data-case-paths="/pa/619/0438-01">619 Pa. at 451</a>, <a href="/pa/619/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="64 A.3d 1058" data-case-ids="4233169,4233568,7310976,7311003" data-case-paths="/pa/619/0437-01,/pa/619/0438-01,/a3d/64/1058-01,/a3d/64/1058-02">64 A.3d at 1066</a>. Given the strict principle of statutory interpretation applicable to fee shifting, however, ambiguities militate in Insurer's favor here. Accordingly, the unconventional usage of the concept of a challenge in Section 1797(b)(6) does not impact its more ordinary application in the previous subsections of the statute or otherwise segue into an <em>explicit </em>authorization of attorneys' fees in scenarios in which carriers have commenced timely peer-review challenges.</p>

While the portrait depicted by Provider and its <em>amicus </em>spotlights the legitimate concern about unscrupulous insurers, it downplays the phenomena of unnecessary medical services and overbilling which, unfortunately, are also salient considerations in any balanced public-policy debate. The adjudicatory system, operating as it does on conventions such as decision-making by a mere preponderance of the evidence to facilitate the resolution of discrete civil controversies, is ill equipped to render broader legislative-type judgments with large-scale consequences.</p>
