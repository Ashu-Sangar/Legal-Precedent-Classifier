I disagree. DEP’s belief that the penalties are appropriate presents EPC with the sort of choice industry participants routinely assess when confronted with allegations that they have violated the law: whether to settle with the agency to mitigate their losses, or to wait for DEP to file a complaint before the EHB and challenge DEP’s statutory interpretation before that tribunal. If the EHB finds there is statutory support for DEP’s continuing violation theory, then EPC is liable for every day that its contaminants remain in the subsurface soil. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 691.602(d) (“Each day of continued violation of any provision of this act, any rule or regulation of the department, any order of the department, or any condition of any permit issued pursuant to this act shall constitute a separate offense.”). If, on the other hand, there is no statutory support for DEP’s interpretation, there is no direct, immediate, or substantial hardship. DEP’s untested belief that it can assess penalties against EPC for continuing violations of the Clean Streams Law is no more than one party’s theory of the case, and is therefore insufficient to confer standing on EPC to seek declaratory relief at this juncture.</p>

Divesting the EHB of its statutory jurisdiction to issue adjudications on DEP’s orders and decisions, <em>see </em>35 P.S. § 7514(a), simply because EPC filed its original jurisdiction declaratory judgment action first will “foster races to the respective judicial and quasi-judicial tribunals” as the Majority fears. Maj. Op. at 621-22, n. 8, 130 A.3d at 759, n. 8. Moreover, although the Majority is correct that until DEP filed its complaint with EHB, EPC had no venue within which to challenge DEP’s asserted entitlement to penalties, it is equally accurate that until DEP sought administrative review it could never assess a fine against EPC. Similarly, the Majority is correct that if DEP’s continuing violation theory is supported by the Clean Streams Law, then by delaying administrative review it could increase the fine. There is no reason to believe, however, that EHB will not understand this and reject a nonmeritorious result if appropriate. Under all established law, it should be afforded the opportunity to do so. I see no justification to bypass this administrative review.</p>

Respectfully, in doing so, the Majority demonstrates an implicit lack of confidence in the administrative tribunals of the Commonwealth. I do not share this lack of confidence. Rather, I trust that these administrative tribunals, which cultivate an expertise in their relative fields, will resolve the case before it correctly, rejecting fanciful or absurd theories that aggrieved parties may appeal to our courts in due course, ensuring a second (or third) review of any alleged error by the administrative tribunal. This is the undeniable logic of the administrative appeal process.

Numerous examples spring to mind. Consider the district attorney who announces an intent to seek the death penalty against a criminal defendant premised on a legal interpretation of a statute, or a negligence plaintiff in a minor impact soft tissue case who indicates an intent to seek punitive damages.

OOR, as the tribunal tasked with adjudicating requests under the RTKL, had the authority to impose its interpretation on OG.
