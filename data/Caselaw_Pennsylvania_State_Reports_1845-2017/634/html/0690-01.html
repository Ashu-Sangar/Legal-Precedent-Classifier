As a result of these observations, Morgantown Children and Youth Services and Morgantown State Police were summoned to the hospital. State Police Troopers James Pierce, Daniel Barnhart, and Charles Morrison arrived at the hospital at approximately 9:55 p.m. and interviewed Dr. Larabee, For-sythe, and Appellant. N.T. 3/10/14, jury trial, at 133-34. Appellant initially told troopers that Trenton had fallen down the stairs at approximately 1:00 a.m. that day and that the <a id="p696" href="#p696" data-label="696" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*696</a>child “seemed fine” until approximately 2:00 or 3:00 p.m. that afternoon when he began to throw up and act “funny.” <em>Id. </em>at 134-35.

The Commonwealth showed Dr. Schmidt pictures taken of Trenton prior to the autopsy and asked that Dr. Schmidt explain the external injuries portrayed in each picture. <em>Id. </em>at 84-89.</p>

Dr. Schmidt further testified that she found “early formation of fibroblast formation, fibroblast coming in a form of supporting membrane” in some of Trenton’s injuries, which is a sign of healing. <em>Id. </em>at 93-94. Dr. Schmidt further explained that “the hematoma that was found in the abdominal cavity occurred at a different time than the peritonitis or the exudate that I saw, observed on the intestines.” <em>Id. </em>at 94.

As the Commonwealth indicated, however, this Court has consistently rejected the “final blow” argument in instances of child abuse. <em>See, e.g. Powell, </em><a href="/pa/598/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="598 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="3990016" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0224-01">598 Pa. at 241-42</a>, <a href="/pa/598/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="956 A.2d 406" data-case-ids="3990016,8207764" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0224-01,/a2d/956/0406-01">956 A.2d at 417</a> (where this Court found the verdict of first-degree murder was supported by the evidence of appellant’s pattern of abuse despite the lack of evidence of a final blow which caused the child’s death).

N.T. 8/10/14, jury trial, at 96, 101. Ultimately, Dr. Schmidt testified that Trenton died of “peritonitis due to closed abdominal injury due to battery,” and declared within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the manner of Trenton’s death was homicide. <em>Id. </em>at 96-97. Similarly, Dr. Larabee determined that Trenton’s cause of death was “intentional injury, non-accidental trauma, child abuse.” N.T. 3/11/14, jury trial, at 173.

Appellant ignores, however, that our standard of review tasks us with viewing <em>all </em>of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner.

      <a id="p717" href="#p717" data-label="717" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*717</a>The record establishes that herein the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was accompanied by the circumstance of torture. Appellant argues that neither Dr. Schmidt nor Dr. Larabee gave an opinion as to how long the abuse occurred. Both doctors testified, however, that Trenton’s bruises appeared to be of different ages, “with some appearing to be not more than two to three days old, and others not less than six to twelve hours old,” indicating that Trenton had endured abuse over a period of time. N.T. 3/11/14, jury trial, at 173. Moreover, Forsythe testified that in the weeks leading up to Trenton’s death, she began noticing unusual bruising on his body. Forsythe further testified that following the incident of abuse she discovered on September 10, Trenton began complaining of a stomach ache. Dr. Schmidt confirmed that in addition to severe abdominal pain, Trenton would have been experiencing lethargy, a fever, nausea, and vomiting. Forsythe also stated that Appellant refused to allow her to seek medical attention for Trenton until he became unresponsive approximately three days after the attack. Dr. Larabee verified that if Trenton had presented at the hospital earlier, he “likely would have survived,” as peritonitis is treatable in its early stages. <em><a href="/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207767271" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="2015 WL 7767271">Id.</a> </em>Moreover if Appellant wished to simply kill Trenton, a four-year-old child, he easily could have done so. Instead, like the victim in <em>Powell, </em>Trenton sustained injuries to vital and non-vital parts of the body that were distinct from the blow to his abdomen which caused the peritonitis, indicating that Appellant sought to cause Trenton additional pain and suffering. <em>See Ockenhouse, </em><a href="/pa/562/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="562 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="225979" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0481-01">562 Pa. at 495</a>, <a href="/a2d/756/1130-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="756 A.2d 1130" data-case-ids="11244835,225979" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/1130-01,/pa/562/0481-01">756 A.2d at 1138</a> (bruises on non-vital parts of the body may indicate “an intent to cause pain and suffering in addition to the intent to kill.”).

In both <em>Woodard </em>and the present case, I would hold that the trial courts erred in admitting into evidence color photographs of nude, battered, open-eyed, deceased children taken during autopsies, encompassing full body portraits and facial closeups. As I explained at greater length in <em>Woodard, </em>I believe that such graphic, visceral portrayals of dead children create an unacceptable risk of influencing jurors to reach conclusions based on factors other than a strict application of the law to the facts. <em>See id. </em>at 212-15, <a href="/pa/634/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="129 A.3d 480" data-case-ids="12280121,6766998" data-case-paths="/pa/634/0162-01,/a3d/129/0480-01">129 A.3d at 510-12</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207767271" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="2015 WL 7767271">2015 WL 7767271</a>, at *24-26 (Saylor, C.J., dissenting).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The impact is <a id="p720" href="#p720" data-label="720" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*720</a>heightened in the present case, given that the trial court apparently permitted the jurors to have unfettered access to these pictures during their deliberations, <em>see </em>N.T., March 11, 2014, at 265. <em>Accord Woodard, </em><a href="/pa/634/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="634 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="12280121" data-case-paths="/pa/634/0162-01">634 Pa. at 187</a>, <a href="/pa/634/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="129 A.3d 480" data-case-ids="12280121,6766998" data-case-paths="/pa/634/0162-01,/a3d/129/0480-01">129 A.3d at 494-95</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207767271" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="2015 WL 7767271">2015 WL 7767271</a>, at *10 (highlighting, as a factor favoring affirmance of the trial court’s decision to admit autopsy photographs, the fact that “the jury was not given the photographs to examine during deliberations!;.]”).</p>

This case and <em>Woodard </em>suggest the potential for confusion in this area of the law in terms of what this Court means by the word "inflammatory.” The <em>Woodard </em>majority credited a trial court’s finding that one set of autopsy photographs of a naked, battered child were not inflammatory, <em>see Woodard, </em><a href="/pa/634/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="634 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="12280121" data-case-paths="/pa/634/0162-01">634 Pa. at 186-88</a>, <a href="/pa/634/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="129 A.3d 480" data-case-ids="12280121,6766998" data-case-paths="/pa/634/0162-01,/a3d/129/0480-01">129 A.3d at 494-95</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207767271" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="2015 WL 7767271">2015 WL </a><a id="p720" href="#p720" data-label="720" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*720</a><a href="/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207767271" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="2015 WL 7767271">7767271</a>, at *10; whereas, the present majority credits another trial court’s finding that similar pictures were inflammatory, <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 712, 131 A.3d at 37-38. The majority, however, provides no explanation for why the visceral impact of the two sets of photographs upon lay jurors may have been different.</p>
