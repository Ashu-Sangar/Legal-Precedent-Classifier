He argues this information should have been used to impeach Detective Wayne Simock’s testimony that the shooting was not gang related. Solano further contends counsel should have impeached the detective with the affidavit of probable cause for Solano’s arrest, in which the detective stated there was reason to believe victim was in a gang. Solano also notes the newspaper article contained information about two potential witnesses, George Williams and Patrick Price, whose testimony would have linked Concepcion and one of his fellow gang members, Catalino Morales, to the murder; Solano argues this evidence would have cast further doubt on the Commonwealth’s case, particularly on its contention the shooting was not gang related.</p>

The Commonwealth also points out counsel, after interviewing Concepcion, made a reasonable, strategic decision not to call him to testify because he told counsel Solano was one of his best friends and had agreed to help him because Solano held a grudge against those who robbed Concepcion; according to Concepcion, these men had also assaulted Solano’s younger brother.

The Commonwealth also points out the jury heard eyewitness testimony that more than one person was thought to have fired a gun; therefore, the notion there may have been two shooters was before the jury.

Additionally, Price’s claim that he accompanied Morales and Concepcion to Indiana after the crime and Morales told him he was the shooter conflicted with Morales’s assertion that only Concepcion accompanied him. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the court noted in addition to being incredible, Price’s version of events did not account for Solano’s whereabouts the day of the murder and thus could not exculpate him. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the PCRA court held Solano failed to show the outcome of his trial would have differed had the proffered testimony been presented, especially in light of multiple eyewitness testimony identifying Solano as the shooter. <em>Id., </em>at 14,16.</p>

The public defender’s office began representing Solano in 2001, and he was tried and sentenced in May, 2003. The same office represented Morales (who had been its client since 1994) from January 29, 2003, through April 23, 2003, one month before Solano’s trial. The office represented Concepcion on four cases from December 26, 2001, until two of the cases were discontinued March 19, 2003,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> less than two months before Solano’s trial; representation on the remaining two cases continued until June 23, 2003, after the conclusion of Solano’s trial. Solano argues the public defender’s office’s representation of these individuals prevented guilt-phase counsel from presenting evidence and arguing to the jury that these two were the actual perpetrators who had the motive and opportunity to commit the murder. Sola-no highlights counsel’s PCRA testimony that he suspected both men were involved in victim’s murder. <em>See </em>N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/27/10, at 67.

He further contends guilt-phase counsel was ineffective for failing to object to or impeach this testimony, which undermined the defense’s theory the shooting was gang related. Specifically, Solano points to the affidavit of probable cause for his arrest, completed by Detective Simock the day after the murder, which stated he had received information that victim belonged to a gang; he also referenced the sweatshirt bearing gang insignia and victim’s name, recovered from victim’s car, and mentioned victim’s juvenile record.

Additionally, the prosecutor testified at the PCRA hearing that he had no reason to believe the detective’s trial testimony was inaccurate; in fact, at least four other witnesses also testified victim was not a gang member. Thus, there was no perjured testimony and no prosecutorial misconduct.

These witnesses testified the same person who shot victim also fired the shots into the crowd, thus supporting the Commonwealth’s theory of the case. Contrary to Solano’s contention that no physical evidence linked him to the crime, the ballistics evidence supported the conclusion that a single shooter fired both weapons used, and the casings and bullets recovered from the crime scene were fired from the same weapons police seized when they arrested Solano and Morales in Connecticut two weeks after the shooting.

We note, to the extent the PCRA court suggested the underlying facts of a <em>crimen falsi </em>conviction offered for impeachment purposes must contradict the witness’s version of the facts or the Commonwealth’s theory of the case, the Rules of Evidence do not contain such requirement. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 609(a) (for impeachment of any witness’s credibility, conviction must be admitted <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>if it involved dishonesty or false statement).

In light of the overall testimony of these witnesses, counsel did not act unreasonably by not impeaching them with <em>crimen falsi </em>convictions or introducing ballistics evidence to rebut Rosario’s testimony. We further agree with the PCRA court that counsel’s foregoing a jury instruction on Jose Aquino’s <em>crimen falsi </em>conviction was not prejudicial to Solano’s case, in light of the other evidence of Solano’s guilt and counsel’s competent cross-examination of this witness.</p>

The Commonwealth contends the PCRA court minimized the actions penalty-phase counsel took in her investigation and preparation, overlooking the fact counsel presented witnesses who conveyed to the jury what counsel believed was important: Solano’s traumatic upbringing with a drug-addicted mother, his time in foster care, and his being a funny, likeable child who performed well in a structured environment. The Commonwealth notes counsel’s strategy was to humanize Sola-no, and the evidence counsel allegedly overlooked was of the same nature as what she actually presented. The Commonwealth contends the PCRA court focused excessively on counsel’s PCRA testimony, during which she “[fell] on her proverbial sword” and asserted she lacked a reasonable basis for not calling additional life-history-mitigation witnesses.

The Commonwealth further notes, although Dr. Dattilio’s reports contained life-history facts about Solano’s traumatic childhood and his mother’s drug addiction, these facts were made known to the jury through the other witnesses counsel called to testify. Finally, the Commonwealth contends counsel had no reason to believe Solano had mental-health issues; he does not contend he told counsel of any problems, Dr. Dattilio’s evaluation did not reveal any issues and indicated Solano denied having any, and Solano told Dr. Schretlen he did not want psychological evidence used in his appeal.

First, Solano contends counsel did not know how to conduct social-history interviews or prepare witnesses to testify, and her use of a questionnaire to seek sensitive information concerning physical or sexual abuse was inadequate. He points to the fact the interview with his mother took place in the presence of his girlfriend, <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>which may have affected his mother’s candor about her own turbulent past, and the questions asked of his foster parents were superficial, producing very little tangible mitigation evidence. Solano notes although counsel interviewed and presented the testimony of Negron, the CYS caseworker assigned to Solano’s family, Negron actually had no one-on-one contact with Solano and thus his testimony was speculative. As for other potential witnesses, Solano points out counsel only conducted brief telephone interviews with them, and the only family members she interviewed were his mother and brother, despite being given contact information for other relatives. Solano states counsel, upon receiving only one- or two-word responses to her questionnaire, never followed up to gain more information. Solano argues counsel could have discovered more about his mother’s tragic upbringing and her own history of poverty, neglect, and abuse; this background could have been used to demonstrate her inability to nurture and provide structure for him. Solano claims he told counsel of his mother’s drug abuse, gave her his family contact information, and answered her questionnaire to the best of his ability, given the questions’ sensitive nature and his academic impairment. Solano argues even if he could be viewed as having been uncooperative, counsel still had enough basic information from which to conduct an independent investigation, but failed to do so.</p>

He notes she only obtained records bearing his name, arguing had she looked into his drug-using relatives’ institutional records, she would have learned more about his dysfunctional background, particularly his mother’s story. Although counsel had his school records, Solano asserts she did not follow up on information they contained concerning his poor academic performance, which could have implicated his mental health; furthermore, counsel failed to introduce these records at the penalty phase because she did not understand the evidentiary rules regarding intro<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>ducing documents into evidence.

Solano notes counsel decided not to call Dr. Dattilio, who had examined him twice prior to trial, because she was concerned this expert’s report contained the diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder, which the jury might find inflammatory. Solano argues counsel should have consulted Dr. Dattilio for edification concerning his diagnosis before deciding not to use him; Solano points to the numerous records PCRA counsel was able to provide this expert, which enabled him to explain his diagnosis would not have made him hesitant to testify, as such disorders are typically environmentally induced. Penalty-phase counsel, however, failed to provide Dr. Dattilio with any records and did not consult with him prior to deciding not to call him as a witness. Solano also contends there were notations in Dr. Dattilio’s July, 2002 report that should have alerted counsel of the need to retain a neuropsychologist, yet counsel failed to do so; the report mentioned significant aspects of depression, borderline intellectual functioning, and permanent disability with cognitive functioning.

Additionally, counsel treated the mother with kid gloves, being afraid to upset her by probing for information concerning her tragic childhood and drug addiction; counsel inferred the mother felt guilty and ashamed about her parental shortcomings and their impact on Solano. Counsel did not attempt to expand on what little she learned from Solano’s mother by researching the mother’s records or talking to other family members to fill in the details of the mother’s story, <em>ie., </em>how her drug addiction caused Solano to be subjected to extreme violence, neglect, and poverty.

When the initial briefs in this case were filed, Solano raised a related claim concerning the applicability of the grave-risk aggravating circumstance, claiming penalty-phase counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence that a second shooter, not Solano, was responsible for the grave risk to others. He also contended penalty-phase counsel was ineffective for failing to object or request a limiting instruction when the prosecutor presented evidence beyond the limited <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>scope of the aggravator. We remanded the case to the PCRA court to file a supplemental opinion fully addressing certain issues not addressed in its initial opinion. On remand, the PCRA court found counsel's failure to introduce evidence regarding a second shooter in the penalty phase prejudiced Solano and thus was an additional ground for relief. PCRA Court Supplemental Opinion, 8/23/13, at 9-10. The parties filed new appeals and supplemental briefs, in which the Commonwealth challenged the PCRA court's finding that penalty-phase counsel was ineffective in connection with the grave-risk aggravator. Solano now contends, in light of the PCRA court’s finding that evidence regarding a second shooter may well have resulted in a different penalty-phase verdict, the potential impact of such evidence on the guilt phase must be re-examined; he contends the PCRA court's finding he was not prejudiced in the guilt phase was flawed because it ''credited” the evidence regarding two shooters in its supplemental opinion, Sola-no's Supplemental Brief, at 8. However, the PCRA court did not make a credibility finding regarding such evidence; rather, it simply stated that had the jury considered testimony casting doubt on who put persons other than victim at grave risk of harm, the jury may not have found the aggravator to be established, which would have changed the sentence to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>PCRA Court Supplemental Opinion, 8/23/13, at 9-10. This does not equate to a finding there were two shooters, nor does it affect the result at the guilt phase, because, as the PCRA court noted, "the presence of a second shooter firing shots toward the crowded park would not have exculpated [Solano] from his role in killing [victim] on the basketball court[,]” <em>Id., </em>at 10. As discussed <em>infra, </em>numerous eyewitnesses identified Solano as the person who shot victim; therefore, any evidence of a second shooter subsequently firing into the crowd was irrelevant to Solano’s guilt for the murder. Accordingly, this claim lacks merit.</p>
