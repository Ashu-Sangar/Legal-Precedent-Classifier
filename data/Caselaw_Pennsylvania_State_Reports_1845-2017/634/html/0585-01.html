Pronouncements of the Commonwealth Court have consistently construed the “Implied Consent Law” at 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547 to require a motorist to assent unequivocally to an official request to take whichever statutorily-prescribed chemical test police select on pain of automatic license suspension, whereas Superior Court construction has discerned a motorist’s compliance with the law if he responds to the official request by asking to take a reasonably practicable, prescribed test of his choosing. We, therefore, granted review to consider whether a motorist who requests an alternative test to the officer’s preferred test exercises a statutory right or, instead, refuses to submit to <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>chemical testing in violation of the Implied Consent Law so as to incur suspension of his operating privileges.</p>

After reading a PennDOT Form DL-26 to inform Appellant of the Implied Consent Law and alert him to the consequences of refusing to submit to chemical testing, <em>see </em>Section 1547(b)(2), <em>supra, </em>police requested that he submit to a chemical test of his blood. Appellant replied by showing police what he considered to be an inexplicably large coagulation of blood in his arm resulting from a relatively minor bump sustained earlier in the day, and he expressed his concern that his body may react in a similar way to a needle. He, therefore, asked police if he could, instead, submit to urinalysis, a breathalyzer or both.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After brief discussion, police responded that Appellant’s request for an alternative test constituted a refusal because, they explained, they held exclusive discretion to select the test. Appellant disputed that he was refusing chemical testing and reiterated that he was willing to take either or both of the other tests. Nevertheless, police asked Appellant to sign the DL-26 form in acknowl-<a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>edgement of his refusal to take the blood test. Appellant continued to disagree in vain with their assessment until he eventually signed the form and added the notation that police refused his offer to submit to a breathalyzer and/or urine test. At no time during this discussion did Appellant indicate he would consent to the official request for a blood test. The Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Driver Licensing (“DOT”) subsequently suspended Appellant’s operating privilege for one year pursuant to the requirements of Section 1547(b)(l)(i), <em>supra.</em>

    <p id="b637-4" data-blocks='[["BL_637.4",637,[177,882,1156,832]]]'>Appellant appealed his license suspension to the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, which, after a <em>de novo </em>hearing, sustained his appeal. Specifically, the trial court determined that Appellant’s failure to submit to the test requested by police did not constitute a refusal to submit to chemical testing under Section 1547(b)(1) because he had otherwise agreed to take a reasonably practicable, different test pursuant to Section 1547(i), <em>supra. </em>In so deciding, the trial court relied upon the statutory construction expressed by the Superior Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Barker, </em><a href="/a3d/70/0849-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="70 A.3d 849" data-case-ids="3685710,7307989" data-case-paths="/a3d/70/0849-01">70 A.3d 849</a> (Pa.Super.2013) <em>(en banc). </em>In <em>Barker, </em>the Superior Court held that an officer’s refusal to grant alternative testing to a motorist who presented a facially valid allegation that he was a brittle diabetic suffering infection from a recent injection violated the right to alternative testing found in Section 1547(i).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>DOT appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which reversed in a unanimous, unreported panel decision that refused to recognize a motorist’s right under Section 1547(i) to alternative chemical testing. Supporting this decision was well-established precedent of the intermediate court that “Section 1547 does not afford a [motorist] a choice among the three tests listed; rather, it is the police officer who has the option to choose the type of chemical test to be administered.” <em>Tarka v. Com., Dept. of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, </em><a href="/a2d/756/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="756 A.2d 138" data-case-ids="11241699" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/0138-01">756 A.2d 138</a>, 141 (Pa.Cmwlth.2000) (citation omitted) <em>overruled on other grounds by Orloff v.

It is for this reason that anything other than a direct assent to submit to the chemical test requested by the police officer constitutes a Section 1547(b)(1) refusal, which is not vitiated by a motorist’s offer to submit to a different test. <em>McKenna v. Com., Dept. of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, </em><a href="/a3d/72/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="72 A.3d 294" data-case-ids="7306628" data-case-paths="/a3d/72/0294-01">72 A.3d 294</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2013). It is only where a motorist who failed to assent to the officer’s request establishes through competent medical evidence that he was mentally or physically incapable of assenting can he avoid the civil penalty of license suspension. <em>Lemon v.

To construe Section 1547(b)(1) as instead contemplating a request only for “chemical testing” in general, which would have the unavoidable effect of requiring an officer to literally utter a request for “chemical testing” and then ask the motorist to participate by selecting his preferred test, would render implied consent as specified in Section 1547(a) meaningless and divest an officer of authority to direct the course of a DUI investigation. It could not have been the General Assembly’s intent to establish a rule of implied consent at the outset of the statutory scheme only to immediately thereafter devise a procedure for obtaining chemical testing that would nullify the rule. We, therefore, discern “chemical testing” simply as a collective term comprising “chemical test or tests” in recognition of an officer’s authority under Section 1547(a) to request one or more <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>tests.

If the General Assembly had intended such a profound limitation to be placed on implied consent, it easily could have made a right to alternative testing explicit in the statute. It did not do so. Moreover, it would be logical to expect that any language explicitly providing that a motorist’s request for an alternative test shall constitute a submission to chemical testing in satisfaction of implied consent would either appear in, immediately follow or, at the very least, specifically reference Section 1547(b)(1)—the very section devoted to the civil penalty of license suspension and how the police/motorist interaction bears on the prospect of suspension.

Our construction also avoids the uncertainties that may arise from attempts to discern whether an alternative test under 1547(f) is reasonably practicable. While officers are well-acquainted with performing their duties under a reasonableness standard during DUI arrests, their good-faith attempts to accommodate the “reasonably practicable” standard could result in lengthier transport times leading to delayed <em>initial </em>testing and a consequential increased risk of compromised test results.

He never voiced so much as an inclination, let alone an intention, to submit to the officers’ request to take a chemical test of his blood even after he was told that refusing an official request as he was doing amounted to a violation of the Implied Consent Law. In what Appellant estimated was a 60-second exchange, N.T., at 43, he never availed himself of the opportunity to assent but, instead, persisted in denying that he could be deemed to refuse a request to submit to chemical testing when he was willing to take a breathalyzer, a urinalysis or both.

This constituted a refusal under the Implied Consent Law, as Appellant possessed no right to alternative testing as he claimed. Appellant’s belief that the officers misapprehended the law relating to an offer to submit to alternative testing was irrelevant to whether his refusal was justified under Section 1547. <em>See Com., Dept. of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing v.

As presented, this claim is predicated entirely on the discredited position that Subsection 1547(i) confers a right to alternative testing. Because our rejection of the predicate is dispositive of Appellant’s final issue, we need not review it further. In addition, we refrain from <em>sua sponte </em>reviewing whether Subsections 1547(a) and (b) implicitly confer a right to alternative testing where a motorist asserts that an ostensible injury or condition prevents him from submitting to an official request for chemical testing.
