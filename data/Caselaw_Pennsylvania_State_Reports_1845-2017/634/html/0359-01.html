Although Appellant told the officer that Ms. Jeffries had been attacked by several other women, Ms. Jeffries informed the officer that Appellant had actually caused her injuries. Ms. Jeffries explained to the officer that she was reluctant to press charges against Appellant, as she feared he would kill her.

When Ms. Jeffries and her friends decided to leave Cadillac Slim’s and go to another club, Ms. Jeffries asked that a male acquaintance drive Appellant home, as she did not want him to accompany her to the club.

Appellant initially challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s verdict of first-degree murder on the grounds that (1) there was insufficient evidence to establish that Appellant acted with the necessary premeditation; (2) the jury erred in failing to find that Appellant was acting under the “heat of passion” when he fatally stabbed Ms. Jeffries; and (3) the jury erred in finding a specific intent to kill because Appellant presented evidence to show that he was intoxicated at the time of the killing. <em>See Mason, </em><a href="/pa/559/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="559 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="837130" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0500-01">559 Pa. at 509-511</a>, <a href="/a2d/741/0708-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="741 A.2d 708" data-case-ids="11655859,837130" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0708-01,/pa/559/0500-01">741 A.2d at 718-714</a>. This Court found no merit to Appellant’s sufficiency claims, determining that: (1) the circumstances of the case did not, as a matter of law, foreclose a finding of premeditation; (2) the record did not support a heat of passion claim since Appellant claimed that he was so intoxicated at the time of the stabbing that he could not remember whether words were exchanged which would give rise to a heat of passion defense, there was no evidence that the victim did anything immediately before the stabbing to provoke Appellant, and the victim’s son testified that his mother was just lying on the bed when Appellant came into the room and began stabbing her; and (3) it was well within the power of the jury to make a credibility determination and disbelieve the evidence presented by Appellant to establish that intoxication prevented him from forming <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>a specific intent to kill. <em><a href="/a2d/741/0708-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="741 A.2d 708" data-case-ids="11655859,837130" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0708-01,/pa/559/0500-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/559/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="559 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="837130" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0500-01">559 Pa. at 510-512</a>, <a href="/a2d/741/0708-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="741 A.2d 708" data-case-ids="11655859,837130" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0708-01,/pa/559/0500-01">741 A.2d at 713-714</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

This Court determined, however, that Appellant had failed to show that counsel was ineffective.

Further, regarding the adequacy of counsel’s pretrial investigation, we found that the jury was aware of the apparent reconciliation through the testimony of several witnesses, including the victim’s mother herself; thus, the evidence allegedly missed was merely cumulative, and, regardless, would not have precluded the first-degree murder conviction. <em><a href="/a2d/741/0708-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="741 A.2d 708" data-case-ids="11655859,837130" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0708-01,/pa/559/0500-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/559/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="559 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="837130" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0500-01">559 Pa. at 515-516</a>, <a href="/a2d/741/0708-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="741 A.2d 708" data-case-ids="11655859,837130" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0708-01,/pa/559/0500-01">741 A.2d at 716-717</a>. Lastly, as to counsel’s guilt phase closing argument, this Court determined the record reflected that the challenged comment was merely a reminder to the jury that evidence, not emotion, should control the outcome of the case, and, when read in context, the comment was clearly part of counsel’s strategy to persuade the jury that despite the crime’s gruesomeness the evidence showed Appellant was too intoxicated to form the specific <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>intent necessary for a first-degree murder conviction. <em>Id, <a href="/pa/559/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="559 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="837130" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0500-01">559 </a></em><a href="/pa/559/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="559 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="837130" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0500-01">Pa. at 518-519</a>, <a href="/a2d/741/0708-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="741 A.2d 708" data-case-ids="11655859,837130" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0708-01,/pa/559/0500-01">741 A.2d at 718</a>.</p>

The evidentiary hearing was eventually held in October 2011, and was limited to Appellant’s penalty phase issues. During the five day hearing, testimony on behalf of Appellant was elicited from Dr. Robert L. Sadoff, an expert in forensic psychiatry; Dr. Gerald Cooke, an expert in forensic and neuropsychology; Dr. Richard Restak, an expert in neurology; Dr. Allan Tepper, Appellant’s trial expert; Attorney Thomas Moore, Appellant’s trial counsel; Attorney Gerald Stein, Appellant’s direct appeal counsel; Thel<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>ma Mason, Appellant’s mother; Larry Lawhorn, Appellant’s uncle; and Brian Mason, Appellant’s brother.

Appellant’s counsel indicated to Judge Sarmina that he would provide the court with the status of Appellant’s issues, and Judge Sarmina requested that, in addition to addressing the penalty phase mitigation issues, the parties’ post-hearing submissions also indicate the issues upon which Judge Jones definitively ruled and what issues were “still open.” <em>Id. </em>at 51-52.

Appellant further maintained that trial counsel failed to investigate Appellant’s mental health deficiencies, and, despite Dr. Tepper’s pre-trial request, failed to provide additional school records, records of past psychiatric treatment and alcohol and drag abuse treatment, and criminal records, which, Appellant asserted, would have prompted Dr. Tepper to recommended neuropsychological testing that would have revealed Appellant suffered from organic brain damage and enabled Dr. Tepper to opine on the presence of statutory and non-statutory mental health mitigation. In support of this argument, Appellant cited to the testimony of Doctors Cooke, Sadoff and Restak, who, according to Appellant, had the benefit of Appellant’s full records and offered opinions that Appellant suffered from a variety of cognitive conditions that affected his behavior and would have altered the jury’s determination as to the mitigating factors set forth in Sections 9711(e)(2) and (3). <em>Id. </em>at 15-21.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

Appellant faults trial counsel for failing to develop accounts of Appellant’s “long-term, intense and contentious” relationship with the victim, and specifically argues that counsel should have obtained and presented letters from the victim to Appellant expressing her love for him. Appellant’s brief at 16-17. It is unclear how such letters would be of any benefit to proving that the victim provoked Appellant prior to the attack, causing him to act out of sudden and intense passion. Also, because Appellant testified that he did not recall the events of the killing, he could point to no evidence supporting his claim that he acted in the heat of passion. Further, there was no evidence of provocation on the part of the victim immediately prior to the attack, and the letters Appellant faults trial counsel for failing to obtain do not provide such evidence. As such, it was not unreasonable for counsel to forgo attempting to persuade the jury that Appellant acted in the heat of passion.</p>

This profile, when coupled with testimony offered by family mem<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>bers who viewed Appellant to appear “highly intoxicated” and “paranoid” on the evening in question, should have prompted counsel to investigate further into Appellant’s medical and corrections history, which, Appellant asserts, would have provided additional evidence of his violent reactions to heavy drug use.

Moreover, he pursued the expert neuropsychological opinion of Doctor Tepper as to the likely effects of intoxication on Appellant, but he reasonably opted against using the unfavorable opinion Dr. Tepper offered. Therefore, though the record supports the position that there was arguable merit to investigating and presenting a diminished capacity-involuntary intoxication defense, it also shows that trial counsel did, in fact, investigate and present the claim.

To reach this conclusion, Judge Sarmina initially noted that trial counsel hired Dr. Tepper for purposes of both the guilt and penalty phases, and she acknowledges Dr. Tepper’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing that as part of his evaluation he met first with Appellant and gathered background information from him January 1995, then met and gathered background information from Appellant’s mother in February 1995. <em>Id. </em>(citing N.T. 10/25/11 at 95).

Dr. Tepper then interviewed Appellant for a second time and administered psychological testing in March, 1995. <em>Id. </em>(citing N.T. 10/25/11 at 95). Judge Sarmina notes that although Dr. Tepper did not receive all the records he requested, based on the records he did receive, the testing he performed, and the information provided by Appellant and his mother, Dr. Tepper was able to testify at the penalty phase hearing that Appellant was borderline intellectually disabled, that he had long-stand<a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>ing feelings of inferiority and problems with drug addiction, and that the cumulative effect of these issues compromised Appellant’s ability to exercise control over his own behavior. <em>Id. </em>(citing N.T. 2/16/1996 at 74-80).</p>

In so determining, Judge Sarmina specifically found that despite Dr. Tepper’s indication that he learned from the additional public school records that Appellant had extremely low standardized test scores over a number of years that evidenced constant attention and concentration difficulties which might now be considered Attention Deficit Disorder and/or have been brain based, Dr. Tepper was already aware from his original testing and interviews that Appellant fell within the range of borderline intellectual disability, and that Appellant did so poorly in school that he repeated first grade and was placed in a school for those with learning disabilities. <em>Id. </em>(citing N.T. 10/25/11 at 181-132, 148-149, 156-158).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_52" id="ref_footnote_1_52">52</a> Because the records pertaining to Appellant’s intellectual function which trial counsel failed to provide to Dr. Tepper provided only cumulative information to that which he was already aware, the failure to provide such information does not support a finding that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in this regard. <em>Id.</em>

Record evidence of Appellant’s IQ score of 71 as a child, his placement in special classes in elementary school, his adaptive challenges as described by family and trial counsel, and the opinions of Dr. Tepper based on his most recent post-conviction review of Appellant’s history were offered to the PCRA court as threshold support of this claim entitling Appellant to a full evidentiary hearing.

The same cannot be said for the defendant with a potentially colorable <em>Atkins </em>claim, where the very question asking whether a defendant meets the psychological criteria of “intellectually disabled” for purposes of the Eighth Amendment turns on a complex, diagnostic inquiry into whether the defendant experienced onset of both sub-average intellectual functioning as revealed by IQ tests and adaptive functioning deficits based on standards and definitions adopted in the DSM and AAIDD before the age of eighteen.

The High Court’s decision in <em>Nixon </em>illustrates the judicially recognized, fundamental right to plead guilty by differentiating it from the act of conceding guilt during a capital case. Specifically, the High Court held that counsel was not obliged to obtain express consent from a consistently aloof and non-responsive defendant before employing a strategy that conceded guilt during the guilt phase of a capital trial. Central to this holding was the distinction made between conceding guilt during trial and pleading guilty, the latter of which is ultimately a decision for the defendant and always requires a defendant’s express consent. Conceding guilt during the capital trial was an important decision-even though the prospect of a conviction was already very high under the facts of the case-for the obvious reason that it made a verdict of guilt and a subsequent death phase proceeding all but a certainty. However, because the concession did not relieve the prosecution of its <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>burden to prove every element of the first-degree murder charge beyond a reasonable doubt, kept intact defendant’s rights to a jury trial, to confront witnesses against him, and to make evidentiary objections, allowed for at least the theoretical possibility of jury rejection of the prosecution’s case, and would not severely limit the grounds for appellate review, the chosen defense did not involve the loss of core, fundamental rights that occurs with a guilty plea. As such, counsel was free to implement this overarching defense strategy without gaining defendant’s express consent, and the High Court reviewed counsel’s chosen strategy under the <em>Strickland, </em>rubric for ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
      <p id="b515-7" data-blocks='[["BL_515.3",515,[240,2008,1119,275]]]'>To be clear, <em>Nixon </em>was silent on whether the defendant could have, as a matter of law, blocked counsel's strategy had he openly objected to it, which is the issue we address today. However, the <em>Nixon </em>discussion is instructive insofar as it did not consider the highly important and consequential act of conceding guilt in a capital case to be the functional equivalent of the fundamental right to plead guilty so as to condition counsel’s authority on receipt of the defendant's express consent.</p>

On the one hand, Appellant’s counsel did succeed in presenting evidence of Appellant’s borderline intellectual disability, a type of evidence which the Supreme Court of the United States has observed may very well impact capital penalty deliberations. <em>See Penry v.

On the other hand, however, it appears that this evidence could have been better developed, and there was a substantial quantity of other available mitigation. Further, upon my review of the record, I find that counsel was not adept in presenting the type of context for the evidence that was adduced which might resonate with jurors.</p>
    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[183,993,1154,1054]]]'>For example, in his closing remarks, rather than focusing closely upon the impact of Appellant’s intellectual disability upon his moral culpability, counsel ruminated on his personal role in defending against a death sentence, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.T., Feb. 16, 1996, at 114-16; offered a lengthy portrayal of his own childhood experience with a boy who he depicted as impaired, <em>see id. </em>at 116-118; transitioned somewhat discordantly to a theme of “living hell” which he first abstractly ascribed to his client’s life, then entreated the jury to relegate to his client by imposing a life sentence rather than death, <em>see id. </em>at 118-121; and stood in front of a death-qualified jury attempting to draw a comparison between modern-day capital proceedings and the Salem witch trials, <em>see id. </em>at 122. Only a few short and somewhat disjointed passages from the closing touched upon the actual mitigation evidence developed on the record. <em>See id. </em>at 118-19, 125-26. Given such shortcomings, and in light of the availability of a more developed mitigation case, I find the representation to have been sufficiently deficient that a new penalty proceeding is implicated. <em>Cf.
