For the following reasons, we affirm the judgments of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b572-8" data-blocks='[["BL_572.8",572,[250,1173,1154,357]]]'>On the morning of April 4, 2009, 21 year old Richard Poplawski (“Appellant”) was asleep in his Pittsburgh home when his mother, Margaret Poplawski, awoke him with a screaming complaint that their dogs were urinating and defecating on the living room floor. N.T. at 1391, 1447-48. The two argued bitterly until his mother threatened to call police to have him removed from the home. N.T. at 1448.</p>
    <p id="b572-9" data-blocks='[["BL_572.9",572,[249,1563,1154,635]]]'>Appellant warned his mother against doing so and went back to his bedroom as she began to place a phone call. N.T. at 1448. As he listened to his mother’s conversation with a 911 operator, he dressed himself in a level-three ballistics vest and other attire that he would later refer to as his “outfit for intended battle.” N.T. at 1448. To complete the outfit he donned a belt designed to hold .357 ammunition and strapped down his Dan Wesson .357 magnum to his hip. N.T. at 1449. Other firearms, including a fully loaded AK-47 style Romarm semi-automatic rifle (“AK-47”) and a 12-gauge shotgun loaded with alternating slug to buckshot ammunition, were propped up in the corner of his bedroom. N.T. at 1449.</p>

N.T. at 61. Her voice was calm and she indicated that no violence or weapons were involved, although she confirmed that legal weapons were kept in the home. <em>N.T. at 61. </em>The dispatch conveyed “mother son domestic, wants her son out of the house, giving her a hard time, no weapons.” N.T. at 62.</p>
    <p id="b573-4" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[176,618,1158,404]]]'>Margaret Poplawski returned to Appellant’s bedroom and, seeing his preparations, expressed disbelief, saying “come on, you’re not going to do this.” N.T. at 1451. In his mind, Appellant would later tell authorities, he was saying to himself “come on with it,” and he picked up his 12-gauge shotgun and walked out into the living room, where he could see a police officer at the threshold of the front entrance. N.T. at 1451-52.</p>
    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.5",573,[176,1055,1156,1210]]]'>Less than five minutes after receiving the dispatch, Pittsburgh Police Officers Paul Sciullo and Stephen Mayhle had arrived at the Poplawski home. It was Officer Sciullo whom Appellant first saw at the entrance, and he instantly fired his shotgun from the hip, striking down the officer with duty weapon still in holster. N.T. at 1452. This first shot was executed with a “point and click” Appellant would later explain. N.T. at 1452. Appellant then attempted to use the pump action of the shotgun to fire buckshot, but the gun malfunctioned, so he quickly ran to the kitchen to clear the slug shell and chamber a new round. At this time, he heard Officer Mayhle calling for assistance, and Appellant emerged from the kitchen to exchange gunfire with Mayhle inside the house. Mayhle landed two shots, one to the chest but stopped by Appellant’s vest and one to the leg, forcing Appellant back toward the kitchen. Unable to see the officer’s position, Appellant started firing into the wall between the kitchen and dining room and the firing stopped, but he did not know if he had hit the officer. N.T. at 1454. He ran into his bedroom to grab his AK-47 and started toward the front door, where he saw Officer Sciullo lying motionless on his back at the threshold and Officer Mayhle lying outside at the bottom of the steps. N.T. at 1454.</p>

Officer Kelly <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>had just completed his shift and picked up his daughter from work, and the two were nearly home when they heard the police radio report followed by the sound of gunfire from the Poplawski home, which was less than two blocks away. N.T. at 106-07. After dropping off his daughter, Officer Kelly arrived at the scene and was immediately met with gunfire from Appellant’s AK-47. Appellant fired upon the driver’s door before the injured officer exited, and he continued to fire as the officer stumbled his way to behind the rear wheel well, from where the officer drew his duty weapon and fired futilely in several directions. N.T. at 1455. Appellant left the porch to survey the rear of the property and, seeing nothing, returned to the front.</p>
    <p id="b574-4" data-blocks='[["BL_574.4",574,[278,1033,1150,404]]]'>Unsure if Officer Sciullo was still alive, Appellant stood over the officer and fired a single AK-47 shot into his neck. N.T. at 1455. He turned his attention to Officer Mayhle and fired several shots into his prone body, just in case the officer “was playing opossum,” N.T. at 1455-56, causing the officer to twitch with each strike. N.T. at 92. Appellant then fired upon an immobile Officer Kelly, who never returned fire. N.T. at 1456.</p>
    <p id="b574-5" data-blocks='[["BL_574.5",574,[277,1467,1150,309]]]'>With no other activity around his house, Appellant attempted to confiscate Officer Sciullo’s sidearm pistol, but he could not disengage the retention strap of the holster. N.T. at 1456. He then returned to his bedroom to discard the depleted 40 round magazine from the AK-47 and reloaded with a fresh 30 round magazine. N.T. at 1456.</p>

N.T. at 170. He ran to Kelly and managed to drag the officer to a safer position behind the SUV, but could not move him any further. Officer Kelly was bleeding heavily from wounds to his leg and torso, according to McManaway, but was able to speak for a short time before slipping into unconsciousness and losing a pulse. N.T. at 173-80, 245-52. McManaway also observed Margaret Poplawski at this time nervously smoking a cigarette and pacing outside the garage side of the home. <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>She was not visibly armed. N.T. at 182. He yelled and motioned to her to leave the area when AK-47 gunfire coming from a window of the house was directed at him, tearing up the SUV and causing shrapnel to hit his face. N.T. at 175-76. McManaway returned fire and was shot in the left hand during the course of several exchanges. N.T. at 178-80.</p>
    <p id="b575-4" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[178,664,1154,1160]]]'>Appellant’s semi-automatic weapon kept rescuers at bay for over 40 minutes until an <em>ad hoc </em>rescue team comprising both S.W.A.T. and city police used a van draped with bulletproof vests to retrieve Officers McManaway and Kelly from the scene shortly after 8:00 a.m. N.T. at 184, 246. Just minutes later, S.W.A.T. personnel arrived in an armored vehicle and drove it up to the front of the house and were met with heavy gunfire for some time before the pattern changed to intermittent spurts of battle. N.T. at 367-73. Positioning of the armored vehicle to cover the location of Officer Mayhle enabled a rescue/recovery team to reach the fallen officer. Appellant had not been firing his weapon as the team approached, but “gunfire erupted” from his location when they prepared to lift Mayhle. N.T. at 373. No one was injured during the recovery, however. Eventually, a S.W.A.T. sniper positioned on a neighboring home’s roof used a succession of seven or eight shots through the side wall to force Appellant from his strategic firing position deep within the room to a position closer to the window. N.T. at 433. At that moment, the sniper saw the barrel of Appellant’s rifle protrude from the window and he struck it with a single round, disabling the rifle. N.T. at 434.</p>

N.T. at 498. The call was transferred to the 911 supervisor, and eventually to a S.W.A.T. team negotiator on the scene, who construed Appellant’s dealings as deceptive—at one moment saying he was “done shooting innocent police officers right now,” and in the next saying “well, I just want to take one more shot” with his .357 revolver. N.T. at 527. When the negotiator asked him to simply toss the revolver out the <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>window, which had no glass remaining in it at that point, Appellant claimed he could not. N.T. at 529. He also claimed he could not put his hands up at the window and remained out of view inside the room. N.T. at 530. Appellant also expressed anger over his disabled AK-47 and threw it against a wall during the phone conversation. N.T. at 528. When asked about Officer Sciullo, Appellant said not to worry about him because he shot him with a 12-gauge and something else and the officer was dead. N.T. at 528. Eventually, the negotiator managed to arrange the manner of surrender and police officers entered the home and placed Appellant under arrest at 10:44 a.m. N.T. at 544-48.</p>
    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[262,989,1153,789]]]'>Appellant was transported by ambulance to Pittsburgh’s Presbyterian Hospital. Two ambulance crew members and a doctor made an initial assessment of Appellant’s injuries and, once they prepared Appellant for transport, cleared Detective Brian Johnson to begin his interview with Appellant. Detective Johnson read Appellant his Miranda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> rights from a prepared card he carried in his wallet, N.T. at 1312, and then asked if Appellant would talk without the presence of a lawyer. Appellant agreed to talk, but evaded questions with complaints that his flex-tie handcuffs were too tight, that he received too much medication when, in fact, no medication had been administered, and that the paramedic was leaning against him and touching his penis. N.T. at 1314-21. Once at the hospital, Appellant stopped Detective Johnson’s interrogation by invoking his right to an attorney. N.T. at 52.</p>

N.T. at 65, 68, 140. He wore a cervical collar and received for his pain Tylenol and Oxycodone orally and Dilaudid intravenously,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> medications that could cause drowsiness. N.T. at 76-77. <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>Once staff placed him in the hospital bed and police handcuffed and shackled him to its frame, he said to a patient care technician who was washing his face that he did not wake up that morning wanting to kill people. N.T. at 1390. He asked her “how many cops did I kill?” When she said she did not know, he replied “not enough, I bet.” N.T. at 1392.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[186,674,1156,938]]]'>He slept for some time and awoke to see two Pittsburgh police officers in the hallway guarding his room. He yelled to the officers “I’m sorry I killed three of your friends,” N.T. at 1336, and, sometime later, “all you cops are cock suckers, like you’re on a big power trip. I should have killed more of you.” N.T. at 1343. "When a nurse later arrived with a dinner tray, one of the officers entered the room with her and, noticing there was no table for the tray, suggested that the nurse could put it on his chair. Appellant responded “you motherfuckers aren’t going to eat. That’s why I kill you motherfuckers because of your power trips.” N.T. at 1347. After Appellant ate and the officer returned to the hallway, Appellant said in a calm voice that the officer who shot him in the chest was brave and that only Appellant’s ballistics vest stopped the bullet. “He could have ended it all,” Appellant said. N.T. at 1348. He said the officers did not deserve what happened and that he would spend the rest of his life in prison “biting off dicks.” N.T. at 1348.</p>

N.T. at 1350. Appellant again screamed the invectives he had earlier directed at the officers. N.T. at 1350. He later yelled at the officer “I wish it was you that came to my door today.” N.T. at 1351. The officers did not respond to Appellant’s outbursts. N.T. at 1351.</p>

N.T. at 1338. Accordingly, at 10:06 p.m., Sheriffs Deputies Troy Garrett and Brad Nevin began their shift and applied their handcuffs <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>and shackles to Appellant before the officers removed theirs. Appellant asked if the deputies could dowse the light in the room, but the deputies cited their need to observe him. N.T. at 1372.</p>

N.T. at 1372. The deputy agreed the handcuff was somewhat tight and he loosened it. N.T. at 1373. At that point, Appellant said he was sorry about what happened and that it all happened so fast. He remembered hearing his mother crying in the basement and the police officers screaming outside. N.T. at 1378. Without response from Deputy Garrett, who remained silent throughout, Appellant said he did not care for the direction in which the country was headed, but knew where he was going and that he deserved to go there. N.T. at 1374. He said he had always considered himself a fighter for liberty and a supporter of police, and he acknowledged that they had a hard job and that he did not feel sorry for himself. N.T. at 1374, 1381. When Appellant had finished his comments he thanked Deputy Garrett for listening to him, and Deputy Garrett walked outside the room and took notes about what was just said. N.T. at 1376. He then called the major crimes divisions of the Pittsburgh Police Department to inform them that Appellant was volunteering facts about the shooting.</p>

N.T. at 1436. As Deputy Garrett described Appellant’s earlier actions and comments, Appellant caught Detective Smith’s eye and nodded to him, so the detective walked toward him. N.T. at 1437. Appellant said he liked the current guards but disliked the previous pair, <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>and he believed the hospital staff was mistreating him because of what he had done. N.T. at 1437. At these complaints, the detective began to walk out of the room to resume talks with Garrett and told Appellant he would call a nurse to the room. N.T. at 1437. Appellant stopped him by asking to see his arraignment papers and, upon seeing the complaint against him, stated that he did not intend to shoot the neighbors’ houses. N.T. at 1438. Appellant then asked the detective his name and if he was with the police. Detective Smith offered his name, rank, and assignment, and Appellant said he wished to talk. Detective Smith advised that he had to get a pre-interrogation warning form faxed from his office, first, because Appellant had invoked his right to remain silent and requested counsel.</p>

Appellant provided his biographical information and confirmed after each paragraph that he understood his rights by answering “yes, sir” and initialing the form each time. N.T. at 1440, 1442. At the end of the form, Appellant confirmed that he was willing to waive his rights and answer questions without the presence of a lawyer, again, by answering “yes, sir” and initialing the form where the detective had written his affirmative answer verbatim.

As recounted <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth presented Appellant’s highly detailed confession as to how he carried out his ambush-style attack upon Officers Sciullo and Mayhle when they arrived at his home. He killed Officer Sciullo with a shotgun blast to the head, and struck down Officer Mayhle with multiple rounds of shotgun and AK-47 gunfire. He gratuitously shot both officers additional times in the head and neck with his AK-47 as they lay motionless on the ground. He opened fire on Officer Kelly’s SUV as it pulled up in front of his home, striking the officer’s leg through the driver’s side door, and fatally pierced the officer’s vest with the same high-powered AK-47 ammunition as Kelly exited his vehicle. Neighbors identified the shotgun blasts as the first shots fired, and they witnessed Appellant shooting at the prone bodies of all three officers. Expert forensic testimony further substantiated the use of deadly weapons to vital parts of the officers’ bodies. Accordingly, we hold that sufficient evidence was presented to permit a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was guilty of three counts of murder in the first degree.</p>

His two-prong argument states, first, that police impermissi-bly failed to scrupulously honor his invocation of the right to <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>counsel. The invocation was clearly and unequivocally made, Appellant emphasizes, when he eventually declared “I want my fucking lawyer” as Detective Johnson was interviewing him in the hospital emergency room. N.T. at 52. Although questioning ceased at this point, police maintained a coercive presence over the many hours in which he lay restrained in a hospital bed by standing outside his hospital room in plain sight, escorting all personnel entering his room, and periodically turning on the overhead lights during nighttime hours, he continues. He avers that this chronic pressure culminated with Detective Smith, summoned to the hospital after Appellant had broken his 16 hours of silence by volunteering statements to a Sheriffs Deputy guarding his room, allowing Appellant to begin a conversation that led to his signing a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form and providing incriminating statements.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Pain and blood loss from the gunshot wound, fear and agitation expressed about likely consequences, perceived hostility from guards, and several administrations of intravenous pain killers, including schedule IV narcotics Oxycodone and Dilaudid over a 16-hour period, all worked in concert to deprive Appellant of the lucidity that had prompted him 16 hours earlier to invoke his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, he insists.

Credited was testimony by the nursing staff and officers alike who explained that officers neither questioned Appellant nor responded to his many outbursts during the time his invocation was effective. Deputy Garrett entered Appellant’s room only because Appellant asked him to loosen a tight handcuff, and Garrett remained silent when Appellant began to talk about the crime, his motivations, and his expression of remorse, the court found. While Detective Smith arrived because Garrett notified him about Appellant’s new willingness to talk, Smith did not enter the room until Appellant motioned for him, and he advised Appellant that they could not converse because Appellant had requested an attorney.

When Deputy Garrett entered Appellant’s room on Appellant’s request that a handcuff be loosened, he listened when Appellant volunteered statements concerning his case, but he neither initiated the encounter nor conversed with Appellant, and he made notes only afterward.

Only when Appellant then renounced his invocation and said he wished to speak did Detective Smith request a <em>Miranda </em>form be faxed to the hospital, go over the form with Appellant, and begin an interview. At the time of this interview, therefore, Appellant had been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights twice by two different law enforcement personnel and had been advised of his rights additionally by a magistrate. Moreover, testimony indicated Appellant was alert and perceptive during each of these advisements and again at the time he renounced his invocation, all of which occurred in a hospital setting. This record supports both the suppression court’s factual findings, which are binding on this Court, and its legal conclusion that Appellant freely decided to renounce his invocation of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights in a hospital environment in which law enforcement officers honored his rights.</p>

N.T. at 263, 292. At trial, however, when the Commonwealth asked Dr. Williams if he could determine which “grouping of gunshot wounds on Eric Kelly’s body were administered first,” defense counsel’s objection was overruled. The trial court had initially sustained objections to testimony regarding the order of specific wounds received, but at trial it allowed Dr. Williams to infer from the alignment of bullet holes in the driver’s side door of Kelly’s SUV with the gunshot wounds in his leg that Officer Kelly received this grouping of gunshot wounds as he sat in the driver’s seat, and it allowed him to then opine further that Kelly received the directly fatal gunshot wound to his torso as he exited the vehicle. Dr. Williams’ report had identified this as the “most inevitably fatal” shot.</p>

He fails, however, to carry his burden of explaining how this admission of evidence prejudiced his defense. Examination of the entire record reveals that Dr. Williams’ testimony merely corroborated unrebutted eyewitness accounts that Appellant initiated gunfire on Officer Kelly, who fell to the ground immediately after first alighting his vehicle and remained incapacitated there. The crime scene investigation, as well, noted the <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>incapacitated officer lay on the sidewalk next to his SUV for an extended time as Appellant’s gunfire prevented paramedics and fellow officers from offering aid. The uncontradicted evidence admitted elsewhere during trial overwhelmingly established that he fired the fatal shot while Officer Kelly was just exiting his vehicle. Unsupported by a showing of prejudice, this claim fails.</p>
    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[273,732,1153,1208]]]'>Appellant next contends that Allegheny County Associate Medical Examiner and Forensic Pathologist Dr. Todd Luckasevic also testified to opinions not in his report when describing the autopsy of Officer Mayhle. The defense objected when the prosecution asked Dr. Luckasevic if he could opine on the position of Officer Mayhle at the time he received a fatal gunshot wound that entered his face and severed his cervical spine. At side bar, defense counsel asked for an offer of proof, and the prosecutor replied that she expected the doctor to say the officer was either standing, sitting up, or directly underneath the shooter because those would be the three possibilities based on the essentially level trajectory the bullet had taken once it entered the face. N.T. at 567. Defense counsel protested that, again, this opinion was not in the doctor’s report, nor was it offered when defense counsel interviewed the doctor six months earlier, and she decried the prosecutor’s practice of relying on “surprise opinions” to make its case. N.T. at 567. The court disagreed that the question would produce a surprise opinion, noting that “I don’t think you have to be a forensic pathologist to figure out if the bullet goes straight, you either have to be standing up, sitting down, or on the ground ... this is pathology, but it isn’t rocket science, so the objection is overruled.” N.T. at 567.</p>

N.T. at 568. When asked by the Commonwealth what position the officer must have been in to sustain that wound path, Dr. Luckasevic responded that because many positions would be <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>consistent it was a difficult question to answer. The doctor recommended, instead, that he could offer an opinion as to whether the wound was consistent with a particular scenario. N.T. at 568. The Commonwealth then supplied a hypothetical based on Exhibit 76, a crime scene photograph depicting Officer Mayhle’s body lying face up on a concrete slab. Assuming that the concrete was beveled out underneath the officer’s head, the prosecutor asked the doctor if he could determine the location of the firearm in relation to the officer. The doctor answered “[i]f, as you say, the concrete’s beveled out, the bullet had to have been fired from above in a downward fashion.” N.T. at 569. It followed, the doctor opined under this same assumed scenario, that the two gunshot wounds to Officer Mayhle’s back must have preceded this head wound given the “immediately incapacitating” effect severance of the spinal cord would have had. N.T. at 576-78. Moreover, the shallower of the two back wounds was marked by a path entering the low back and exiting much higher, consistent with the officer bending down in a running motion. N.T. at 580. In fact, the doctor opined, the three shallow wounds to the officer’s body were all consistent with this physical position. N.T. at 576-78.</p>

Moreover, the record demonstrates that defense counsel ably nullified the victim position line of questioning through her cross-examination of Dr. Luckasevic, which developed the critical expert opinion that it was not possible to ascertain from the wound angle Officer Mayhle’s precise location and position at the time he received his fatal wound. The most Dr. Luckasevic offered was an opinion that Officer Mayhle’s gunshot wounds were just as likely caused in a manner consistent with the Commonwealth’s hypothetical as they were with the defendant’s alternate hypothetical.

As Dr. Shakir began to describe how the wound was not a “typical gunshot wound of an ordinary bullet,” N.T. at 890, defense counsel anticipated that the doctor would identify the bullet that caused the wound and objected. At sidebar conference, the court rejected defense counsel’s argument that the testimony went beyond the scope of the coroner’s report and ambushed the defense with surprise testimony. “He’s going to base it on the size of the wounds.

N.T. at 892. Dr. Shakir went on to describe a second gunshot wound that transected the brain as well and constituted another lethal wound, N.T. at 897, and thereafter catalogued six more entry wounds to the head, neck, and torso of Officer Sciullo, two of them received post-mortem, he opined, as the officer’s body lay in the doorway to Appellant’s home.

Even if we were to assume, instead, that a discovery violation attended this expert testimony, Appellant fails to specify how the testimony caused him prejudice other than offering a generic statement that the expert opinion was “particularly damaging” because it included “what weapons were used.” Brief for Appellant at 54. Appellant’s own properly admitted statement to police, however, indicated he had shot Officer Sciullo with a shotgun rifle slug. Again, our precedent cited above clarifies that prejudice is not simply presumed in the instance of a discovery violation, but must be established by the complaining party. We therefore find that no reversible error attended the admission of Dr. Shakir’s expert testimony on slug types. To the extent Appellant’s challenge to Dr. Shakir’s testimony may be fairly read to incorporate generic assertions, appearing elsewhere in the brief, that the testimony included improper opinion on the position of Officer Sciullo at the time he was shot, the record demonstrates that defense counsel effectively cross-examined the expert on this point. <em>See </em>footnote 13, <em>supra.</em>

N.T. at 1146-47. Nor, for that matter, could he say from what direction the bullets hitting the slab were fired or how old the defects were. N.T. at 1146-47. With respect to ballistics evidence gathered inside the home, the record shows that Dr. Levine opined on direct examination how placing a straight probe through a hole and connecting to a bullet lodged in a closet wall enabled him to infer the location of Appellant during the time of the shooting. On cross-examination, however, Dr. Levine acknowledged defense counsel’s point that it is accurate to describe the use of a probe as assisting in determining bullet flight lines rather than the precise locations of a shooter, and consequently modified his diagram to allow for a range of possible locations anywhere along a line cutting across several rooms in the interior.

It was grossly unfair and alarming, he argues, that the Commonwealth was not only using expert testimony beyond what it presented during discovery but was also gathering more expert opinion during the course of trial, all without volunteering the post-discovery opinion when it gained it. N.T. at 879. The Commonwealth had two years in which to supplement reports and supply opinions regarding the officers’ body positions when shot, what weapons were used, where Appellant stood when he shot at the officers, and ballistic evidence that the defense was unaware of and unprepared to defend against.

Since a broader assessment of the impact of the overall evidence along these lines will likely be required on post-conviction review, I would refrain at this juncture from wider <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>pronouncements, pertaining to the penalty phase, as to harmlessness.</p>
    <p id="b628-4" data-blocks='[["BL_628.4",628,[251,461,1153,839]]]'>Concerning Part V’s treatment of the admission of evidence that Appellant visited a controversial website, I would not deem Appellant’s challenge to have been waived as does the majority. <em>See id. </em>at 569, 130 A.3d at 728. The material aspect of the salient objection, it would seem to me, is invocation of the requirement of Rule of Evidence 403 that evidence should be excluded where its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 403. While certainly inartful, Appellant’s trial counsel appears to have been attempting to advance just such an argument, when she was interrupted by the trial judge’s ruling. <em>See </em>N.T., June 23, 2011, at 871-72 (“[Bjeeause he’s on the Penguin website, that doesn’t make him a hockey player. Because he was on StormFront—”). As I would treat this claim as preserved, at least as pertaining to the guilt phase of trial, I would simply deem the evidence harmless in such regard.</p>
    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[249,1322,1157,1054]],["BL_629.1",629,[175,349,1153,91]]]'>As to the potential spillover effect into the penalty phase, however, I believe that this matter is best left for post-conviction review. In this regard, I note that penalty counsel did not object when the Commonwealth moved for incorporation of the guilt-phase evidence into the penalty phase, although the very limited purpose for which some of that evidence had been admitted was unrelated to penalty. Moreover, penalty counsel also failed to object to the prosecutor’s specific allusions to the evidence, which clearly transcended the basis for its admission at the guilt phase. <em>See </em>N.T., June 28, 2011, at 328 (“Nazism, StormFront, haters, ladies and gentlemen ... [;] what he learned on those websites, chatting with those people, those like-minded haters and bigots and racists, we’ll never know.”). From my point of view, in the absence of critical objections to a pattern of conduct on the part of the prosecutor—encompassing statements deemed by the majority to be “highly irregular and improper,” Majority Opinion, at 575 n. 17, 130 A.3d at 731 n. 17, and by the trial judge to be “way over the line” and “just pandering to the emotions of the jury,” N.T., June 27, 2011, at 95-96—I believe <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>that a probing judicial assessment is properly reserved to post-conviction.</p>
    <p id="b629-4" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[176,460,1157,896]]]'>Regarding the issue of future dangerousness (Part VI), the Court recently related that “a prosecutor is permitted to discuss a defendant’s future dangerousness during rebuttal, after a defendant <em>places his future conduct at issue.” Commonwealth v. Eichinger, </em><a href="/pa/631/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="631 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="6786278" data-case-paths="/pa/631/0138-01">631 Pa. 138</a>, 162, <a href="/pa/631/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="108 A.3d 821" data-case-ids="6786278,6888344" data-case-paths="/pa/631/0138-01,/a3d/108/0821-01">108 A.3d 821</a>, 835 (2014) (emphasis added). The majority appears to appropriately determine that mitigation evidence centered on a defendant’s positive influence on peers as recently as high school, <em>(see </em>Majority Opinion, at 580-82, 130 A.3d at 734-36), is not of a type placing future conduct in issue, but it proceeds nevertheless to deny relief based on harmless error. <em>See id. </em>at 578-79, 130 A.3d at 733-34. Again, viewing this claim in isolation, I do not regard the difficulty with the prosecutor’s remarks implicating future dangerousness as sufficient, in and of itself, to warrant a new penalty hearing, but I would reserve an assessment of the aggregation of the prosecutorial overreaching for the post-conviction stage, where the broader range of it may be appropriately considered.</p>
    <p id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[178,1375,1153,293]]]'>Finally, I am concerned with the apparent abuse of the latitude afforded to the prosecution to introduce victim-impact evidence, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 580-81, 130 A.3d at 734-35 and I would suggest that this case may present an apt vehicle, on post-conviction review, for imposing some rational limits as a supervisory matter.</p>
