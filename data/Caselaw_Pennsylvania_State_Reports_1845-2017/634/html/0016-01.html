Thus, the Legislature faced a situation in which <em>Neiman </em>invalidated a statute which had already expired and been replaced, but whose effects remained beyond its expiration date—in the form of prior registration periods which had to continue in existence in order to be extended by SORNA. Inasmuch as the Assembly could do nothing to restore the now-expired Megan’s Law III as such, it enacted legislation designed to continue in force SORNA registration requirements for offenders whose registration periods began during Megan Law Ill’s governance.</p>

Thus, because the ten-year registration requirement under Section 8 of Megan’s Law III was imposable between January 23, 2005 and December 19, 2012—the day before Section 9795.1 expired—it seems evident the General Assembly sought to preserve the effect of that provision via the specific wording of paragraph (3.1)— which by its terms applies to anyone who, during that interval, was convicted of a sexually violent offense or under probationary or parole supervision as a result of the conviction of a <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>sexually violent offense. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9799.13(3.1)(i). Moreover, since Section 8 of Megan’s Law III, as it pertains to individuals convicted of indecent assault, only encompasses convictions graded as first-degree misdemeanors, the legislative effort to preserve Megan’s Law III registrants as SOR-NA registrants required a restricted definition of “sexually violent offense” for purposes of paragraph (3.1)—namely, one which would exclude persons convicted of indecent assault graded as a second-degree misdemeanor, since those individuals would not have been required to register under Megan’s Law III.</p>

Thus, the legislative goal as it pertains to paragraph (2) did not relate to recovering registration periods that would otherwise have been lost due to Neiman—as, indeed, it was enacted two years before <em>Neiman </em>was decided. Rather, paragraph (2) must also be understood in light of SORNA’s stated purposes which, as noted, are set forth at Section 9799.10, 42 Pa.C.S. These include, not only bringing Pennsylvania into substantial compliance with the Adam Walsh Act, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9799.10(1), but more particularly, “requiring] individuals who are <em>currently </em>... supervised with respect to probation or parole or registrants under this subchapter to register with the Pennsylvania State Police ....” <em><a href="/pa/630/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="107 A.3d 1" data-case-ids="4276409,6890827" data-case-paths="/pa/630/0408-01,/a3d/107/0001-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 9799.10(4) (emphasis added).
