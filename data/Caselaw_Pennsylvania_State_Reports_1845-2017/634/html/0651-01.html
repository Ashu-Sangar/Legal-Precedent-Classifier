We hold § 954(a) is a statute of repose; its applicability, as determined by statutory interpretation, is a question of law for courts to decide. Further, the trial court properly held biosolids application falls within the RTFA’s definition of “normal agricultural operation,” which bars appel-lees’ nuisance claims. Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the Superior Court’s order that reversed the grant of summary judgment for appellants on the nuisance claims; we affirm the remainder of the order.</p>

Although the PaDEP, which with the York County Solid Waste Authority monitored the application of the biosolids, issued notices of violation to Synagro in 2006, 2007, and 2009, none of these involved odors; the violations involved spreading the biosolids beyond designated areas and tilling too soon after application. <em>See </em>Appendix to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Vol. I, Exs.

The court stated § 954(a)’s express terms contain three requirements for a nuisance action to be barred: (1) the agricultural operation has an established date of operation at least one year prior to the filing of the action; (2) the conditions or circumstances constituting the basis of the action have been substantially unchanged since the established date of operation; and (3) the conditions are a “normal agricultural operation,” as defined in § 952 of the RTFA. <em>Id., </em>at 43.</p>

Thus, it is a statute of repose, which extinguishes a cause of action and divests a court of jurisdiction—in contrast to a statute of limitations, which measures when a party must file a lawsuit after a cause of action has accrued and is a defense that must be proven to a jury. Appellants contend because § 954(a) is jurisdictional, its applicability is a question of law to be decided by a court, and only a court may engage in the statutory interpretation necessary to determine whether the practice at issue—here, the application of biosolids—is a “normal agricultural operation” under § 954(a); to hold otherwise would invade the province of the court and weaken the RTFA “by requiring litigation in the precise circumstances where the legislature determined none should occur.” Appellants’ Brief, at 14.

How a practice is conducted and whether it meets industry standards and regulations are questions pertaining to the merits of the nuisance action itself, once the court has determined such action is not barred by § 954(a); however, the inquiry under § 954(a)—whether an activity is a “normal agricultural operation”—is a categorical inquiry for the court.

This purpose cannot be achieved unless the definition of “normal agricultural operation” is read expansively, taking into account new developments in the farming industry. The fact that biosolids use is not specifically mentioned in the RTFA’s definition is not determinative, as the definition is broadly drafted, aimed at protecting farms now and in the future; enumerating specific activities would render the definition outdated as farming technology progresses. The legislative goal is to protect and encourage farming innovation, as evidenced by amendment of the definition of “normal agricultural operation” in 1998. <em>See </em>Act of May 15, 1998, P.L. 441, No. 58, § 1.

Notably, <em>amicus </em>City of Philadelphia’s history of producing biosolids for agricultural use illustrates the practice’s acceptance: the City has engaged in such production for over 30 years; since 1990, over one-third of its biosolids have been used on farms in Pennsylvania and elsewhere; since 2008, the City has recycled 100% of its biosolids, with half of them being applied to land; and in 2014, 15,524 dry tons of the City’s biosolids were used on Pennsylvania farms. <em>See Amicus Curiae </em>City of Philadelphia’s Brief in Support of Appellants, at 2-3, 5-6.

BB, Excerpt of EPA Process Design Manual, “Land Application of Sewage Sludge and Domestic Septage,” at 1 (1988) (stating 38% of sewage sludge generated annually in United States is applied to land; 67% of that amount is applied on agricultural lands). Biosolids application is influenced by varying nutrient needs of crops from season-to-season, the weather, and storage and transportation logistics; thus, the amount and time of year of the application varies monthly, seasonally, and annually. <em>See </em>Appendix to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Vol. Ill, Ex. BB, Excerpt of EPA Process Design Manual, “Land Application of Sewage Sludge and Domestic Septage,” at 5, § 2.2.1 (1983) (describing how sewage sludge application to farmland must be at rate equal to or less than “agronomic rate” concerning nitrogen amount). Such variance, as experienced in the instant matter, does not make the practice any less “normal.” Additionally, the manner in which biosolids are applied at a particular site is not determinative of the practice’s normalcy, in general. Thus, we reject appellees’ contention that the allegedly improper manner in which the biosolids were applied here determines whether this is a “normal agricultural operation”; the manner of application and the resulting harm go to the underlying merits of the nuisance claim, but the question of law for the trial court was whether application of biosolids, generally, is a normal operation.

The application of biosolids to farmland has been closely regulated by the PaDEP for 30 years, and the RTFA is part of a comprehensive regulatory framework for biosolids use. We cannot ignore the existence of other statutes, regulations, and case law that classify biosolids use on farmland as an ordinary farming practice to be encouraged. The RTFA should not be considered in isolation, but in the context of the elaborate regulatory framework for biosolids use in which it exists. Within this framework, both the SWMA and Act 38 include the land application of biosolids in their respective definitions of “normal farming operations” and “normal agricultural operation.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a>

The Nutrient Management Act includes biosolids in its definition of “nutrient.” <em>See id., </em>§ 503 (stating “nutrient” “includes, but is not limited to, livestock and poultry manures, compost as fertilizer, commercially manufactured chemical fertilizers, <em>sewage sludge </em>or combinations thereof’) (emphasis added). The PaDEP’s regulations define “agricul<a id="p687" href="#p687" data-label="687" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*687</a>tural utilization” to include the use of biosolids as fertilizer. <em>See </em>25 Pa.Code § 271.1 (providing “agricultural utilization” includes <em>“land application of sewage sludge </em>for its plant nutrient value or as a soil conditioner”) (emphasis added); <em>see also Hempfield Twp. v.

    <p id="b732-8" data-blocks='[["BL_732.9",732,[248,972,1159,794]]]'>I join the majority opinion and write to suggest that, if the manner in which a farming practice is carried out deviates substantially from the norm and has unusual adverse effects upon neighboring properties, at some point that particular method of implementing the practice should be viewed as a distinct practice whose agricultural normalcy should be independently evaluated. Indeed, the line separating a farming industry practice as such, and the particular manner in which it is implemented, may not always be clear. <em>Cf. </em>Majority Opinion, at 682, 131 A.3d at 19 (explaining that the question of whether an agricultural operation is “normal” for Section 954(a) purposes “is a broad one, focusing on the practice in general, not on whether the defendant ... conducted the practice in accordance with accepted industry standards and regulations”).</p>

The majority concludes that it does and that it is agriculturally normal. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 683-85, 131 A.3d at 20-22. The majority continues that “the <em>manner </em>in which biosolids are applied at a particular site is not determinative of the practice’s normalcy,” but, instead, “go[es] to the underlying merits of the nuisance claim[.]” <em>Id. </em>at 685, 131 A.3d at 21-22 (emphasis added). Although, as explained below, I ultimately agree with the <a id="p689" href="#p689" data-label="689" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*689</a>majority, I see the issue as a close one, for the following reasons.</p>
    <p id="b733-4" data-blocks='[["BL_733.4",733,[174,451,1157,1090]]]'>There was evidence that, as used by Hilltop Farms, the biosolids were, for the most part, applied to the surface of the land and were not plowed into the soil. <em>See </em>N.T., Feb. 16, 2012, at 26 (deposition of Synagro employee Jonathan Coble), <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. 373a. In this regard, a fact sheet issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency lists various methods to reduce odors at land application sites, including subsurface injection or incorporation of biosolids into the soil. <em>See </em>Biosolids and Residuals Management Fact Sheet, EPA 832-F-00-067, at 2 (Sept.2000), <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. 579a; <em>see also </em>Brief for Appellees at 4-7, 46-49 (suggesting that Appellants failed to take known precautions to reduce or control odors). Further, Appellees contend incorporation of best practices into a farming methodology is an essential part of the agricultural operation itself for purposes of a judicial normalcy determination under the Right To Farm Act (“RTFA”). They note that courts in other States have reached similar outcomes under the right-to-farm legislation pertaining in those jurisdictions. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellees at 57-58 (citing <em>Wyatt v. Sussex Surry, LLC, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2007%20WL%205969399" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="2007 WL 5969399">2007 WL 5969399</a> (Va.Cir.Ct.2007); <em>Trosclair v.

RTFA’s stated legislative objectives are broadly remedial, <em>accord </em>Brief for <em>Amicus Curiae </em>Attorney General at 9 (observing that RTFA is a “broad and anticipatory statute aimed at protecting agricultural land and operations now and into the future”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> and as such, it is subject to a liberal construction designed to effectuate its objectives. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(c). As for the enactments at issue in <em>Wyatt </em>and <em>Trosclair, </em>those provisions are not statutes of repose and, moreover, unlike in Pennsylvania, <a id="p690" href="#p690" data-label="690" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*690</a>they grant immunity from nuisance liability expressly in terms of agricultural operations conducted in accordance with best-management practices. <em>See Wyatt, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2007%20WL%205969399" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="2007 WL 5969399">2007 WL 5969399</a>, at *2 (quoting Va.Code Ann. § 3.1-22.29(A)); <em>Trosclair, </em><a href="/so2d/717/1257-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="717 So. 2d 1257" data-case-ids="11720533" data-case-paths="/so2d/717/1257-01">717 So.2d at 1259</a> (quoting La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 3:3603(B)). Given these differences, I view the majority’s present, broad categorical approach to the surface application of biosolids as appropriately balancing the protections afforded by RTFA with neighboring property owners’ reasonable ability to challenge substantially altered conditions on the subject farm in a timely manner. With that said, I note that agricultural knowledge tends to develop and improve over time. Thus, I would not rule out the possibility that an evidentiary record in a future dispute could support the concept that the use of certain identified odor-control practices is necessary for a particular application of biosolids to qualify as “normal” and, thus, to fall within Section 954(a)’s protective scope.</p>
