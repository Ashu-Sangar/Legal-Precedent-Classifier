        "text": "Mr. Justice Sharswood\ndelivered the opinion of the court, May 29th 1876.\nUpon the main question presented upon the auditor\u2019s report and the exceptions thereto there are no merits in the appellant\u2019s case. It has neither law nor justice on its side. The opinion of the court in Duffey v. Duffey, 8 Wright 402, is direct to the point \u2014 that when a step-father takes his step-child to reside with him as one of his family, while the one cannot claim for services the other is precluded from compensation for expenditures. The facts reported by the auditor and fully sustained by the evidence make this a very strong case in illustration of the justice of that ruling. The only fact relied on to meet it \u2014 that the former guardian was allowed in his account a small sum paid to the step-father \u2014 is a very insignificant one, when we consider that he was the surety for that guardian, and was his successor in the trust. In the settlement of the account of Easton, before his discharge and the appointment of Bratten to succeed him the wise provision of the 11th section of the Act of March 1832, Pamph. L. 192, \u201c that in every such case it shall be the duty of the court to appoint some suitable person to appear and act for the ward in respect of the settlement of such account,\u201d seems to-have been entirely overlooked. We have not the question of the conclusiveness of that settlement upon the ward now before us. No exception was taken on the subject of the allowance of the f 100, for which Easton had credit in his settlement as paid to Bratten. The account of the latter settled during the minority of the ward, and hot accompanied or followed thereupon by his discharge, stands upon an entirely different footing. All partial accounts of guardians during the minority of the ward, whether filed in the Register\u2019s office or in the office of the clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court, are not for settlement and confirmation, and even if they go through the forms of a settlement and confirmation are not conclusive upon the ward. Yeager\u2019s Appeal, 10 Casey 173. There was here no one to represent her and take care of her interest. The court cannot be expected to do so. They have not knowledge of the necessary facts to enable them to adjudicate. In the present instance non constat that the court were made acquainted with the relation between the guardian and ward. The names were different and there was nothing to indicate that any such relation existed. It is clear that the decision in Rhoads\u2019s Appeal, 3 Wright 186, has no application, but only to cases where the account is properly and legally presented for settlement and confirmation. The learned court below were therefore entirely right in dismissing the exception of the appellant and confirming the report of the auditor.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.",

    "head_matter": "Douglas\u2019s Appeal. Landis\u2019s Estate.\n3. Partial accounts of a guardian, filed during minority, are not conclusive upon a ward, even though they go through the form of a settlement and confirmation.\n2. When a step-father takes his step-child to live with him as one of his family, he is not entitled to be repaid for expenditures made for her during her minority.\n3. B. took his step-daughter, L., under two years of age, to live with him as one of his family, where she lived until her majority; a former guardian, whose security B. was, in settling his account claimed a credit for payment to B. for L.\u2019s support; and B., when appointed guardian of L., asked credit for certain yearly payments as the cost of her maintenance: Held (affirming the court below), that B., as guardian, was not entitled to compensation for maintaining L. during her minority.\nMay 24tb 1876.\nBefore Agnew, 0. J., Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson and Woodward, JJ. Williams, J., absent.\nThis was an appeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court of Franklin county: Of May Term 1876, No. 105.\nIt was taken from a decree of the court below confirming the report of the auditor appointed to audit the final account of James H. Bratten, deceased, guardian of Mary Perry (formerly Landis), as filed by his administrator c. t. a., J. W. Douglas.\nThe case was this:\u2014\nIn the end of 1849, Jacob Landis, of York county, died intestate, leaving to survive him his widow, Catharine Landis, and a daughter, Mary, then but a few weeks old. In April 1851, the Orphans\u2019 Court of York county appointed Jacob Ehrhart guardian of Mary Landis. In June 1851, when the daughter was about eighteen months old, Catharine Landis married James H. Bratten, and from that time until Bratten\u2019s death, in 1868, Mary Landis lived with her mother and step-father at Chambersburg, in Franklin county. As to the circumstances under which she lived with her step-father, Mrs. Susan Frey testified as follows:\u2014\n\u201c Mr. Bratten was one day in our house and talking to Mr. Frey; he said in my presence, in reply to Mr. Frey\u2019s saying to him about marrying a widow with a child, that \u2018 that made no difference to him, that he intended-to raise that child as his own, that he had promised his wife before he married her that as long as he had bread, she should have it \u2014 that he would care for and support the child as if it was his own.\u2019 He did do so; the child was in his family the same as his own children; when he bought for them, he bought for her just the same; if he gave to his own daughters for spending money or for church, he gave to her also; she called him \u2018 father,\u2019 and he called her \u2018 daughter,\u2019 or \u2018 Mary.\u2019 She was a young lady when he died; she did a good deal of work in the family, more I think, than any of them; she nursed the children, and when I was there, I saw her cooking just the same as his own children. The children were all educated at the common schools here in town, and went to the same schools as my own children; he never sent her away from town to school.\u201d\nIn 1856, Ehrhart was removed from the guardianship by a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of York county, and Hezekiah Easton a2Dpointed in his place. Easton entered the necessary security, with James H. Bratten as his surety. In 1860, Easton being desirous of withdrawing from the trust, filed his account in the proper office in Franklin county, in which he charged himself with $600, under date of April 1st 1857, as \u201c money received when appointed,\u201d and claimed credit for the following :\u2014\nApril 1st 1857 \u2014 Paid Jas. H. Bratten for keeping said Mary Landis near four years, ..... $100.00\nAlso, the interest on said money, it being (Jan. 17th 1860) five hundred dollars, which amounted to . . . 70.00\nAllowance for guardian,......20.00\nMortgage in favor of said Mary Landis, coming from James\nH. Bratten, entered in Mortgage Book E, page 160,. 410.00\n$600.00\nRegister, ......... 3.50\nClerk, ......... 2.50\nThis account was. duly confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court of that county. Easton was thereupon discharged from the trust at his own request, and James H. Bratten was appointed guardian in his place. On October 1st 1867, Bratten filed a partial account in the Register\u2019s office of Franklin county, as follows:\u2014\nMarch 13th 1860 \u2014 Money received from her former guar-\ndian, Jacob Ehrhart, ...... $500.00\nInterest to the present, ...... 220.00\n$720.00\nIn this account he claimed credit for Fees paid G. W. Toms, register, .... 3.50\nFees paid H. Easton,...... . 20.00\nSupporting, maintaining, clothing and educating said ward\nfor eight years, at $100 per annum, .... 800.00\n$823.50\nAll the funds are consumed and there is no further estate.\nT. M. M. (paid $1.00). Fees on account paid, . . 4.00\nThis account was in due' time confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court and a balance decreed in favor of the accountant of $107.50. Within a.year, and on January 3d 1868, Bratten died leaving a will, of which J. W. Douglas was subsequently appointed administrator de bonis non cum testamento annexo. On September 8th 1875, after citation by Mary Landis, who had then reached her majority and become Mary Perry, Douglas filed the following guardian\u2019s account of the estate of Mary Landis.\nJune 1st 1875, the administrator of said guardian claims the following credits:\u2014\n\u201c To balance found due the guardian on his account filed\nAugust 7th 1867,......$103.50\nInterest from August 7th 1867 to June 1st 1875, . 49.68\nTo supporting, maintaining, clothing and educating said ward, from August 7th 1867 to January 3d 1868, the day of James H. Bratten\u2019s death, at the rate of one hundred dollars per year, ..... 41.70\nInterest from January 3d 1868 to June 1st 1875, . 17.50\n$212.38\nAccountant\u2019s fees, ..... $20.00\nAdvertising and register\u2019s fees, . . 4.90\nClerk\u2019s fees,......'2.00\nThe accountant suggests that no estate of the ward ever came into the hands of the accountant.\u201d\nCounsel for Mrs. Perry filed six exceptions to this account and upon motion the court appointed an auditor \u201cto examine the exceptions filed to the said account and to state a full and completo account according to law of the management of the said ward\u2019s estate.\u2019'\u2019\nThe first exception was as to the omission of the items of the partial account from the final account, and the other five exceptions raised the question as to whether the minor was chargeable by Bratten, her guardian, for maintenance during her minority and while an inmate of his family.\nThe above facts appeared in evidence before the auditor.\nOn the first point the auditor reported that the account should be restated so as to include the earlier items. As to the payment made by the former guardian, Easton, to Bratten, for the minor\u2019s maintenance, as set forth above in Easton\u2019s account, the auditor was of opinion that in these proceedings and at so late a day, in the face of his confirmed account, they could not be disturbed. As to the credits of $800 and $41.70, the auditor reported that they should bo stricken out, on the ground that Bratten was legally bound to maintain his step-daughter, under the circumstances, and could not charge her in his account with her maintenance and support. After making some unimportant changes in the account, the auditor reported a restated account, as follows:\u2014\nThe accountant should be and is now charged as follows:\u2014\nMarch 13th 1860 \u2014 To cash received from H. Easton, guardian, . ........ $500.00\nInterest on same from March 13th 1860 to March 13th 1876,......... 480.00\n$980.00\nThe accountant is credited as follows:\u2014\nMarch 13th 1860, cash paid H. Easton, allow-\nance, ....... $20.00\nMarch 13th 1860, cash paid Gr. W. Toms, . 3.50\nAugust 7th 1867, cash paid T. M. Mahon, clerk\u2019s\nfees,.......1.00\nInterest on $23.50 to March 13th 1876, . 22.56\nInterest on $1 to March 13th 1876, . . .52\nAccountant\u2019s fees, ...... 20.00\nAdvertising and register\u2019s fees, . . . 4.90\nClerk\u2019s fees, ......2.00\nDouglas excepted to the auditor\u2019s report, (1) and (2), on the ground that the auditor had disallowed the credit claimed by the guardian for the minor\u2019s support; (3) that the auditor charged Bratten with $500 as principal, whereas Easton\u2019s confirmed account shows that Bratten received but $410, less certain costs; (4) and (5) that the auditor erred in opening Easton\u2019s account and Bratten\u2019s first account.\nThe court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report of the auditor.\nDouglas took this appeal and assigned for error that the court erred in not sustaining the exceptions of appellant and in confirming the auditor\u2019s report, and in not confirming the account of James H. Bratten, guardian of Mary Landis, now Mary Perry, as stated by J. W. Douglas, administrator of the estate of Jas. H. Bratten, deceased.\nJ. W. Douglas, p p. \u2014\nBratten always demanded, and in part received from Easton, compensation for the minor\u2019s support, and cannot therefore be presumed to have assumed the position of a parent to her.\nBratten\u2019s account was practically a final account, upon the confirmation of which the court would at his request have discharged him. After a lapse of eight years, when Bratten\u2019s estate is almost distributed, this court will not disturb it: McLellan\u2019s Appeal, 26 P. F. Smith 232; Rhoads\u2019s Appeal, 3 Wright 189.\nMcCauley <f- Orr and J. Kell, for Mary Landis (then Perry).\u2014\nBratten was bound to maintain his step-daughter and could not charge her for her support: Lantz v. Frey, 2 Harris 202; Ruckman\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F. Smith 253; Duffey v. Duffey, 8 Wright 402. His account was not a final account and did not conclude his ward: Bowman v. Herr, 1 Penna. R. 282 ; McCormick v. Joyce, 7 Barr 248; Yeager\u2019s Appeal, 10 Casey 173; Foltz\u2019s Appeal, 5 P. F. Smith 428. The representatives of Bratten improperly refused to account for the minor\u2019s estate and the costs should be put upon them."
