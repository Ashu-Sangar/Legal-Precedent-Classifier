Kille had no notice of the Ege heirs’ claim until April 24th 1874, and the action did not exist as to them until that date. In an action for mesne profits, the record of the judgment in ejectment is conclusive that defendants were in possession at time <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>ejectment was brought, and also as to the title during the time laid in the demise, but not evidence of the length of time defendants were in possession : Bailey <em>v. </em>Fairplay, <a href="/binn/6/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Binn. 450" data-case-ids="1795121" data-case-paths="/binn/6/0450-01">6 Binn. 450</a>. If plaintiffs ask for damages anterior to the service of the writ in ejectment they must show their title and the possession of defendants: Osbourn <em>v. </em>Osbourn, 11 S. &amp; R. 58; Huston <em>v. </em>Wickersham, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20313" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 313">2 W. &amp; S. 313</a>; Postens <em>v. </em>Postens, 3 Id. 183; Drexel <em>v. </em>Man, 2 Barr 271; Sopp <em>v. </em>Winpenny, 18 P. F. Smith 80. The action of ejectment is conclusive only from the time it is brought down to the execution of the habere, and the judgment therein is not evidence of any matter which came collaterally in question: Duchess of Kingston’s Case, 11 Harg. State Trials 261; Hibshman <em>v. </em>Dulleban, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20191" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts 191">4 Watts 191</a>; Lentz v.

F. Smith 165. The record of an action, founded on common law, consists of the writ, declaration, pleas and judgment: Erb <em>v. </em>Scott, 2 Harris 20. The record remitted from the Supreme Court simply shows the affirmance of the judgment in the court below. The bills of exception only become part of the record in the Supreme Court for purposes of review. Neither the opinion of the Supreme Court nor the assignments of error are returned as part of the record, and yet the court below say, from these plaintiffs have shown title anterior to the bringing of ejectment, and that these matters. should be taken notice of in this action. Seyfert, McManus &amp; Co. paid $2000 rent, but no ore was taken. out by them; clearly Kille will have to repay this rent and recovery of it by the plaintiffs will subject him to pay it twice. Its reception by Kille did not injure plaintiffs. What are permanent improvements is a question -of law for the court and not a question of fact for the jury, and the court should have said that the “ machinery, buildings and conveniences for mining ore” were fixtures, and instructed the jury to allow defendants a set-off for their value : Christian <em>v. </em>Dripps, 4 Casey 271; Harlan <em>v. </em>Harlan, 8 Harris 306 ; Roberts <em>v. </em>Dauphin Deposit Bank, 7 Id. 71; Ewalt <em>v. </em>Gray, <a href="/watts/6/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Watts 427" data-case-ids="1846157" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0427-01">6 Watts 427</a>; Morrison <em>v. </em>Robinson, 7 Casey 459 ; Walker <em>v. </em>Humbelt, 5 P. F. Smith 408. It should have been left to the jury to ascertain the quantity of land of the Cox tract embraced in the Seyfert, McManus &amp; Co. lease. Defendants should have been permitted to show by witnesses who were familiar with the land, the premises, their value and the improvements ; what was the value of the land when known to have ore on it, but not developed, and its value after the erection of improvements, to show plaintiffs had sustained no damage.</p>

F. Smith 416. The amendment would not have deprived defendants of any valuable right; they did not complain that it would work them any injury, and failing to do this or object to the amendment in the proper, action, it is too late im a collateral suit to remedy the omission, and deprive the other party of a right incident to and inseparable from his recovery: Hill <em>v. </em>Meyers, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%2021" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="10 Wright 21">10 Wright. 21</a>; Beatty’s Adm’rs <em>v. </em>Burne’s Adm'rs, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Cranch%20108" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Cranch 108">8 Cranch 108</a>. The action tried did exist from its date. The same defendants ■ upon whom the writ was served remained and knew as well of the action before Kille came upon the record as afterwards, and it was they,.not he, who improved after the writ of ejectment was served, and the additional plaintiffs were added with their knowledge and without objection. Plaintiffs do not contend that the record in the ejectment is conclusive of plaintiffs’ right to recover mesne profits or of their title for a longer period than from the date of the writ until the date of the habere facias, but they do hold that in an action for mesne profits, if the record and proceedings of the trial of the ejectment be offered in evidence,.and they conclusively show that the title of .the plaintiffs and defendants were distinctly put in issue and adjudicated, for. a period long anterior to the date of the writ, then the defendants are concluded from contesting that title, and the plaintiffs will be deemed .to have proved their title, for.the period determined by the ejectment, without other evidence.. The charge of the court below when reduced to writing and filed by request, and the notes of testimony so far as necessary to explain the charge, are parts of the record: Northumberland County Bank <em>v. </em>Eyer, 8 P.

The rent received by Kille from the Seyfert,-McManus &amp; Co. lease, was-money received as profits from plaintiffs’ lands, was not his, and was certainly as fair an estimate of what profits should be paid plaintiffs as could be found. Its payment should not be delayed to abide the result of another trial between other parties which may never be brought: Breading <em>v. </em>Blocher, 5 Casey 349; Ranck <em>v. </em>Becker, 13 S. &amp; R. 43. The improvements for which credit is allowed must'be permanent and beneficial : Jackson <em>v. </em>Loomis, 4 Cowan 168; and.their character as well • as value are questions of fact for the jury: Worthington <em>v. </em>Young, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Ohio%20403" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="8 Ohio 403">8 Ohio 403</a>. The evidence offered in the 13th assignment of error was simply an opinion, not a fact, and the value of an undeveloped ore bank that no human eye ever saw certainly cannot be proved as a fact from which a jury are to fix actual damages.</p>

None of the defendants in error were originally parties to the action of ejectment, the record of which they gave in evidence. They were substituted some two years after the writ issued. The original plaintiffs had no title and were nonsuited. The defendants in error did not derive title from them, but recovered on their own title solely. It was in nowise connected with the original plaintiffs. The so-called amendment was not the addition of names omitted through - mistake, nor of parties holding any joint interest with the original plaintiffs. There was no privity of title or interest between them. They were strangers to each other’s claim. The substitution was not authorized by the statute. That question, however, is not now before us on bill of exceptions. The substitution having been made, and the record being given in evidence in a subsequent suit, we may declare its effect.</p>

The action is equitable in its character: Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Eshbach, 3 Harris 417. Hence a boná, fide occupant under claim of title who has made permanent and valuable improvements, may show them to be a full compensation for the use of the premises: Morrison <em>v. </em>Robinson, <em>supra. </em>The fact that the plaintiffs in error had let the premises for a term of fifteen years at an annual rental of $2000, besides the payment of royalty on each ton of iron ore mined, and received the rent for one year, did not necessarily give the defendant in error the right to recover that sum. It appears that no ore was mined by the lessees during the time for which the plaintiffs in error are liable for mesne profits. By their eviction they became unable to fulfil their covenants in the lease. Their lessees acquired a right of action against them for damages which may equal or exceed the whole sum they have received. Then if the premises were in nowise injured by the lessees, and they took no ore therefrom, we cannot see that the $2000 received by the plaintiffs in error establishes a correct basis for fixing the just rental value of the premises.
