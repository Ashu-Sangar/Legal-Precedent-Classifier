The county of Westmoreland brought suit, on the 4th June 1857, against his administrator, to recover the costs on an indictment in the Oyer and Terminer for homicide, and on the 23d February 1859 judgment was obtained by the county for $625.55. On the 9th March 1865 a sci. fa. was issued on this judgment against Corrigan’s administrator, with notice to his heirs and devisees, but no proceedings had on the sci. fa. until the 10th February 1874, when there was a trial and verdict rendered in favor of the county, as against the administrator, but in favor of the devisee; no judgment was ever entered on this verdict.</p>

This case arises upon the distribution of the proceeds of this sale. The court below decreed the payment of the judgment of the county in full, and awarded the residue of the fund to A. J. Corrigan, devisee of the real estate sold under the will, and rejected the claim of one McDermott. The claim of McDermott was against A. J. Corrigan •as owner of the real estate, and by agreement of parties was to be paid only in case the judgment- of the court was adjudged not to be a lien upon the real estate.

It is also settled that it is immaterial how soon judgment is obtained in the first period of seven years; the lien runs to the termination of the period of twelve years without a further proceeding. In Duncan <em>v. </em>Clark, <em><a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20224" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Watts 224">supra </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20224" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Watts 224">225</a>, Justice Kennedy says: “ It is obvious that in the first case, when the judgment is obtained within the seven years, the five years ought not to commence before the expiration of the.latter period; for if it were to be held to commence-from the date of the judgment, it would be placing the vigilant creditor in a worse condition than the negligent one, and also be contrary to the express, as well as the plain, import and meaning of the Act of 1797, which terminates the lien only after a lapse of seven years from the death of the debtor.” So the lien of the debt may be continued after the period of twelve years, by proper revivals. This is decided in Payne <em>v. </em>Craft, <em>supra, </em>where the death took place in 1813 and the sale of the real estate in 1833, and the lien was held to be continued by entries on the docket by agreement that the judgment should be revived without a scire facias. The later cases run in the same line, only that in cases, where the death has taken place since the Act of 26th February 1834 went into effect, the first period is <em>five </em>instead of seven, and the entire period <em>ten </em>instead of twelve years, and the widow and heirs or devisees must be made parties. In this case the scire facias to revive the judgment of the county was issued against all the parties within the ten years, and the sale of the property took place within three years thereafter, and consequently within the duration of the lien.</p>
    <p id="b497-8" data-blocks='[["BL_497.10",497,[318,2144,987,132]]]'>The decree of distribution was correct and it is therefore affirmed with costs to be paid by the appellants and their appeals are dismissed.</p>
