The original and supplemental petitions filed were referred to an auditor who reported substantially these facts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b390-8" data-blocks='[["BL_390.8",390,[252,1179,1172,1244]]]'>The petitioner was the only child of Mary Agnew (formerly Graham); the latter died in 1843, and soon after her death the ' petitioner, then but a few weeks old, was taken to the home of her mother’s younger sister, Mrs. Carothers, wife of Dr. Carothers, and lived there until some time after she had attained her majority and until she was married; she was brought up by and treated by her aunt and her guardian in all respects as their own child. In 1846 James Graham, the grandfather of the petitioner, died intestate, seised of a farm in Allegheny county, in which Mary Agnew and Mrs. Carothers were each entitled to an eighth interest. Proceedings for the partition of this real estate were begun in 1849 (Dr. Carothers having in the meantime been appointed guardian of the petitioner), and the inquest made a return dividing the estate into four purparts, of which the lowest in value was appraised at $3538. Mary Agnew’s interest was valued at $2169. Dr. 'Carothers and his wife elected to take a purpart valued at $4500, and one was accordingly set apart to them, in October 1849, charged with the payment of $2169 owelty of partition to Mary Agnew as her entire share of the estate. Up to this time no money or property of the ward had come into the hands of her guardian. The purpart set apart to Mrs. Carothers turned out to be coal lands, and became very valuable. There was no evidence that the partition was not fairly conducted. The record of the proceedings in partition did not show in express terms that the guardian declined to take for his ward; it did however show notice to the parties interested to appear on a certain day and accept or refuse the real estate at the valuation; that the guardian was present on that day, that all the shares were allotted to other heirs, and that the petitioner’s share was ordered to be paid in money.</p>

The account of her guardian was filed in September 1866; in- it the accountant charged himself, among other things, with $2169 and simple interest thereon, and claimed credit for over $3000, paid for the minor’s support and education during' her entire minority. This account was fully explained to the minor before it was filed, so that she understood clearly that it' charged hpr for her support and education. There was some evidence that her relations to her aunt and guardian made it impolitic for her '[o object to the account as stated, but there was nothing to show that any improper influence was used in any way. The petitioner took a note for the balance due her, and signed a receipt therefor. Payments were made to her on this note at various times as late as 1870. Dr. Carothers died in April 1867. Mary Agnew was married some months later. At the filing of the first petition the purpart allotted to Mrs. Carothers was still in her possession.</p>

The owelty charged in the partition was never paid in money, but remained a charge upon Mrs. Carothers’s share until the settlement of the account, and was then included in the note given to the petitioner. From January 1st 1850 to January 1st 1857, the guardian received other money of the minor to the amount of $2746. In May 1856, Dr. Carothers, having then in hand $1750 of the trust money, invested $900 in hank stock in his own name, and in June 1857, having in hand $2746 of the trust funds, he invested $1000 in bank stocks in his own name. It appeared, however, that at this time he was the owner of valuable real estate, and was a physician in active practice, and further, that both he and his wife had money of their own sufficient in amount to make these investments. He did not appear ever to have invested any of the trust funds in his ward’s name. Beyond the above facts there was no evidence given to trace the minor’s money into these investments. The auditor was of opinion that there was no evidence to show that any of the minor’s money had been used in the purchase of the stocks claimed by the petitioners.</p>

It set forth the proceedings in partition; that the petitioner was entitled to choose or refuse a purpart before Mrs. Carothers, being the only child of an older sister; and that the guardian, in electing to take a purpart for his wife, had committed a fraud upon his ward, and prayed a review of the account on this ground. A supplemental petition, filed in 1868, set forth that Dr. Carothers had been legally disqualified to act for his ward in the proceedings in partition, and therefore she had not been in fact represented; further, that Dr. Carothers had elected to take a purpart for his wife, though the first choice was in his ward, without having first refused <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>a purpart for the latter of record, all of which was a fraud upon the ward, and prayed that the petitioner, not having been represented in the partition, should be allowed to come into court and make choice of or refuse the purpart taken by Mrs. Carothers at its valuation. Neither of these petitions prayed to surcharge the accountant on the ground that his choice of a purpart enured to his ward. A third petition, filed the same day, was based upon the charges for support and maintenance of the ward; and a fourth petition, filed April 1871, prayed a transfer of the above-mentioned stocks and an account of the dividends received from them.</p>

The appellant and the wife of Dr. Carothers were each entitled to one-eighth interest therein. It was divided into four purparts. The least valuable was valued at $3538. The appellant’s share was of the value of $2169 only. The guardian had no funds of the appellant with which he could pay owelty. If he had elected to take a purpart for her, he would have been obliged to advance, of his own money, a sum nearly equal to the whole value of the appellant’s share. This he was certainly not required to do. Had he done so, he would have incurred the risk of having the legality of his act questioned by his ward on her arriving at full age. He therefore took no purpart for the appellant. He did, however, in right of his ydfe elect to take a purpart valued at over $4500. This he.had a perfect right to do. The rights of his wife were not to suffer from the fact that her husband was guardian of the appellant. The wife was not thereby compelled to decline taking a purpart, nor was she obliged to take jointly with the appellant or any other heir. There is no averment that the partition was not honestly and fairly made, nor that any purpart-was appraised at less than its then market value. The partition was confirmed and the allotment made to Mrs. Carothers in October 1849. The court then ordered her and her husband to pay to his said ward the said sum of $2169, with interest from that date. He was charged Avith this sum in his final account, which was duly confirmed. A title thus acquired by Mrs. Carothers, in the absence of any fraud, cannot be divested or impaired by the discovery, several years afterwards, that the surface of the land was underlaid Avith coal.</p>

    <p id="b395-7" data-blocks='[["BL_395.7",395,[203,1463,1169,216]]]'>In the case we are now considering it is not claimed that any error of law appears on the face of the record, nor is it shown that new matter has arisen since the decree, or that all the proof now offered to invalidate the decree was not known and accessible to the appellant when it was made.</p>
    <p id="b395-8" data-blocks='[["BL_395.8",395,[248,1678,826,42]]]'>The answer to the petition, <em>inter alia, </em>avers:—</p>
    <p id="b395-9" data-blocks='[["BL_395.9",395,[201,1721,1170,129]]]'>1. That the accounts containing all these' credits were well known to said ward, having been .examined before and after she attained her majority, and she made no objection thereto.</p>
    <p id="b395-10" data-blocks='[["BL_395.10",395,[201,1849,1169,131]]]'>2. No objection was made to these credits in her first petition, nor has she specified in her supplemental petition her ignorance that the guardian claimed such credits.</p>
    <p id="b395-11" data-blocks='[["BL_395.11",395,[201,1979,1168,120]]]'>3. She does not.aver that they are not correct in amount, nor that they were not duly and properly expended in the. maintenance and education of said ward.</p>
    <p id="b395-12" data-blocks='[["BL_395.12",395,[198,2109,1169,337]],["BL_396.1",396,[250,414,1168,210]]]'>The master, to whom the case was referred to ascertain the facts and give his conclusions, reported, showing that when the guardian’s account was made, the appellant was more than twenty-three years of age; that, she was present when the .items were “ discussed and considered during several evenings; that she was aware of the fact that a charge for boarding and clothing would probably be made, and the only question, if made,, was as to how much the charge •would be.” She was advised that it was a final settlement between <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>herself and her guardian. When the account was fully prepared it was presented to her. He therefore found, “ that the facts relied upon by petitioner for a review of the account were fully known at the time of the filing of the account, and not within that class of eases allowing a review for new matter discovered after the decree.”</p>
    <p id="Au7f" data-blocks='[["BL_396.6",396,[246,624,1173,437]]]'>It will be observed that the effort is not to surcharge the guardian with money or property withheld or omitted from his final account, but to strike therefrom certain credits distinctly claimed, stated in the account, and confirmed by the court. The evidence was wholly insufficient for that purpose. All the facts on which the appellant relies to attack the decree were as well known to her when the account was filed, as when she petitioned for the review. She received payments to apply on the account after its confirmation, and made no application for a review until after the death of her guardian.</p>
    <p id="b396-6" data-blocks='[["BL_396.7",396,[243,1062,1172,560]]]'>3. The allegation that the guardian purchased stocks with his ward’s money is not sustained by the evidence. The master states the law correctly. ■ He says : “ If the proofs establish the fact that these stocks were purchased with the money of the ward she would certainly be entitled to make her election to take them in lieu of money,” but he adds, “ the evidence fails to show that any of her money was used for that purpose.” An examination of the testimony does not show his finding to be unwarranted. He therefore concluded, “that under the law such a case had-not been presented as entitles the party to a rehearing of the account.” Exceptions having been filed to the report, they were dismissed, and the report confirmed finally by the court. We see no sufficient cause for disturbing the decree.</p>
    <p id="b396-7" data-blocks='[["BL_396.8",396,[416,1623,997,86]]]'>Therefore, decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>
