At .common law there could be no apportionment of rent by time; but by statutes in England (11 Geo. 2, ch. 19, sec. 15, and 4 Wm. 4, ch. 22), and by similar statutory provisions or usage in this country, there is always an apportionment in such cases, the lessee being liable to the representatives of the deceased life tenant for the rent until he died and to the heir afterwards: 1 Parsons on Contracts 516; Ghreen <em>v. </em>Osborn, 17 S. &amp; R. 171; Ex parte Smyth, 1 Swanst. 337; Williams on Real Property 58; 2 Sharswood’s Blackstone 122; 3 Kent’s Com., 9th ed. 614; Blight <em>v. </em>Blight, 1 P. F. Smith 420. The 14th and 15th sections of 11 Geo. 2, ch. 19, are in force in Pennsylvania: Roberts’s Digest 237. Under the Act of February 24th 1834, executors or administrators of any tenant for life who shall die before or on a day on which any rent was reserved, &amp;c., may recover the whole or a proportion of the rent, “according to the time 'elapsed at the death of said tenant for life:” Smith <em>v. </em>Wistar, 5 Phila.

Mrs. Crissman was cultivating the land by paying Kyper with a portion of the crop instead of money, the almost universal method of cultivating farms in Pennsylvania. Kyper was a cropper, not a tenant. He had no interest in the.land, but received his "share of the crops as the price of his labor. The possession is still in the owner of the land, who- can alone maintain trespass: Fry <em>v. </em>Jones <em>et al., </em><a href="/citations/?q=2%20Rawle%2012" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Rawle 12">2 Rawle 12</a> ; Adams <em>v. </em>McKesson’s Executrix, 3 P. F. Smith 83. The crop having been sown or planted before the death of the widow, her share of it was emblements, whether it was to be delivered to her before the end of the year or not. Assuming that between the widow and the tenant her share may be called rent, between her and the remainderman it is emblements. No case can be cited where a rent payable in kind was apportioned between the remainderman and the representatives of the tenant for life.</p>

    <p id="b127-7" data-blocks='[["BL_127.11",127,[177,1268,1181,1124]]]'>The rent reserved, in the lease of Mrs: Crissman, to G. W. Kyper, was in kind; the grain and hay to be delivered at Altoona, after they were harvested and prepared for market. At that time, then, was the rent due, and not before: Lamberton v. Stouffer, 5 P. F. Smith 284. In the meantime, before the grain was harvested and ready for delivery, Mrs. Crissman, the life tenant, died. Under these circumstances, •were the rule of common law still in force, the rent would fall to the reversion: 2 Black. Com. 175-6. Indeed, the sub-tenant might have abandoned the premises and paid rent to no one. To remedy this evil, the statute of 11 Geo. 2, ch. 19, sec. 15, provided that the executor of the life tenant should be entitled to recover a rateable proportion of the rent accruing between the last day of payment and the death of the lessor: <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Rawle%2012" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Rawle 12">Id. 124</a>. So our Act of 1834, secs. 7 and 30, secures to the executor or administrator of the life tenant, an apportionment of rent accruing for the “last year or quarter of a year or other current period of payment.” The current period, in the case in hand, was the whole of the year for which the lease was drawn; the rent, <em>inter alia, </em>two-fifths of "the spring and one-third of the fall grain, to be delivered as in said lease stated. The combined value of these products would be the rent for the current period, and it ought to be apportioned according to the theory above stated. So, that part of said rent now in the hands of the administrator, and which is the subject-matter of the case stated, should be divided between the parties, in the same proportion that the time, from the beginning of the lease to the death of Mrs. Crissman, bears to the whole year.</p>
