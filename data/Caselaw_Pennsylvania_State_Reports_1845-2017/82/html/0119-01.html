The cases are there distinguished, and it is shown that in both of the latter the evidence was withdrawn from the jury immediately after it had been given. The manifest reasoning of the court was to hold that whenever the testimony received was of such a character as to inevitably tend to prejudice the minds of the jurors, the error was not cured by the court telling them, after the argument had closed, not to consider the testimony. In this case the evidence had undoubtedly produced an impression on the mind of the jury. It was calculated to impair the effect of his testimony in regard to other facts in the ease.
