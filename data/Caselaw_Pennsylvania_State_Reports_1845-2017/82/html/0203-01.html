The building of this fence is the cause of this action, the plaintiff contending that it obstructed his way to the river, the right to which was given to him by the grant in the deed of Adam Eckert to Conrad Bombaugh, which extended the lane down to the low-water mark of the river and of which the defendant had notice in the Potts deed in the line of his title.</p>

He further contended that, in any event, the south side of the lane must have been as far north as the Maclay line, and that Mr. Hammond in 1843 erected a tavern and attached a porch thereto, which occupied the space abovfe the Maclay line for over twenty feet, and that if the lane, therefore, was where plaintiff claimed, then defendant and those from whom he claimed had obstructed and had possession of said lane for the last thirty years, and plaintiff had lost his right of way by lapse of time.</p>

There is no doubt of the right of the plaintiff so far as regards the case thus far, nor is there any doubt that there was an open lane east, about twenty feet wide. At one time there was no fence on one side, but the right continued there in all persons who bought out-lots. The dispute arises after you cross the turnpike, and go down towards the river. From that down toward the river there was no fence on either side. Maclay’s land lay on one side of this lane, and Eckert’s on the other, and it was sold from time to time, with the line of Maclay as a boundary. So it came on down, but called for one hundred and five feet in width, to the Maclay line. The land was sold in 1791, and it clearly embraces all the land'between the great road and the river, and it calls for the Maclay line. [If a person had taken possession under that deed of the whole three acres and some perches, and had held it for more than twenty-one years, they would have a good title against Mr. Bombaugh, notwithstanding his was the oldest deed, because he did not take possession. He was only using it, perhaps, once a year for twenty years. Constant, uninterrupted possession Avould give a better title. It is not necessary to put a house all over the ground or fence it in.

If it had been a declaration on the part of Hammond ‘ I agree to give up this porch and take it aAvay whenever you come here and claim it or want it,’ then it would show that Hammond was claiming to put it there under Bombaugh, but Bombaugh’s declarations do not show that he should keep it there as long as he pleased; I do not think there is anything in that; the porch would hold the possession as well as the house.] Is it true then that the Maclay line ran along the porch ?

Both parties claim under title derived from Adam Eckert. The plaintiff under deed executed and recorded in October 1790. Eckert thereby sold and conveyed to Conrad Bombaugh, his heirs and assigns, a certain five-acre out-lot, known as lot No. 1 in a plan of lots laid out by Eckert, bounded by Eckert’s lane on the south. The deed further declared, “and the said Adam Eckert doth hereby further grant and confirm to the said Conrad Bombaugh, his heirs and assigns, the free, open, and unmolested use of the twenty-feet alley aforesaid, and extendeth the same by these presents, through his, the said Adam’s, other land, not laid out as aforesaid, down to the low-water mark of the said Susquehanna.” The title to the lot, and the use of the alley, became vested in the plaintiff.</p>

He also says when acquired by adverse possession for twenty years, it may, he should suppose, be lost by non-user for the same period. But “where it has been acquired by grant,” he proceeds to say, “ it will not be lost by non-user, in analogy to the Statute of Limitations, unless there were a denial of the title or other act on the adverse party to quicken the owner in the assertion of his right.” This latter view of the law is affirmed in Erb <em>v. </em>Brown, <em>supra. </em>So in Linderman <em>v. </em>Lindsey, <em>supra, </em>it was held that nothing less than an absolute denial of the right followed by an enjoyment inconsistent with its existence for twenty-one years, can amount to an extinguishment.</p>

So long as his free and unmolested use of it was not interfered with, the grantor and all others might use it without any denial of the plaintiff’s right. Whether the plaintiff used it in each year or after an interval of several years, his right continued unless it was denied and followed by an enjoyment inconsistent therewith. Nor would the mere fact that the defendant, and those whose title he had acquired, claimed the right of soil in the land covered by the lane, extinguish the plaintiff’s right of way. Such a claim was not inconsistent with the plaintiff’s easement or servitude, unless it was <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>followed by an adverse possession excluding the plaintiff therefrom. In so far as the house had been constructed and maintained, against the plaintiff’s consent, in the lane, it was a denial of his right, and he may have lost his privilege, by lapse of time, over the ground covered thereby. There is some evidence that the brick house extends further into the lane than the old log house did. This will be a question for the jury to determine. So in regard to what one witness calls the “rough porch” at the Hammond house. The plaintiff testified, “I gave permission to use it so long as I had room to go to the river.” The learned judge charged, although this permission was given to Hammond, yet it did not show the latter used it on that authority. The fact should have been submitted to the jury to find whether the porch was erected or maintained by permission of the plaintiff. If so, it cannot be said his exclusion from the ground covered thereby was in denial of his right; but it was a recognition and affirmance thereof. It was in no sense adverse.</p>
    <p id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.6",210,[313,1146,1165,421]]]'>As to the part of the lane not obstructed by house or porch, the nature of the acts done on the part of the defendant gives character to his adverse possession: Lodge <em>v. </em>Patterson, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%2077" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="3 Watts 77">3 Watts 77</a> ; Dikeman <em>v. </em>Parrish, 6 Barr 211. Therefore an entry by the defendant, or by one whose title he acquired, under a deed calling for boundaries that would embrace the lane or alley, and holding the same continuously for twenty-one years, would not of itself bar the plaintiff’s right of way. There must have-been superadded an absolute denial of his right united with an occupation inconsistent with its exercise.</p>
    <p id="b210-7" data-blocks='[["BL_210.7",210,[313,1576,1168,647]]]'>When one seeks to prove the abandonment of a servitude created by deed, he must do more than show it to have been rarely exercised by the grantee. In this case the plaintiff had no exclusive use of the alley. It was concurrent only. He therefore had no right to take such a possession as would have excluded any one who did not interfere with his free, open and unmolested use thereof. His reserved right to such use was spread on the record. The existence of the lane was in the defendant’s chain of title. The latter therefore had constructive notice of plaintiff’s claim. But the testimony of Jacob S. Schlayer goes further. He testifies that when the defendant was about buying the land, he assisted him in its measurement. That he “ argued the lane did not belong to the house.” That -the defendant answered substantially, it did not belong to the people of whom he had bought; but he would take it up and pay taxes on it.</p>
    <p id="b210-8" data-blocks='[["BL_210.8",210,[318,2221,1164,218]]]'>We think, therefore, the learned judge erred in the view he expressed, both in regard to the extent the plaintiff was obliged to use the grant to avoid a presumption of its abandonment, and also as to the effect of the defendant’s claiming the ground covered by his deed, and the assignments are substantially sustained.</p>
