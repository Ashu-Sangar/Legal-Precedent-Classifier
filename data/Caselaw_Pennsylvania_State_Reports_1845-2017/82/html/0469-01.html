Dig. 1464, which gives a preference to miners, mechanics, laborers, or clerks, for labor or services rendered, for any period not exceeding six months, immediately preceding the sale of the property of their debtor, and if they give notice in writing of their claims to the officers executing the writ before sale, making it the duty of these officers to pay them out of the proceeds of sale the amount they are entitled to receive, not exceeding $200.

It is <em>pari materia </em>with previous acts giving preference to laborers, and is intended to give immediate relief to persons of limited means, and not to one who gave no time or attention to the business and who made the contract for speculation merely.

The Mechanics’ Lien Law, the creature of our statutes, originally confined to one or two counties, has been made general and has always received a liberal construction. As Pennsylvania became a <em>mining </em>state, an act was passed (Act of 2d April 1849, Pamph. L. 387) protecting laborers in mines, and giving them a preference over other creditors. This act originally extended to only seven counties. In 1872 it was re-enacted, made general, and the amount of preference given to laborers, &amp;c., was extended from $50 to $200. This act, so far as it has come before this court, has received such a construction as to give effect to its humane provision : Reed’s Appeal, 6 Harris 235; Wade’s Appeal, 5 Casey 328; Pennsylvania Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Costello, 9 Id. 241. Seider’s Appeal, <em>supra, </em>upon which the auditor rested his decision, is relied upon by appellant to reverse him. In that case it was decided that contractors who employed eight or ten hands were entitled to the benefits of the act, and also for “horses, carts and drivers.”</p>

Snyder fulfilled the contract by hiring teams and drivers, but did no hauling himself. The saw-mill, fixtures and other personal property of Wolf having been levied on and sold by the sheriff under two judgments by the appellant, an auditor was appointed to distribute the proceeds. He reported that Snyder was entitled to priority to the extent of two hundred dollars, under the provisions of the Act of April 9th 1872, Pamph. L. 47. Exceptions filed by the appellant were overruled and the report confirmed by the court, and from this decree this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b471-6" data-blocks='[["BL_471.6",471,[202,932,1172,1464]],["BL_472.1",472,[278,419,1163,76]]]'>The only question presented is whether Frederick Snyder was a “miner, mechanic, laborer, or clerk.” These and these only are the classes of persons to whose claims priority is secured by the act. “ Miner, mechanic or clerk,” it is not pretended that he was. ■ Was he a laborer ? If he was a laborer it must be conceded that it does not matter in what manner his services were to be compensated,, whether by daily wages or by the quantity of lumber delivered. The act does not say wages, but “ all moneys that may be due or hereafter become due for labor and services.” What class of persons was intended tobe comprehended by the word “laborer?” We think this question has been very accurately answered by this court in Daniel Seider’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%2057" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Wright 57">10 Wright 57</a>. “ By laborers,” says Mr. Justice Woodward, in delivering the opinion of the court, “ we mean those who perform with their own hands the contract they make with the employer.” It is clear that Frederick Snyder does not fall within this description. The act meant to favor those who earned their money by the sweat of their own brows, not those who were mere contractors to have the work done, and whose compensation was the profit they would realize on the transaction. Had Snyder been a chief workman, and employed helpers or assistants, the case might have presented a different question, which it is not necessary here to determine; for it would seem that such helpers would be entitled to priority, and it is very clear that the act did not intend to give a double lien. In such case, if he had paid the assistants, he might be entitled to stand in their shoes- by substitution, and recover the balance as compensation agreed upon for his own services. A somewhat analogous question arose under the Mechanics’ Lien Lavra, and it was decided by this court, in Jones <em>v. </em>Shawhan, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 257" data-case-ids="1856271" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0257-01">4 W. &amp; S. 257</a>, that one who furnishes nothing but his superintendence and skill as an' undertaker had no right to file a lien for anything in pursuance of his contract as such. . “ It is he,” said Chief Justice Hibson, “ who has found the labor or material, and not-he who has ordered them, that is entitled to the lien. Were the contractor, as well as the mechanic or material-men, allowed to <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>file, there might be double liens and possibly double recoveries, which the law does not tolerate.”</p>
