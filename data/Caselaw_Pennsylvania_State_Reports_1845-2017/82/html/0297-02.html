      <em>“ </em>The first and second sections of the Act of 30th of January 1874, directs the mode of completing the list of taxables, and describes the duties of the assessors and county commissioners in connection therewith. The third section of the same act requires the county commissioners to make a full and correct copy of the resident taxables in each election district, and to furnish the same, together with the necessary election blanks, to the officers of the election in such election district, on or before seven o’clock of the morning of the election. * * * *</p>

      <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>“An election is the embodiment of the popular will, the expression-of the sovereign power of the people. When the application of technical rules and a strict construction of the acts of the officers, in preparing the election papers and conducting an election, would tend to defeat the will of the people and change the result of an election for an important office, they should not be applied, and all reasonable intendments should be made in favor of the legality of their proceedings. When, however, it is alleged that there is actual fraud in the election, or that the ballot-box has been tampered with, or illegal votes received, or the careless or fraudulent acts of the officers have mixed and confused the ballots, the duty of the court is equally plain, and every legal facility should be afforded to purge the poll; and when the acts of the officers are so frandulent and irregular that the <em>result cannot be ascertained, </em>then the entire poll is rejected. These are substantially the conclusions of the judges in the-contested election cases in Philadelphia in 1845, 1850 and 1858, reported in 2 Pars, and 1 and 2 Brewst.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b299-6" data-blocks='[["BL_299.6",299,[247,1159,1168,948]]]'>“The State Constitution, art. 8, sect. 1, gives to every citizen possessing the qualifications prescribed, the right to vote, and section 7 of the same article provides that no elector shall be deprived of the privilege of voting by reason of his name not being registered. To disfranchise all the voters of a township, as we are asked to do in this petition, the facts on which we are required to act should show a case free from legal doubt. If we, by our decision, should permit the carelessness or even the fraud of officers whose duty it is to furnish a list of voters at the election, to defeat the election and deprive the people of the oounty of the officer who was elected by a majority of their votes, we would thus make the people suffer for an act in which they did not participate, and which they did not sanction. In so doing, instead of punishing an officer for the violation of the election law, we practically punish the voters of the county by defeating their choice of a county officer as declared at the election. A decision of this kind would be fraught with danger, by inviting unscrupulous or unprincipled persons, on the eve of an important election, to secrete or destroy the list of voters or other important papers in a township in which the majority may determine the result in the county. Buies applicable to contested elections, like other legal rules, must be uniform, and the results and consequences of decisions therefore determine their correctness.</p>

In Melvin’s Case, 18 P. F. Smith 383, Thompson, C. J., referring to the powers and duties of the court to strike out the vote of an election district, says: “ This ought not to be done when a legal election as to <em>time </em>and <em>flace </em>is held, although fraudulent votes have been received. The remedy in such case is to purge the polls by striking out the fraudulent votes if possible. In 1 Brewst. 176, it appeared from the evidence, that in <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>one case the minority inspector was overawed, and the list of assessed voters taken from him, and the requirements of .the law in receiving the ballots were to a great extent disregarded. There was nothing to show that the voters not on the list were qualified according to law, and a large number of such votes Avere received. Still the entire poll was not rejected, and each contestant was allowed to prove his legal vote, to be counted for and credited to him, in the final computation.</p>

In Melvin’s Case, 18 P. F. Smith 333, it was held that a Avhole election district may be stricken out on showing an entire disregard of conformity to law in holding it either by design or ignorance. It is begging the question to presume that the commissioners or the officers of election did their duty; their failure to do it is the gist of this complaint.
