Beyond this harsh or sharp conditions should not be favored. ‘ Sometimes policies are seen,’ in the language of the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court in West Branch Ins.

Such one-sided policies are not to be commended. They may be used as a snare for the unwary, and are not calculated to accomplish any practical good. Fortunately, they are of very rare occurrence. The policy before us is not one of this class; but to give it the construction contended for would be a decided step in that direction, and in our judgment would work great injustice.</p>

The building was occupied by the insured and her family all the time, without any interference with her possession by the sheriff or any one else.

Why then should the company, with the plaintiff’s money in their treasury, be absolved from their obligation to make good <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>tbe loss ?

If the condition is construed as having in view a loss attended with an actual seizure and interference with the possession of the insured, whereby the risk might be increased, we can at once recognise ‘its wisdom and propriety ; and doubtless it was this that was intended, and nothing more.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b403-7" data-blocks='[["BL_403.7",403,[202,888,1164,466]]]'>“ The condition in question has <em>special </em>if not <em>exclusive </em>reference to personal property, which when levied on is usually seized <em>in fact </em>and remains in the custody and possession of the sheriff' until it is sold. This works an involuntary change of possession — takes the property out of the owner’s control and leaves it in charge of the sheriff and his employees, who cannot be expected to guard it with the same degree of care that the owner would. Hence a levy and <em>actual </em>seizure necessarily increases the risk, and it is this that the condition is designed to guard against; but it has no applicability in the case of a <em>technical </em>seizure, unattended by change of possession or increased risk.</p>

In that case, after the policy was issued and before the fire occurred, an execution was placed in the hands of the sheriff, and a levy was made on the goods of the insured, but they were not taken into the custody of the officers, or left in charge of a watchman, nor was the actual possession of the insured disturbed. While this condition of affairs existed the goods were destroyed by fire, and the insurance company defended against payment of the loss on the ground that the insurance ceased when the levy was made.
