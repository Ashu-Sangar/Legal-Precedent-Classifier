Morris, filed a bill in equity against Alexander Ervin, the Seventh National Bank and the Second National Bank of Philadelphia, which set forth, that on the 29th of April 1875, Henry G. Morris, being largely engaged in the iron business at Southwark Foundry, in Philadelphia, finding he was insolvent, executed a general assignment for -the benefit of his creditors; that Morris commenced business at said foundry in January 1871, and employed Alexander Ervin at a salary of $6000 per annum, as his confidential agent and financial manager; that he had the fullest faith in the business ability and integrity, of Ervin, and trusted him unreservedly with the control and management of the finances of his business and the receipts of moneys; that the private ledger of Morris was kept by Ervin, and the other books by Ervin’s nephew, under his charge; that so great was the confidence of Morris in Ervin that he never personally examined the books as kept by Ervin, nor investigated the condition of the business, but received a statement, from time to time, on balance sheets prepared by Ervin; that, in April 1875, he became insolvent, and an examination of his books showed that in four years and four months he had lost $1,200,000 in the foundry business; that this investigation of the books showed they <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>had been kept in a grossly irregular manner, and disclosed the fact' that Ervin, while acting as financial manager for Morris, had received large sums of money for which he failed to account; that from the account in the private ledger, as kept by Ervin himself, it-- appeared he had fraudulently, at divers times, drawn out of the cash assets of Morris various sums of money, aggregating up to 30th of July 1873 the sum of $80,000; that finding himself so indebted, Ervin, without the knowledge or consent of Morris, fraudulently credited himself, on July 31st 1873, as follows: “July 31st, special pig iron- account. On account of interest to cover notes issued to his order, $100,000;” that said credit was purely fictitious and without consideration or authority from Morris, and was made to conceal large sums due by Ervin to Morris, and which, being illegal and unauthorized, should be disallowed; and that after disallowing this credit the account as kept by Ervin showed that the latter was indebted to Morris $79,740.27; that in the course of business Morris was accustomed to make numerous notes for large sums, and at times drew them to Ervin’s order to have the same discounted; that the books showed that $62,840 of these notes were intrusted to Ervin to negotiate, and that the same were paid by Morris at maturity, although the books failed to show that they were issued, and that Ervin has appropriated the proceeds thereof to his own use and never accounted for the same; that the books of the foundry show that Ervin is indebted to Morris on his private ledger account in the sum of $79,740.27, which, added to the proceeds of the above notes, make an aggregate indebtedness of $142,220.27.</p>

It is submitted, that this is without warrant in law or equity. The inducement recited in the decree, even if admitted, does not justify the injunction. The gist of it is, that it appears to the court, that moneys, the property of Henry G. Morris, have come to the hands of Ervin, as the agent of Morris, and are retained by him to the prejudice of the plaintiff, assignee of said Morris. Therefore it is that the court restrains Ervin from transferring or disposing of any real estate, no matter when or how he acquired it, or stocks, bonds or other securities of which he may be possessed, even though he purchased or inherited them years before he ever heard of Henry G. Morris. The injunction affidavits do not designate a single piece of real estate, or any stocks, bonds or other securities in which it is supposed that money belonging to Morris was invested, unless it be in the vague reference to stock of the Seventh National Bank.</p>

The question then simply is whether the defendant, having secured the money of the complainant and refused to discover to the court the form in which it has been invested by him, should thus be able to defeat the complainant’s claim, or whether he should not be restrained from disposing of any and all property until he has made discovery as to which is the complainant’s and which is his own. The rule applicable to this case, both in law and equity, has been well settled for over a hundred and fifty years, and has remained unshaken in this country and in England. It has always been held, that if any one having charge of the property of another willfuly intermixes it with his own, or wilfully conceals which is the property of the other and which is his own, that in such cases he, through whose wrong the confusion occurred, must show affirmatively which is his own and which is the property of the innocent party; or failing so to do, all shall be taken as the property of the innocent party.
