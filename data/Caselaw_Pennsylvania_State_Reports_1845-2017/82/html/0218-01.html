In Damon <em>v. </em>Bache, the judgment in ejectment confessed by vendee in favor of vendor was conditional and gave time to the vendee to pay purchase-money. In this case the confession of judgment was unconditional and absolute and possession given immediately to vendor. The judgment creditors here had no opportunity through diligence to protect their claims. The existence of fraud need not be proved positively, but may be inferred from facts calculated to establish it: Kaine <em>v. </em>Weigley, 10 Harris 179; Rogers <em>v. </em>Hall, <a href="/watts/4/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts 359" data-case-ids="1842707" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0359-01">4 Watts 359</a>.

But Merrifield holding the legal title under articles could not be damnified by the vigilant creditors of McNamara: Covanhovan <em>v. </em>Hart, 9 Harris 501. It was not necessary for plaintiff to tender purchase-money before suit brought because the transfer of the possession of McNamara to Merrifield was a fraud upon the former’s creditors : Bassler <em>v. </em>Niesly, 2 S. &amp; R. 352; D’Arras <em>v. </em>Keyser, 2 Casey 249; Harris <em>v. </em>Bell, 10 S. &amp; R. 39.

The main facts found by the referee are substantially these: Merrifield sold the lands in question by two written contracts to McNamara. The first contract was executed in May 1869 in consideration of $350, to be paid for the land therein described; $44 thereof to be paid down and the residue in five equal annual payments with interest. The other contract was for a lot, adjoining the former, and was executed in June 1869. It stipulated for the payment of $300, of which $50 was to be paid down, and the residue in five equal annual payments with interest.

He continued in possession until 16th December 1871. At this time the amount unpaid on both contracts was about $693. In January 1871 the creditors of McNamara began to enter judgments against him. They became liens on his equitable interest in the lands. Before the 1st of October following these liens exceeded <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>$3000. In May 1871, a fi. fa. was issued on one of these judgment liens and the land was levied on. An inquest was held and the land condemned. In November 1871, a vend. exp. was issued, and the land duly advertised to be sold on the 16th December following. All these facts were known to Merrifield. Yet with a full knowledge thereof, on the 15th December, being one day preceding the intended sheriff’s sale, he and McNamara entered into a written agreement by which an action of ejectment for the lands was commenced, judgment confessed in favor of Merrifield with leave to issue a writ of habere facias, and the writ was issued on the same day. On the next day, the writ was executed by giving possession to Merrifield. By deed dated the same day and acknowledged two days thereafter, Merrifield, for the consideration of $699 therein recited, conveyed the lands to the defendant in error.</p>

Thereupon the writ of vend. exp. was stayed by the plaintiff in the execution. An alias vend. exp. was subsequently issued on which the land was duly sold on the 10th February 1872 to the plaintiff in error. A deed therefor was duly executed, acknowledged and delivered to him.</p>
    <p id="b223-7" data-blocks='[["BL_223.7",223,[187,1358,1190,393]]]'>The purchase by the defendant from Merrifield was not on a good and valuable consideration. The defendant did not know either Merrifield, McNamara, nor the land. He never paid anything for the land and knew nothing about it. • C. Smith, Esq., paid the money to Merrifield. Smith called on the defendant and requested “the use of his name to hold in trust for some one.” The name of that “ some one” does not appear to have been proved. The referee therefore found that the defendant “holds the title as a <em>■naked trustee </em>for a <em>nameless cestui que trust.”</em>

    <p id="b224-10" data-blocks='[["BL_224.10",224,[272,1567,1172,304]]]'>The agreement between the owners of the legal and the equitable title, by which the latter was given up, is designated by the referee as “ very sharp practice, indeed.” It was, in fact, not only a change of the contract, so as to make instalments, payable in the future, due at once ; but also to yield up, for no consideration, an estate of large value, an estate then in the grasp of McNamara’s creditors, and the proceeds of which they were entitled to receive.</p>
    <p id="b224-11" data-blocks='[["BL_224.11",224,[272,1870,1174,474]]]'>This case must not be confounded with that class of cases in which it has been held that one creditor may be preferred by a confession of judgment; although it be done with the design and effect of removing the property from the reach of another creditor, equally meritorious. In those cases the injury to one is an incident necessarily flowing from the legal protection of the other, who could not otherwise be protected. It is where the estate is insufficient to protect both creditors. In this case Merrifield needed no additional protection. He was already fully secured. A sale of the equitable estate in no wise affected his legal title: Canon <em>v. </em>Campbell, 10 Casey 309; nor his remedy to enforce payment by ejectment.</p>

Immediately thereafter, the land was professedly sold for about the amount due for the legal title, being one-fourth its just value, and a conveyance thereof made to a trustee for some unknown person. Who was to permanently enjoy the benefits of the value of the estate, thus wrested from McNamara’s creditors, the evidence fails to disclose. If Merrifield received no more than the consideration recited in his deed to the defendant in error, they were not enjoyed by him, but by some “ unknown person.”</p>
    <p id="b225-6" data-blocks='[["BL_225.6",225,[171,838,1174,515]]]'>All the facts proved, naturally lead the mind to the conclusion that the primary object of the arrangement was to remove the estate of McNamara out of the reach of' his lien creditors. If the conclusiveness claimed for that judgment by the defendant in error be given to it, such will be its undoubted effect. As every sane person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequence of his own deliberate act, it follows that the facts found prove such to have been the intent. They prove a constructive fraud on the lien creditors of McNamara. In its effect this is tantamount to actual fraud, and the policy of the law makes the act illegal: McKibbin <em>v. </em>Martin, 14 P. F. Smith 352. Legal fraud, where the facts are ascertained, is for the court: Dornick <em>v. </em>Keichenback, 10 S. &amp; R. 90.</p>
