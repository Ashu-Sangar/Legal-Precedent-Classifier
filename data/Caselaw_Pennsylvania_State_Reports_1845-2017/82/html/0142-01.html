S. executed a mortgage to a building association to secure a bond for $600, conditioned for the payment of interest on a loan, and of monthly dues upon shares of stock in the association. In a scire facias on the mortgage the only averment of a breach of the condition of the bond was that <em>“ </em>the sum of $600 with the interest thereof as yet remains unpaid.” <em>Held </em>(reversing the judgment of the court below), that this averment was insufficient to ground a judgment for want of an affidavit of defence upon.</p>

After appearance by the defendants, judgment was entered for want of an affidavit of defence, and damages were assessed at $600. The condition of the bond and the averment of a breach thereof in the scire facias appear in the opinion of the court. The defendants took this writ of error, on the ground that the court erred in entering judgment for want of an affidavit of defence, and in entering judgment for the amount therein set forth.</p>

It is inapplicable to the case of a special condition such as that contained in the bond as recited in this scire facias, and it is insufficient to ground a judgment for want of an affidavit of defence upon. The scire facias takes the place of a declaration, and it should show on its face an immediate cause of action. It does not allege a failure to pay any instalment, and it cannot be inferred that there has been a failure to pay such instalments for six consecutive months. How then does it appear that the principal sum has become immediately recoverable by action ? This it was incumbent on the plaintiffs below to aver and set forth in the scire facias with reasonable certainty. This the averment contained in this scire facias does not do, and the judgment below was therefore erroneous.</p>
