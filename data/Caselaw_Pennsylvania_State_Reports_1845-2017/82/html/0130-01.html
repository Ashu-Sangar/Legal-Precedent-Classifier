    <p class="summary" id="b131-6" data-blocks='[["BL_131.6",131,[192,509,1173,777]]]'>This action was begun as an action of dower at common law, by “Elizabeth Ramey, widow of Jacob Ramey, deceased, now intermarried with Joseph S. P. Harris,” against George M. Tatham; the <em>narr. </em>contained counts for dower in five messuages. The writ was served on the tenants of the defendant, who occupied a certain tract of land of which Jacob Ramey had died seised, of an undivided two-sevenths of which the defendant had become the owner <em>after </em>Ramey’s death. After an appearance was entered for the defendant, the plaintiff obtained leave to amend the declaration, and sometime afterwards filed a declaration in debt, and procured a plea to be entered by the prothonotary for the defendant, under the rules of court, of “never indebted;” whereupon the defendant’s counsel moved the court to strike off the plea and permit him to withdraw his appearance, on the ground that the appearance for the defendant, who resided in Philadelphia, had been obtained by a service in a local action on his tenant. The plea was stricken off, but the withdrawal of the appearance was refused. The defendant then demurred to the declaration, and' assigned the following grounds of demurrer:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b131-7" data-blocks='[["BL_131.7",131,[236,1286,1048,40]]]'>1. “ The declaration is in debt, while the action is in dower.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b131-12" data-blocks='[["BL_131.12",131,[182,1973,1172,467]]]'>It appeared from the evidence that Jacob Ramey died, intestate, in 1855, seised of a tract of land in Elair county, leaving a widow, the plaintiff, and nine children, two of whom died soon afterwards, intestate and without issue. In 1864, two of Ramey’s children, Anna and Susan, the latter then the wife of William M. Eicholtz, conveyed their undivided two-sevenths of this tract to Tatham, the defendant, for $4539.75, “subject, however, to the dower of Mrs. Elizabeth Ramey, widow of Jacob Ramey, deceased.” Tatham paid two-thirds of the purchase-money, and retained one-third of it on account of the widow’s dower, which remained in his hands at the time of the trial.</p>

There was also some evidence to show that Mrs. Ramey, up to the time of bringing the suit, had demanded, hut never received, from Tatham, interest on this amount. The defendant denied that there had been any contract between himself and the plaintiff by which he was to pay Mrs. Ramey interest on the part of the purchase-money retained by him, but testified that the understanding between them had been, that Mrs. Ramey was to be paid out of the rent of the farm, and that he had always been willing to pay her her share, and had so instructed his agents. It appeared that the agreement for the sale of the two-sevenths of the farm had been in writing, but neither party produced a copy of the writing at the trial.</p>

The rule is, that so long as the substantive cause of action remains the same, the mode of stating it may be varied by amendment: Cassell <em>v. </em>Cooke, 8 S. &amp; R. 268 ; Newlin <em>v. </em>Palmer, 11 Id. 98; Root <em>v. </em>O’Neil, 12 Harris 326; Smith <em>v. </em>Bellows, 27 P. F. Smith 441. In dower the thing claimed is land, with damages for its detention; in debt the claim is for a fixed sum of money. The one action is local, the other transitory. If this change be allowed, then ejectment can be changed to case for slander, and a citizen of Philadelphia, who appears to a writ of <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>ejectment served on Ms tenants at Erie, must stay in court to answer any claim the plaintiffs may choose to set up against him. The right which every man has of being impleaded in the courts of his own district has always been greatly valued, and it is not to be supposed that the legislature would do such violence to the spirit of the people without a very clear expression of that intent.</p>

L. 265, permitting an amendment or change in the form of an action, to authorize an entirely new and different cause of action to be substituted. The words of the act, “ If the same shall be necessary for a proper decision of the cause upon its merits,” plainly evince this, and it is the principle which runs through all our acts for amendment and the decisions wMch have been had upon them. The courts have construed these acts with the greatest liberality, but never to the extent of allowing a different cause of action to be introduced. It would lead to very great injustice to defendants if this could be done, of which the case presented on this record is an illustration. The plaintiff below <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>sued out a writ of dower against the defendant. It was served on the tenants of the land, and the landlord or owner in fee simple, residing in a distant county, appeared by „his attorney. It was proper that he should do so, if he had any defence against the claim of the demandant. Dower is a real and local action, and cannot be brought except in the county where the land lies : Act of 13th June 1836, Pamph. L. 587. The demandant was allowed to change the form of action from dower to debt, which is a personal and transitory action, and to file an amended declaration grounded upon a contract of the defendant to pay the plaintiff a sum of money as interest. Yet the attorney for the defendant— who had never been served and was not within the jurisdiction of the court — was not allowed to withdraw the appearance which he had entered to the writ of dower. Thus, upon the same principle as that adopted and carried out by the learned judge below, a man, by commencing an action of ejectment, and by a service on the tenant securing the appearance of the landlord, may then change the form to assumpsit, and recover upon any contract relating to the same land; for it can hardly be pretended that he could introduce a cause of action not connected in some way with the same subject-matter. If one sues to recover the possession of land, that is a different cause of action from a claim for rent on a lease. The demandant had no right to maintain her action of dower, on her own showing, for the court had no jurisdiction.of it. As her husband had died seised and intestate, her remedy was in the Orphans’ Court; or if the defendant had become personally bound to pay her interest upon her thirds as valued by agreement, she must pursue him by personal action, in the proper forum, for the arrears.</p>
