At the trial before Henderson, J., it appeared that on the morning of June 6th 1874, a passenger train on the defendant’s road, passing through a sparsely settled district within the city limits of Harrisburg, ran over and killed the plaintiff’s son while .walking uppn the defendant’s track; further, that as soon as the engineer observed the boy upon the track every possible effort was made to stop the train. It was admitted that the train hands were competent men, and that the track and train and everything about them were in perfect order. The only negligence attributed to the defendant was that the speed of the train was excessive, and in contravention of the city ordinance regulating the speed of trains. It did not appear that the boy had any right to be upon the track. He was apparently prevented from hearing the train that struck him by the noise made by another train; passing in the opposite direction upon another track. As a complete defence to the action the defendant offered in evidence the following paper:—</p>

To this offer the defendant objected: 1. Because the receipt was in writing and under seal, and could not be contradicted by the plaintiff. 2.

It is valid in law and a complete har, and full defence to the plaintiff’s right to recover in this case, unless you are satisfied from the evidence that he was induced to sign it by false statements or fraudulent representations, that being ignorant, he was deceived as to the contents of the paper, that it was not read to him and its import and effect misrepresented to him, so that the execution of the release was a fraud upon him. Whilst the credibility of the witnesses and <em>phe </em>weight of the evidence is for you, we do not hesitate to say that we fail to see any sufficient evidence to justify the jury in a conclusion of fraud to set aside the written evidence, the release in this case. You have on the one hand attacking the release — the plaintiff, the party in interest, he stands alone and seeks to set aside his solemn deed. He says it was only intended by him as a receipt, but you will observe he signed twice, he says he can neither read nor write, but you will have the paper out with you, and may examine his signature, what he admits he wrote. He says the paper was not read to him, but Williams, the witness to the execution, says he read over and explained it to him, and that it was executed in pursuance of an understanding or agreement that he was to execute it, if the defendant would pay the funeral expenses. If there is any truth at all in the testimony of Williams, a witness, it is true, in the employ of the defendants, but he is in no way interested directly in the result of this suit, it overcomes, certainly meets squarely the testimony of the plaintiff. It explains, and when we consider that the defendant claimed immunity from any damage, it explains the small amount in the release, simply the funeral expenses, which were all that they would consent to pay. But even if we set off oath against oath, we must then let the paper speak for itself, and so speaking does it not deny the right of the plaintiff to recover in this action.”</p>

Its execution was not denied. It was submitted to the jury to find whether it was obtained by fraud. There was no evidence given upon the trial, as far as appears upon this record, to justify such a submission. The learned judge himself said in his charge: “ Whilst the credibility of the witnesses and weight of evidence is for you, we do not hesitate to say that we fail to see any sufficient evidence to justify the jury in a conclusion of fraud to set aside the written evidence, the release in this case.” Why then should it have been submitted?

All he said was: “I went to see him (Williams) — paper lying before him; he told me here is receipt of funeral. I signed and he paid me. I can’t road or write. (Release shown witness.) This is my name. I may have signed it twice. The paper was not read to <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>me.” He does not pretend that he told Williams that he could not read and asked to have it read or explained. There was nothing ■untrue in what he says Williams told him. Below the release was a receipt for the funeral, which he also signed. As he wrote his name, Williams had a right to presume that he could read, and had read it. He was not required to read or explain it to him, unless requested. As is said by Chief Justice Gibson, in Greenfield’s Estate, 2 Harris 496, “If a party, who can read, will not read a deed put before him for execution; or if, being unable to read, will not demand to have it read or explained to him, he is guilty of supine negligence, which, I take it, is not the subject of protection, either in equity or at law.” Shay, did not even deny that he knew what he was signing; that it was a release of all his claim upon the company in consideration of a sum of money sufficient to pay the funeral expenses. It has been more than once held that it is error to submit a question of fraud to the jury upon slight parol evidence to overturn a written instrument. The evidence of fraud must be clear, precise and indubitable; otherwise it should be withdrawn from the jury: Stine <em>v. </em>Sherk, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 195" data-case-ids="1852563" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0195-01">1 W. &amp; S. 195</a>; Irwin <em>v. </em>Shoemaker, 8 Id. 75; Dean <em>v. </em>Fuller, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20474" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="4 Wright 474">4 Wright 474</a>. Since parties are allowed to testify on their own behalf, it has become still more necessary that this important rule should be strictly adhered to and enforced. Judgment reversed.</p>
