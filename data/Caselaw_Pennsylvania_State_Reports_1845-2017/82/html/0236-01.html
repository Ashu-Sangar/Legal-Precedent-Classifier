Where a commissioners’ deed dated June 5th 1827 made in pursuance of a sale of land for taxes, recited the performance of the directions of the Act of 29th of March 1824, and the sale had never been impeached by the county, and the purchaser had paid taxes upon the tract for forty years after the sale, but had not taken actual possession, it was for the jury to determine whether the requirements of the Act had been complied with. A party claiming under a commissioners’ deed is not required to prove the pre-requisites of the sale positively under all circumstances. Natural presumptions arising from already proved facts which lead to a belief that the directions of the law-have been fulfilled, must be submitted to a jury in this as in other cases.</p>

Mr. Deringer, it would seem, had written a letter to Zurah Smith, in which there was some claim about something which had been paid by the former before that date. Zurah Smith replies under date of February 4th 1829. What does his letter relate to ? Does it relate to the taxes of 1827 or some other ?

In determining that point, you may take into consideration the manner in which the lands were subsequently treated by the proper officers of the county. Upwards of forty-nine years have elapsed since that sale took place. Perhaps it would be too much to expect noAV explicit proof of the publication specified in the statute. The hand that printed the newspapers in the county at that day, as well as the hand that posted the notices spoken of <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>in the statute, are both now probably cold in death. The tongue that could have spoken to us advisedly in relation to these matters .has been, perhaps, hushed for ever. It is your duty, however, to ascertain from the best evidence before you, whether/ or not the requirements of the statute referred to were complied with. In ' doing this, you may consider the showing as exhibited by the books in evidence, as well those belonging to the treasurer’s office as those kept from year to year under the direction of the commissioners.</p>

It has been shown, too, that taxes were assessed upon the land regularly from the year 1826 even down to 1868, not as though it belonged to the county, but as though it belonged to other parties. If, from a consideration of all these matters, together with the great lapse of time, you are satisfied that the commissioners complied with the requirements of the statute, then we say to you that their sale of the Samuel Pope tract, on the 8th of July 1826, and their subsequent deed of the 9th of June 1827 to Henry Deringer, vested in him the title. Up to this point there is no serious divergence between the views of the counsel on the one . side and the other. Indeed, it is conceded that if the commissioners did their duty in observing the requirements of the Act of 1824, then there was a good title to the Samuel Pope tract vested in Henry Deringer by the sale and the deed referred to.]</p>

This book has been put in evidence, but, notwithstanding the common practice referred to, it does not show that ■ any sale of the Samuel Rope tract took place in 1828. On the other hand, the treasurer’s deed, duly executed and acknowledged, ■ recites the fact of a sale having been made on the 25th November 1828. Again, the book has been put in evidence for the purpose of showing the general disposition which the treasurer made of this and other tracts at the time of his sales in 1828. The argument of the counsel for the plaintiffs is, that if the Samuel Rope tract had been sold, an entry to that effect would have been made by Zurah Smith, the treasurer, upon this book. The entry does not appear there, and they adduce the 'omission as one of the circumstances to corroborate their theory that no' sale of the tract was made at that time.</p>

They have produced a deed which recites a sale, and which, unless you are satisfied that the tax was paid before that sale, would be good, and would divest the title of Henry Deringer, and his representatives now would not be entitled to recover. In the discussion of this branch of the case, reference has been made to a letter written by Zurah Smith. I may -say here that the counsel, both for the. plaintiffs and the defend<a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>ants, have apparently vied with each other in paying high compliments to the character of Zurah Smith; moreover, they say that he was a man of probity and a business man. It may be assumed then, for the purpose of this investigation, that he was that kind of a man. The letter seems to have been written February 4th 1829, and was therefore subsequent to the entry on the commissioners’ transcript book of January 10th 1829. I have only to say of Zurah Smith and of John Myers, the treasurer who preceded him, and about whom the counsel on both sides have said much in the argument, that they were old men when I was a boy. I remember Zurah Smith and John Myers. They were excellent old men, but they were not infallible; they were like all other human beings, liable to make mistakes. And now that they are gone and the clods of the valley are over them, we are called upon to investigate their acts, and to deduce from them, if possible, what the truth is, in connection with those acts. I allude to John Myers, not because the evidence connects him with the case, but solely because his name has been so frequently mentioned in the argument of counsel on the one side and the other.</p>

This is a circumstance competent for argument and competent for your consideration. In explanation of the course pursued by Zurah Smith, the plaintiffs’ counsel further argue that there might have been a large body of deeds made out at this time, as was usual; and that this one might have been acknowledged through mistake, and afterwards come into the hands of the commissioners. Again, it is also argued that Zurah Smith continued to be the county treasurer until 1830; that his receipt is here for the taxes of 1828 and 1829; and yet when he executed and delivered that receipt to Mr. Deringer or his agent, if the views of the counsel for the defendants are correct, a destructive and fatal dagger had been sticking, for two whole years, in the very heart of Mr. Deringer’s title. The plaintiffs’ counsel ask how this is to be explained, if there had been such a sale as the defendants claim; how it is that Zurah Smith, who must have known of the sale, who made it, and who is conceded to have been an honorable man, continued to receive from Mr. Deringer the taxes continually accruing upon this land.

But <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>you must find further, I repeat again, not only that the taxes in question were paid, but <em>that they were paid before the sale of </em>1834.</p>

No man can be expected to swear that he examined every day and date, the crossing of every £t,’ the dotting df every £i.’ He can say only that he saw the receipts, that he examined them and that they purported to be tax receipts for the years 1826, and, if you please, down to 1868; and further, that they purported to be receipts from the treasurer of the county of Luzerne. As I before remarked, the Supreme Court have wisely said that testimony of this character was exceptional; nevertheless,' from the very necessity of things, cases will arise where it will be competent for the consideration of a jury. If you find, then, that the receipts spoken of by the Deringer family and by Mr. Stewart, did exist, covering the payment of taxes for 1832 and 1833, and that these taxes were paid before the sale in 1834, then that sale conveyed no title whatever; it was utterly valueless. If, on the other hand, you find that they did not exist, or that they did not show the payment of these taxes before that sale, then the sale of 1834 vested the title in Charles S.

The case does not decide what amount or what kind of proof will be sufficient to establish the requisites. Here, in this case, was a deed made nearly fifty years before the trial; a recital in the body of the deed that the statute had been complied with; the records of the commissioners showing that after the sale they treated the land as not belonging to the county; the assessments in the name of Henry Deringer, the purchaser, and the payment of taxes by the purchaser for a long series of years.

The case of Hoffman <em>v. </em>Bell, 11 P. E. Smith 444, cited by plaintiffs in error, decides no more than that the payment of taxes <em>by a stranger </em>for twenty-one years will not raise a presumption that the owner has conveyed to him. It was an attempt to misapply the doctrine of Taylor <em>v. </em>Dougherty, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 324" data-case-ids="1852507" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0324-01">1 W. &amp; S. 324</a>. One of the vital questions in the case was, whether the taxes for the year 1827, for which it was alleged the tract was sold to the commissioners in Í828, were paid before the sale ? As bearing upon this question, it was certainly competent to show the acts of the county officers, in relation to the sale of unseated lands in the county, occurring in that year, and especially their public acts.which had special reference to the sales of the tract in question. A public sale by the treasurer in the manner directed by law is essential to the validity of a conveyance by him and an important element in the title of the purchaser, and therefore the records kept by the treasurer, and especially his sale book, may be given in evidence by either party for whatever it is worth. That a deed was made in this case by the treasurer to the commissioners was shown by the production of the deed itself, but there was no evidence of a sale made to warrant the execution of the deed, which can amount to no more than secondary evidence at best, and could only be received, if at all, to show a sale after showing the loss of primary proof. It was competent, therefore, for defendants to show that the treasurer kept a record of his sales made in 1828, and that the book showed no sale of the Samuel Rope tract, which was a circumstance to be submitted with other facts to the jury.

There were facts to be submitted to the jury on the question whether the requirements of the Act of 29th March 1824 had been complied with by the commissioners, in making the sale to Henry Deringer of June 5th 1827. There had been no <em>actual </em>possession of the Samuel Rope tract until very recently. Henry Deringer had paid the taxes regularly on this tract, with a slight exception, for nearly forty years. It is not the case of one setting up payment of taxes against another in actual possession, exercising rights of ownership under a claim of title. The payment of taxes will not stand for actual possession to support a title under the Statute of Limitations, •but it is an assertion of title of a decided character, so much so it will extend even a tortious possession, beyond the <em>pedis possessio </em>of a trespasser: M’Call <em>v. </em>Neely, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%2073" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="3 Watts 73">3 Watts 73</a>; Heiser <em>v. </em>Riehle, 7 <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%2073" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="3 Watts 73">Id.</a> 37 ; Criswell <em>v. </em>Altemus, Id. 580. It was said in our former opinion, the county being the owner of the land the commissioners conveyed, the deed of June 5th 1827 recited the performance of the directions of the act, and this sale has never been impeached by the county. The conclusion then stated was that the facts were for the jury, upon the question whether the directions of Act of Assembly had been complied with. Opinion of Woodward, J., Coxe <em>v. </em>Deringer, 28 P. F. Smith 271. In Jenks <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 P. F. Smith 410, there was direct and positive proof that the sale was private, and the act not pursued. So in Hoffman <em>v. </em>Bell, 11 P. F. Smith 444, <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>the deed was made after the treasurer had gone out of office, and therefore without authority. In no case has it been decided that the party claiming under a commissioners’ deed must prove the prerequisites of the sale positively under <em>all </em>circumstances. Natural presumptions arising from clearly proved facts which lead to a belief that the directions of the law have been fulfilled, must be submitted to a jury in this as in other cases.</p>
    <p id="b256-6" data-blocks='[["BL_256.6",256,[272,711,1177,994]]]'>The second proposition is sustained on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence to overturn the fact of the sale set forth in the treasurer’s deed of 1828 to the commissioners. This fact lies at the foundation of the title of the county, of which the primary evidence is the deed itself. There are some recitals in a treasurer’s deed, which are only secondary evidence, and where, to support a sale, the recitals may be corrected by the original documents from which the recitals were derived: Turner <em>v. </em>Watterson, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 171" data-case-ids="1856454" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0171-01">4 W. &amp; S. 171</a>. But a sale is an independent fact in itself, not necessarily the subject of an entry in an original document, unless it happens, to be made voluntarily by the treasurer. The law requires no entry of it. The sale is itself an original act, done <em>in pais, </em>or, as it were, out of doors, and in point of time follows all the documentary entries relating to the tax for which the sale is made. It has nothing original to be referred to, by way of correction. Hence the treasurer’s deed is the primary and best, and, it may be, the only evidence of the fact of a sale. The sale is a necessary act, without which no deed can be made. The deed, when delivered, is therefore the proper evidence of the sale set forth in it, and cannot be avoided by loose and inconclusive evidence that no sale was made nothing less than clear and strong evidence of no sale being made should be permitted to overturn the solemn deed of the officer of the law. Any other rule would render tax titles very insecure.</p>

F. Smith 267. This case does not need the doctrine of that case. Here we have not only the signing, sealing and acknowledgment, but possession by a subsequent purchaser under a tax sale of 1834, to whom it would be probably delivered by the commissioners, who suffered the land to be sold for the taxes of 1832,1833, assessed' in his name. But it is not necessary to strengthen the presumption of delivery, for both the plaintiffs and the defendants in error have argued the case as one of a <em>delivered </em>deed, and that the purpose of the evidence was to show that there was <em>no sale </em>to support the deed.</p>
    <p id="b257-6" data-blocks='[["BL_257.6",257,[180,831,1182,1598]],["BL_258.1",258,[288,399,1208,603]]]'>This brings us to the sufficiency of the evidence relied on. The first two facts on which most reliance is placed are that the treasurer made entries of the sales of other tracts at the same time, and made none of the sale of this tract. What then is the fact itself as to the Samuel Rope tract, the only one we are concerned in, and what is the value of the fact ? ■ The fact is simply an omission — a failure merely to make an entry; .and its value uncertain. Was it a failure of inadvertence or of intention ? Was it a slip of memory, or because no sale was made ? Who can say with certainty.? The treasurer has made no entry of a sale, but will this fact overturn a sale he alleges he made, and which he has consummated in the most precise form, by a deed solemnly executed and delivered, under the responsibility of his office and the sanction of his oath? Surely a solemnly affirmed act cannot be blown away by such a breath as this. Still worse and weaker are the next two facts relied on, viz.: that the treasurer on the 4th of February 1829 wrote .a letter to Henry Deringer and did not mention that the land had been sold to the commissioners in 1828, and that afterwards he received the taxes of 1828 and 1829 of Deringer, and said nothing of a sale in 1828 for the taxes of 1827. If Zurah Smith; the treasurer, were a party to be affected by his own acts or omissions there would be room for argument. But after the sale of 1828, he had no power whatever, by acts or declarations, much less by mere omissions, to impair the deed he had before solemnly and officially executed and delivered. The title under that deed was not to be withered by his breath, or his omission to speak of that which did not concern him. Frail, indeed, would be the tenure of any purchaser under such a deed, could such evidence be used half a century afterwards to stifle its voice. Of the same character are the omissions of the commissioners to perform the subsequent duties devolved on them by the Act of Assembly. Such irregularities are unfortunately too frequent. And what makes the error of the court more hurtful was the language and tone of the charge upon these weak and inconclusive facts. Referring to the letter of February 4th 1829, the judge said: “ When Zurah Smith wrote that letter, if the theory advanced by the plaintiffs’ counsel be true, there had been dealt a staggering, if not fatal blow at this very title,” and referring to <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>Smith’s receipt for the taxes of 1828-29, he said: “ And yet when he executed and delivered that receipt to Mr. Deringer, or his agent, if the views of the counsel for the defendant are correct, a destructive and fatal dagger had been sticking for two whole years in the very heart of Mr. Deringer’s title.” The language of hyperbole is suited to the purpose of the advocate, who would enforce his thought by striking and intense expressions, in order to deepen its effect, and by the exaggeration lead the minds of his hearers into the fever of his own heated fancy. But weak and inconclusive facts when thus presented by a judge can only mislead. Jurors catching the tone and temper of their conclusions from the strong and figurative style of the judge, fail to give to the facts their true weight which a cool and fair statement is calculated to produce. There is . clear error in the tenth specification.</p>

There was such evidence of the time of the payment of the taxes of 1832 and 1833 as was properly submitted to the jury. It came from several witnesses, not being confined to C. M. Deringer. It appeared that the receipts were continuous and complete, in biennial periods, from the year 1826, until the year 1844, a lapse intervening then for four years ; and beginning again in 1849 they continued in the same manner until 1868. They were regular in their form, character and time of payment early in the year. An illustration of their form, &amp;c., was given in the receipt of January 5th 1830, viz., a statement in transcript form of the five tracts belonging to Mr. Deringer, giving the names, quantities, localities and taxes for each tract for the two preceding years, summed up together,-and a receipt at the bottom for the entire amount, with date. This precise, methodical and regular payment of the taxes on all the five tracts early in the year was strong evidence of Mr. Deringer’s punctuality. It proved his deep interest in the subject, which was not likely to fail in performance of his duty to protect himself. It was a very natural conclusion that a man who always paid his taxes promptly in biennial periods, previous to the time of sale, would have paid them in time in 1832 and 1833. This, therefore, was a question for the jury and not the court. Yet we are not unmindful of the necessity of holding a party to strict proof of the <em>time </em>of payment, when its purpose is to defeat a tax sale. The doctrine of McReynolds <em>v. </em>Longenberger, 7 P. F. Smith 13, ought not to be carried beyond its fair import. No question arose in that case upon the sufficiency of the evidence as to the <em>time </em>of payment, as shown in the receipts which had been destroyed; and indeed no objection was taken to the deposition on the score of time. The questions in this court arose upon the exclusion of parts of the deposition of the person who was the administrator of the owner, who had testified to the finding of the tax receipts in their proper place among the muniments of the owner’s title ; and the <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>points decided were that on proof of their destruction by fire, and of their apparent official character, and the lapse of time since their dates being over thirty years, the evidence of their existence, character and possession was competent, in order to receive proof of their contents. The chief question was whether such instruments, when accompanying the possession and title of the land, proved themselves after a lapse of thirty years. What would have been their effect had the deposition been read and no other evidence of the time of the payment of the taxes than the mere years for which the taxes were assessed had been offered, was not determined. We make these remarks to guard against any inference that we now mean to give that case a wider range than its true character imports.</p>

No such contradiction need take place in a future trial.</p>
