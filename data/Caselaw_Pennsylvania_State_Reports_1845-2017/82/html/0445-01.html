The <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>plaintiff concedes that he can, in any event, recover no more than the purchase-money paid and interest.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[277,474,1172,303]]]'>“ When a contract for the sale of land has not been consummated by deed, the vendee may rescind the contract at any time, even for a partial failure of title, and sue to recover the money paid on the contract; for the law will not compel a party to accept a title different from that contracted for, and if the vendor cannot give him the title that was contracted to be given, the law will on demand give the vendee back what he had paid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b448-7" data-blocks='[["BL_448.7",448,[273,777,1173,1501]]]'>“ The law is different in the case of an executed contract. In such a case the vendee has accepted his deed and after that he must resort to the covenants contained therein, for his redress in case of failure of title, without fraud on the part of the vendor. In such a case he cannot rescind the contract, but must sue for damages for the breach, and he is entitled to recover the amount of damages actually sustained, not exceeding the amount of purchase-money paid and interest. If the failure of title be total, he can recover all he has paid with interest; if partial, he can recover in proportion to the failure. If he has himself relieved the title of its encumbrance, he can recover to the extent of the price paid to remove the encumbrance, if it does not exceed the amount of the purchase-money and interest. In this case the title which the vendor, Knowles, covenanted to convey and assure to the plaintiff, was that of the heirs of William A. Knowles, for by the bond given at the same time by Kennedy, he agreed, substantially, that he would take upon himself the risk of any claim then or thereafter to be made by the widow of William A. Knowles.' [The title which the defendant agreed by his deed to convey to plaintiff, had utterly failed when this suit was brought, and at that time the plaintiff undoubtedly had a right to demand a return of what he had paid and interest.] But the defendant contends that plaintiff ought not to recover now, because he has now perfected his title to the land, and is able to give, and in law has given him all the title he covenanted to give. We are not as clear on this point as we would like to be, [but decide that the defendant cannot set up the title acquired by him since this suit was commenced, as a defence to the plaintiff’s demand in this case, nor can the defendant restrict the plaintiff’s recovery to what the defendant paid for the outstanding titles to the land.] It therefore follows that we are of the opinion [that the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this case, for the $300 paid by him, with interest thereon, from the time of the demand for the return of the purchase-money, by the plaintiff.] The foregoing charge answers the plaintiff’s points, substantially, in the affirmative, except as to power to rescind contract.”</p>

He therefore took a life-estate in the land subject to the widow’s statutory right. At the time of the delivery of the deed to the vendee he gave to the vendor a bond indemnifying the latter against all claim then or thereafter to be made by the widow' of said William A. Knowles for or on account of the lands. The vendee thus substantially took on himself the risk of all claim the widow might assert, and now makes no complaint arising therefrom. The vendee went into possession of the land under the deed. His possession has not been interfered with by the vendee or by any one claiming by title paramount. Subsequent to the conveyance and before the commencement of this suit, the widow of William A. Knowles, by application to the Orphans’ Court of Erie county, elected to have three hundred dollars’ worth of property set off to her out of said lands. The appraisers appointed for that purpose reported that the land was of greater value than $300, and that it could not be divided without injury to or spoiling the whole, which was confirmed by the court; but no further action appears to have been taken therein.</p>

    <p id="b450-8" data-blocks='[["BL_450.8",450,[278,1884,1166,258]]]'>The court below held, the language used created a covenant on the part of the vendor that he was seised of an estate in fee simple, and the vendee was entitled to recover the purchase-money he had paid, with interest thereon from the time he had demanded its return. All the assignments of error except the 1st, 9th and 10th are predicated on this ruling and may be considered together.</p>
    <p id="b450-9" data-blocks='[["BL_450.9",450,[281,2141,1164,290]]]'>There is no averment in the deed, that the vendor was seised of an estate in fee; nor is it averred that he was seised of an indefeasible estate. Even the usual words “grant, bargain, sell,” are wholly omitted, and “grant and convey” are substituted. The covenant of warranty is special. It is to defend against persons lawfully claiming under the vendor or under William A. Knowles, deceased.</p>

      <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>In fact the vendor was the lawful owner of a freehold estate in the land conveyed, and was well seised of the same. The vendee did not become liable to accounkto any one for the rents, issues and profits of the land during his occupancy thereof. He was’ not evicted by any adverse proceedings. His enjoyment of the premises during the life of the vendor was secure. No one claiming under the vendor or under William A. Knowles had disturbed the vendee in his possession. The vendor by his covenant of special warranty was bound to protect the vendee against the outstanding title of the heirs of William A. Knowles. He did this by a purchase of their title. It was held in Baxter <em>v. </em>Bradbury, <a href="/me/20/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="20 Me. 260" data-case-ids="570287" data-case-paths="/me/20/0260-01">supra,</a> that if the grantor by deed of warranty had nothing in the estate at the time of the conveyance, but acquired a title afterwards, this title enures to the grantee immediately by way of estoppel, and he cannot elect to reject the title and recover the consideration-money paid in an action for breach of the covenant of seisin ; but is entitled to merely nominal damages where no interruption of the possession has taken .place, and to the damages actually sustained when there has been. In Haverstick <em>v. </em>The Erie Gas Co., 5 Casey 254, it is said in strict law whenever a covenant is broken, the plaintiff is entitled to recover full damages for its breach; but equity intervenes and allows the covenantor to perform on making compensation for his negligence.</p>
    <p id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.6",451,[196,1421,1173,346]]]'>The declaration in this case avers, that in consideration of $400, the plaintiff in error sold the land, to the defendant in error, and covenanted he was seised in fee of the same, &amp;c., and charges that he was not so seised. It also avers the payment of $300 of the purchase-money, and claims the plaintiff therein is damaged to the amount of $1000. The claim is not to recover the money paid, but damages more than threefold. It is not in rescission of the contract, but in affirmance thereof, and damages for its breach.</p>
    <p id="b451-7" data-blocks='[["BL_451.7",451,[196,1768,1172,348]]]'>It is true the purchase by the plaintiff in error, of the outstanding title, after suit brought, could not defeat the right of action ; yet it does affect the measure of damages.' The title which the vendor had conveyed had not wholly failed. The failure was partial only. Compensation is the usual measure of damages. We discover nothing in the evidence in this case to take it out of that general rule. The covenant appears to have been made in. entire good faith.</p>
    <p id="b451-8" data-blocks='[["BL_451.8",451,[198,2113,1170,167]]]'>The defendant in error was entitled to recover nominal damages at all events and such further damages as the evidence shows him to have sustained. The assignments are therefore substantially sustained.</p>
    <p id="b451-9" data-blocks='[["BL_451.9",451,[199,2287,1169,130]]]'>We see no merit in the first and tenth assignments, and no evidence of such knowledge in the defendant in error as to justify the affirmance of the point covered by the ninth assignment.</p>
    <p id="b451-10" data-blocks='[["BL_451.10",451,[331,2417,991,46]]]'>Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>
