McCray in 1864 purchased land of Reed by articles of agreement, which he did not place upon record until 1871, and never took possession of the land or put a tenant thereon. In 1861, Clark obtained a judgment against Reed, and in 1866 he issued a scire facias to revive the same. Reed accepted service of the writ, hut it was not served upon McCray. Judgment was taken for want of an appearance and Clark sold the land in dispute. McCray brought ejectment and on the trial offered to prove by Reed that at the time the latter accepted service of the writ,. Clark admitted he had notice of McCray’s title, which offer was rejected. <em>Held, </em>that it was error to reject this evidence.</p>

The revival of a judgment by agreement to which a terre-tenant is not a party will not continue the lien as to him, although the deed by which he became terre-tenant was not recorded and he never entered into possession of the premises: Armstrong’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20852" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 852">5 W. &amp; S. 852</a>. It is not alleged by the defendant Clark that McCray had notice of his judgment against Reed, of his intention to revive the same, or any of the proceedings thereon. Therefore, as McCray became the purchaser of the land in dispute on the 29th of December 1864, and paid purchase-money in full, all of Reed’s interest and title in the land vested in McCray, and as Clark’s judgment against Reed was entered on the 4th of May 1861, the lien against the land in dispute expired on the 4th of May 1866, and there being no notice or revival as to McCray, the terre-tenant, the levy and sale in 1868 of Reed’s interest in the land to Clark passed no title, as Reed had no title remaining to sell at that date. ■ The object of the Act of April 16th 1849 was to provide for constructive notice to the plaintiff in a judgment of the transfer of the title, but did not touch the question of actual notice.

Under these acts a plaintiff in a judgment which was a lien upon land was compelled to ascertain whether a sale had been effected by the defendant in the judgment, and if so, to make the vendee a party terretenant in any revival, by scire facias, of the lien. The Act of 16th of April 1849 provides for a continuance of the lien by a revival between the original parties, except where the vendee has taken actual possession or placed his deed on record. If the plaintiff in the judgment finds no person in possession of the land bound by the judgment, and there is no deed or conveyance of the same from the defendant in such judgment on record, neither the spirit nor letter of the act requires him to heed actual or constructive notice except that <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>of possession. In the present case John Clark, one of the defendants in error, obtained a lien on the land in dispute by a judgment entered on the 4th day of May 1861, and when Reed, under whom plaintiff in error claims, sold the land on the 29th day of December 1864, the lien of the said John Clark was in full force and effect. Plaintiff in error not having placed himself in a position to claim notice as a terre-tenant by recording a deed or by taking actual possession, the title acquired at the sale on the judgment on the revival by scire facias carried the title to the land.</p>

L. 664), the lien of the judgment was continued against his land by the revival against Reed alone. The act declares, “In all cases where a judgment has been or shall be regularly revived between the original parties, the period, of five years during Avhich the lien of the judgment continues, shall only commence to run in favor of the terre-tenant from the time that he or she has placed their deed on record: Provided, that this act shall not apply * * * when the terre-tenant is in actual possession of the land bound by such judgment, by himself or tenant.” It is urged that this statute has prescribed the only ways by which the land of a terre-tenant can be discharged from the lien of a judgment duly revived against the original defendant. The correctness of this view may be tested by considering the object and spirit of the act. Its object was to protect the plaintiff in a judgment against the title of a third person of which he had no notice. Its spirit was to require one who desired to continue beyond five years the lien of his judgment on all the lands originally bound thereby, to revive it, <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>against all persons who he knew had purchased any of them after the recovery of the judgment. This section however deals with constructive notice only. The terre-tenant who relies on constructive notice to the plaintiff in a judgment to protect his land from a continued lien by a revival against the defendant therein, must show that he has either put his title on record, or that he was in the actual possession of the land, by himself or tenant. It leaves untouched the question of actual notice.</p>
    <p id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.6",461,[184,761,1167,948]]]'>Notice may be either actual and positive, or it may be implied and constructive. Actual notice is knowledge brought directly home to the party. Constructive notice is in its nature no more than evidence of notice, the presumption of which is so violent that the court will not allow-of its being controverted: 1 Story’s Eq., § 399; Lessee of Billington <em>v. </em>Welsh, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Binn.%20134" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Binn. 134">5 Binn. 134</a>. The rule is well established that a purchaser of land having notice of a prior unrecorded deed from his vendor, will not be permitted to set up his title against that prior conveyance. Such purchaser with notice is not considered a boná fide purchaser; but as one acting in bad faith, a <em>particeps criminis, </em>taking the place of his vendor; and to permit him to hold against the first purchaser would be to convert the statute into an instrument of fraud: 1 Story’s Eq., § 397 ; Brightly’s Eq., § 113; Jacques <em>v. </em>Weeks, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20270" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Watts 270">7 Watts 270</a> ; Garrard <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville Railroad Co., 5 Casey 154. So in York Bank’s Appeal, 12 Casey 458, it was held, that if a- subsequent encumbrancer have actual notice of a judgment defectively entered, before his rights attached, it is equivalent to the constructive notice given by statute to a proper entry on the judgment docket. That actual notice is as effectual as constructive notice is affirmed in Smith’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20128" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="11 Wright 128">11 Wright 128</a> ; Speer <em>v. </em>Evans, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20128" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="11 Wright 128">Id. 141</a>; Meehan <em>v. </em>Williams, 12 <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20128" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="11 Wright 128">Id. 238</a>.</p>

The terre-tenant was there in possession by his tenants on whom service could have been made.
