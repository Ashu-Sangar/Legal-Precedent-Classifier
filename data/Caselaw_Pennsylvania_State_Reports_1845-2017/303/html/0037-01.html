    <blockquote id="b64-8" data-blocks='[["BL_64.7",64,[267,1496,1148,694]]]'>“6th. The said road, when appropriated by defendant, was an ordinary country road, with stone and dirt surface in the main, having a single-track roadbed, with space for vehicles to pass at different points along the road. It was in use throughout all seasons of the year, subject to some slides of dirt and rock, some of which were required to be moved to keep it passable, and others were such that traffic could and did pass over them, but none of them seriously delayed traffic; it was nearly level throughout, lying along and in close proximity to the river edge, and in times of high water portions of it were covered with water; it could have been widened at a reasonable expense.”</blockquote>

Appellant contends that it is the statutory duty of appellee to reconstruct the new road to the width of 33 feet. The old road was not so built, but was so <em>“to be </em>built.” The new road of 1902 was practically a duplication of the old road as it was in fact, but not as it was on paper. At the present time a road 33 feet wide has become necessary. Shall the defendant be compelled to build it? The phrase “in as perfect a manner as the original road,” as used in section 13 of the Act of 1849, P. L. 79, we interpret not as referring to the method of building the old road, but as requiring that the new road be the same sort or kind of road as the old road. Webster’s New International Dictionary gives as the first definitions of “manner” the following — “species, kind, sort.” As was said by Chief Justice Mitchell, in Commonwealth v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/215/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="215 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="948352" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0149-01">215 Pa. 149</a>, at 153: “What the railroad company does under this authority [Act of 1849] is not to give the Commonwealth a new road with a new title and new attributes, but the old road reconstructed. The site is necessarily changed, but in all other respects it is to be ‘the same,’ to wit: expressly upon the most favorable location and in as perfect a manner as the original road, and, by necessary implication, of the same other qualities, including width, actual and potential.” The Act of 1849 does not require that the reconstructed road shall be an exact replica of the old road in respect to its grade or other physical aspects. Such a requirement might be utterly impracticable because of the difference in the terrain on Avhich the neAV road was to be built. It does, however, require <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>that the new road, in location and width, shall be, as far as it is physically practicable, an adequate substitute for the old road appropriated by the railroad company.</p>
    <p id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[290,512,1150,1890]],["BL_67.1",67,[149,332,1148,196]]]'>The court below found from the evidence that the new road constructed by the defendant was of the same width actually as the old road, and the same width potentially as the old road. The court aptly said in its opinion dismissing plaintiff’s exceptions: “The potential width of the old road was thirty-three feet, and the potential width of the new road as located along the hillside was thirty-three feet, and still is thirty-three feet, as the testimony discloses that the matter had been taken into consideration at the time of the relocation. There is no contention here that there is not sufficient ground along the hillside upon which to build or construct a road thirty-three feet wide; in fact, the testimony all discloses that there is mote than that much ground along the way. The old road being thirty-three feet wide, the new road which was laid out to take its place still maintains that same width. It was actually opened, however, for a width of approximately fourteen to sixteen feet, which was wider than the old road. By the term ‘open and construct,’ as used, we mean the actual building of the roadway, not the construction of the potential width of the road...... We believe that the defendant company discharged its obligation when it reconstructed a new road to a potential width of thirty-three feet and actually opened the new road to a width of fourteen to sixteen feet and reconstructed the traveled way of the new road in as perfect a manner as the original road......At the time the old road was taken, it was an ordinary country road, probably not traveled extensively, and a new road was supplied which met the conditions as they existed at that time. It seems now that it would be an unjust decree, after all these years of upkeep and maintenance by the plaintiff township of the road, which would require the defendant company to reconstruct it to meet present-day <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>needs and demands, when in good faith it did relocate it on the most advantageous route and location and reconstructed it in as perfect a manner as the original road.”</p>
    <p id="b67-7" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[143,549,1154,1839]],["BL_68.1",68,[260,335,1149,1069]]]'>Apparently, the only substantial difference between the old road and the new road is that, on account of the topographical differences in the respective locations of these roads it would cost more to widen the new road than it would cost to widen the old road. This is one of the risks the public has to take when an old road is appropriated under the Act of 1849 and a new road is substituted therefor. It may be that in some cases when the actual road has to be widened to take care of additional traffic requirements this widening may be less expensive than the widening of the old road would have been. When it proves to be less expensive, the public is the gainer. When it is more expensive, the public loses. When the township and the railroad company traded roads in 1902, the contract of trade was made under and in reference to conditions then existing. The old, narrow road was able to meet all the traffic requirements put upon it from 1803 until 1902, and no one had reason to anticipate in the latter year that within less than a third of a century a road of the old width would prove totally inadequate. It would be inequitable to compel the railroad company to pay now for the widening of a road which both parties in 1902 believed would be adequate to the future demands put upon it. If the old road used for ninety-nine years had been actually 33 feet wide and the new road constructed in 1902 by the railroad company had been of the same width, and if in 1929 additional traffic requirements had made it necessary to widen this road to 50 feet, and if it could be proved that it would cost much more to widen the new road to 50 feet than it would have cost to widen the old road to 50 feet, the township would not, of course, be in any position to demand of the railroad company the additional cost of widening the <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>road. The township is, under the facts of the instant case, in no better position to make now a similar demand upon the railroad company, when the actual roadway has to be widened from 16 feet to 33 feet. The railroad company gave the township in 1902 a new road which was, as far as practicable, a duplicate in actual and potential width of the road it took from the township. However, on account of the present location of the new road, it will cost the township more to make the new road’s actual width correspond to its legal width, than it would to have widened the old road in equal measure. But since appellant concedes that the new road was constructed “on the most favorable location,” we do not see why the railroad company should be penalized now for something which results from a condition of nature, and the necessity for overcoming which could not in 1902 have been reasonably anticipated by either party. It is the demands of the public that made this unforeseen widening necessary, and the public should pay for it.</p>

In that case, this <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>court, speaking through Chief Justice Mitchell, said: “The court below found that the legal width of the original road in 1803 was fixed at 33% feet......In contemplation of law the present road is the road that was opened by legal proceedings in 1803.” He said further: “The buildings [of the defendant company] were within the legal limits of the highway, the chute extending across it, though above the surface, was of course an obstruction, and the court found that the quarry was so operated as to be dangerous to public travel and a nuisance. The injunction was therefore properly issued.” The question in that case was not, therefore, the question in the case before us.</p>

D. &amp; C. 385</a>. The facts of that case were stronger for the plaintiff than the facts in the present case. In that case, Judge Marshall said: “The great weight of the evidence was with the plaintiff, to the effect that the [old] road had been the usual country road, with the witnesses’ estimates of its width varying from 25 to 35 feet. On an analysis and study of this testimony, we have concluded that the northerly end of the road, as existing in 1901, was 25 feet in width, and we have so found as a fact.” The court’s third conclusion of law, that “the reconstruction of the road as made by defendant to the width of but 16% feet and without adequate support for the fill on which it was laid......was not in as perfect a manner as the original road,” logically followed. The decree requiring the defendant to widen the new road to 33 feet south of a certain point and 25 feet north of that point was consistent with such finding of fact and conclusion of law.
