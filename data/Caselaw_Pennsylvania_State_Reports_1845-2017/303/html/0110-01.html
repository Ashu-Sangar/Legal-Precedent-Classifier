A few months later a third party proposed to purchase the mine, but without liability for defendant’s contract. Defendant, acting as agent for this sale, on commission, was equally interested with plaintiff in consummating the transaction, and together they executed a written agreement which, after setting forth in detail the terms under which their contract for removal of the coal should be abrogated, states: “The said Sol Benjamin, party of the second part herein, agrees to release and discharge the party of the first part herein of and from all its obligations under its said agreement of May 6,1921, and supplement thereto.” The promissory note, the basis of this action, was given as part of the settlement terminating the contract. At the end of four months, when the note matured, payment was refused, and upon suit <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>being instituted defendant set up as a defense (1) a set-off due under the coal contract, which he alleges was “omitted” in the settlement, and (2) also an earlier oral agreement to make adjustments in addition to the written contract.</p>

A long line of cases adhere to this rule (Citizens’ Nat. Bank v. Wisecarver, <a href="/pa/300/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="300 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1125876" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0060-01">300 Pa. 60</a>, 63, and cases there cited) refusing to allow an oral agreement to void the express terms of a written instrument.
