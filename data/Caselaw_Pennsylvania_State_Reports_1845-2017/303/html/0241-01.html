S. C. A., section 34 a. The Northampton Trust Company and First National Bank of Easton constitute the' consolidated bank. The Northampton Trust Company, of Easton, Pa., was incorporated in 1902 under the provisions of the Act of the Pennsylvania Assembly of April 29, 1874, P. L. 73, and the supplements thereto. It acquired trust company powers by accepting the provisions of the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 159. The First National Bank, of Easton, Pa., was, as its name indicates, a chartered national bank. The consolidation of these two institutions was made under the Charter of the national bank on July 1, 1929, at which time the consolidated corporation took the title of the First National Bank and Trust Company. <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>On the latter date the national comptroller of the currency issued his certificate of approval.</p>

All the assets and property of the trust company were transferred to the bank and trust company, and the trust company ceased to transact business. Thereafter the commissioner of banking of Pennsylvania directed the trust company to petition the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County, under the provisions of the Act of April 9, 1856, P. L. 298, for a decree of dissolution. The bank and trust company entered into these proceedings as respondent, filed its demurrer to the petition, assigning, inter alia, that the contract of consolidation worked a dissolution of the trust company and that the effect of the Act of Congress of February 25, 1927, was to extinguish the trust company and that therefore the court had “no jurisdiction of the said petition.” The court took this view and dismissed the petition. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania obtained leave to intervene as a party-petitioner and to file exceptions to the decree.</p>

The Act of April 9, 1856, P. L. 293, provides a method by which a chárter of a corporation created by this Commonwealth may be dissolved. It is a corollary of this that only by obedience to the prescriptions of this act can a corporation called into being by Pennsylvania be dissolved. Chief Justice Marshall, in McCulloch v. Maryland et al., <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wheat.%20367" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="4 Wheat. 367">4 Wheat. 367</a>, said: “The creation of a corporation...... appertains to sovereignty.

The respective supremacies of the state and national government in their respective spheres of sovereignty have been meticulously observed by the nation and each individual state. Within their individual spheres they are as sovereign as if they were two independent foreign states. There are many governmental activities in respect to which the federal government is not the states’ superior or sovereign. McLean, J., in License Cases, <a href="/us/46/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="5 How. 504" data-case-ids="8300376" data-case-paths="/us/46/0504-01">5 How. 504</a>, 588,12 L. edition 256, 293, says: “The powers of the general government and of the state, although both exist and are exercised within the same territorial limits, are yet separate and distinct sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each other, within their respective spheres.”</p>

They are in harmony with the conclusion reached by the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts in the case of Petition of Worcester Co. Nat. Bank, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20N.E.%20217" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="162 N.E. 217">162 N. E. 217</a> (Massachusetts, 1928), where Rugg, C. J., in interpreting the Act of Congress, said: “The later provisions of said section 3 that there shall be transferred to the national banking association and be held by it, among other things, the ‘franchise’ of the state bank, cannot mean its right to be a corporation. The right to transfer franchise powers of a corporation organized under the laws of one sovereignty to a corporation organized under the laws of a different sovereignty is extraordinary. It cannot be implied, in the absence of explicit statutory enactment to that end. There is no such provision in the statutes of this Commonwealth. Any other conclusion would be in contravention of the laws of this Commonwealth.” That finding was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in <a href="/us/279/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="279 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="3907241" data-case-paths="/us/279/0347-01">279 U.

In that case Chief Justice Taft said: “It held that the word ‘franchises’ directed to be transferred to the national bank by virtue of section 3 did not mean its charter or its right to be a corporation, for that would be in contravention of the law of the Commonwealth......” and then added: “These views lead us to agree with the conclusions of the supreme judicial court in respect to the legality of the consolidation of the trust company <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>with the national bank......

S. Revised Statutes, as amended by section S of the Federal Reserve Act. Such conversion of a state bank does not dissolve the state corporation. It is merely a change of title and governmental supervision. In the case of Michigan Ins. Co. v. Eldred, <a href="/us/143/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="143 U.S. 293" data-case-ids="6138989" data-case-paths="/us/143/0293-01">143 U. S. 293</a>, the appellee there, like the appellee here, took the position that “the logical effect of the decisions and of the Act of Congress (Revised Statutes, section 5154) would seem to be, upon the conversion of a state bank into a national bank, all of its property, rights, privileges and franchises, including its corporate existence, would pass to and be mei’ged in the national bank. What necessity is there for, and how could the state bank exist after it had been stripped of, all its property, rights and franchises? If it still could exist as a state corporation for any purpose, it would still be under the control of the state, which is obnoxious and repugnant to the authority exercised by Congress over national banks. The Act of Congress certainly does not contemplate the existence of two banks after the conversion. Hence, the state bank must cease to exist for all purposes.” The Supreme Court of the United States, speaking through Mr. Justice Gray, said: “The evidence offered by the defendant on this point wholly failed to support this defense, and at most only proved that the plaintiff sued by the wrong name. It showed no more than that the plaintiff corporation, having been originally created by the laws of Michigan, had, in accordance with the National Banking Act, become a national bank, and its name been changed accordingly, without affecting its identity, or <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>its right to sue upon obligations or liabilities incurred to it by its former name.”</p>

S. 520</a>, the Supreme Court said, at page 527: “The question we are to consider here is, did the court err in holding that the plaintiff in error was not exonerated from liability either by its becoming a national bank or by the proceedings for the redemption and retirement of its circulating bills issued whilst a state bank, which proceedings, it was claimed, were in strict observance of every requirement of the New York Statute of 1859 in relation thereto, or by the statute of limitations of the State of New York? The court decided that the New York Statute providing for a redemption of circulating notes and for releasing the bank, if the notes were not presented in six years, applied alone to banks ‘closing the business of banking’; that the change or conversion of the Metropolitan Bank into the Metropolitan National Bank did not ‘close its business of banking’ nor destroy its identity or its corporate existence, but simply resulted in a continuation of the same body with the same officers and stockholders, the same property, assets and banking business under a changed jurisdiction ; that it remained one and the same bank, and went on doing business uninterruptedly......

    <p id="b275-3" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[155,1488,1150,805]]]'>We conclude that when a state bank consolidates with a national bank located in the same county, city, town, or village, pursuant to the Acts of Congress authorizing such a consolidation, the charter of the state bank is not thereby extinguished and the state corporation is not thereby dissolved. Pennsylvania could by appropriate legislation provide that under such circumstances a state bank is ipso facto dissolved and it might be expedient so to provide, but this court cannot, under the guise of a judicial decision, enact such legislation. The charter of the Northampton Trust Company still exists and the company still maintains in contemplation of law its corporate personality. Its petition praying for dissolution under the Pennsylvania Act of April 9,1856, P. L. 293, should have been granted.</p>
