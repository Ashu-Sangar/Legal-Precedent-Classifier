At the time of the sale, the encumbrances on them were: (1) A mortgage of $2,000, which was not discharged by the sale; (2) a judgment for $1,000 which had been fully paid long before the sale, but which had not been satisfied of record, although the judgment creditor had promised to do so; and (3) three mortgages, belonging to appellees, for $13,000, $17,000 and $3,800 respectively, which, if the sale is carried through, will be discharged, because the judgment of $1,000 had not been satisfied of record: Reading v.

Yetter, <a href="/pa/280/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="280 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="1084485" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0229-01">280 Pa. 229</a>. Moreover, in Delaware Co. Nat.

After all, the ultimate test always is, whether or not the action of the court in setting aside the sale was a gross abuse of discretion (Stroup v. Raymond, <a href="/pa/183/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="183 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="896148" data-case-paths="/pa/183/0279-01">183 Pa. 279</a>, 281; Chase v.

    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[274,1643,1149,740]]]'>Counsel for appellants urge, however, that the Miller Case has no application here, because there the deed to the purchaser at the sale had not been acknowledged when the application was made to set it aside, while here the deed had been acknowledged, though it had not been delivered or recorded. Appellants contend, and cite a number of early cases which hold, that, after a sheriff’s deed has been acknowledged, it is error to set aside a sale, unless there was “fraud or absence of authority to sell.” Perhaps it would not be difficult to show, from the pleadings alone, that there was sufficient fraud in the instant case, but we need not go into this question, since the Act of April 22, 1905, P. L. 265, is now conclusive thereof.</p>
    <p id="b263-2" data-blocks='[["BL_263.3",263,[130,334,1152,2056]],["BL_264.1",264,[284,323,1145,250]]]'>
      <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>By section 3 of the statute, the acknowledgment of sheriff’s deeds, which previously had been made in open court, was directed to be made thereafter “before the prothonotary or clerk of the court out of which the writ issued, or his deputy”; and section 4 provides: “No deed shall be acknowledged before the return day of the writ under which the sale was had, or pending a motion to set aside the sale, or exceptions made to its confirmation ; nor shall a deed be delivered while such a motion or exceptions are pending, whether made before or after acknowledgment, and until the expiration of such further time, if any, as the court may direct by rule, or special or standing order. At the expiration of the times stated, and after the final disposition of all such motions or exceptions, if any such be made, the prothonotary or clerk shall deliver the deed to the sheriff or coroner, who shall forthwith cause it to be registered in the proper office, if registry be required, and recorded in the office for the recording of deeds and so forth for said county. The acknowledgment of the deed, and its delivery to the sheriff or coroner for the purpose of recording, shall operate as a delivery to the grantee or grantees named therein, with the same effect as if acknowledged in open court, under existing laws, and as if delivered to such grantee or grantees personally.” It will be noticed that under this section the mere acknowledgment before the prothonotary or clerk is not to have the same effect as an acknowledgment in open court previously had, but that there must now be both “the acknowledgment of the deed <em>and </em>its delivery to the sheriff or coroner for the purpose of recording” before it shall have “the same effect as if acknowledged in open court, under existing laws.” The rule of the court below, passed in pursuance of this statute, requires the prothonotary to hold the deed for one week, before delivery for recording. During that week, the motion to set aside the sale was made in this case. Hence, especially as the section also says that any one interested may <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>make such a motion “before or after acknowledgment” of the deed, the motion, made within that week, had the same effect, under this act, as if it had been made before acknowledgment in open court under the previous practice.</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[282,595,1148,1287]]]'>Appellants also contend that, in some of our decisions since the passage of the Act of 1905, there are statements to the effect that motions to set aside sheriff’s sales must be made before acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed. Appellees claim, on the other hand, that a proper consideration of all that was said in those cases will show that, despite the sentences excerpted by appellants, the actual decisions do not sustain their contention. It is not necessary, however, to decide this controversy, for in none of the cases cited by either party did it appear that the motion to set aside the sheriff’s sale was made between the date of acknowledgment of the deed and its delivery, and hence the statute, in the respect now under consideration, had no bearing on the questions there raised. Indeed, in but two of the cases was the statute even referred to: Iron &amp; Glass Dollar Savings Bank v. Wigman, <a href="/pa/264/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="264 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="1048506" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0146-01">264 Pa. 146</a>, where the exceptions to the sheriff’s sale were made before the erroneous acknowledgment of the deed, and Fenton v. Joki, <a href="/pa/294/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="294 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="1113367" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0309-01">294 Pa. 309</a>, where, in direct violation of the language of the statute, the deed was acknowledged and delivered before the return day of the writ. In each case it was held that the acknowledgment had no effect whatever, and this would have been so even before the passage of the Act of 1905.</p>
