Bechtel provided as follows: “I hereby appoint the Colonial Trust Company of Reading, Pa., trustee of the property Nos. 402% and 404 Penn Street and extending to Cherry Street,......, the said trustee to collect the rents and income arising therefrom, and after paying charges and repairs, to divide the balance into seven equal shares and pay one of said shares to each of my six children and to the children of my deceased daughter, Amelia Laura Miller, monthly, the child or children of a deceased legatee to represent the parent, until the death of the last of my children, when I direct my executors to sell said property at either public or private sale, and direct the proceeds thereof to be distributed under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania.”</p>

Bechtel, who is still living, Susan B. Bechtel, who died in 1924, unmarried and without issue, leaving her estate to Rena E. Bechtel, and Sarah Clarinda Stoudt, who died in 1924, survived by six children and two grandchildren; by three sons, Ernest Y. Bechtel, who died in 1922, without issue, leaving his estate to his wife, Annie L. Bechtel, George Irvin Bechtel, who died in April, 1930, leaving his estate to his two children, and Charles William Bechtel, who died in 1925, survived by an only daughter; and by the three children of Amelia Laura Miller, who are still living.</p>

Bechtel, petitioned the orphans’ court to terminate the trust as above provided. They were joined in this petition by the wife of Ernest Y. Bechtel, and the children, grandchildren and great gandchildren of testator as shown above (except the children of Sarah Clarinda Stoudt, who did not oppose the termination) ; the two great grandchildren, minors, being represented by their respective guardians, all others having an interest being sui juris.</p>
