After about one hour of questioning, Williams <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>told the police, inter alia, that he was on the corner of 20th Street and Susquehanna Avenue in Philadelphia with several other members of the “Alkie Bets” when a stranger informed the group that Whitaker, who was more or less intoxicated and was seated on the steps in front of a nearby building, had $150 “on him”; that he approached Whitaker and asked for a cigarette and urged him to go home “before something happens”; that Whitaker became argumentative and Williams punched him and knocked him down; that the other members of the “Alkie Bets” on the scene then moved in and assaulted Whitaker and went through his pockets; and that he saw “Sputs” (one of the gang) stab Whitaker four times.</p>

In support of this position, our attention is called to the following. Williams was seventeen <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>years of age at the time and had only an Eighth Grade education. He was also suffering from and undergoing treatment for a stab wound of the leg suffered only two days before.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Additionally, it is argued that the questioning took place under oppressive circumstances, that is, in police headquarters in the presence of several policemen.</p>

But, having filed a timely motion to suppress the statement on the ground that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his constitutional rights at the time the statement was given, Williams may still pursue this particular challenge to the admissibility of the statement, even in the absence of an objection at trial. This is so, because under Rule 323(e) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Williams could not raise this issue at trial. However, our examination of the record is persuasive that this complaint is without merit and that the suppression-hearing court correctly concluded that Williams was fully aware of his rights before he responded to any police questioning. In this <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>connection, it must also be noted that Williams’ trial testimony as to his personal involvement in the Whitaker assault and robbery was substantially the same as his statement to the police.</p>
    <p id="b203-3" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[156,552,1151,1042]]]'>Williams next complains the trial judge committed reversible error in his charge by failing to submit to the jury for its decision the issue of the voluntariness of the statement. It is true that as a general rule and under most circumstances, the issue of the voluntariness of a statement, such as here involved, must be considered and ultimately determined by the jury. And this is so even though a “Jackson-Denno” hearing court has previously determined the issue of voluntariness. <em>Jackson v. Denno, <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">378 U.S. </a></em><a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">368</a>. <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">84 S. Ct. 1774</a> (1964), and <em>Commonwealth v.

However, where, as here, the admissibility of the statement is not challenged at trial on the ground of involuntariness and the defendant does not request the trial judge to instruct the jury on this issue, and also fails to enter either a specific or general exception to the charge, we rule that the omission or inadvertence on the part of the trial judge in this regard is not reversible error.</p>
    <p id="b203-4" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[152,1607,1152,710]],["BL_204.1",204,[196,324,1158,878]]]'>The next complaint challenges the manner in which the Commonwealth was permitted to question certain defense witnesses at trial for the purpose of affecting their credibility. All of these witnesses were members of the “Alkie Bets” and admittedly participated in the Whitaker assault, or were on the scene when it happened. Some of these witnesses testified that they didn’t see Williams stab Whitaker, and one of said witnesses, Charles Leftenant, also known as “Sputs” said he did the stabbing and not Williams. One of the witnesses also stated that Williams was not in the immediate area when Whitaker was stabbed and robbed. During cross-examination the Commonwealth was per<a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>mitted without objection to question these witnesses concerning written statements each had given to the police which were in direct and substantial conflict with their trial testimony. It is urged that this line of cross-examination should not have been permitted until the Commonwealth had first established that the requirements of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">supra,</a> and <em>Escobedo v.
