At the time of the accident Mrs. Price was pregnant with the infant Pamela Price. As a direct result of the accident, Mrs. Price suffered severe personal injuries requiring prolonged hospitalization in the Frankford Hospital. Subsequently, Pamela Price was born in Lankenau Hospital on September 23, 1959, with cerebral palsy, a massive and permanent injury to her brain and body.</p>

Price, and by Pamela in her own right sought to recover damages for Pamela’s condition and related expenses allegedly caused by the accident. The first action was terminated after a general release was signed by Martin and Delores Price on October 24, 1960, and the second, the subject matter of these appeals, was allowed to continue.</p>

By order of the court below separate trials were mandated on the issues of liability and the effect of the release. A trial by jury on the release issue was first conducted with the trial judge eventually directing a verdict in favor of Byram and Yellow Cab (appellees). Thereafter the parties agreed that no mention was to be made of the release at the second trial.</p>

Thereafter the jury returned verdicts in favor of the defendants-appellees. Following disposition of post-trial motions by a court en banc, judgments were entered in favor of defendants-appellees and these appeals followed.</p>

Appellants also allege that the release issue was wrongly decided and that judgment n.o.v. should be entered. Of course, any discussion of the release issue would be unneces<a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>sary if there was no error in the conduct of the liability trial — if the infant could not recover for her injuries, ipso facto, the parents, in their own right, could not recover for their medical and related expenses arising from Pamela’s condition.</p>

At the time of trial Mr. Wolman, a well-known sports figure and principal owner of the Yellow Cab Company, was beset by many financial difficulties and the downfall of his financial empire was widely publicized by the Philadelphia news media. Hence the argument is presented by appellants that this line of inquiry generated sympathy for Mr. Wolman, a person with no connection whatsoever in the litigation, and effectively informed each juror that a vote for defendants-appellees was a vote for Mr. Wolman. For a variety of reasons, I do not believe there is reversible error.</p>

Mr. Wolman was certainly a controversial, well-known person; but whether he could be termed “popular” depends in large measure upon the particular segment of the population one addresses.

Necessary for a complete understanding of this alleged error is the fact that Dr. Mitchell, while not actually delivering Mrs. Price, was her obstetrician and that, apart from the issue of damages, the sole question involved in the principal trial was whether a causal relationship existed between the concurrent negligence of appellees and the infant’s cerebral palsy. Reading the record, it becomes most apparent that appellees’ trial strategy involved linTn'rig the infant’s condition not with the appellees’ negligence but with other factors, including any possi<a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>ble negligence on the part of Dr. Mitchell.

During the cross-examination of Dr. Mitchell, he was asked whether he had brought certain papers and documents and he affirmatively responded. At this juncture a side-bar conference was conducted followed by an <em>in camera </em>proceeding. An examination of this correspondence revealed that Dr. Mitchell notified his professional liability insurance carrier of the possibility that a malpractice claim might be filed against him. After argument by counsel for both parties, the trial judge, over appellants’ objection, not only permitted the introduction of these documents but also allowed cross-examination on this subject in order to discredit Dr. Mitchell’s testimony by demonstrating a possible motive or bias for his testimony.</p>

Since the jury cannot return a verdict against a nonparty witness, the fact that this witness is insured cannot possibly inure to the plaintiff’s benefit and correspondingly prejudice the defendant. Although, as appellants <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>suggest, a plaintiff might possibly be prejudiced, the general rule is intended to shield the defendant and not the plaintiff.

Nevertheless, owing to the primacy of the causation issue at trial as well as Dr. Mitchell’s possible responsibility for the infant’s unfortunate condition, this correspondence between Dr. Mitchell and his professional liability insurance carrier is most relevant, especially since his testimony on direct examination, if believed, would absolve him of all liability.</p>

In the instant case, the trial court erroneously struck the balance between these two policies by permitting defense counsel over plaintiffs’ objection to inquire of the prospective jurors whether any of them were creditors of or had any claims against Jerry Wolman, a well known Philadelphia sports figure and the then principal shareholder of the corporate defendant Yellow Cab Company.</p>

Wolman is not a party to this litigation, and while there is nothing of record to substantiate appellants’ assertion that he was a “popular” figure, the opinion in support of affirmance itself characterizes him as “controversial”. In these circumstances there was a substantial possibility that among the veniremen were one or more individuals sympathetic toward Wolman, and defense counsel’s implicit suggestion to the jurors that Wolman’s fortunes were tied to those of Yellow Cab created the unfortunate opportunity for such sympathy to influence the ultimate verdict.</p>

    <p id="b182-7" data-blocks='[["BL_182.7",182,[196,1200,1149,424]]]'>Appellee Yellow Cab Company seeks to justify its use of this correspondence on the theory that it tended to indicate Dr. Mitchell’s awareness that his own professional conduct rattier than the automobile accident might have been the cause of the infant plaintiff’s injuries and, hence, that Dr. Mitchell had a motive to testify so as to assign blame to Yellow Cab rather than to himself.</p>

In the first place, this correspondence was utterly irrelevant for the purpose claimed by appellee.

The opinion in sup<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>port of affirmance itself recognizes the unwise public policy of generally permitting evidence of a witness’s communication with his insurance company in this day and age when virtually all insurance carriers routinely require advance notification of any possible claims, but this is precisely what that opinion unfortunately portends. Despite the stated intention of the opinion in support of affirmance to limit today’s ruling to the particular circumstances at bar, as this case now stands, whenever an individual communicates with his insurance company about a matter in which he may have any involvement, however innocent, that communication opens him to the charge of admitting responsibility for the matter.

However, on the copy of the release agreement produced at trial appeared the writing “P.I. <em>27837, </em>10/28/60”, which was the number of the check paid by Yellow Cab in return for the release. On the face of that check appeared the following language: “For In full and final settlement of all claims arising out of an accident which occurred on March 14, 1959— <em>P.I. </em>— C.P. <em>#4, </em>March, 1959, #1498.” (Emphasis added).
