BroAvn, along with his codefendants Daniel Patrick O’Neill and Michael F. McCaffrey, agreed to rob an <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>establishment for the alleged purpose of obtaining money for their rent. At approximately 7:30 P.M., the three young men left O’Neill’s apartment in Lacey Park, Warminster, and drove a short distance to Montgomeryville, where McCaffrey purchased a box of .38-caliber bullets to be used in O’Neill’s revolver. Brown and O’Neill purchased a pair of dark gray stockings to be used to cover their faces during the robbery. They then drove to Willow Grove, intending to rob the Seven Eleven grocery store. Upon arriving at the Seven Eleven store, they decided not to rob the store because of a high fence adjacent to the store which would have impeded their flight and the presence of several patrons in the store. Brown and his codefendants then proceeded to the nearby town of Glenside at approximately 9 P.M., where they drove past the delicatessen owned by Eugene Jordan. They noticed that Jordan was alone in the store, and drove slowly past the store two more times before they stopped and parked in front of it. O’Neill and Brown placed the stockings over their heads and entered the store, while McCaffrey waited outside with the automobile’s engine running. O’Neill had a revolver in his possession and Brown had a billy-club with him as they entered the store. O’Neill told Jordan that they intended to rob him, whereupon Jordan attempted to pull the stocking off O’Neill’s head. O’Neill fired the revolver three times at pointblank range into Jordan, which naturally caused his death.</p>

Later that evening, O’Neill hid the murder revolver in an abandoned automobile near his apartment. The revolver was found the next morning by a child playing in the automobile and was turned over to the police, who determined after a ballistics test that it was the murder weapon.</p>

Township for further investigation concerning several burglaries in that area. At approximately 7 P.M., Brown and O’Neill came under suspicion for the murder of Jordan and were taken to the office of the Montgomery County District Attorney in Norristown.
