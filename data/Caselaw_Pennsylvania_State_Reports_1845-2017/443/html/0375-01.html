Shepherd, Jr., and his wife (the property owners) in which the Borough sought to compel the property owners, by mandatory injunction, to remove from the bed of Tannery Kun Creek those portions of a retaining wall on their property which had fallen into the creek and to repair the retaining wall. The court <em>en banc </em>dismissed the Borough’s exceptions to the chancellor’s decree nisi and adopted it as the court’s final decree; the Borough then appealed.</p>

The findings further show that this retaining wall has deteriorated to the extent that part of it has collapsed, causing stone, mortar and soil to fall into the creek partially obstructing its flow, and that, if not properly maintained, the retaining wall will continue to deteriorate and further impede the flow of Tannery Run Creek.</p>

The chancellor’s finding that the Borough had adopted Tannery Run Creek is amply supported by the record. The question remains, however, what, if any, obligation the Borough thereby assumed.</p>

This view was echoed in <em>Owens v. Lancaster, </em><a href="/pa/182/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="182 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="893301" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0257-01">182 Pa. 257</a>, 262, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.%20858" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="37 A. 858">37 Atl. 858</a> (1897), where it was held that a city which had adopted and used a watercourse as an open sewer was responsible for the damage caused by allowing accumulations of debris to obstruct the natural flow of the stream.

    <p id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.4",492,[191,979,1148,861]]]'>In none of the cases discussed above was the question presented whether the municipality incurred, in addition to its duty to keep the watercourse open, the duty to maintain the artificial or natural embankments on the sides of the stream. The distinction between these two duties is an important one. Underlying the obligation of the municipality to prevent accumulations of debris in the stream bed is the belief that those accumulations are caused, or at least aggravated, by the flow of sewage or the increased flow of surface water resulting from the use of the watercourse by the municipality as part of its sewer system. Thus, unless the deterioration of the embankment is the direct result of the use by the municipality of the stream, its restoration cannot be viewed as falling within the scope of the duty incurred by the municipality.</p>

While the lower court overruled the exception, our review of the record has convinced us that the Borough’s position is correct. The evidence <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>showed that the Borough maintains four sets of inlets into the stream above appellees’ property, and that the watershed of Tannery Run Creek encompasess ninety acres located within the Borough, but no testimony was introduced indicating what, if any, increased flow of water resulted from these four sets of inlets. Moreover, there was no proof of causal relationship between any increased flow and the deterioration of the wall. On the contrary, the only testimony giving any indication of the cause of the deterioration was that of Mr. Shepherd, one of the property owners, who stated that a truck had run into a utility pole located in the center of the wall, knocking over the pole and cracking the wall.</p>
