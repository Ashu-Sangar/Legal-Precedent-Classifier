Sayre, Jr. and Holland R. Sayre. <em>More than two years prior to her death, </em>decedent had opened five accounts at several <em>savings and loan associations. </em>Three of the accounts were designated “Greta Rhoads Sayre in Trust for Holland R. Sayre,” and two were designated “Greta Rhoads Sayre in Trust for Allyn T. Sayre, Jr.” No power of revocation or alteration was specifically reserved by the decedent, nor did she ever revoke or alter them. These five accounts, which totaled approximately |50,000, were <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>not included in the Inheritance Tax return filed by her executor, Holland R. Sayre. The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue made a re-appraisement of the Estate and included the bank accounts. A protest was filed by the executor with the Department of Revenue, and after the protest was denied, the executor took an appeal to the Orphans’ Court Division of Delaware County.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[195,790,1154,380]]]'>The Orphans’ Court Division hearing Judge held that the decedent <em>created irrevocable trusts </em>when she opened the accounts, and thus the accounts were not subject to Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax at her death.

However, there is firmly embedded in Pennsylvania a “tentative trust doctrine.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a>
      <em>Brose Estate, </em><a href="/pa/416/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="416 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1892997" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0386-01">416 Pa. 386</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20301" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="206 A.2d 301">206 A. 2d 301</a>. The tenative trust doctrine or exception to the general rule of trusts provides that, with respect to a deposit in a savings account by one person of his own money, in his own name as trustee for another, a <em>mere tentative trust, revocable at will, </em>is deemed to have been created. Nevertheless, extrinsic evidence, if clear and <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>convincing, is admissible to prove that the depositor’s intent was to create an irrevocable trust. <em>Brose Estate, </em>416 Pa., supra.</p>
    <p id="b664-4" data-blocks='[["BL_664.4",664,[217,497,1150,1037]]]'>The appellant-executor advances several facts and circumstances which he contends evidence the decedent’s intent to create <em>irrevocable </em>trusts: (1) when opening the accounts, decedent refused to sign the revocable trust clause on the reverse side of the savings and loan associations’ agreements (or signature cards) of deposit, saying, “I will not sign anything unless Mr. Bell reads it first”; (2) there were no principal withdrawals from any of the five savings accounts during decedent’s lifetime; (3) the decedent did not include in her Federal Income Tax return the interest on these savings accounts; and (4) at least two of the accounts Avere established in the presence of Holland R. Sayre, a beneficiary. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, contends that the issue is governed and controlled entirely by a stipulation of counsel, which appears in the record, that the decedent had the power to “alter, amend or revoke” the trust accounts during her lifetime. As we shall see, the stipulation does not so state.</p>
    <p id="b664-5" data-blocks='[["BL_664.5",664,[215,1546,1149,595]]]'>The stipulation merely states that if the savings and loan association officers were called, each would testify that the decedent had the power to “alter, amend or revoke.” Such testimony, Avithout more, may mean that that is the policy of the bank or the officers’ interpretation or understanding of the legal effect of such a deposit, and their conclusion is not binding on the Courts. Moreover, decedent’s failure to include the interest from the savings accounts in her Federal Income Tax return<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> could be the result of her misunderstanding of the Federal tax laws.</p>
