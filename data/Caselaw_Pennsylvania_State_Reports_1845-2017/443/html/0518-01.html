There were several fires reported in that area, and a fire was burning just north of the intersection of 18th and Holland Streets. Fire trucks and equipment were parked near the intersection and a large crowd had gathered in the area. At approximately eight o’clock p.m. the police discovered some flammable material near a building close to the intersection and attempted to arrest a person named Benny Wall in connection with these materials. Wall was standing in a crowd of about one hundred persons in front of a tavern known as the Chesterfield Lounge, located on the southeast corner of the intersection of 18th and Holland Streets. Wall resisted arrest and the arresting officers called for help.</p>

As the Court stated in <em>Smith v.

The Commissioners also received additional names from friends and acquaintances. The names of the clubs and churches were obtained from the yellow pages of the telephone directory. The Jury Commissioners testified that they had actual knowledge that such letters were sent to the predominantly Negro clubs and churches, but did not know or recall whether they had responded to the inquiry. There was also testimony that contact was made with the Negro committeemen, but, again, the Commissioners did not know or recall whether any names were supplied from these sources. Approximately one-half of the names placed in the jury wheel were gathered in this manner. The other half were supplied by three Judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County. There is testimony that one of the Judges went through the voter registration lists and gathered names, but there was no testimony offered as to how the other Judges gathered and supplied names for jury service. Once the names were received by the Commissioners from the various sources, there was no way to tell whether the person was white or black. At this point, the names were then turned over to the Secretary of the Jury Commissioners, who placed them in a locked jury wheel for later random selection.</p>

We disagree. Officer Woolis testified that he was struck by a bottle hurled from the general direction of the Chesterfield Lounge as he entered the intersection <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>attempting to assist Ms fellow officers. He further testified that he was acquainted with appellant and his family because he had had a beat in appellant’s neighborhood for over a year. <em>He definitely identified appellant as the person who threw the bottle </em>at the time of the incident and made the arrest within one hour thereafter. Our review of the evidence convinces us that the Commonwealth’s evidence was undoubtedly sufficient to support a guilty verdict.</p>
    <p id="b639-3" data-blocks='[["BL_639.4",639,[137,836,1150,589]]]'>Appellant’s final contention is that the lower Court erred in refusing to accept his point for charge concerning his alibi defense. Appellant testified that he was working in the bar as a bartender during the racial disturbance and the rioting, and never went outside. We have reviewed the lower Court’s charge and find that it accurately and adequately stated the law concerning an alibi defense and indeed included all the significant portions which appellant’s requested point for charge contained. We find no merit in this or in any other contention of the appellant.</p>
