These charges arose from the fatal shooting of a Philadelphia police officer on June 13, 1948. After the Commonwealth had presented its case, the appellant, who was represented by an attorney, withdrew his plea of not guiltj and entered a plea of guilty to murder generally. Three Judges were impaneled to determine the degree of guilt. After a hearing, the three-Judge Court found appellant guilty of murder in the first degree and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. No post-trial motions were filed.</p>

There was testimony to the effect that the appellant tripped the policeman and then, while kneeling on top of him, removed the policeman’s gun from its holster and shot him four times. Additionally, the Commonwealth introduced a spontaneous confession in which appellant admitted the killing. Faced with the very real possibility that the jury would sentence appellant to death, it was not unreasonable for appellant’s attorney to counsel appellant to enter a guilty plea which resulted, as above mentioned, in a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
