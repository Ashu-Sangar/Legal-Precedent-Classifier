Under his will dated January 3, 1936, he left his residuary estate in trust. In this appeal, we are called upon to determine, in the light of all the language of the will, the meaning of the following language which appears as part of the Eleventh paragraph of his will: “. . . I have at the time of the execution of this my Last Will <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>one grandchild, Margaret Ann Lilley, and my wife has one grandchild by a former marriage, Dorothy Adele Allen.

Each of his children survived him; the last survivor was Doris, who died March 14, 1969. In 1907, testator married Kathryn Allen, a widow who had a son by a previous marriage, Richard M. Allen. Kathryn died on June 27, 1943. Richard is still living. No children were born of testator’s marriage to Kathryn Allen.</p>

Allen’s daughter and Kathryn’s grandchild. Natalie was born after the death of both the testator and Kathryn. The Orphans’ Court excluded Natalie, and she has appealed to this Court.</p>

In the Fifth paragraph of his will, he gave his residuary estate in trust to pay his wife annually at least $4,000, and should his daughter Doris become “self-dependent,” at least $1,800 annually to Doris. He then gave each of two named cousins $300 annually for their lives, and if his daughter Doris was not self-dependent, she was to share with his sons the balance of income.

The naming of his wife’s grandchild, Dorothy Adele Allen, as entitled to be included in the gift of the remainder would not only further confuse the meaning of this clause, but likewise <em>negate appellant’s interpretation </em>of this ultimate gift of principal to Kathryn’s then living grandchildren.
