MacDade Boulevard is a highway of two north<a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>bound and two southbound lanes, the midline of which is marked only by a broken white line without any constructed medial divider.</p>

The light turned green, one of the cars turned off east on South Avenue, the other continued north in the innermost northbound lane of MaeDade Boulevard, and plaintiff followed in the same lane. His two companions were still farther back. At a point the plaintiff described as three-quarters of a block, one of his companions as seventy-five to one hundred yards, and a policeman investigator as two squares or four to five hundred feet north of the intersection, plaintiff saw the car in front of him ‘veer sharply’ to the left, across the marked midline, into the nearest southbound lane, to pass around what plaintiff suddenly saw to be an excavation across the highway in the lane he was travel-ling, with a mound of dirt completely blocking the other northbound lane to plaintiff’s right and extending up on the sidewalk. Four or five feet of the highway surface closest to the midline in the lane of plaintiff’s travel remained unbroken. Southbound traffic appeared immediately after the preceding automobile had made its way around the obstruction, and plaintiff saw no way to follow, left of the obstacle, without risking collision with one of the cars approaching in the opposite direction.</p>
