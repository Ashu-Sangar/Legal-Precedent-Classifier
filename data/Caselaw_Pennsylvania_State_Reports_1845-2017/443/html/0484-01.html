There are twenty-eight one-judge judicial districts in this Commonwealth — eight of which districts include two counties — and the possibility exists that any or all of these counties could be without judicial representation for prolonged periods if the Senate failed to confirm or even to act on the gubernatorial judicial nominations. Instead of recognizing the dire need for more judges, as evidenced by the numerous legislative proposals that have been recently introduced, the opposition view would lop off six judges. In this day and age, when our courts are faced with tremendous backlogs on both the criminal and civil sides of the courts, the prompt and expeditious filling of judicial vacancies is vital to the efficient operation of our judicial system. Those in opposition to the order, by their restricted and narrow interpretation of when a vacancy occurs, would not serve the public need in this respect.</p>

Adopting the opposition’s position, the Governor could appoint a man while the Senate is in session to fill a vacancy <em>first </em>occurring during the Senate’s adjournment despite any contrary senatorial advice. To forestall any such possibility, the purpose of the Constitution’s time division must be deemed to relate primarily to the availability of the Senate for consultation.

Conversely, however, the opposition holding could be said to place undue power in the Senate, which if misused could circumvent the power of the Governor to appoint. These arguments were raised and answered by the Court in <em>Lafean. </em>Because of the wisdom and current validity of the Court’s opinion on these aspects, we quote it at length. “A careful consideration of the argument and authorities cited by counsel for appellants fails to convince us that in framing the Constitution it was intended to limit by implication the choice of the governor in filling vacancies. It is of no avail to say that to permit the appointment of one who has been rejected for a full term would in effect enable the governor to evade the constitutional requirements. We cannot assume a public official will abuse his trust (Lane v. Commonwealth, supra), or act with a view to evade the duties of his office. The presumption is to the contrary: Mansel v. Nicely, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20Pa.%20375" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="175 Pa. 375">175 Pa. 375</a>. In Fritts v. Kuhl, supra, it is said (page 205) : ‘The argument of those who deny the power, that it will tend to deprive the senate of their just participation in appointments to office, is not of controlling force. It is not logical to argue from an abuse of power to a negation of it. Every authority, however indispensable, may be the subject of abuse. Undoubtedly, the governor may abuse this, as he may any other power entrusted to him, but the argument is equally cogent, that the senate may arbitrarily refuse to consent to every nomination made by the governor, and leave him powerless to execute the laws, unless he will accede to its demands. The consequences likely to flow from a denial of the governor’s power are much more to be [deprecated] than those that can result from conceding it.” <a href="/pa/261/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="261 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="1042275" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0057-01">261 Pa. at 67-68</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20494" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="104 A. 494">104 Atl. at 497</a>.</p>
