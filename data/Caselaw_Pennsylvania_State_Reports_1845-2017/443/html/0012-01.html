    <p id="b125-6" data-blocks='[["BL_125.8",125,[137,833,1151,762]]]'>On June 10, 1970, defendants (appellants) sold property in Montgomery County to the plaintiffs (appellees). The next day, the defendants moved to Florida. On July 2, 1970, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in Equity alleging that the defendants had misrepresented the condition of the property and had “maliciously, fraudulently, and with the intention to deceive plaintiffs” concealed certain serious structural defects on the property. The prayer of the complaint was for rescission and reconveyance, and for compensatory and punitive damages resulting from the alleged tortious conduct. The complaint was served upon the defendants in Florida by certified mail on July 11, and July 21, 1970.</p>

Defendants’ preliminary objections were dismissed by the Court en banc, which directed plaintiffs “to effect service of the complaint in equity upon the defendants by service upon the Secretary of the Commonwealth pursuant to Act <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>No. 152.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> Plaintiffs thereafter served defendants by service upon the Secretary of the Commonwealth; whereupon defendants took this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b126-5" data-blocks='[["BL_126.4",126,[198,509,1154,432]]]'>For the purposes of this appeal, it is assumed that the defendants committed a tortious act within the Commonwealth prior to the passage of the aforesaid Act, and that they became nonresidents thereafter. The sole issue, therefore, is whether or not the Act applies to nonresidents who had been residents of Pennsylvania and had committed tortious conduct in our State before the passage of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b126-6" data-blocks='[["BL_126.5",126,[196,951,1156,758]]]'>Act No. 152 provides, in pertinent part: <em>“From and after the passage of this act, any nonresident of this Commonwealth who . . . shall have committed a tortious act within this Commonwealth,</em>

We disagree. We cannot change the clear language of the Act. If the Legislature had intended to say “who shall commit,” with its obvious import, then that is what they would have said.</p>

In <em>Kilian v. Allegheny County Distributors, </em><a href="/pa/409/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="409 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="1883244" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0344-01">409 Pa. 344</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20517" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="185 A.2d 517">185 A. 2d 517</a>, we interpreted §1011 (now §2011) of the Business Corporation Law of 1933, P. L. 364, as amended, which provides for service of process on unregistered corporations “doing business” in the Commonwealth as applying as of the date the action was filed, although the statutory amendment was not in effect when the operative facts occurred. We pertinently said (pages 350-351) : “The Act of 1959, supra, dealt with a procedural matter, i.e., service of process. While substantive rights are settled as of the time the cause arises, rights in procedural matters, such as jurisdiction and service of process, are determined by the law in force at the time of the institution of the action.” Accord: <em>Frisch v.
