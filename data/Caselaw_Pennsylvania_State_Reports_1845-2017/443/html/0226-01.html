See Act of March 11, 1875, P. L. 6, §1, 12 P.S. §645. While it appears, then, that orphans’ courts may grant nonsuits, the grant of a nonsuit is not an appealable order; all that is appealable is an order of the court <em>en banc </em>refusing to take off a nonsuit. <em>Kukich v.

A compulsory nonsuit may be entered only against parties plaintiff (or counter-claimants). While the situation of a contestant to a will is analogous to that of the usual plaintiff in terms of burden of proof, he is not in fact a plaintiff. On the contrary, a contestant is defending against probate of a document he asserts not to be a valid will. After the proponent proves a prima facie case of validity, the mere fact that the burden of proof of invalidity is then upon the contestant does not make him a plaintiff. Moreover, under the Act of 1875, <em>supra, </em>a nonsuit motion is proper only when the defendant has introduced no evidence; in the case before us both parties introduced evidence.</p>

I believe those words in the order pertaining to a “compulsory nonsuit” should be regarded as surplusage and ignored; the decree entering judgment for proponents, declaring the will to be valid and directing its probate, was entirely sufficient without that inappropriate terminology.</p>
