On June 20, the Ratonys purchased property in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, <em>as tenants by the entireties. </em>Sixteen months later, being then separated, they conveyed the property for a net sum of f620. On December 11, 1941, they executed a formal Separation Agreement. The Agreement was drawn by the decedent’s attorney, who also witnessed its signing. After the Agreement was entered into, the parties continued to live apart and appellant made no attempt to attack or set aside or ignore the clear language of this Agreement or the mutual promises they made therein, until after decedent’s death on August 26, 1968, twenty-seven years later.</p>

Furthermore, Justice Roberts contends that the <em>waiver of the wife’s right or claim for support </em>against her husband “evinces a clear intent on the part of the parties to the agreement that <em>the $620 to be divided between them was to serve in lieu of further support payments.” </em>This is obviously completely devoid of merit — it gives the wife <em>for her support </em>only the tiny amount of $310, which would have resulted in the ridiculous amount of $13.28 a year, based on the length of time she lived after the Separation Agreement was executed. Justice Roberts further contends there was a want of consideration for the Agreement. He not only overlooks the aforesaid mutual promises and mutual property agreements and settlements, he also overlooks the facts that (1) both parties were extremely poor; and (2) the wife acquired, iix addition to the aforesaid sum of money and a division of their furnishings and other personal property, a right to a separate existence for her life (a) without any interference from her husband, and (b) without any marital duties, such as the duty to cook or keep house; and (3) she secured her absolute liberty; and (4) she secured the important right to receive and keep, without any claim thereto from her husband or any rights of her husband therein, any money she might (a) inherit, and (b) make from her work, or (c) win.</p>

Justice Jones then advocates a <em>new </em>test for the determination of consideration in a postnuptial agreement. He first overlooks tbe fact that the parties mutually agreed that from this time forward each would have no rights or interest in any property of the other.

Employing the familiar principle that a spouse’s release of his or her intestate share supplies the consideration for a transaction with the other spouse, the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>Edwards </em>held that the widow who released her dower interest in exchange for her spouse’s relinquishment of his interest in her property was barred from sharing in his estate. Relying on the principle that the intestate share is not a present interest when the contract is entered, the Appellate Court of Indiana came to a contrary conclusion in <em>Unger </em>as it held a widower received no consideration from his wife for his release and hence could claim his intestate share. Analyzing these two rationales, I am persuaded by the Indiana Court. In the situation where the <em>surviving </em>spouse is the one who relinquished his or her intestate share in exchange for certain property, I would rely on the rule that such release is a valid consideration. However, where the <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>
      <em>deceased </em>spouse is the one who relinquished his or her intestate share in exchange for certain property, the deceased spouse has never furnished anything since that spouse’s intestate share in the estate of his or her mate was divested by the prior death of the decedent. Accordingly, in the mutual release situation, the deceased spouse, whoever it may be, has never surrendered anything.</p>

Primarily, it ignores the distinction between marriage settlements (postnuptial and antenuptial agreements) concerning the disposition of the spouses’ respective interests in the estate of the other, and separation agreements concerning the rights of spouses to live apart and the right of a wife to support, maintenance, and the property presently owned jointly between them as tenants by the entireties. This distinction is crucial in many circumstances. For example, a separation agreement may be abrogated by a reconciliation, whereas a postnuptial property settlement will not be annulled merely by reconciliation, and it is the intention of the parties and the surrounding facts which determine what type of agreement has been created in each case.

The agreement merely states that sum of three hundred and ten dollars is “. . . a full and complete settlement of all property rights between the parties” and that from then on “. . . neither party shall have any property interests in any property owned by the other.” Contrary to the majority’s rhetorical question, this language is far from clear.

For instance, where a postnuptial settlement altogether fair and equitable, has been executed and the gift to the wife has passed to her (for post-nuptial settlements, strictly speaking, are mere gifts between husband and wife: Schoul. Dom. Rel. 276), she might in that case in equity be required to perform it; in other words, a chancellor would refuse to restore her to her rights relinquished in the settlement, after the death of the husband. It will depend much, therefore, upon the nature and value of the interest which has been parted with by the wife as a consideration for what she has received by way of settlement, whether or not she ought to be entitled to relief; Cord on Married Women, sec. 35, <em>et seq. The authorities, as also the reason of the thing, seem to teach that </em>. . . <em>the wife . </em>. . <em>is never bound by a mere promissory consideration.” </em>Id. at 306. (Emphasis added.)</p>
    <p id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[205,1527,1146,478]]]'>The majority’s proposition that Mrs. Eatony’s acquisition of such things as “her absolute liberty” (she was still married), and “a right to a separate existence for her life without any interference from her husband, and (b) without any marital duties, such as the duty to cook or keep house” serves as sufficient legal consideration for this ambiguous agreement is certainly novel and without decisional precedent. I, for one, am unable to accept it.</p>
