    <p id="b416-5" data-blocks='[["BL_416.7",416,[231,616,1145,322]]]'>This appeal involves the correctness of the appraisement of the Estate of Harold R. Dixon, deceased, by the Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for inheritance tax purposes. For reasons that will appear later in this opinion, it is unnecessary to reach the merits of the controversy.</p>
    <p id="b416-6" data-blocks='[["BL_416.8",416,[229,949,1148,762]]]'>Dixon, the decedent, died testate in Allegheny County on June 1, 1968. Letters testamentary were issued by the Register of Wills on June 26th. The Estate filed an inheritance tax return on October 16th. The Department of Revenue filed its appraisement of the Estate on October 23rd. The Estate filed a protest nunc pro tunc with the Department of Revenue on September 24, 1969. The Department refused to consider the protest because it was untimely filed. An appeal was then filed by the Estate in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County, which subsequently entered a decree sustaining the Estate’s protest of the appraisement made by the Department of Revenue. The Commonwealth appeals from this decree.</p>

L. 373, §316, as amended, 72 P.S. §2485-1001, the Estate Avas required to file its protest of the appraisement with the Department of Revenue within sixty days after receipt of notice of the department’s appraisement. It is undisputed that the protest herein was not filed until after eleven months had elapsed and the only reason given for the delay was the unfamiliarity of the attorney for the Estate Avith the statutory requirements. Under the circumstances, the Department of Revenue properly refused to con<a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>sider the protest and the court below erred in ruling otherwise.</p>
