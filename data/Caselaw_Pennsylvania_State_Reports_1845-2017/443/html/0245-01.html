After she had testified in many cases, it was discovered in 1965 that she had lied about her professional qualifications in that, in reality, she had never fulfilled the educational requirements for a laboratory technician.” <em>Commonwealth v.

We there noted that “. . . [e]ven though Miss Mallatratt lacked the necessary theoretical and academic background for accreditation as a laboratory technician, it may well be that the practical experience gained over a long period of years in laboratory work did qualify her to make proper and sound laboratory findings.” <em>Commonwealth v.

He also contends that the Commonwealth was permitted to produce expert testimony to the effect that a laboratory technician need have no formal education in order to analyze bloodstains properly, but when appellant proffered expert testimony to the effect that formal education was essential, the hearing court sustained the Commonwealth’s general exception. In addition, appellant argues that the trial court announced it was already familiar with “the technical experience of Miss Mallatratt” and that the purpose of the hearing was merely to put sufficient corroborative testimony on the record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> This, appellant asserts, amounted to a decision <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>in. advance of the hearing that Miss Mallatratt was qualified, based on information of unknown origin and validity. Appellant further contends that Miss Mallatratt’s testimony concerning her tests was mere guesswork because the undershorts in question had been exposed to the August sun for several days. Finally, appellant challenges the constitutionality of his death penalty and the Pennsylvania murder statute under both the equal protection and the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
    <p id="b362-4" data-blocks='[["BL_362.5",362,[198,895,1151,981]]]'>In our view, appellant’s scope of inquiry during the hearing was unnecessarily and prejudicially limited. Although his expert witness was permitted to assert that Miss Mallatratt’s tests in this case were inadequate because her notes were insufficient, and because she failed to appreciate the effect of prolonged sunlight on the specimens, appellant’s medical expert was not allowed to give his opinion with regard to the formal educational training required to be an expert in the field of serology. The hearing court concluded such an opinion would be irrelevant. The Commonwealth asserts on appeal that an answer by appellant’s medical expert to such a question would be an opinion on the ultimate legal issue involved. Yet the Commonwealth’s expert was permitted over objection to present his opinion as to the quality of the way in which Miss Mallatratt went about her examinations and as to the accuracy of the conclusions to which she came.</p>

During this hearing, appellant is to be afforded full opportunity to cross-examine the Commonwealth’s witnesses and present his own experts concerning the necessary qualifications, academic and otherwise, requisite for being a sufficiently competent expert in serology who is able to analyze the type of evidence in this case, so that we might have a valid determination, once and for all, whether Miss Mallatratt’s experience gained in her laboratory work enabled her to make sound laboratory analyses of the evidence described in this record.</p>
