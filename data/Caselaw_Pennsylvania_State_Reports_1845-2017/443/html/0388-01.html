This tax deficiency was based on several items, the most important of which was the failure of the executors to include in Eleanor’s gross estate the amount of $1,731,904.04, which the Commissioner claimed was the value of Eleanor D. Merrick’s interest in the aforesaid trust which DuPuy created for Amy. On July 5,1966, Eleanor’s executors filed with the Tax Court of the United States a timely petition for the redetermination of this deficiency. One of the errors asserted by the executors in their petition was the inclusion in Eleanor’s gross estate (upon which the Commissioners based the deficiency) of Eleanor’s (alleged) interest in Amy’s trust.</p>

The Orphans’ Court, pursuant to Section 707 of the Orphans’ Court Act of 1951, P. L. 1163, 20 P.S. §2080.707, authorized the United States, and also the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (with respect to its Inheritance Tax interest), to appear as a party in interest, and a citation was issued to both the Commonwealth and the United States to show cause why the prayer of the executors’ petition should not be granted. The United States, through the Department of Justice, filed preliminary objections, objecting to the power and jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court to entertain the said declaratory judgment proceeding. The Orphans’ Court dismissed the preliminary objections and the United States took an appeal to this Court.

Nevertheless, the provisions of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act of June 18, 1923, P. L. 840, as amended, July 25, 1963, P. L. 305, 12 P.S. §831 et seq., appear to make the issue regarding principal presently justiciable. If Alfred V.
