After further hearing, out of the presence of the jury, the motion was denied by Judge Doty, the trial judge. Notwithstanding these rulings, appellant, as was his right, see <em>Commonwealth v.

He was questioned for about an hour and a half of this period before he confessed, and was, so the policemen testified, calm and stable throughout this period, responsive to questions, and without any indication of intoxication.</p>

Camm said that he told the officer he had spent the previous evening drinking with John By toff. Appellant asserted he was told by Kowalczyk to sign a paper, which the officer only later informed him constituted a written agreement to take a polygraph examination. He further testified that after he took the test, the officer told appellant he was lying. At no time, Camm stated, had he been told of his right to counsel or his right to remain silent; the warnings contained in his written statement had not been read to him or by him.</p>

He felt that the appellant, with his limited emotional resources, his premorbidity and schizoid tendency, had, in effect, been “brainwashed” by the isolation, the questioning, and the polygraph test, and that the interrogation “would hare a much more profound effect on him than it would on a so-called normal person.” This testimony, by itself, was not sufficient to compel a finding of mental incompetence, and in any event- did not have to be accepted. See 1 Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence, §565 at 576-577.</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[183,947,1156,426]]]'>A careful examination of the record fails to demonstrate that the lower court erred at the suppression hearings in not holding as a matter of law that appellant’s confession was involuntary, or that the jury erred in not so finding as a matter of fact. The question of appellant’s physical or mental coercion was strictly factual, and it was fully within the jury’s competence to reject appellant’s version.</p>
    <p id="b372-5" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[183,1385,1158,805]]]'>Appellant argues that the confession was not knowingly or understanding^ given because Officer Krimmel, in administering the constitutional warnings, stated that anything Camm might say could be used “for or against him”. Detective Krimmel, confronted on cross-examination at trial with an answer he had apparently given at the first suppression hearing using the “for or against” phraseology in a warning he had given appellant, denied having done so. “I haven’t said that at any proceeding. My only recollection is that anything he would say would be used against him at the trial.” Officer Kowalczyk stated he had not heard Krimmel give the warning in “for or against” terms. The written statement, signed by appellant, used only the word “against”.</p>

In both of these cases there was no dispute that the only warning given the accused had been that whatever he said could be used “for or against you”. In the case before us, on the other hand, the record not only does not compel such a factual finding, but the clear weight of the evidence is to the contrary. The record indicates, moreover, that three subsequent warnings given to Camm, including the written one, were in proper form, saying only “could be used against you”, and that no incriminating statements were made by appellant until after the subsequent oral warnings. In this situation, we cannot say as a matter of law that the warnings were not adequate or that the confession which followed them was not understandingly made; nor can we say that the jury verdict which involved a factual determination of adequacy and understanding was not fully supportable.</p>

The assistant district attorney made no commitment as to what his position would be.</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[201,677,1149,645]]]'>As indicated briefly in part I, appellant’s direct testimony included a recital of the course of events and the treatment accorded him by the police from the time of his arrest at his home through the signing of his formal statement at headquarters.

Appellant in his brief asserts that “The District Attorney over and over again successfully, in effect, forced the defendant into an open-Court confession of guilt, by forcing him to claim his privilege.” Appellant’s position is, furthermore, that when he took the stand and gave advance notice of his non-waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege as to the events surrounding the crime, and the court allowed him to do so, this was tantamount to a ruling that appellant could take the stand without danger of losing his privilege. “It was on this ruling and on this basis that the defendant took the stand”, his brief states. The appellant now contends that this understanding was flouted by the assistant district attorney and ignored by the trial court both in its rulings and its subsequent opinion refusing post-trial motions.</p>

Any witness in a judicial proceeding has the right to refuse to answer certain questions on the ground that to do so might tend to incriminate him. A defendant in a criminal proceeding, moreover, may refuse, under the same constitutional protection, to take the witness stand altogether.

This was overruled, but the court announced clearly to counsel and the witness that a statement of the result would be ground for a mistrial, unless it were to come out on cross-examination.

At 3:15 p.m. the same day Camm was arrested and brought to Homicide Headquarters in Philadelphia. This arrest was the result of information that he had been seen on a roof near decedent’s home in the early morning of that day. About two hours after being taken to police headquarters, and after he had received warnings as to his constitutional rights, and been given a polygraph test, Camm gave an oral statement, followed at 6:00 p.m. by a written statement. The gist of the statement was as foUows: On July 12, 1966, at about 2:30 a.m., John Bytoff told appellant that he knew a man who had money. They went to Koffke’s residence and walked around the back into a shed that led into the kitchen, where Camm broke a window and climbed into the house. Both Camm and Bytoff put masks over their faces and started searching for money. Koffke woke up and was seen by Camm and Bytoff to “do something at the buffet”. After Koffke went back upstairs, Bytoff went over to the buffet and searched for money. Koffke <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>came downstairs again and Bytoff said, “We’ll jump him”. Bytoff threw the deceased to the floor, wrapped a sheet around his mouth and asked him “where the money was”. When the deceased did not reply, Camm searched the upstairs. On returning, he saw blood in Koffke’s ear, then both Camm and Bytoff ran out. AU that was taken were three packs of Pall Mall cigarettes.</p>
