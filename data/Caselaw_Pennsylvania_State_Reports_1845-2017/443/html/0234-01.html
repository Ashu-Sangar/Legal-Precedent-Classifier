This court has consistently refused to reverse convictions of murder in the first degree, even with the death penalty imposed, for errors in the conduct of the trial or in the admission of evidence or in the judge’s charge, when these errors did not deprive the defendant of the fundamentals of a fair trial.” <em>Commonwealth v.

As we read <em>Crow, </em>that case stands, inter alia, for the proposition that a district attorney’s reference in his closing address to the convictions of a defendant’s confederate in a robbery was not sufficient error to justify disturbing on appeal the trial court’s refusal of a motion for the withdrawal of a juror. The <em>Senior </em>case likewise did not grant relief; only <em>Leroy </em>reversed a judgment of sentence on this ground, with no discussion of the issues. As will appear, we believe such error should be evaluated in each case to determine whether it is harmless.</p>
