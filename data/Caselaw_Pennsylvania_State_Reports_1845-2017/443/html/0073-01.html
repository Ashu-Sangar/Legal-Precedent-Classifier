      <p id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[221,1617,1163,718]]]'> Justice Stewabt explained that delay may ultimately result in as much oppression to one already a prisoner for the reasons that as to (1) above, the possibility of a partially concurrent sentence with the one already being served is lost of the trial of the pending charge is postponed and because under procedures widely practiced, the duration of his present imprisonment may be increased and conditions under which he must serve his sentence greatly worsened by the pendency of another outstanding criminal charge. As to (2) above, an untried charge, of which even a convict may be innocent, can have fully as depressive an effect upon a prisoner as upon a person who is at large since detainers have a corrosive effect on attempts to rehabilitate. (3) above, is self-explanatory since evidence and witnesses can disappear, memories fade and events lose their perspective, a man isolated in prison is powerless to exert his own investigative efforts to mitigate these erosive effects of the passage of time.</p>

In my view, such prejudice is already apparent on the record presently before us, and I would accordingly limit the inquiry upon remand to the question whether the Commonwealth made a diligent and good faith effort to bring appellants to trial after they had so demanded, a duty imposed upon the states by virtue of the United States Spreme Court’s two recent decisions in <em>Smith v.

However, the speedy trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is also designed to prevent undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial and to minimize anxiety and concern <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>accompanying public accusation. <em>United States v. Ewell, </em><a href="/us/383/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="383 U.S. 116" data-case-ids="6168414" data-case-paths="/us/383/0116-01">383 U.S. 116</a>, 120, <a href="/us/383/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="383 U.S. 116" data-case-ids="6168414" data-case-paths="/us/383/0116-01">86 S.

    <p id="b193-4" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[152,614,1155,650]]]'>“At first blush it might appear that a man already in prison under a lawful sentence is hardly in a position to suffer from ‘undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial’. But the fact is that delay in bringing such a person to trial on a pending charge may ultimately result in as much oppression as is suffered by one who is jailed without bail upon an untried charge. First, the possibility that the defendant already in prison might receive a sentence at least partially concurrent with the one he is serving may be forever lost if trial of the pending charge is postponed. . . .</p>

Cf. Klopfer v. North Carolina, <a href="/us/386/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="386 U.S. 213" data-case-ids="6170322" data-case-paths="/us/386/0213-01">supra,</a> <a href="/us/386/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="386 U.S. 213" data-case-ids="6170322" data-case-paths="/us/386/0213-01">386 U.S. at 221-222</a>, <a href="/us/386/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="386 U.S. 213" data-case-ids="6170322" data-case-paths="/us/386/0213-01">87 S. Ct. at 992-993</a>. In the opinion of the former Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, ‘[I]t is in their effect upon the prisoner and our attempts to rehabilitate him that detainers are most corrosive. The strain of having to serve a sentence with the uncertain prospect of being taken into the custody of another state at the conclusion interferes with the prisoner’s ability to take maximum advantage of his institutional opportunities. His anxiety and depression may leave him with little inclination toward self-improvement. ’ ” Id. at 378-79, <a href="/us/393/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="393 U.S. 374" data-case-ids="11316280" data-case-paths="/us/393/0374-01">89 S.

      <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>In the present case, trial was not had until almost three years after appellants’ original requests for speedy trial. I believe that a delay of this length can certainly be characterized as inherently oppressive. Furthermore, this almost three-year delay has certainly prejudiced appellants by negating the possibility of their state sentences running at least in part concurrently with the unexpired portion of their federal sentences.</p>
    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[220,780,1148,594]]]'>In light of the above, I would vacate appellants’ convictions and remand the record with instructions that unless the Commonwealth establishes either that it expended a diligent effort in bringing appellants to trial or that such an effort could not in any event have succeeded, the judgments of sentence against appellants should be arrested.
