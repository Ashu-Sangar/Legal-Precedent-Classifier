    <p id="b555-9" data-blocks='[["BL_555.13",555,[161,1132,1154,380]]]'>Plaintiff-appellee, Edwin J. Crane, was an employee of E. A. Gallagher &amp; Sons (Gallagher), a rigging company. Crane sustained serious personal injuries when he was trapped and crushed between a falling 2,000 pound skid and a moveable metal parts transportation rig in defendant-appellant’s, I.T.E.

      <em>Gallagher </em>— an <em>independent contractor </em>— had contracted with ITE to remove from ITE’s premises certain pieces of heavy machinery. The machinery was to be partially dismantled, placed on skids and then hauled to a railroad siding for shipment. On the day of the accident, plaintiff and a number of other Gallagher employees were engaged in moving a piece of the machinery through a narrow area in the plant. Attempting to avoid a large rack which was in the aisle, <em>one of the Gallagher employees </em>was unable to maintain sufficient tension on his guideline securing the skid and machinery, and it fell on plaintiff, seriously injuring him. <em>Plaintiffs complaint charged defendant-ITE with negligence in failing to provide a safe passageway and in failing to keep the passageway clear of </em>

    <p id="b557-3" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[158,1149,1150,1097]]]'>The principles governing the duty of a possessor of land to the employees of an independent contractor of course differ when the landowner or possessor does not retain control of the performance of the contracted work. In such a case, it is a general rule that a possessor of the land must still use reasonable care to make the premises safe or give adequate and timely warning of dangers known to him but unknown to the contractor or his employees. <em>Funari v. Valentino, </em><a href="/pa/435/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="435 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1924183" data-case-paths="/pa/435/0363-01">435 Pa. 363</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=257%20A.2d%20259" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="257 A.2d 259">257 A. 2d 259</a>. However, the possessor of the land can insulate himself from liability by warning the contractor of the existence of any dangerous conditions on the premises which he knows or should know, and need not warn the contractor’s employees. <em>Grace v. Henry Disston &amp; Sons, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/369/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="369 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="1232352" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0265-01">369 Pa. 265</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20118" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="85 A.2d 118">85 A. 2d 118</a>. Finally, these duties cannot be imposed upon the possessor of land, if the defective conditions were created by the work of the independent contractor or his employees. <em>Celender v. Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, </em><a href="/pa-super/208/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="208 Pa.

We think not.</p>
    <p id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[200,533,1153,1259]]]'>In imposing the second and third above-mentioned duties on ITE, both the plaintiff and the Court below relied on our decision in <em>Glass v. Freeman, </em><a href="/pa/430/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="430 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1915734" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0021-01">430 Pa. 21</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=240%20A.2d%20825" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="240 A.2d 825">240 A. 2d 825</a>. However, this reliance was misplaced. The rule enunciated in <em>Glass </em>closely parallels §§318 and 344 of the Restatement 2d, Torts, and is undoubtedly inapplicable. A careful examination of §§318 and 344 of the Restatement demonstrates that neither can properly be applied to the facts in the instant case. Section 318 deals with the duty of a possessor of land or chattels to control the conduct of a <em>licensee. </em>Section 344 deals with and covers the situation where a possessor of land holds it open to the general public for entry for business purposes. Although Comment c thereunder indicates that the intended coverage of §344 includes the acts of independent contractors and concessionaires employed or permitted to carry on activities upon the land, Comment a thereof makes it clear that §344 imposes liability <em>only </em>on possessors of land who hold it open to the public for business activities. See also, §415 Restatement 2d, Torts. In our judgment, neither <em>Glass v. Freeman, </em>nor §318, nor §344 controls or applies to this case.</p>
