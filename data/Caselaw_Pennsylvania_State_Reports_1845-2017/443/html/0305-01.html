    <p id="b419-8" data-blocks='[["BL_419.13",419,[163,1122,1155,653]]]'>On October 27, 1965, the appellant, John Henry Lewis, while represented by court-appointed counsel, A. Charles Peruto, Esq., and Edmund Pawalec, Esq., entered a general plea of guilty to murder. Before the plea was accepted, the trial court directed several questions to the accused personally, and Lewis’ replies clearly indicated he was entering the plea of his own volition and also that he was fully aware of the consequences. After an evidentiary hearing before a three-judge court, Lewis was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. No appeal was entered.</p>
    <p id="b419-9" data-blocks='[["BL_419.14",419,[165,1787,1153,256]]]'>In October 1968, Lewis instituted post-conviction relief proceedings challenging the validity of his conviction and sentence. After a counseled evidentiary hearing, relief was denied and this appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We affirm.</p>

      <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>To understand the two prime contentions asserted by Lewis in this appeal, a brief summary of the pertinent factual history is necessary.</p>
    <p id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[191,479,1156,822]]]'>About 7 p.m., on December 31, 1964, George Turk, an elderly male, left his place of employment in Philadelphia and proceeded to his automobile parked on a nearby street. As he entered the vehicle, Lewis also entered the vehicle with the intention of robbing him, and brutally beat Turk with his fists inflicting multiple injuries which resulted in death. Ellis Banks aided Lewis in the commission of the crimes by serving as a lookout from a point about 30 feet away. On January 4, 1966, Banks, in response to police questioning, admitted his part in the commission of the crimes and implicated Lewis as the actual perpetrator. Lewis was taken into custody láter the same day, and shortly thereafter gave the police a written confession detailing the circumstances of the assault and robbery.</p>
    <p id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[187,1312,1156,652]]]'>Banks was called to trial first and was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree and robbery. After judgments of sentence were imposed, appeals were filed and we subsequently reversed the judgments and convictions, because the incriminating admissions Banks made to the police and which were used against him at trial had been obtained without a prior warning of his right to remain silent. See <a href="/pa/429/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="429 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1913544" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0053-01">429 Pa. 53</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20416" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="239 A.2d 416">239 A. 2d 416</a> (1968). On retrial, after pleading guilty to murder generally, Banks was adjudged guilty by the court of murder in the second degree and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 5 to 20 years.</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.6",420,[185,1975,1153,320]],["BL_421.1",421,[153,317,1146,147]]]'>After Banks had originally been convicted by a jury, as before related, but before these convictions were reversed by this Court, Lewis was called to trial and, as previously noted, entered a general plea of guilty to murder. It is now urged that the guilty plea was not knowingly and intelligently entered because it was the <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>“unappreciated product” of Banks’ “unlawful confession,” Lewis’ own “unlawful arrest” and subsequent “unlawful confession.”</p>
    <p id="b421-3" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[147,484,1152,1152]]]'>As to tbe allegation that the guilty plea was the “product” of the “unlawful” confessions, this is completely refuted factually by Lewis’ own testimony at the post conviction relief hearing below, when he candidly admitted that he plead guilty solely because his counsel advised him that such would lessen the possibility of his receiving a death penalty sentence, and also that the confessions of Banks and himself had nothing to do with his entering a plea of guilty. Moreover, even though the confessions were “unlawfully” obtained, i.e., in the absence of required constitutional warnings, this in itself, does not invalidate the guilty plea. <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em><a href="/us/397/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="397 U.S. 759" data-case-ids="12058501" data-case-paths="/us/397/0759-01">397 U.S. 759</a>, <a href="/us/397/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="397 U.S. 759" data-case-ids="12058501" data-case-paths="/us/397/0759-01">90 S. Ct. 1441</a> (1970). However, if the confession given by Lewis to the police which was subsequently used against him during the adjudication of guilt proceedings were obtained in the absence of required constitutional warnings, this could invalidate the adjudication of guilt of murder in the first degree and require a new hearing to determine the degree of guilt. <em>Commonwealth v. Marsh, </em><a href="/pa/440/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="440 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="1932317" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0590-01">440 Pa. 590</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=271%20A.2d%20481" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="271 A.2d 481">271 A. 2d 481</a> (1970).</p>

Since the guilty plea was entered subsequent to <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">378 U.S. 478</a>, <a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">84 S. Ct. 1758</a> (1964), but prior to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S. Ct. 1602</a> (1966), the absence of such a warning would, in itself, prohibit evidentiary use of the confession. <em>Commonwealth v. Jefferson, </em><a href="/pa/423/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="423 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1903093" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0541-01">423 Pa. 541</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=226%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="226 A.2d 765">226 A. 2d 765</a> (1967). But the record further discloses that not only was the confession introduced in evidence without objection, but was received by the trial court after defense counsel specifically informed <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>the court that Lewis personally desired that the statement be read into the record without objection. Under such circumstances, the admissibility of the confession may not be challenged now. In view of this, it is unnecessary to reach the question of whether or not the confession was tainted and rendered inadmissible in evidence, because it was the product of an unlawful arrest, i.e., one lacking probable cause, since it was based on the “unlawful” admissions of Banks. However, we must note that because evidentiary use of Banks’ admissions to the police were proscribed in his trial, it does not necessarily follow that the information gained therefrom would not constitute probable cause.</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[226,1085,1147,317]]]'>It is next urged that Lewis was denied constitutional due process and equal protection of the law, because his co-felon, Banks, although equally guilty under the law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> avus adjudged guilty by the court of murder in a lesser degree, and given a less substantial punishment.</p>
