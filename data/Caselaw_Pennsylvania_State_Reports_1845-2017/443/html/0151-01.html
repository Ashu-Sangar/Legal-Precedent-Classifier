    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[157,732,1151,701]]]'>The facts can be briefly summarized: In the early morning hours of July 16, 1953, appellant and his two confederates planned to rob a gasoline station-motel complex situated along state highway Route 22, east of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Under the pretext of desiring to rent a room, appellant and one of his co-conspirators lured the 79 year old attendant, David W. Fawber, into one of the motel cabins. When appellant produced his pistol and informed the attendant this was a “stick-up”, Fawber began to shout. Appellant struck Fawber on the head with his pistol three times; the weapon discharged on the third blow. The bullet penetrated Fawber’s skull and caused his death.</p>

On July 22, in the presence of several police officers and a stenographer, the co-conspirators’ inculpatory statements were read to Smith. He corrected these statements by disagreeing with certain parts and by summarizing his version of the three robberies, including the shooting of David Fawber, which appellant described as an accident. This statement was introduced at trial by means of the stenographer testifying from her original notes. Smith’s trial testimony covered 119 pages in the typewritten transcript. In it he repeated in considerably greater detail substantially everything contained in his prior oral statement.</p>

Maroney, </em><a href="/us/399/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="399 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6168334" data-case-paths="/us/399/0042-01">399 U.S. 42</a>, <a href="/us/399/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="399 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6168334" data-case-paths="/us/399/0042-01">26 L. Ed. 2d 419</a> (1970). A warrantless search of an automobile can be made even though not “incident to arrest”, “provided that there is probable cause to believe that the car contains articles that the officers are entitled to seize.” <em>Id., </em>p. 48, <a href="/us/399/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="399 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6168334" data-case-paths="/us/399/0042-01">26 L.

Since, however, the record before us is not altogether clear as to whether the appellant was originally arrested for the felony murder committed in Harrisburg or in connection with the disappearance of the automobile in which Smith was traveling, it is not here possible to apply the above test; a stolen car offense would not be likely to have given the officers any belief that the car contained articles they were entitled to seize. This inconclusiveness, however, docs not help appellant, for if it be assumed that probable cause was not present to justify the search of the car, it is clear on this record that the admission into evidence of the clip and bullets was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Chapman v. California, </em><a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. 18</a>, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">17 L.

Not only did the Commonwealth have in its case the confession of the appellant and the loaded murder weapon seized from his person, but it also had eyewitness testimony identifying Smith as the gunman at the scene of the two previous robberies and as being one of the two men who were escorted to the cabins by Mr. Fawber shortly before his death.

What kind or manner of a man was this? He says that they did not have those hacksaws down in Tennessee. If you believe that they did, that might throw some light on what kind of a man this was and what kind of men he associated with. In other words, did they arm themselves down in Tennessee? Did they conceal upon themselves those hacksaw blades with the intention of coming north and getting prepared for escape in case they were apprehended? Now, you will have to decide how that is <em>with respect to the penalty, if you come to the point where you determine it is murder in the first </em>degree.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
