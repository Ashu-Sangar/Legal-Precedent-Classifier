During the early evening of June 30, 1967, one Robert Whitaker, the deceased, left the residence of a friend he was visiting and proceeded to a bar at the corner of 20th Street and Susquehanna Avenue in Philadelphia. At that corner he became involved in a fight with a James Williams, and Williams called for help from his friends (the “Alkey Gang”). Approximately eight men jumped on the deceased and began beating him. There was eyewitness testimony that appellant was among those striking Robert Whitaker. During the fight, Whitaker was stabbed several times by a Charles Leftenant and was hit in the head with a stick by a James Hill. He died at approximately 12:05 a.m. on <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>July 1, 1967, from multiple stab wounds to the body.

He contends that the custodial confession he made was involuntary, that the suppression court improperly placed the burden of proof on him to show that the confession was not given voluntarily and that the suppression judge erred in allowing the text of the confession to be read into the record. Appellant next argues that the trial court improperly permitted the Commonwealth to introduce evidence of the corpus delicti after the prosecution had stated that its next witnesses would testify as to the confession and appellant had objected to introduction of evidence of the confession because the corpus delicti had not been proven. Error is further asserted in that the trial court allowed the written confession to go out with the jury. Lastly, appellant argues that the felony murder doctrine should have been totally excluded from the case because the person who inflicted the fatal wound to the deceased was adjudged guilty only of second degree murder.</p>

It is highly unlikely that the defendant or his friends could remember the names of the officers who allegedly mistreated them on prior occasions, and the prosecution would thus have little chance of rebutting such testimony.

The whole basis for having the judge and not the jury hear motions to suppress evidence is the belief that the judge, trained in the law and aware of the policies behind exclusion of unconstitutionally obtained evidence, will be able to rule on the questions of law without being influenced because of having knowledge of the evidence which is sought to be suppressed. Certainly, when the motion to suppress is based on an alleged violation of the Fourth (and Fourteenth) Amendment, the suppression court is fully aware of the evidence in question. We see no difference, for this purpose, between motions alleging violations of the Fourth (and Fourteenth) Amendment and those alleging violations of the Fifth (and Fourteenth) Amendment. It is within the suppres<a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>sion court’s discretion to determine whether it wants to hear the text of the confession, and the record in this case gives no indication that the court’s ruling on voluntariness was influenced in any respect by a belief that the confession was true.

After a number of witnesses had been called by the prosecution, the district attorney, in response to a question by appellant’s lawyer, stated that after his next witness he would proceed immediately to introduce the confession into evidence. Appellant then objected to the admissibility of the confession on the ground that the corpus delicti had not been established.

Rule 1114 states: “Upon retiring for deliberations, the jury may take with it such exhibits as the trial judge deems proper. The jury shall not be permitted to have a transcript of any trial testimony nor a copy of the indictment.” Appellant’s position is that since the confession had been read aloud by a prosecution witness it had thereby become part of the trial transcript and therefore the trial judge had no power to send it out with the jury.</p>

It does grant the court discretion with respect to exhibits. There is no question that appellant’s confession was physically identified and received as an exhibit. The question is whether it somehow lost that status when it was read aloud to the jury and was thereby incorporated into the transcript. Merely to state the question is to answer it. The confession could not lose the status of an exhibit merely by being read aloud because in no sense had anything happened to change its character. If appellant’s position were to prevail, all exhibits consisting of written words, e.g., letters, deeds, wills and statements of various kinds, including confessions, would have to be read by each juror silently to himself in order for them to retain their character as exhibits. Such a procedure would be both time consuming and inefficient, and of no discernible aid to maintaining the integrity of the fact-finding process.</p>

First, appellant has not shown that he suffered any prejudice from the court’s refusal to eliminate the felony-murder doctrine from the jury’s consideration. Appellant was convicted of second degree murder and thus was convicted of a crime no higher than that of which Leftenant, the person who administered the coup de grace, was convicted.</p>

Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §1105, as amended; 18 P.S. 5105. <em>Commonwealth v. Parmer, </em><a href="/pa/364/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="364 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1223544" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0011-01">364 Pa. 11</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.2d%20296" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="70 A.2d 296">70 A. 2d 296</a> (1950). He is therefore subject to the <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>same felony murder rule, involving as it does the possibility of a conviction of murder in the first degree, as are all other participants. What the trier of fact may have found in a separate trial of one of the other participants, including the actual stabber, is irrelevant in his trial. Thus a jury may find a defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter even in the absence of evidence of legal passion or provocation, provided the evidence would have supported a murder conviction. <em>Commonwealth v. Hoffman, </em><a href="/pa/439/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="439 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1930989" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0348-01">439 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20726" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="266 A.2d 726">266 A. 2d 726</a> (1970); <em>Commonwealth v.

Likewise, a trier of fact can find an actual murderer guilty of something less than first degree murder although the evidence would have supported such a verdict. Mitigating factors too numerous to catalogue may be present in one case, and not in another. Even if the fact-finders were called to testify in one case as to why they found as they did in another, public policy considerations would require rejection of such proof. <em>Commonwealth v.
