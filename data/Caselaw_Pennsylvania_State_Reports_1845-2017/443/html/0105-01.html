It is uncontradicted that attorney Sheeler, in order to toll the running of the statute of limitations, called and informed Mr. Oates that he was filing a writ of summons and the reason therefor, which was certainly an indication the possibility of settlement had not been then foreclosed. Although denied by Dr. Kraynick, the minor plaintiff’s father, there is evidence that Dr. Kraynick, in August, 1969, telephoned Oates to inform him of attorney Sheeler’s death and that he, Dr. Kraynick, would notify Oates when he secured new counsel. In attorney Sheeler’s file there was reference to the fact of the existence of the insurance carrier and its name, yet the new counsel, for some unexplained reason, failed to communicate concerning the case with the insurance carrier. Further, there was testimony by Oates that on January 28, 1970 — eight days prior to the expiration of the time for entering an appearance or filing an answer — Oates called Kraynicks’ new counsel, found that he was not in the office and left word at the office that he had called but Oates received no return call; the record contains evidence by the secretary for Kraynicks’ new counsel that she had no recollection of any such call on January 28, 1970, although she did recall <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>Oates’ call on February 9, 1970, at which time he first learned of the entry of a default judgment.</p>

In that case, the notice to plead was in small letters and the defendant who suffered the default judgment had only a ninth-grade education and was not represented by counsel. In the present case, notice to plead was in normal-sized type and Mr. Oates admitted that he knew the significance of the complaint, the significance of the 20-day <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>time period, and understood the warning that a default judgment would be entered.</p>

    <p id="b225-7" data-blocks='[["BL_225.9",225,[146,1282,1153,589]]]'>My reading of the record satisfies me of the correctness of the lower court’s conclusion that this is “a clear case of inattention not excused or accounted for.” This absence of excuse is, in my view, confirmed rather than dispelled by the frank admission in appellant’s brief that this is “one of the unfortunate situations that arise in the law because of the crush of increased business activity and the overcrowding of the world.” I am unable to find that the court below in any way abused its discretion (or blunted its conscience) in refusing to open the judgment.</p>
