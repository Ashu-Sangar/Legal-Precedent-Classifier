Briefly summarized, we affirmed the entry of judgment by the Chester County Court of Common Pleas in favor of Norina G. Burbage, administratrix of the estate of Edward Burbage, against the Boiler Engineering and Supply Company, Inc. (Boiler), and in favor of Boiler against General Controls, Inc. (General) for indemnification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> In accordance with our opinion, indemnification payments were made on the <em>judgment.</em>

Subsequently, Boiler filed a complaint against General for indemnification of reasonable counsel fees and costs. In its answer and new matter, which was admitted, General averred that Boiler’s insurance carrier was obliged by the terms of its policy of insurance to provide a defense and that counsel fees and costs had been paid by the insurance carrier. A motion for judgment on the pleadings was interposed by General and judgment was entered in General’s favor after oral argument. This appeal followed.</p>

      <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>This specific question was resolved in the negative by the Superior Court over twenty years ago in <em>Rohm &amp; Haas Co. v. Lessner, </em><a href="/pa-super/168/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="168 Pa. Super. 242" data-case-ids="471880" data-case-paths="/pa-super/168/0242-01">168 Pa.

In <em>Rohm &amp; Haas, </em>the defendant contracted to install a boiler for the plaintiff and agreed to “hold harmless” the plaintiff for any injuries negligently occasioned by the defendant. A third person was injured and brought suit against the plaintiff. After the defendant refused to undertake the defense of this third person’s claim, plaintiff’s insurance carrier, obliged to defend the plaintiff under the policy, undertook the defense and was successful. A subsequent assumpsit action to recover costs and fees was then instituted by the plaintiff to recover this amount. Recognizing that the insurance carrier was the real party in interest, as is the situation in the case at bar, and that the nominal plaintiff suffered no pecuniary loss, the Superior Court held that the plaintiff had “no cause of action either on its own account or on behalf of its insurer by equitable subrogation.” <a href="/pa-super/168/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="168 Pa.

Just as that plaintiff was entitled to be “held harmless” under his contract, so is Boiler, under our prior decision, entitled to indemnification. <a href="/pa/433/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="433 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="1921011" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0319-01">433 Pa. at 326-27</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=249%20A.2d%20563" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="249 A.2d 563">249 A. 2d at 567</a>. Similarly, the insurance carriers for that plaintiff and Boiler defended and paid counsel fees and costs so that neither Boiler nor that plaintiff suffered any pecuniary loss. Accordingly, the court below, bound by the principle of <em>stave decisis, </em>concluded that Boiler could not recover.</p>

This argument was presented and rejected in both <em>Les-mark </em>and <em>Safway. </em>As well stated in <em>Safway: </em>“It is difficult to find a distinction between subrogation to the right to recover the amount of the judgment which was paid by another, and subrogation of the right to recover fees. In both instances the insured has paid nothing, thus the argument that payment by indemnitee is required is of little force. The fact that [Boiler] had a liability on the judgment ... is a technical one and not a real nor actual liability. It is not a practical basis to distinguish between the judgment and the fees.” <a href="/f2d/343/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="343 F.2d 129" data-case-ids="872366" data-case-paths="/f2d/343/0129-01">343 F. 2d at 135</a>.
