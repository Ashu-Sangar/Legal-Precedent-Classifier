In 1968, appellant petitioned for post-conviction relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), requesting that his sentence be modi<a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>fied or set aside for reasons •which will be considered in this opinion. The order denying that petition, entered on October 11, 1968, is assigned for error on this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.4",388,[208,553,1158,1091]]]'>Back in 1956, appellant had entered pleas of guilty to robbery charges and was sentenced to serve 5 to 10 years in prison. He was paroled in 1960. In May of 1963 he was arrested and confined on the murder charges which as we have noted were disposed of on his plea of guilty in 1965. Before entering upon his new sentence on this murder conviction, he was required to serve the five years remaining on the 1956 robbery conviction. In November of 1966, appellant filed a PCHA petition seeldng to have his robbery sentence set aside. The petition was denied, but the Superior Court reversed, directing that a hearing be held to determine the validity of the appellant’s allegations. <a href="/pa-super/210/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="210 Pa.

The appellant then promptly filed an Application for Dismissal pursuant to Buies 314 and 316 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, a hearing was held and the 1956 robbery charges were dismissed on January 3, 1968.</p>

The motion was denied and appellant then filed this PCHA petition requesting that his 10 to 20 year sentence for second degree murder be set aside or modified. The gravamen of the petition is that the court, in imposing the murder sentence, had before it and considered appellant’s prior robbery conviction in determining the sentence to be imposed and, therefore, since that conviction no longer stands, appellant is entitled to reconsideration of the remaining murder sen<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>tence without regard to the rohhery conviction. The PCHA court dismissed this petition without a hearing, stating that the robbery conviction in no way affected the term of sentence imposed on the murder charge.</p>

Minnick, </em>supra, at 46. Here, it is obvious that appellant’s contentions amount to no more than an attack upon the validity of the sentence on the ground that its severity is based upon a prior invalid conviction.

The same court sat as the PCHA court on this petition and denied it, stating that the circumstances of the crime and not the prior conviction motivated the imposition of the maximum sentence.
