Moreover, the appeal papers in the Superior Court Prothonotary’s office, Eastern District, also indicate an appeal was only taken from No. 772, December Term, 1965. Accordingly, we need not consider No. 771. <em>Cf. Com. v. Wade, </em><a href="/pa-super/156/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="156 Pa.

However, it appears to us, after a further review of the appeal forms in the Superior Court Prothonotary’s office, that appeUant’s counsel, the Defender Association of Philadelphia, completed the form except for the caption, allowing a third party, perhaps the appellant, to fill in the judgment of sentence from which the appeal was taken, which failed to note No. 771. This initial mistake was perpetuated both in the aUocatur petition presented to this Court as well as the later docket entry in the Supreme Court Prothonotary’s office. In light of the fact that appellant is untrained in the law, we have corrected the docket entry <em>sua sponte </em>and addressed the issues presented in No. 771 rather than prejudice the appellant. Nonetheless, we cannot condone this haphazard, sloppy practice by the Public Defenders.</p>
