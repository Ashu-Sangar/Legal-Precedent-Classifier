L. 1257, as amended, 53 P.S. §6901 et seq. (Supp. 1971) (hereinafter “the Act” or “the Enabling Act”) enacted Ordinance No. 675 of 1968, known as the Business Privilege Tax Ordinance, imposing a tax upon the privilege of engaging in business in the City of Pittsburgh. This tax is measured by the gross receipts of a business and is assessed at the rate of six mills per dollar of volume of gross annual receipts. The appellants, a group of domestic and foreign corporations engaged in the contracting and construction industry, filed a complaint in equity attacking the validity of the ordinance and seeking to have the City and its officials enjoined from collecting the tax. The chancellor found the tax ordinance to be valid and applicable to the appellants; after exceptions his decree was affirmed and made final by the court <em>en banc. </em>This appeal followed.</p>

The 1947 Act represented a legislative grant of power to the municipalities to tax anything except in those areas specifically forbidden by statute. See <em>Rose Twp. v.

Clearly, the 1965 reenactment represents a similar grant of power, for Section 3 of the 1965 Act declares, in the same language as the 1947 Act, that: “It is the intention of this section to confer upon such political subdivision the power to levy, assess and collect taxes upon any and all subjects of taxation, except as above restricted and limited, which the Commonwealth has power to tax but which it does not tax or license, . . .” Despite the above quoted language, appellants assert that a municipality may not provide for a business privilege tax because that particular tax is nowhere mentioned in the Enabling Act. We cannot accept such a narrow interpretation. Section 2 of the Act generally states that municipalities may provide for taxes on “persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property.” <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>It then carves out certain exclusions from the broad grant. Nowhere is it stated that business privilege taxes are outside the range of the taxing powers granted.

See <em>Plymouth Lanes v. Plymouth Twp., </em><a href="/pa/415/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="415 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="1891826" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0206-01">415 Pa. 206</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=202%20A.2d%20811" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="202 A.2d 811">202 A. 2d 811</a> (1964). Clearly, carrying on a business such as that in which the appellants are engaged, namely the business of construction, involves much more than the use of the tangible property employed in the structures themselves. In order successfully to complete almost any project, a contractor must necessarily employ and supervise his own labor force, negotiate subcontracts, coordinate the supporting contractors and services, comply with the restrictions and conditions imposed by government regulatory authorities, and perform miscellaneous other functions. It is only in the very rare case where the business itself consists only of the use of tangible property already being taxed by the state, and where the tax is measured by the amount of such property being used, that under similar provisions of earlier enabling statutes we have invalidated a tax on the theory appellants assert.

Subsequent to the <em>National Biscuit </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>however, this Court held, in <em>Commonwealth v.

The incidence of a tax embraces the subject matter thereof and, more important, the measure of the tax, i.e., the base or yardstick by which the tax is applied.” <em>Id. </em>at 652. Applying this test we find the contested ordinance is not duplicative of the corporate franchise tax (nor, for that matter, any others of the pertinent state taxes) because it does not tax the same subject matter, nor is it measured by the same tax base. As the Court expressly held in the closely similar case of <em>Federal Drug Co. v.

It is not a tax limited to foreign corporate associations. In the second place, while in each case the <em>object </em>of the tax is to license for the purpose of doing business, the tax actually <em>imposed </em>by the Foreign Corporate Franchise Tax is measured by the value of <em>the property of the foreign corporation within the state. </em>In the Pittsburgh ordinances the tax is on the <em>gross volume </em>of business conducted by the taxpayer. The respective impacts of the two taxes are on a totally different basis.” See also <em>Blauner's Inc. v.

    <p id="b471-3" data-blocks='[["BL_471.4",471,[169,890,1161,1024]]]'>(4) A further contention of the taxpayers is that the Business Privilege Tax is merely an attempted expansion of the Mercantile License Tax (Ordinance No. 488) and as such should be subject to the maximum rate limitations specified for mercantile license taxes by Section 8(2) of the Act (i.e., one mill on each dollar of volume of business of a wholesaler and two mills on each dollar of volume of business of a retailer). While the ordinance here involved does tax the privilege of engaging in business, it is in no way limited, as is the mercantile tax, to the transactions of merchants who sell at wholesale or retail; its scope, subject to the exclusions, reaches all persons engaged in any business in the City of Pittsburgh. To the extent, however, that the Business Privilege Tax can be considered an extension of the mercantile tax, it does not exceed the limits of the Enabling Act because, as stated above, retailers are taxed at two mills and wholesalers at one mill, just as the Act requires.</p>

H. Martin Co. v. Sharpsburg Borough, </em><a href="/pa/376/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="376 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1246216" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0242-01">376 Pa. 242</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20A.2d%20125" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="102 A.2d 125">102 A. 2d 125</a> (1954), namely, that there is no unlawful delegation in allowing a city officer to enforce and administer a taxing statute complete on its face, so long as the regulations issued by that officer are merely in aid and explanation of the ordinance. We are not persuaded that the duties assigned to the treasurer or the regulations issued by him transgress this limitation.</p>

By definition, the tax imposed by the City is not an income tax, but rather a tax on a privilege which is measured by the gross receipts collected from conducting a business and <em>not </em>by the amount of profit made by the taxpayer.</p>

      <p id="b466-5" data-blocks='[["BL_466.5",466,[226,1378,1148,717]]]'> The appellants contend that the Iiocal Tax Enabling Act, <em>supra, </em>should be construed as granting to municipalities the power to enact only those taxes as to which specific rate limitations have been provided by the Act. In support of this interpretation they point to the title of the Act, which refers to authority to a city to levy, assess and collect “certain taxes subject to maximum limitations for general revenue purposes.” See Section 8 of the Act, 53 P.S. §6908 (Supp. 1971) for specific rate limitations imposed in certain areas of taxation and Section 17 of the Act, 53 P.S. §6917 (Supp. 1971) for a limitation on the aggregate amount of taxation which may be imposed under authority of the Act. Nowhere does the title indicate, nor do we interpret it to mean, that a municipality is restricted to levying those taxes upon which specific rate limits are placed. Indeed such an interpretation, aside from being unreasonable, would be a contradiction of the clear text of Sections 2 and 3 of the Act, quoted above.</p>
