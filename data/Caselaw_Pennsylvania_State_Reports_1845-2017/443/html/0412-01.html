The primary question raised on appeal is whether the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to cross-examine its own witness for the purpose of impeachment.</p>
    <p id="b525-9" data-blocks='[["BL_525.16",525,[149,1628,1150,706]],["BL_526.1",526,[206,325,1153,316]]]'>The Commonwealth’s witness, one Elmer Troup, testified to a shotgun battle between appellant and the deceased victim. In the course of his direct examination he stated that he did not know whether the appellant had cocked the hammer of the gun before he went in the direction of the deceased. The Commonwealth pleaded surprise to this testimony on the ground that the witness had given pretrial statements which indicated that appellant had cocked the gun, and requested permission to cross-examine the witness. In support of its request, the Commonwealth claimed that the testimony was significant to proving its case of murder in that an inference of premeditation could be <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>drawn from the fact of a cocked gun. After examining the witness’ pretrial statements, the trial court concluded that the witness had categorically stated therein that he had seen the appellant cock the gun before moving toward the deceased, and accordingly allowed the Commonwealth to cross-examine.</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[205,658,1152,484]]]'>In the course of the Commonwealth’s cross-examination of Troup, the witness’ pretrial statements were read to him and thus placed before the jury. The defense, in its cross-examination of Troup, developed that at the time he gave his statements to the investigating officer Troup was “a little shook” over the incident and, further, that his statement on direct examination that he wasn’t sure whether or not the gun was cocked was the truth.</p>

As the lower court noted in its opinion, appellant was not harmed by the cross-examination since the witness continued to adhere to his trial statements that he was unsure whether appellant had cocked the gun. Moreover, when it convicted appellant of voluntary manslaughter rather than of murder, the jury apparently rejected any inference of deliberateness <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>and premeditation which could have been drawn from the pretrial statements.</p>
    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[212,447,1153,489]]]'>Appellant contends, however, that he was prejudiced by the admission of Troup’s pretrial statements because without them there would have been insufficient evidence upon which to submit a charge of murder to the jury. This charge, according to appellant, placed the jurors in a position of possibly compromising their views between the major charge of murder and the antithetical verdict of not guilty by returning the verdict of voluntary manslaughter.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[209,946,1154,760]]]'>We cannot, however, accept the premise of appellant’s argument, and therefore do not reach its merits. A study of the record convinces us that, quite apart from Troup’s pretrial statements, there <em>was </em>sufficient evidence introduced to justify the trial judge in charging on murder. The evidence showed, in brief, that appellant, upon hearing that the deceased had threatened his life, procured his shotgun; approached by a circuitous route through the woods the house where the deceased was standing armed on the porch; called to the deceased to drop his gun; and when the deceased, in true western fashion, responded “No, it’s either me or you now” and fired his gun, returned the fire, with fatal result.</p>
