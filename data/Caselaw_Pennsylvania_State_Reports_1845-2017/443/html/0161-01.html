(“Rittenhouse”), whose building in Philadelphia was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1962. Two contracts of insurance had been issued, one in the face amount of $230,000, and the other in the amount of $68,500. After a nonjury trial, the court below held (1) that the larger policy was in force and effect on the date of the loss, and that the defendant insurers were liable thereon, and (2) that the smaller policy was not in force or effect on the date of the loss, and that the insurers were not liable thereon. A verdict was entered accordingly. Exceptions to findings and conclusions were filed by both parties, and in all material respects were dismissed by the court <em>en banc, </em>one judge dissenting. Both parties have appealed.</p>

In essential respects they are as follows: Rittenhouse was required under the terms of a purchase money mortgage covering the premises in question to maintain fire insurance in the aggregate face amount of $350,000. In partial discharge of this undertaking it purchased, effective June 27, 1961, $60,000 of insurance from Insurance Company of North America (“I.N.A.”), $30,000 from Fidelity Phenix Insurance Company (“FidelityPhenix”) and $30,000 from Newark Insurance Com<a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>pany (“Newark”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The balance of $230,000 was sought and obtained from underwriters at Lloyd’s, the underwriting being evidenced by two “cover notes” issued by Stewart, Smith (Pennsylvania) Inc. (“Stewart, Smith”), brokers for Lloyd’s.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Of paramount importance in the matter before us is the following language contained in both cover notes issued to Rittenhouse by Lloyd’s: “Warranted same terms and conditions as and to follow the settlements of Insurance Company of North America,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and that said company has, at the time <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>of any loss, and at the same gross rate, at least $60,000 (subject only to reduction by amount of any loss not reinstated) on the identical subject matter and risk, and in identically the same proportion on each separate part thereof. This policy is subject without notice to the same conditions, endorsements, assignments and alterations of rates as are, or may be assumed in the above-mentioned Company’s Insurance upon which this policy is based and shall be deemed to include such risks of Lightning and/or Explosion as are included in that Insurance.” For ease of reference these two paragraphs will be referred to as the “warranty clause”.</p>
    <p id="b277-3" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[164,1004,1149,1027]]]'>Early in April, 1962, Rittenhouse’s agent was advised that INA proposed to cancel its $60,000 policy. Since INA was Lloyd’s “warranty company”, the Rittenhouse agent promptly requested the broker, Stewart, Smith, to have Fidelity Phenix or Newark substituted as the warranty insurance company. At this time it was recognized in conversation between the broker and Rittenhouse’s representative that INA’s cancellation would immediately result in Lloyd’s being off the risk if no substitute warranty company were secured. Lloyd’s notified Stewart, Smith by cable that they wished to follow INA and therefore considered themselves off the risk as of April 5, 1962.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> By formal written notice received by Rittenhouse on May 22, 1962, INA cancelled its policy, effective June 2, 1962. Lloyd’s never gave written notice of cancellation to Rittenhouse, the only evidence of their intention being the above mentioned cable to the broker, Stewart, Smith; neither did they tender a return of premium.</p>

    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[206,460,1155,810]]]'>Three days later, on July 10, 1962, two new cover notes totaling $68,500 were issued to Eittenhouse by Stewart, Smith on behalf of a second underwriting group at Lloyd’s (hereinafter “Lloyd’s Group II”). These cover notes stated the effective dates of coverage to be from April 5, 1962 to April 5, 1963 and designated Fidelity-Phenix (instead of INA) as the underlying warranty company, said company to have at least $30,000 coverage on the same subject matter and risk a the time of any loss. In all other respects the Lloyd’s Group II cover notes were identical to those issued by the original Lloyd’s group. On the face of these notes a space entitled “Previous No.” was completed with the numbers of the cover notes issued by the original Lloyd’s underwriters.</p>
    <p id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[206,1282,1155,756]]]'>Eittenhouse contends that Lloyd’s are bound because they never cancelled their insurance by any notice to Eittenhouse, that the cancellation of the INA policy did not automatically terminate Lloyd’s commitment under their original cover notes, and that the issuance of the Lloyd’s Group II policy (cover notes) was not an effective replacement of or substitution for their original undertaking. Lloyd’s argument, in brief, is that its original cover notes were conditioned upon coverage of at least $60,000 by INA at the time of the loss, and that the cancellation of the INA policy prior to the loss automatically terminated Lloyd’s liability on its original cover notes. We agree with Lloyd’s position, and are therefore constrained to reverse.</p>
    <p id="b278-6" data-blocks='[["BL_278.6",278,[206,2047,1155,318]],["BL_279.1",279,[160,338,1157,1354]]]'>The resolution of this dispute lies in the interpretation of the warranty clause in the Lloyd’s cover notes; specifically the following language: “Warranted same terms and conditions as and to follow the settlements of INSUEANCE Compant op Noeth Ameeica, and that said company has at the time of any loss, ... at least <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>$60,000 ... on the same identical subject matter and risk. . . .” This mode of expression is undoubtedly telegraphic, but it is clear and unambiguous as far as the problem before us is concerned. The Lloyd’s undertaking to the insured, not evidenced by any separate Lloyd’s policy, was completely “geared into” co-insurance furnished by INA which the application to Lloyd’s had designated as the “warranty company”. That undertaking was to be on the same terms and conditions as the insurance issued by INA; settlement by Lloyd’s of any claim was to be on the same basis as an INA settlement; and insurance issued by INA in the sum of at least $60,000 on the same subject matter and risk was required to be in existence at the time of any loss. The latter requirement was clearly a condition precedent to any liability on Lloyd’s part; indeed the preceding two aspects of the Lloyd’s insurance — those relating to terms and to settlement — were meaningless without the existing of the INA policy to which they refer. Since the condition precedent was admittedly not met, there could be no liability on the part of Lloyd’s. The fact that it gave no independent notice of cancellation to Rittenhouse or its authorized agent is immaterial; it was automatically off the risk pursuant to the INA notice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

A case substantially the same as that at bar is <em>National Factors, Inc. v. Holford, </em><a href="/ad2d/27/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="27 A.D.2d 377" data-case-ids="5540590" data-case-paths="/ad2d/27/0377-01">27 App. Div. 2d 377</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20N.Y.S.2d%20470" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="279 N.Y.S.2d 470">279 N.Y.S. 2d 470</a> (1967). There, as here, the lead company cancelled; there, as here, Lloyd’s terminated its co-insurance, but no notice thereof was conveyed to the insured. The court held that the Lloyd’s policy “became inoperative and void by its own terms”. The requirement of the continued maintenance of the underlying co-insurance was held to be “reasonable, consistent, a condition precedent, not antagonistic to the mortgage clause. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b280-3" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[200,995,1151,810]]]'>The enforceability of the clause was similarly upheld in <em>Romanos v. Home Ins.

In that case want of diligence in presenting a claim of loss was held to bar recovery against the primary carrier, and by the same token to relieve Lloyd’s of liability. Relying on the decisions in <em>Barnard v. Faber, </em>1 Q.B. 340 (1892) and <em>Beauchamp v. Faber, </em>14 T.L.R. 544 (1898), the court held that the purpose of the warranty clause was to require concurrency of coverage, and that compliance with the warranty was a condition precedent to recovery.

As Williston observes, “[a] contract of insurance is normally a unilateral contract . . . most of the so-called warranties in insurance policies are not even promises in form, but are conditions. The use of the word ‘warranty’, therefore, in insurance law is a misnomer.

When a ship was to go to sea, it was the custom of the time for persons who desired insurance to pass among those present in the coffee house a slip giving the information as to the ship, crew, cargo, owner and the contemplated voyage. Any one interested and responsible would then -write underneath the slip the amount for which he was willing to be liable to the insured, and would initial it. When the amount desired was obtained, the contract was complete. The name ‘underwriters’ was applied to insurers by reason of the methods thus employed.
