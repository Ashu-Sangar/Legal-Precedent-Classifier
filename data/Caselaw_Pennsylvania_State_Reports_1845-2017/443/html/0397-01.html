Emhart <em>Manufacturing </em>Company was originally a business corporation organized under the laws of Delaware in 1922 for the purpose of manufacturing glass-making and packaging machinery and equipment. Its plant and principal office were located in Connecticut, and from the time of its incorporation until June 30, 1964, the date of its merger with appellant, it owned no offices or plants in Pennsylvania.</p>

In 1935, Emhart <em>Manufacturing </em>Company incorporated Plax Corporation in Delaware to develop inventions of the Fernplas Corporation, another Delaware corporation. Emhart <em>Manufacturing </em>eventually acquired Fernplas for cash and liquidated it into itself, thereby gaining title to any patents owned by Fernplas. Plax continued to develop machinery and to manufacture plastic products. Its home office and plant were located in Connecticut.</p>
    <p id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[124,892,1151,528]]]'>In 1953, Emhart <em>Manufacturing </em>sold one-half of the stock of Plax to Owens-Illinois Glass Company. In 1957, Owens-Illinois in turn transferred its one-half interest in Plax to Monsanto Chemical Company in exchange for Monsanto stock. In 1962, Monsanto acquired the remaining one-half of Plax stock from Em-hart <em>Manufacturing </em>in exchange for Monsanto stock. As a result of these transactions, Emhart <em>Manufacturing </em>acquired a total of 308,219 shares of Monsanto common stock.</p>

The largest block of stock, which amounted to approximately 42 percent of that outstanding on appellant’s books, had been held by Glen Alden.</p>

In computing the income to be allocated to Pennsylvania on the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax report, appellant excluded the capital gain derived from the Monsanto stock sale. Its return discloses a net income to be allocated of $5,740,012. On the other hand, the Commonwealth’s original settlement of appellant’s Corporate Net Income Tax for that year shows a net income to be allocated of $19,892,697. The difference of $14,152,685 consists of the $13,637,858 capital gain on the sale of Monsanto stock and the $514,827 of subpart F income and taxes discussed in a separate portion of this opinion.</p>

Appellant then petitioned for review before the Board of Finance and Review, which was also refused. Emhart next appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Commonwealth Docket). After an original appeal bond was filed, the matter was tried before the court en banc upon a stipulation of facts and agreement to try without a jury. On January 2, 1970, the court denied relief in a per <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>curiam order. Appeal was taken to our Court. Pursuant to Rule 63 of our Rules, The Dauphin County Court (Swope, P. J.) filed an opinion on May 26, 1970, indicating its reasons for the issuance of its January 2, 1970 order.</p>

ACF Industries, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/441/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="441 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1933918" data-case-paths="/pa/441/0129-01">441 Pa. 129</a>, 135, <a href="/citations/?q=271%20A.2d%20273" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="271 A.2d 273">271 A. 2d 273</a>, 276 (1970). Appellant admits that its numerous divisions and foreign and domestic subsidiaries were treated as a unitary business enterprise for corporate net income tax purposes. Hence, the instant case is unlike <em>Commonwealth v. Columbia Gas &amp; Electric Corporation, </em><a href="/pa/336/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="336 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1195631" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0209-01">336 Pa. 209</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 A.2d 404">8 A. 2d 404</a> (1939), where the Court concluded that the taxpayer was engaged in a multiform business, and only that portion of the business conducted in Pennsylvania could be considered for tax purposes.

The proper standard to be utilized in evaluating whether a taxpayer has satisfied his burden as to an unrelated asset is to determine if there is clear evidence that the asset is not <em>“ </em>‘a necessary part of the corporate activity’.” <em>Commonwealth v. The Mundy Corporation, </em><a href="/pa/346/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="346 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1216502" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0482-01">346 Pa. 482</a>, 484, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20A.2d%20878" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="30 A.2d 878">30 A. 2d 878</a>, 879 (1943); accord, <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[207,968,1147,581]]]'>An analysis of the transaction reveals that it was more than a capital restructuring designed to increase shareholder equity in Emhart by means of a purchase and cancellation of its issued and outstanding shares— a view urged by appellant. As a result of the merger, Emhart acquired, inter alia, the Monsanto stock and the $30,000,000 indebtedness. The latter became an item of general indebtedness for appellant, which was concededly a corporation engaged in a unified business enterprise in furtherance of its corporate development both within and outside of this Commonwealth.</p>

Furthermore, as the trial court stressed, appellant consented to a restriction on the use of the stock sale proceeds. A relationship was thus created between the stock and the debt, and the stock was in fact used to retire a portion of Emhart’s general indebtedness. We believe the capital gain proceeds from this sale contributed substantially to a scheme of corporate functioning <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>and the business potency of appellant, and accordingly should be considered in the determination of appellant’s income allocable to Pennsylvania.

Different tax consequences follow from the choice of any of the six types of reorganization set forth in Section 868(a) (1), and considerable tax planning is necessary to perceive the most desirable alternative in a given situation, for the federal statutory scheme relating to corporate reorganizations is as complex as any in the Code (or elsewhere).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The pertinent statutory language states that the deduction is allowed if the “. . . dividends are included in taxable income as returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government. . . .” Act of May 16, 1935, supra, 72 P.S. §3420b 1(b). It is therefore apparent that unless a dividend is reported to the Federal Government, it is not entitled to be deducted on the Pennsylvania return. Hence, if a corporation fails to take the deduction in the year it included the dividend in its federal return, it is unclear whether the corporation can ever take advantage of the deduction in a later year, for while the corporation will have “received” the dividend, it will not have included that sum in its federal return — a prerequisite for the deduction.</p>

That the state deduction also encompasses a 100% deduction when the dividends received are from certain foreign corporations does not alter our conclusion.

The statutory definition looks primarily to form, rather than substance, however, which is the weakness of appellant’s argument. The form of the reorganization is often crucial.

This, in turn, may depend on the form of the transaction, the amount and character of the consideration exchanged, and the change in the parties' legal and economic rola<a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>tionships to the properties involved and among themselves.” Bittker and Eustice, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders 507 (2d ed. 1966).</p>
