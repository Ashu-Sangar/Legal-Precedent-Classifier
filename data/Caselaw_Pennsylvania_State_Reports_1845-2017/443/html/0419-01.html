Fisher, the decedent. Appellee filed a petition for citation sur appeal from assessment of inheritance tax. The owner of the accounts, the widow of the decedent, and the daughter of the decedent all testified that the decedent had been unemployed and in ill health for a number of years during which time he had been supported by his wife and daughter. The court found that the accounts had been set up for convenience in order to enable decedent to withdraw money on behalf of the survivor, who had also been in ill health. The court further found that the decedent never deposited money, never claimed ownership, and never had access to the bank books, although the usual account cards were signed by both the decedent and his sister. Based on these facts, the court determined that the presumption of a prima facie gift inter vivos by the decedent’s sister <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>to the decedent had been overcome, and no part of the accounts was to be taxed as part of the decedent’s estate.</p>
