If the residue of the testator’s estate is well devised to them in trust, then this was right, otherwise the appeal by the next of kin should be sustained, for if as to the residue he died intestate, the administrator should have been selected from the next of kin.</p>

Although the objects of the testator’s bounty be not in being, yet if they belong to a class so designated by the testator that its members may be ascertained by means of the testator’s description, or, if he has given discretion to some person or body of persons to select them, the gift will be sustained: Witmán v. Lex, 17 S. &amp; R. 88. The relief of the poor appears among the ‘good and godly uses’ recited in the statute 1 Edw. VI. c. 14. ‘ To the poor of Stratford,’ was enough to carry the charitable gift of William Shakspeare to his townsfolk; and the poor of Eldred township, a definite municipality, is certain as words can make anything: Lawrence County v.

      <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>“ Now, is there any doubt as to the trustees designated by the testator? He has not given their correct corporate name, but he has used terms which describe them perfectly, and are applicable to no one else. They are by express provisions of the act incorporating them, ‘ the overseers of the poor’ in said (Warren) county. The words ‘ for the benefit of Eldred township,’ which the counsel for the appellant treat as part of the description of the trustees, are not so intended, but are plainly a repetition of the terms and purpose for which the overseers are to manage the property. It is true that this disposition will enure to the benefit of the taxpayers, but that is the effect of every benefaction which provides for any of the burdens of government; and it is also true that inasmuch as Eldred township is not a poor district, some complication may arise in the administration of this trust so as to limit its benefits to the inhabitants of Eldred township, but these difficulties cannot prevent the vesting of the estate, nor does it appear that they cannot be overcome, without the application of the doctrine of <em>cy fres. </em>But if they cannot, the power to apply it in cases in which the testator’s intent is clear and lawful is clearly possessed by the courts of this state, not only as part of their common law power, but by the express provisions of the statute law: Act of April 26,1855, sec. 10 (P. L. 331); act of May 26, 1876 (P.L. 211).</p>

R. 558, which from his ability and experience is entitled to great respect, I am not convinced that the act of 1885 (P. L. 259) was intended, or did in fact affect the power of the courts at all. The 10th section of the act of 1855 contains two provisions: That no disposition for charitable uses shall fail for certain defined defects, but that the same shall be carried into effect by the courts ‘ so far as the same can be ascertained and carried into effect, consistently with law and equity ; ’ and second, that such dispositions so far as they cannot be carried into effect shall be understood to be made subject to be disposed of by the legislature, and, failing such disposition, to go into the public treasury. The act of 1885 repeals the <em>ey pres </em>power thus assumed by the legislature which existed only in cases where the courts could not sustain the disposition, and directs that in such cases the estate shall <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>go to the heirs at law. The commissioners of the Rouse estate are a corporation expressly authorized to receive property by devise, and the purpose of their incorporation was to administer a similar charity. The testator’s will, though not elegantly expressed, is not ambiguous or doubtful, nor is his disposition illegal; but on the contrary it is highly meritorious — charitable in the broad and legal sense of the word. It is clearly our duty to sustain it.</p>
