That deed was to Greenwald and Kahn. Greenwald sold to Kahn his interest, which would be one half, by a deed of the 28d of November, 1874, and Kahn made a conveyance then to Kaufman on the 8th day of February, 1875; then Kaufman conveyed to Joseph Klee, by a deed of Oct. 25, 1877.</p>

It does not convey a title unless the party as whose property it was sold had the title; and, as there is no deed on record showing that Edward McQuaide ever had any title to these lots, and no evidence before us here that he ever had any title, that sheriff’s deed gave no title to these lots to Greenwald and Kahn.</p>

It must be exclusive ; not a part of the time having it in possession and a part of the time somebodj' else using it. It must be continuous for twenty-one years, and, as another adjective is used, notorious ; that is, the possession should be such that persons claiming any interest in the property, or anybody else, may see that these parties are in possession, and in possession in such a way that this possession may show that these parties claim it and own it; so that persons may see and know their possession. Now these are the essential elements to make a possession for twenty-one years, sufficient to give a person a title.</p>

Of course before such a statute was passed a man’s title was not cut up if he had been out of possession fifty years, but that often led to trouble ; deeds might be lost, and in various other ways a party in possession might not be able to prove his title; and for that reason, I say, the statute was passed, saying twenty-one years peaceable possession of property, claiming it as a man’s own, denying the title of any person else, in possession of it so that everybody could see it, exclusive^, nobody else having anything to do with it, would make a good title, and that is really the claim here of the defendant.</p>

It is not necessary, generally, in an action of ejectment, for the defendant to put in evidence his title, unless the plaintiff can make out a good title ; in that sense the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title. But where the plaintiff has a record title, a deed or series of deeds on record, that clearly gave him the title to the property, and the defendant sets up, in opposition to that, the claim of the statute of limitations, then the burden of proof is <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>on the defendant to prove that he has had possession of it in such a way and such a length of time as would give him a title.</p>

There is some evidence that he was ; yet the evidence on the part of the plaintiff is that he occupied these two lots from 1856, when J. R. Hasson got title from Robinson, until, perhaps, 1861 or 1862. Yet there is some evidence here that McQuaide used these two lots as a part of his cattle yard there; and there is some evidence that he had left there, or ceased to use them as a cattle yard, before this sheriff’s sale, in Januaiy of 1866. I do not think that is very material in this case, because the mere possession of McQuaide, if he had possession, has not been established here as a possession claiming title. He may have been a tenant or he may have been there by sufferance; there is no evidence that his possession was exclusive, and hostile to the plaintiff.</p>

Going hack, then, to Greenwald and Kahn, who got the sheriff’s deed in 1866, if Greenwald and Kahn, or those to whom they conveyed, had possession, claiming it and using it as I have indicated the kind of possession should be, for twenty-one years after that, that would give a good title to the defendant. Say that possession commenced at the date of the sheriff’s deed, — and, ordinarily, possession is not given at a sheriff’s sale on the date of the deed ; ordinarily it is after that some time, — but taking it as the date of that deed, if Greenwald and Kahn entered into possession in pursuance of that deed on the 25th day of January, 1866, claiming it as theirs, using it as theirs and continuing in possession (such a possession as I have indicated) for twenty-one years, they would have a good title.

At a sheriff’s sale in 1866 they acquired his title to or interest in them, and thereafter for a period of nineteen years they used them for “ droveyard purposes ” and paid all the taxes on them, including the assessments for municipal improvements. It is a circumstance worthy of note that while McQuaide, Greenwald and Kahn were living Hasson and Duff who owned the lots in 1856 offered no resistance to their possession or the possession of their successors in title. In December, 1892, Has-son conveyed his interest in them to his brother, the present plaintiff, who having obtained a deed from the heirs of Duff in January, 1893, leased them in April of that year to Winters. This was the first assertion by lease of the Hasson and Duff title, and it was obviously made to enable the plaintiffs to secure possession and compel the defendant to abandon his claim, or bring suit to enforce it. The evidence submitted on the trial afforded but slight ground, if any, for an inference that Greenwald and Kahn were at any time the tenants of Hasson and Duff, or that they paid the taxes for the use of the lots. The declaration testified to by Kraft as having been made to him by Hasson in 1865 was not sufficient to warrant it. That declaration, if made, was quite as consistent with a possession under McQuaide whose title Greenwald and Kahn acquired the next year as a possession under Hasson and Duff. Besides, an inference that the taxes were paid for the use of the lots was opposed to the admissions made on the trial, and to the testimony of J. R. Hasson the plaintiffs’ grantor. He testified distinctly that he paid all the taxes, directly, or advanced money <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>to another person to pay them. He so testified after the plaintiffs’ offer to prove by him a different state of facts was rejected. Furnishing money to a person to pay taxes is not a leasing of lots in consideration of the lessee’s agreement to pay the taxes upon them and keep them fenced. But the rejected offer furnished no basis for the verdict of the jury, or for instructions to them. It could rightly have no place in either.</p>
    <p id="b537-5" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[181,727,1171,1678]],["BL_538.1",538,[250,375,1160,1662]]]'>There was no evidence showing that McQuaide bought or leased the lots of Hasson and Duff, but there was evidence of his possession of them anterior to that of Greenwald and Kahn, and of their purchase of the lots at a judicial sale of them as his. The sale indicated that it was supposed by the creditors of McQuaide that he owned or had an interest in the lots and that such was the belief of Greenwald and Kahn is evidenced by their purchase of them. Their possession and payment of taxes and assessments for street improvements were therefore naturally referable to a claim by them of ownership of the lots on which the assessments were laid. But as it was not shown that McQuaide had title to the lots the purchasers took nothing by the sale, and the evidence of it .was valuable only as throwing light upon the nature and character of their claim and possession. The conditions under which the case was tried were not favorable to the ascertainment of the facts essential to a correct decision of it. The parties whose possession constituted the principal reliance of the defendant were dead and their death rendered the plaintiffs’ grantor incompetent to explain that possession. The litigants were therefore compelled to rely for their evidence, respecting the possession of the lots, upon the recollection of persons residing in the neighborhood of them. The evidence so obtained covered a period of thirty years and was somewhat conflicting. It was sufficient, however, to warrant the jury in finding a possession which clothed the defendant with title under the statute of limitations, and so the learned court below regarded it. Was it submitted to them with proper instructions? Whilst the attention of the jury was called to every possible phase of the plaintiffs’ contention it seems to us that the defendant’s case was not adequately-presented to them. From what was said in the charge respecting the declaration testified to by Kraft as having been made to him by Kahn in 1865, the jury may have inferred that the <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>declaration considered by itself was sufficient to justify them in finding that Greenwald and Kahn were then in possession of the lots under a lease from Hasson. For reasons already stated we think it could not be so regarded. We think, too, that the unqualified affirmance of the plaintiffs’ fourth point was misleading. By it the jury were told that if they believed Greenwald and Kahn were in possession of the lots by the permission, license or lease of Hasson and Duff, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. True, there was an offer to prove such a possession by the plaintiff’s grantor but he was adjudged incompetent for that purpose and the offer was rejected. If the learned court thought there was any evidence in the case sufficient to warrant such a belief the attention of the jury should have been directed to it, and they ought, under the circumstances, to have been advised that the rejected offer should have no place in their deliberations. In other words they should have been instructed that their belief must rest on the evidence in the case, uninfluenced by an offer of evidence which was excluded. The instructions in regard to the possession of McQuaide ignored the testimony of Trauerman and Meyers, which was to the effect that he had exclusive possession of the lots from 1860 to 1865, and that he was succeeded in that possession by Greenwald and Kahn, who maintained it for nineteen years. In the instructions respecting the possession of the latter there was no reference to the admission in regard to it, or to the admission of their payment of taxes. In the last paragraph of the general charge the jury were told that “ generally where there is a long- lease the property is taxed in the name of the tenant,” although there was no evidence in the case of such a practice. In short it appears to us that the tendency of the charge considered as a whole was to unduly depreciate the defendant’s claim, while giving to the plaintiffs’ contention all the prominence and consideration it deserved.</p>
