    <p class="summary" id="Aqjo" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[145,963,1169,805]]]'>“ The plaintiff shows a legal title by conveyances to a piece of land situate on the south side of Main street, in Tidioute, this county. This piece was conveyed by James T. Magee, to S. H. Evans, and B. T. Hopewell, in February, 1865; and a chain of title from these parties to the plaintiff is shown, and it is shown she is in the occupation of that piece of land. The defendants, Margaret Horn and her husband, were or are in the occupation of a piece of land adjoining on the west. And the real question is, where is the division line between these pieces of land, in the first place; and second, what are the rights of the respective parties in the strip between the two lots, which is claimed by the defendants to be an alley held in common for their common use. It appears that the plaintiff’s husband erected a gate across the end of this alley or lane, and that that was the gate which was torn down by the defendants; I believe also he built the fence which was torn down.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b393-11" data-blocks='[["BL_393.7",393,[142,1783,1171,655]],["BL_394.1",394,[280,416,1164,608]]]'>“ Now, the first question is to determine the limits of the defendants’ land, to know whether or not the acts complained of were committed within the lines of her land. Referring to the original deed from Magee, who is admitted to be the common source of title, that is to say, the man who at one time owned both of these pieces, from him the conveyances come from both sides, and therefore we go back to him. We have a deed from Magee to Evans and Hopewell, beginning at the northeast corner of land of Esther Goodrich. Thence south a given number of rods, thence east a given distance to other lands of the grantor, and then north to the road, and then west along the road to the place of beginning. The land of the grantor on the east is not designated so we can find its bound<a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>aries, therefore we cannot fix the eastern boundary of this land, except by the western, and we cannot fix the western unless we fix the eastern boundary of Esther Goodrich’s land. Therefore we are bound to search for the boundaries of Esther Goodrich’s. Esther Goodrich is shown by the evidence, without contradiction, to have occupied a piece of ground fronting on the same Main street, a part of the tract conveyed by Magee to Alger. Esther Goodrich claims under a Mrs. Washburn, by deed from her, and Mrs. Washburn traces her title to Madison Alger, who was shown to have occupied a portion of the ground, at least, at quite an early day, somewhere about 1850 perhaps.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[278,1032,1163,1101]]]'>“ The deed from James T. Magee was given in evidence, but its description is so indefinite that it is impossible to locate it by the deed. The only call in this deed, except the road, is the corner of blank lot, the tract not named, just simply a blank in the deed. It calls thereby for the land of the grantor somewhere probably, but whether it does or not, we are unable to find that tract. The evidence does not disclose to us any tract of land existing at that time as a separate piece that we can identify as the iand intended. It is impossible therefore from the calls in the deed, and the evidence showing the situation of affairs at the date of the deed to locate it, except that it must be somewhere on the south side of the Warren and Franklin turnpike at this place. But there is evidence, as I have said, that at the date of the deed to Hopewell' and Evans, Esther Goodrich was in occupation of a piece of ground, claiming, as I have said, under Madison Alger as the original owner. This was the eastern part of what had been claimed by Alger, and there is considerable evidence in the case tending to show where Alger claimed his lines to be, or those under him ; that is, a fence or other monuments erected along there, and especially of a fence on the eastern side of this piece claimed by Esther Goodrich.</p>

The building of a fence by one party without the consent of the other and its maintenance for a short time would not necessarily fix the line. We have no evidence, that I am aware of, of any actual concurrence of Magee and Mrs. Goodrich, or anybody before her in fixing that line, no evidence, I mean, that they came together at any specified time, and agreed upon any particular monument, or set anything to mark it, but there is evidence of a general character of what was done by the various parties and where they lived, and from all that you must determine, if you can, where Esther Goodrich’s line was in 1865, where it was marked upon the ground if it was so marked. If you should find that the line was fixed between Magee and Esther Goodrich, or between Magee and Mrs. Washburn, or between Magee and Madison Alger, the eastern line of the Alger claim fixed and agreed upon by any monument, that would be the line. I do not recall, I say to you, any evidence of that kind. I will not review the evidence. You have heard it commented on by counsel on both sides, and I have no doubt that you will be able to apply the law that I give you to the facts, and thus solve the difficulty.</p>

The same is true as to his answers to defendants’ points, recited in the remaining three specifications. The description in the deed of February 1865, from Magee, who is admitted to be the common source of title, is so vague and indefinite that it was necessary to resort to other evidence for the purpose of determining the' location of the dividing line between the lots, etc. It thus became a question of fact for the consideration of the jury, under all the testimony; and the case appears to have been submitted to them with substantially adequate and proper instructions.</p>
