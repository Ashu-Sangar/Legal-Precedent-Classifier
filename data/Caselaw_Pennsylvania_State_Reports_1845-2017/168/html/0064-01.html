The agreement was dated June 18,1892, and contained a stipulation “that said railway company shall construct and maintain a good and sufficient crossing over the right of way on said premises.” The railway company constructed its railway on the land, and before suit was brought also constructed a crossing over its track on the premises of plaintiff. Prior to the construction of the crossing the railway company tendered to plaintiff a deed in which no mention was made of the crossing. Plaintiff refused to accept the deed, and in turn tendered to the railway company a deed containing the following clause: “ Excepting and reserving unto the said parties of the first part, their heirs and assigns forever, a good and sufficient right of way or railroad crossing over and across the said Clearfield &amp; Mahoning Railway on the said premises of tlie parties of the first part, so that the occupant or occupants of the said premises of the parties of the first part may cross or pass over the said railroad on the premises with wagons, carts and implements of husbandry, as the occasion may require; said causeway or railroad crossing to be maintained by the said party of the second part, its successors and assigns.”</p>

      <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>The learned judge is substantially correct in his construction of the agreement of June 18,1892, on which this action is founded, and also in regard to the kind of conveyance therein provided for. The agreement is executory, and evidently contemplates the execution and deliveiy of a deed, in due form, expressed in such apt words as will secure to each party, respectively, the rights and privileges mentioned in the agreement or intended to be granted or reserved. The construction contended for by the defendants is unreasonable and wholly untenable. Their covenant to “construct and maintain a good and sufficient crossing over the right of way on said premises,” is not independent of and unconnected with the right of way acquired by the defendant, but a covenant running therewith, and thus securing to plaintiff the “good and sufficient crossing ” intended to be appurtenant to his land on either side of said right of way.</p>

With this single modification, we think the judgment on the conditional verdict should be affirmed.</p>
