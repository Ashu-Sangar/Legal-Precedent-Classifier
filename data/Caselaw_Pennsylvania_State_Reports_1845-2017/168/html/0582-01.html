The suggestion filed discloses a clear ground of interest in the relator who filed the same. His interest consisted in his right to vote the 253 or more shares of stock; the right to vote which, if his suggestion be true and on this demurrer must be taken as true, he was deprived of and thereby a board of directors elected by a minority contrary to his right. If the election of Mr. Morris to the board of directors as part of the ticket of Mr. Stevens and those acting with him could have the effect of preventing an inquiry into the method and legality of-' the corporate election, then any minority of a private corporation who might be reckless enough of the rights of a stockholder or stockholders to disregard what otherwise might be-<a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>required, could stifle inquiry and prevent investigation by placing upon their ticket such of the opposition as they might think would institute proceedings for such an investigation.

This is the rule of all remedial statutes : Com’th v. Dillon, <a href="/pa/61/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="61 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="428649" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0488-01">61 Pa. 488</a>.

There is no express language in the statute that requires it.

The 4th section prescribes the form of the writ and the remaining sections of the statute regulate the process, service, pleadings and judgment, with execution thereon.

    <p class="summary" id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[257,628,1169,947]]]'>“ But the learned judge says: ‘ It may be also applied in all cases where two or more persons hold one and the same office: as where two or more are trustees,’ etc., etc. There need not be any conflict of opinion upon the construction of this act of 1886. The office contested or questioned by the suggestion is the office of the directorship of the Tyrone Gas and Water Company. The office of president, secretary and treasurer is but the result of being a director or manager of the corporation, and unless a director, the person cannot be a president, secretary or treasurer. So that there is nothing in the opinion of Judge Livingston in Com’th v. Martin, 3 Lane. Bar, 177, which militates against the joinder of the defendants or the corelators in one and the same information. The office questioned is the directorship. It is not pretended that if the board which elected Mr. Stevens president was a duly elected board of directors or trustees that his election as president of the board is not legal. His office as president stands or falls as an incident of the proceedings touching the election of the board of directors and not otherwise.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b608-6" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[253,1594,1168,756]]]'>“ But apart from this view is another, and to our minds is another equally forceful. It is that the policy of the law is to cheapen litigation while preserving the rights of the parties. Nothing can be done that will deprive either party of a full hearing by the joinder. The suggestion discloses but a single cause of complaint. That cause applies equally to all or it ap-; plies to none. In one form, a writ of quo warranto is a proceeding to contest an election, and while the lower courts have for years differed upon the question of the joinder of more than one office in a contested election of ballots under our election laws, the opinion of the Supreme Court, in Mook et al. v. Conrad et al., from quarter sessions of Phila. Co., has set at rest that question in favor of* the joinder in a single petition or one proceeding.

The injunction issued by the court was issued at the instance of creditors of A. B. Hoover and was intended, not to disfranchise the Hoover stock, but to preserve it within the grasp of the law so that, if it should be ascertained that it was transferred by Hoover in fraud of -the rights of his creditors, it might be restored to said creditors. The injunction resulted in the tellers disfranchising the Hoover stock in the hands of Mr. Morris at the election. Such a result was not the primary object, or ostensible purpose, of the injunction, — could not advance the interests of Hoover’s creditors, — and was a manifest injury and injustice to Mr. Morris, because it deprived him of his rights as the majority stockholder in the water company.

    <p id="b620-8" data-blocks='[["BL_620.9",620,[253,1454,1164,388]]]'>First, it is contended that the title of the relator to the office of director not being disputed he has no standing to question the title of the respondents to similar positions. But this view, as was well held by the learned judge below, overlooks the rights of the relator as a stockholder, to have his votes properly counted, and the affairs of the company committed to the charge of the officers legally elected by a majority of the stockholders. This is too clear to need further elaboration.</p>
    <p id="b620-9" data-blocks='[["BL_620.10",620,[254,1861,1163,550]],["BL_621.1",621,[138,371,1173,862]]]'>Secondly. The right to separate and distinct offices held by different incumbents, cannot in general be inquired into in one proceeding. But in this state the practice in quo warranto is regulated by the act of June 14, 1836, P. L. 621, find the eighth section provides that “ if it shall appear to the court or judge (allowing the writ) that the several rights of different persons may be properly determined by one writ, it shall be lawful for such court or judge to make such order or orders for the introduction or addition of such persons into the writ, or for notice to such persons to appear and take defense, as shall be reasonable and just.” The obvious purpose of this provision is to <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>bring the proceeding under the principle of equity practice, that the court having obtained jurisdiction of the subject-matter of controversy shall include all the parties to it, and make a final determination of the whole. This is in accordance with the general policy of the law, and the proper construction of remedial statutes. While the words are, the “ several rights of different persons,” and it is not expressly said that the title to different offices may be determined in one writ yet the latter case is not excluded by the language used, and may be equally within the intended remedy. It appears to be clearly .so in the present case. Although the offices in controversy are different, yet the title of the incumbents as to all of them, depends on the same votes at the same election, and a decision on the validity of that election will be equally conclusive as to the rights of all. The case is therefore clearly within the privilege of the statute, and the learned judge was right in dismissing the motion to quash, and overruling the demurrer.</p>
    <p id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.4",621,[137,1240,1175,1168]],["BL_622.1",622,[262,369,1167,186]]]'>The cases of Moock v. Conrad, <a href="/pa/155/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="155 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="983335" data-case-paths="/pa/155/0586-01">155 Pa. 586</a>, and Coopersdale Election, <a href="/pa/157/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="157 Pa. 637" data-case-ids="846611" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0637-01">157 Pa. 637</a>, cited by both parties, have very little bearing on the present question, but so far as applicable they are in harmony with the conclusion herewith announced. In the former it was held on a motion to quash that a contest of the election of four councilmen might be commenced by a single petition where it “ alleged fraud or mistake calculated to affect the entire ticket, and to destroy the returns as to each one of the set returned as elected,” and that in case a joint trial would result in injustice or inconvenience, the respondents could sever in their answers, and ask the court to allow them to sever in their trials. In the Coopersdale Election case it was held by the court below, that to join contests for burgess, councilmen, school directors, justice of the peace, constable, and collector of taxes, in one petition would “ complicate the proceedings, and involve the court in confusion as to questions of costs, evidence, and decrees, and compel persons having no joint interests to join in a defense,” and this was affirmed by this court. Both those cases were decided upon the same principle, namely the practicability of determining the whole controversy in one proceeding without injustice or inconvenience, .and of refusing the attempt unless those conditions appeared. In both those cases that principle was applied under the gen<a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>eral powers of the courts at common law. In the present case-the same principle is applied under the additional sanction of express statutory authority. The difference in result arises from the difference in the facts and circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[262,574,1168,397]]]'>Upon the merits of the case, it appears that Morris was the-holder of certificates of shares on which he was prima facie entitled to vote. The creditors of Hoover claimed title to 253 of the shares held by Morris, upon grounds that might authorize a court of equity to require Morris to transfer them, but gave no authority to the tellers to reject them in counting the vote. The action of the tellers must therefore be justified, if at all, by the terms of the injunction.</p>
    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[258,980,1168,1010]]]'>Very serious objections are raised to the mode of proceeding by the tellers in allowing the ballots to be deposited, and then rejecting them in the count without giving Morris any opportunity to be heard in defense of his right to vote them, and without any identification of the shares enjoined, or any evidence that such enjoined shares were included in those voted by Morris. It is however unnecessary to discuss these objections in detail, as it appears from the opinion of the learned court below on the points reserved, and even more clearly from the opinion of our brother Dean while president judge, in continuing the injunction upon the Gas and Water Company against incurring any new debts pending the contest over the Hoover stock, that no effect upon the election, or the right of Morris to vote the stock thereat, was intended by the preliminary injunction. Neither the action of Morris therefore in voting the stock nor that of the tellers in receiving his votes, though contrary to the general language used in the injunction, was a violation of its real intent and meaning, and the nominal violation was no ground on which the later action of the tellers in rejecting the votes in the count could be sustained.</p>
