The track was obscured by smoke about 100 feet from where they stood when they began to cross, walking their horses. The distance from where they stopped to look to a place of safety was about fifty feet.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.6",663,[123,815,1165,1017]]]'>“ The man who was killed approached the railroad crossing in his wagon about twilight of a misty day. The evidence was explicit that he twice stopped and looked and listened, the last time at the edge of the tracks, which he then proceeded to cross, but was struck by an express train running at the rate of forty miles an hour. He had safely crossed four tracks before he was struck. A fellow traveler on horseback crossed all the tracks without injury. No whistle was blown from the engine, no bell was rung until the train was almost at the crossing, and there was no headlight. The points at which the injured man stopped to look and listen were, in the ordinary condition of the tracks, proper places for the performance of that legal duty, as they permitted a clear view of 900 feet. At the time of the accident, however, a freight train which had passed by had left a cloud of smoke and steam hanging over the track on which the train that struck the man was approaching. This obscured the view, so that this track was not clearty open to vision for more than about 100 feet beyond the crossing, when the man last stopped to look. A freight train also passing still further down the track partiaUy obstructed the view.”</p>
