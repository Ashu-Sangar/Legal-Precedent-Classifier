The city did the work, and filed liens against the properties which plaintiff was compelled to pay. Plaintiff did not begin the constmetion of houses until after the street improvements were put in, and until more than a year after the execution of the contract. In an action to recover the amount of the municipal liens paid by plaintiff, <em>held, </em>that he was entitled to recover, (1) because he was not bound to build the houses before the curbing and paving were done; (2) because the damage, if any, suffered by defendants from plaintiff’s failure to build the houses within a year were not the subject of set-off for the reason that they were speculative, and not in contemplation of the parties when the contract was made, and not such as arose naturally from the breach.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b143-4" data-blocks='[["BL_143.5",143,[192,582,1166,1833]]]'>“ The controversy in this case arose out of a sale or exchange of real estate between the plaintiff and the defendant’s firm. The agreement in reference to this was reduced to writing, and this memorandum of agreement in writing was dated the fourth day of August, 1890. Amongst other things, it set forth that the street pavement was to be put in by the parties of the first part on front and rear and side streets ; and also an agreement on behalf of John McConaghy that houses were to be built on Clifford street by the party of the second part within one year. Some of the street improvements, such as water pipes and sewers, were put in by Pemberton &amp; Co.; but the paving bills, which was the most expensive part of the street improvements, were not paid by Pemberton &amp; Co; a lien was filed against the property, which had been acquired by Mr. McConaghy, and he was obliged to pay the bills. For the amount of these bills he brought suit against Pemberton &amp; Co., and filed a statement, in which he alleged as follows : ‘ Plaintiff sues the defendants to recover money paid out and expended to their use under the following circumstances: Plaintiff bought from the defendants in the autumn of 1890, 24 lots of ground on the south side of Clifford street, in the Twenty-ninth ward of the city of Philadelphia, between 'Thirty-first and Thirty-second streets, having a frontage of 395 feet on Clifford street and extending in depth 90 feet to Hollingsworth street, the defendants agreeing to pay for the sewer, gas, water, curb and street pavement on all the aforementioned streets. Subsequently the said Clifford street was paved and curbed in front of the said lots, and the defendants refused and neglected to pay for the said curbing and paving as agreed; whereupon liens were filed against the said lots for the money due for the said curbing and paving, and the plaintiff was thus compelled to pay for the same, and did so pay. He now claims to recover from the defendants the sum of $4,375.98, being the amount paid by him for said paving and curbing, together with interest from Feb. 25, 1892. Plaintiff avers that he has never been paid this sum or any part of it, and that it is all justly due and payable.’</p>

The plaintiff did not, however, recollect distinctly the conversations to which his attention was called; nor did he recollect receiving the letter referred to. He was also asked why he did not build houses as he agreed to do, and he gave two reasons; (1) that he thought there were too many houses in the neighborhood, and (2) that as he had paid fully in the trade for the street improvements, he was not bound to build the houses until the street improvements were in, and that he thought it just that the street improvements, as long as he paid for them, ought to be done first.

There were two lines of testimony, however, upon which the referee decided adversely to the defendants’ right to take the testimony. First, the defendants offered to show that the properties which Mr. MeConaghy had exchanged for the unimproved lots of Messrs. Pemberton &amp; Co., under the agreement of Aug. 4, 1890, were not worth the values placed upon them by MeConaghy, and a large amount of the claim of set-off was based upon the theory that the defendants had a right to show that the properties which they had taken in barter or exchange for their own land were not worth what they thought they were when they took them. As there was no pretense of any fraud or imposition upon the part of the defendants, as they were, according to their own testimony, experts in the real estate business; had been engaged for a considerable period of time in large operations; were sui juris, and abundantly competent to look after their own interests; and as the agreement, so far as the exchange of land for houses was concerned, was fully executed before any dispute arose between the parties ; and as no complaint had ever been made of any unfairness in the dealings in this regard, the referee felt bound to reject, when objection was seriousty made to it, all testimony tending to show that the properties traded by Mr. McConagby for land of Messrs. Pemberton &amp; Co. were worth less than both parties seem to have thought them worth at the time of the trade. Second, a large number of experts were called on behalf of the defendants, and while the referee admitted their testimony generally upon the questions of improvement to a neighborhood by the building of houses, yet he excluded their opinions as to the amount of damage suffered by the defendants in this particular case.</p>

Mr. Pemberton also testified at considerable length as to the tract of ground which he and his partners were improving and developing, and that, in his view, the balance of his property was damaged by the failure of Mr. McConaghy to build houses within a year; that, in his opinion, the cost of carrying a certain number of houses should be charged to Mr. McConaghy for his failure to build houses according to his agreement. On page 49 of the type-written notes of testimony, he says: ‘The cost of carrying property, including houses and lots unsold on account of Mr. McConagliy’s failure to build, was seven houses at $400, making $2,800, and twenty-six lots, twelve on Clifford street and fourteen on Thirty-first street, with interest, $1,500, making a total of $4,300. Then, general damage to the value of the balance of our houses and lots, $3,000.’ And he says further, in explanation, that the development of the property was retarded by the failure of McConaghy to build, to the extent of that amount of money.

That is, that regarding the covenant to build houses within one year by McConaghy as a binding covenant on him, and admitting that there had been a breach of that covenant, and that damages might be recovered for that breach if any actual damages were proved, no sufficient testimony had been brought before the referee from which he could find that the defendants, Pemberton &amp; Co., had suffered any loss from the failure of McConaghy to build houses within one year.</p>

The contention of Messrs. Pemberton &amp; Co. is, that houses were to have been built and finished on all the lots within one year, or at least this is the result of the propositions advanced by their learned counsel for them, for it was contended that if houses had been built on these lots, the neighborhood would have been improved and Messrs. Pemberton &amp; Co. would have been enabled to sell their other houses at good prices, but as the lots remained vacant they could not sell the houses at any price. But this view requires us to read into the covenant words which are not there. Certainly, Mr. McConaghy would have complied with the letter aud spirit of his agreement if he had commenced the building of two or three houses. He had not agreed to build all the houses within one year; the simple agreement was that houses were to be built within one year; and even the opinions of the experts have hardly gone so far as to contend that the erection of two or three houses would have affected the sale of a number of other houses in the neighborhood in a dull and off year for building operations, as this year was testified to have been; nor does the referee think, with all respect to the opinions of the defendants themselves and all the experts who have been called, that any damages have been satisfactorily proved to have resulted from the failure on the part of McConaghy to build houses within one year.</p>

The rule would be in the highest degree unfavorable to the interests of the community,” the reasoning for which he then proceeds to give. The same doctrine is stated in 2 Parsons on Contracts, 458, 459. I think the rule in such cases is well stated in the case of Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Exch. Rep. (26 Eng. L. &amp; E. 398). There Alderson, B.,says: “Now we think the proper rule in such a case as the present is this: Where two parties have made a contract, which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive, in respect <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>to such breach of contract, should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i. e., according to the usual course of things from such breach of the contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it.” ’</p>

In that case it was held that evidence of the difference of cost of transportation between horse power and by the engine during the delay on the part of the defendant was admissible on the question of damages. Judge Agnew, delivering the opinion of the court, says : ‘ The true inquiry which arose under these circumstances, was whether the damages thus claimed were the necessary consequence of the failure to perform the contract in time, and whether they were presumptively in the view of the plaintiffs at the time of making their contract to finish and deliver the engine in running order on the defendant’s track by the 1st of February. The damages ordinarily recoverable are those necessarily following the breach, which the party guilty of the breach must be presumed to know would be the probable consequence of his failure. The rule is well expressed by Strong, J., in Adams Exp. Co. v. Egbert, 12 Casey, 364. They must be a proximate consequence of the breach, not merely remote or possible. There is no measure for losses of the latter kind.’ And after discussing the rule at considerable length, he says that the loss in the case before him was immediate, and the necessary consequence of nonfulfillment.</p>
