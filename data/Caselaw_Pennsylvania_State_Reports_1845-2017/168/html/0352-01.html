These exactions he alleged were illegal and in plain violation of the spirit if not the letter of the pension laws. An affidavit of defense was made by the commanding officer of' the Home, in which he set out the following facts : First, the adoption of a rule by the board of managers of the Home requiring the inmates to turn over eighty per cent of their pension money to the treasurer of the institution. Second, that upon the admission of the plaintiff he signed an agreement in writing binding himself to comply with the rules of the Home-of which he knew this to be one. Third, that the payments for which he now sues were made by him voluntarily in accordance with the contract so executed by him on his admission. The learned judge of the court below held this affidavit to be sufficient to prevent a judgment on motion, and this appeal is-<a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>from that ruling. The learned gentleman who represents the appellant has argued with great earnestness that the rule under which the money was paid to the treasurer is wholly unauthorized. We are not inclined to decide that question at this time. It is not necessary to the decision of this case. If the payments shall turn out to be voluntary, as is alleged, and in pursuance of an agreement under which the plaintiff’s admission was obtained, and that admission depended upon the contract and not upon the positive provisions of the statute organizing this institution, then the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>
