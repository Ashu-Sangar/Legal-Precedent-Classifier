To establish the fact of marriage he produced the official certificate of the birth of a child naming himself and decedent as husband and wife; checks by him to decedent indorsed by her in her married name; a letter addressed to her as a married woman by one objecting to the alleged husband’s claim; a policy of life insurance taken out by claimant for decedent’s benefit, in which decedent is described as “his wife.” There was also evidence that decedent collected moneys from beneficial societies of which the claimant was a member, which she could only do as his wife, and there was evidence of a deed to her in her married name. It appeared also that in the circle in which she lived she was called by claimant’s name, and that his children by a former wife called her mother and received from her the consideration and care which her duty as the wife of their father imposed. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to establish the marriage relation between claimant and decedent.</p>

This disposes of the claim of the committee of the alleged husband, who became a lunatic ten years before the death of the woman he wronged, and who, while compos mentis, disregarded her tears,’ turned a deaf ear to her entreaties, and refused to make her his lawful wife.

He may even to gratify her allow himself to be held out, or hold himself out, to her friends and acquaintances as her husband; may recognize the fruit of the connection as his children, and manifest affection and tenderness towards them; and yet the evidence may fall far short of that which ought to satisfy the mind that there was an actual agreement to form the relation of husband and wife.’</p>

It is true that the exceptants, claiming as next of kin, asserted that the child so born was illegitimate, and hence, as contended, the original relation having been illicit, marriage can only be established by direct proof, not by mere reputation. But the evidence upon this point, which is mainly, if not altogether, the testimony of persons directly interested, is opposed by documentary evidence, the genuineness of which admits of no doubt — the official certificate of birth of the child naming the parents as if husband and-wife, the checks by the former to the latter with their indorsement by her in her married name, the letter addressed to her as a married woman by one of the exceptants, her deed in her new name, etc.; and it cannot be said, therefore, that the auditing judge was not warranted in failing to find that the relation, in its inception was an unlawful one.</p>

It is conceded that if his finding in this particular was justified <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>by the evidence, the adjudication based thereon should be sustained. The brothers and sisters of the decedent, five in number, have appealed from the adjudication on the ground, as they allege, that the learned orphans’ court erred in deciding that she was the wife of Strauss. They admit that he was the father of her child, but they insist that it was illegitimate, although they must allow that the registration of its birth and the acknowledgments or admissions of its parents furnish some ground at least for an inference opposed to their contention. It would seem to the ordinary mortal that proper regard for the reputation of their sister would have induced them to relinquish their claim to the small sum in dispute rather than to engage in a contest in which their success depended upon showing her departure from the path of virtue and her resort to a false pretense to hide her shame. But while this was a matter proper for their consideration before inaugurating the contest it cannot be allowed to affect in any degree the decision of the question before us on their appeal. It is a question of fact determinable upon the evidence, oral and documentary. There is some conflict in the former; the latter is undisputed and includes the record of the birth of the child, the receipt for the burial expenses, tbe checks drawn by Nathan Strauss to the order of Sophia Strauss, her signature to the deeds, and the insurance effected' and maintained by Nathan Strauss on his life in favor of Sophia Strauss as his wife. In the record and papers referred to there is a clear recognition by the parties of the existence of the marital relation between them. Their acts and admissions thus evidenced are consistent with that relation and cannot be reconciled with any other without impeachment of their chastity and truth. The beneficial society of which Strauss was a member recognized and dealt with the decedent as his wife. All the testimony in the case is to the effect that after the birth of her child she was known to the narrow circle in which she moved as Mrs. Strauss. A brother-in-law of Nathan Strauss testified that about a year before her child was born she was so known to him and others in the neighborhood, and that Strauss told him she was his wife. His children by a former wife called her mother and received from her the con.sideration and care which her duty as the wife of their father imposed. If the admissions and representations made by the <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>parties in regard to the relation they sustained to each other were false and intended to deceive their neighbors, it is quite clear that her relatives, including the appellants, were participants in the fraud. They were willing that their sister while she lived should be known to her and their neighbors as the wife of Strauss, in order as they suggest, to conceal her wrongdoing, but now for the obvious purpose of appropriating the small estate she left for distribution under the intestate laws, they repudiate the claim they sanctioned in her lifetime and allege that her relations with Strauss were illicit. We think it is clear that their change of position and the motive which prompted it, were not well calculated to lend strength to and inspire confidence in their testimony. All the written evidence was adverse to their contention and the natural inferences from it supported the marriage. It was for the auditing judge to consider the oral testimony in connection with the written, and from all the evidence before him to ascertain the facts. The-law favors marriage: 14 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 520, and cases cited. It is a civil contract and in civil cases, at least, reputation and cohabitation are sufficient evidence of it: Senser v.
