Now, I allow the testimony to be given of what the young man said at the time the building was burned as a part of the res gestee. He admitted to Mr. Shafer that the fire, according to Mr. Shafer’s testimony, originated from a spark from his fire pot, and that he tried to put it out and failed. The colored girl, and also Mary, heard him admit that the fire caught from a spark. A man down in the yard while the house was burning said he explained where it caught; pointed up ; caught from a spark. Then the next day he admitted, according to the testimony of those two witnesses (who were called to contradict him), that the fire caught from a spark. To one of them he expressed the fear that he would be dismissed from the employment of the defendants for burning the house, and to the other one admitted that it caught from a spark, and that he thought he had extinguished it, and when he returned found it had got beyond control. Now, the young man, when first called as a witness, explaining what he said to Mr. Shafer, differs materially from what Mr. Shafer says he said. He said that he told Mr. Shafer he owed an explanation, and that he told him he thought the house caught from a spark. <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>But his testimony here is that it did not catch from a spark. He has so testified, or rather explained his declaration to Mr. Shafer at that time, because he then supposed it caught from a spark. Now, as I say, gentlemen, the first question is, how did that fire take place ? If it took place from a spark or sparks from the fire pot he was using, then the next question would be, was it negligence ? Was it because of his negligence in handling it, or doing something which he ought not to have done, or not being as careful as he ought to have been? The fair presumption is, if it caught from sparks, that it'was negligence. That is the fair presumption. He denies here that it caught from sparks, and denies that he said so to these others. Now, I say if you find from the evidence that the fire originated from the sparks, the fair presumption would be that it was through some negligence of his. The plaintiff cannot explain the exact circumstances of the case, but the young man knows all about it. If it was not through negligence, that is, if this spark set fire to the house without negligence on his part, he could explain it, because if it was purely accidental, without any negligence on his part, there would be. no responsibility on him or his employer. By way of illustrating it, what I mean, gentlemen, I will say this: If he was handling the fire box very carefully, as he ought to have been doing, upon a roof where there would be danger from sparks, and if, with that care and caution that he ought to have exercised, there was a sudden puff of wind that sent sparks into the house, he would not be responsible ; there would not be negligence there. He denies that the fire took place from sparks, and you have the declarations of the various witnesses. If you find that the fire did occur from sparks, the fair presumption would be that he was in some way negligent, as he only could explain how it occurred, and why he was not guilty of negligence, if it occurred from sparks.]” [7]</p>

It is contended in support of the appeal that the declarations of the workmen, made while the fire was in progress, to the effect that it was caused by their carelessness, were not admissible to charge their employers with liability for the consequences of it. We think this contention is <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>sufficiently answered by the decisions of this court in Hanover Railroad Co. v. Coyle, <a href="/pa/55/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="55 Pa. 396" data-case-ids="1470703" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0396-01">55 Pa. 396</a>; Tompkins v. Saltmarsh, 14 S. &amp; R. 275; Elkins v. McKean, <a href="/pa/79/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="79 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="438401" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0493-01">79 Pa. 493</a>, and Penna. Railroad Co. v. Lyons, <a href="/pa/129/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="129 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="568070" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0113-01">129 Pa. 113</a>. We accordingly overrule the first, second, and third specifications of error. As the evidence complained of in the fourth specification was received in rebuttal, and manifestly for the purpose of contradicting the defendants’ principal witness in a material matter, it was clearly relevant and its admission afforded no ground for reversing the judgment. The proposition that if the defendants furnished a proper fire pot and competent and careful workmen they are not responsible to the plaintiff for the loss he sustained through the negligence of their servants is not applicable to the case. The relation between the parties is not that of master and servant and the duties which the former owes to the latter need no consideration in the decision of the questions involved in this issue. For these reasons the fourth and fifth specifications are overruled.</p>

The defendants by their servants were in possession of the roof of the plaintiff’s house and engaged in repairing it. For the purposes of their work they had a fire pot there, and it is established "by the verdict that the fire which destroyed his property was caused by a spark or sparks from it. The workmen, while the fire was in progress, acknowledged that it was so caused, but on the trial they set up in the interest of their employers, a theory respecting the origin of it which was discredited by their previous declarations, and other testimony, and was rejected by the jury. It was a theory born long after the fire and opposed to their observation at the time of it. It was speculative and conjectural and it was justly condemned. The defendants by their servants were in exclusive possession of the roof, and the destruction of the property was due to fire brought there by them, and under their control. The occurrence was not in the ordinary course of things, and the circumstances connected with and surrounding it put on them the duty of showing that it was at least consistent with the exercise of proper care in the performance of their work. If it was capa<a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>ble of an explanation which repelled an inference that it resulted from their negligence, they could and ought to have made it because they were in a position to do so, while from the nature of the case it was not in the power of the plaintiff to show expressly in what manner their work was performed or the cause of the escape from the fire pot of the sparks by means of which his house was burned. In Sherman and Redfield on Negligence, secs. 59 and 60, the rule applicable to the case is thus stated : “ The accident, the injury and the circumstances under which they occurred are in some cases sufficient to raise a presumption of negligence and thus cast on the defendant the burden of establishing his freedom from fault. When the thing which causes the injury is shown to be under the management of the defendants and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants that the accident arose from a want of care.” See also on this point Thompson on Negligence, 1227-1235, Cooley on Torts, 706, and 16 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 448, and cases there cited. In the light of the evidence and the principles applicable to it we cannot convict the learned court below of error in the instructions. We therefore overrule the sixth and seventh specifications.</p>
