The building insured was built for and used as a boarding house, and was erroneously described in the policy as “ occupied by the insured as a dwelling only.” The plaintiff fully and accurately described the property to the agent as a boarding house, and it was seen and examined by the agent, and the misdescription was his act alone. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff vyas entitled to recover.</p>

Twenty-two days after the fire plaintiff mailed a proof of loss to the agent. About three months after the fire a proof of loss was sent directly to the company. Two months afterwards the company returned the latter proof of loss. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to justify a finding by the jury that a proof of loss had been furnished within the time fixed by the policy, and that the company had also waived all irregularities.</p>

So that if you find there was a mistake made by the agent, and that Mr. Dowling did not connive with the agent to perpetrate a fraud upon the company, but he fairly and honestly stated what the building was to be used for and relied upon that in his statement to the company, the company cannot defend if the company itself, or their agent, made a mistake in issuing this policy in the way in which they did.] [5]</p>

Upon that point we allowed some testimony to be introduced in order to bear upon the bona fides of the notice, and upon the question whether, this plaintiff exercised due diligence, and whether he was led by the conduct of the company to not furnish the proofs of loss within the specified time set forth in the policy. You will recollect the testimony of Henry Smith, the station agent, who lives at Mount Pocono, who tells you that upon the morning of the fire (this fire, as I recollect the testimony, occurred between one and two o’clock in the morning), he telegraphed to Mr. LaRue in reference to the occurrence, and on the Monday following LaRue came up to the place. And you recollect the testimony of Willard Dowling as to what occurred between him and Mr. LaRue in reference to this loss. You will recollect Mr. LaRue, according <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>to the testimony of Willard Dowling, asked if the building could be rebuilt, asked something about whether it could be rebuilt for $4,500 (I do not now give you the exact language), and what was said about the house being a loss, and what we wanted to get at was the value of the contents of the house. Also what he said about the furnishing of a form and telling him he should make out a list of the loss and make it low enough, and hold it until he could come and see him about it. You recollect what he said about asking him whether he should hold it, and what LaRue responded to him by saying yes, he should. As this is important, I will read what Willard Dow-ling’s testimony is upon that point. This is what he says as the reporter has furnished it to me: ‘ He, LaRue, said that was all satisfactory, that he knew that was a total loss — that is the building — all we have to get at now is the contents of the building, furniture, etc., which is the only thing to be considered further. And I think he remained on the porch talking about it for a little while, and I asked him whether the building could be rebuilt and whether it was worth more than what it was insured. He asked me for a blank piece of paper and thereon he marked a sort of formula in which to draw the contents of the house, saying right there that -we know the house was a total loss and everything about that or something to that effect.</p>

LaRue says he did not receive that letter, but you have the evidence that Dowling did mail this about twenty-two days after the occurrence, and in the ordinary way of mailing a letter. Then, it seems that on Oct.o13, 1892, a letter was mailed to LaRue, which letter you have heard read, and acknowledged by postal. Then nothing seems to have been done until the 8th of December, 1892, when a proof of loss was sent to the company, and on the 4th of February, <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>1898, this proof of loss was returned to Mr. Dowling by the president of the company, this company refusing to pay it, but stating his grounds why they refused to pay it.</p>

And upon that point you have the testimony of Willard Dowling, the conversation he had with La-Rue with reference to this proof of loss and what LaRue said. Then you have those other letters. Do they show a conduct on the part of the company which would lead Mr. Dowling to the conclusion that they had waived a strict compliance with this part of the policy? We say to you that if there was this action on the part of the company, and from that Mr. Dowling was led to believe that there would not be a strict enforcement of this clause of the policy, and if he then gave reasonable notice, as a prudent man, desiring to furnish all the proofs that should be required in the premises, and that he did this for a bona fide and honest purpose, with the purpose of informing the company as to the loss, we say, if you believe those things from the facts in this case, then the company was estopped from setting up a strict compliance with the clause in their policy requiring the proofs of loss to be furnished within sixty days.] [6]</p>

    <p id="b259-5" data-blocks='[["BL_259.8",259,[154,1472,1171,964]]]'>This case is much stronger for the plaintiff than those above cited. In all of these, written applications had been signed by the insured, and in each case the application was made a part of the contract. In this case no written application was made, and the policy was written by the agent and not read by the insured until after the fire. The building insured was built for and used as a boarding house, and was erroneously described in the policy as “occupied by the insured as a dwelling only.” The testimony was clear and uncontradicted that there was no mistake or deception on the part of the plaintiff, who fully and accurately described the property to the agent as a boarding house and spoke to him of its capacity and use. It was seen and examined by the agent, and its use, which was apparent, was fully known to him. The misdescription was his act alone, in the face of light and knowledge, and was unknown to the insured until after the loss occurred. The .defendant cannot be released from its contract because the plaintiff actiug in good faith accepted without examination the policy written by its agent.</p>

Co., <a href="/pa/96/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="96 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="494605" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0037-01">96 Pa. 37</a>, the insured signed an application which had not been finished. He directed another to fill it up, and expressed a doubt as to the manner in which it should be done. It was held that he knew facts to. incite him to read the policy, and was charged with knowledge of its contents, and should under the circumstances be presumed, to have accepted it as written. No such presumption arose in this case. Having made a full and frank disclosure of the facts to the company’s agent, who was empowered to write the policy and who from observation knew the character and use of the building, there was nothing to induce or warn the insured to read the policy unless it was the anticipation of fraud or mistake, and this could impose no duty in protection of the rights of the defendant.</p>

There was ample evidence to justify a finding by the jury that they had in point of fact been furnished within the limit of time fixed by the policy, and from which also a waiver by the company could properly be inferred. -</p>
