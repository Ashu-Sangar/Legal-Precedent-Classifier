Graham, 9 Lea (Tenn.), 152; nor vice versa: Baldwin v. Weed, 17 Wend. (N. T.) 224. The distinction arises from the obvious difference between the defendant’s relation to the ultimate wrong sought to be recovered for in the one action and in the other, and the character of the defendant’s immediate act in each. It is the lawful right of every citizen to set on foot a criminal proceeding where he believes a crime to have been committed: Cooley, Torts, 180, and the law favors honest efforts to bring the guilty to justice: McCarthy v. DeArmit, ubi supra. Hence, the test of defendant’s liability to suit for malicious prosecution, must be his notice, his belief; and as the law presumes in favor of a man’s honesty of purpose where the legality of his act depends upon the state of his mind, Schum v.

What constitutes such authority must obviously be a question of law for the court; for the right of arrest or liability to imprisonment must be determined by a fixed and cannot be measurable by <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>any fluctuating standard. Hence, while it is true that a defendant in an action for false imprisonment may justify upon like principles as protect a defendant in a suit for malicious prosecution, viz, on the ground of probable cause, Id. 71, the question of probable cause in trespass for false imprisonment is a question of law: Id. p. 70; — with this understanding, that, where it rests upon conflicting evidence, the existence of the facts necessary in law to constitute probable cause must be passed upon by the jury: Mitchell v.

Whilst, however, the action for an arrest, originally illegal and void, because of a failure of jurisdiction on the facts, was at common law an action of trespass, Maher v.

But where there is more than a mere nonfeasance ; where there is, connected with it, a positive wrongful act, in such a way as to make the omission of one thing but a constituent part of the commission of another, merging the former in the latter, I think the rule must be different. Thus, the lodging of an accused person in prison is not, strictly speaking, by virtue of the original warrant of arrest, which simply orders the constable to bring the accused before the magistrate <em>to </em>answer and be dealt with according to law, 1 McKinney’s Justice, pp. 187, 188, but by virtue of another order, or commitment, written or verbal, issued by the magistrate after the prisoner has been brought before and examined by him: Id. 232, 233. If, then, the magistrate, in violation of his duty to-accept bail offered and thereupon to set the prisoner at large, causes him to be removed in custody of a constable from his office to the prison, such performance constitutes a new and distinct wrong, an illegal act, not merely an illegal omission, and that act, involving positive constraint applied by the magistrate to the prisoner, compelling him to do something and not merely to refrain from doing something, constitutes a trespass, an imprisonment, though there may have been no physical contact and no actual violence: See Cooley, Torts, 170 <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>Brushaber v.

There is no similarity between such a case and an unavoidable delay in taking bail, which has been held not to constitute a false imprisonment, Cargill v.

App. 431</a>, or a mere refusal to discharge upon bail one already confined in prison, or one taken by a sheriff upon a warrant itself authorizing his confinement in prison, as in Gibbe v. Rundlett, supra. Neither does the refusal of bail constitute an abuse or misuse of the original process.</p>

It is laid down generally, that if, after execution of civil or criminal process, the person served is subjected to unwarrantable treatment, he has a remedy by action against the officer and against others who may unite with him in doing the wrong: Wood v. Graves, <a href="/mass/144/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="144 Mass. 365" data-case-ids="774148" data-case-paths="/mass/144/0365-01">144 Mass. 365</a>-367.

Wilson, 60Pa. 452, or sells without notice or appraisement: Kerr v. Sharp, 14 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 399. Such again was held to be the position of the defendant in Baldwin v.

It appeared that he had been indicted in New York, arrested in Vermont upon a requisition procured by defendant, and brought back to New York. But the defendant, who was present at the arrest, had caused the plaintiff to be put in irons, with the purpose and effect of forcing him to pay two small debts owing the defendant. It was held that the action ought to have been trespass for false imprisonment and assault. It has been seen that the common law remedy for abuse of process is not trespass, but ease. But one, who by reason of subsequent wrong becomes a trespasser ab initio is suable in trespass: Kerr v. Sharp, supra, 402. The inference is, that the unwarrantable act of the defendant in Baldwin v.

Granted that, as I have endeavored to show, the commitment in denial of bail vitiated the whole pleadings ab initio, then it is clear that a suit thus grounded must be for false imprisonment beginning with the original arrest, and therefore there can be no question of the introduction of a new cause of action by giving that circumstance its legitimate effect, where the suit is, in fact, brought for false imprisonment in the original arrest and in the subsequent incarceration. If the court is to exercise its ingenuity in criticising the statement, it is its duty, as was said in Smith v.

Nor do I think that defendant was injured by the manner in which the question of his liability upon this branch of the case was submitted to the jury. The arrest was made upon a charge of barratry, the crime of being a common barrator. In order to make out that crime, it is generally conceded there must be proof of at least three instances of offending, 2 Whart. Crim. L. sec. 1444, note; 1 Bish. Cr. L. see. 65, 3; 1 Buss. Cr. 266, note, — though some authorities deem that number insufficient. In this case, there is no pretense that plaintiff had brought more than two prosecutions. There was, therefore, no crime to give the defendant as alderman jurisdiction to issue his warrant. His only chance of escape, then, lay in the answer to the question whether or not he had probable cause for acting as he did. Probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, honestly entertained, without regard to what induced the belief, if it be reasonably sufficient: Smith v. Ege, <a href="/pa/52/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="52 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1002276" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0419-01">52 Pa. 419</a>, 421, 422. Of course, if it was true, as plaintiff endeavored to show, that the defendant was the. mover and instigator of the prosecution against the plaintiff, being himself either aware of its baseléssness in fact and in law or having no reason beyond his own full knowledge of the circumstances for believing the plaintiff guilty, he could not pretend to have had probable cause. If, on the other hand, <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>as he contended, he got information from his constable, which, however erroneous it may have been, he honestly believed to point to plaintiff’s guilt, and directed the prosecution and issued his warrant on the strength thereof, he was protected by the rule of probable cause: <a href="/pa/52/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="52 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1002276" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0419-01">Ibid.</a> Whether, under the conflicting testimony, the former or the latter allegation was to be deemed sustained, was for the jury. The defendant got all he could ask when they were told that, if he acted upon (the very words used by Strong, J., in Smith v. Ege, <a href="/pa/52/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="52 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1002276" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0419-01">supra, at p. 422</a>, in stating the test of liability) information received from his constable, honestly believing it to be likely to be true, he was justified in the eyes of the law. They were not told that his ignorance of the law as to what constitutes barratry could not be considered as aiding the probability or reasonableness of his alleged belief in the existence'of a cause of prosecution against plaintiff. It has been said, that, where one, in ignorance of the law, causes the unlawful arrest of another, the offense is not the same, nor his liability so great, as though he knew the arrest to be unlawful and acted in defiance of the law: Hill v. Taylor, <a href="/mich/50/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="50 Mich. 549" data-case-ids="1393828" data-case-paths="/mich/50/0549-01">50 Mich. 549</a>.

A verdict of acquittal is evidence, though it may be slight, of the want of probable cause. Courts have differed as to the conclusive effect of a conviction. The true principle seems to be that in the trial of an action of malicious prosecution or false arrest a verdict of guilty is strong prima facie evidence of probable cause, but it may be rebutted by proof that it was obtained by corrupt or undue means : Munns v. DuPont, 1 Am. Leading Cases, 217. The effect, to be given to a verdict of acquittal has been made to depend upon the circumstances under which it is rendered. Deliberation by the jury has been held to be evidence of probable cause. Greenleaf on Evidence, vol. 2, sec. 457. A verdict of acquittal rendered promptly and without hesitation has been decided to have additional weight as evidence of the want of probable cause. In our cases proof of a verdict of acquittal has been allowed for the purpose of showing that the prosecution was ended, and ended in favor of the plaintiff, thus establishing the right of action and the basis for recovery in damages. The result of any inquiry behind the fact of the verdict would seem to rest upon very unsatisfactory and unsafe ground. The hesitation of the jury to acquit might be evidence that there were indications of guilt, but it would be of no value unless it clearly appeared that the hesitation was upon the evidence. The prompt action of the jury upon the evidence throws no light upon the real question in issue, whether the prosecutor had reasonable cause on existing facts then known to him. The inquiry as to the probable cause goes back to the commencement of the prosecution, and it relates to the facts then known and as they then appeared. It is not confined to the truth of matters which led to the prosecution, but extends to their appearance as indicating the guilt or innocence of the accused. The jury in the criminal court deals with the question of actual guilt as it appears at the trial, not with the indications of guilt as they appeared at the time of the arrest.</p>
