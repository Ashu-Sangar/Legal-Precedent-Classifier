These persons were all included in one information, and were all tried on the same bill of indictment. The said prisoners were committed to said plaintiff by John N. Dawson, Esq., a justice of the peace in and for said county by virtue of eighteen several writings or commitments, containing from three to eight names on each, in which commitments plaintiff was required to receive said defendants, and them have and keep in his custody until discharged by due course of law.

    <p id="b483-10" data-blocks='[["BL_483.15",483,[179,1610,1164,654]]]'>This case stated embodies all the facts upon which the judgment of the court below is based. As sheriff of the county and keeper of the common jail, the plaintiff received into his custody ninety-five persons charged before a justice of the peace, in one information, with the murder of Joseph H. Paddock and duly committed for trial by said justice, as evidenced by eighteen separate commitments containing from three to eight names each. The sole question was whether plaintiff was entitled to a commitment fee of fifty cents for each of the ninety-five persons thus committed and received by him, or a fee of fifty cents for each of the eighteen separate commitment papers, or only a fee of fifty cents for the entire number of ninety-five persons named in said several commitments.</p>

In this we think he was so clearly right that discussion of the subject is unnecessary.</p>
