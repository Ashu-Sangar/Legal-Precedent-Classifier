It is, however, well settled that the usual consequences of a dissolution, whether by transfer of the interest of a partner to another, or by death of one of the partners, may be avoided by suitable provisions in the partnership agreement, or by provisions in the will of the dying partner, if agreed to by the survivors. If such is the agreement the business may be continued after the death as before. The personal representative, or devisee, of the decedent may not •demand an account until the termination of the partnership, by the terms of the agreement. And so much of the decedent’s estate as is invested in the partnership venture, or is by him subjected to the demands of the partnership business, will pass into the hands of those to whom it is given by the law, clogged with the liabilities thus placed upon it by its former owner. These principles are well settled both in our own state and elsewhere: Gratz v. Bayard, 11 S. &amp; B. 41; Laughlin v.

A change of partners whether by transfer or by death, necessarily involves a dissolution of the <em>firm; </em>if the business goes on with new partners in place of the old this involves the organization of a new firm. So it was held in respect to transfers of stock in a banking partnership in Christy v. Sill, <a href="/pa/131/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="131 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="810301" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0492-01">131 Pa. 492</a>; and the reason is much stronger <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>in case of death than of transfer. All the cases which have held a deceased partner’s estate liable to creditors of the partnership, whose debts were contracted after the death, have rested the liability either upon the terms of the agreement or the will, and not upon any common-law liability as partner. This being so, we are called upon to determine what liability the defendants’ testator assumed when he accepted the transfer of the stock of Ingraham in this partnership. By so doing he substantially agreed to be bound by the terms of the partnership agreement. If the articles expressly declare that the whole estate of each partner shall be considered as embarked in the business and shall continue liable for losses occurring; after the death of the partner, then we may enforce the terms of this contract against the defendants, there being no question raised in behalf of creditors claiming prior liens upon the estate. But if the contract is silent upon the particular point involved here, or if its language is ambiguous and uncertain, how shall it be construed ? This, in the light of the decided cases, is the real question which we are obliged to determine.</p>

A possible exception to these cases, is our own case of Laughlin v.

Incidentally the liability for such debts was involved and was decided. The language of Judge Agnjsw, in his opinion, does contain an intimation that the rule which we have found all but uniform in all other courts, viz, that the general estate is not liable for such debts unless distinctly made so by clear language either in the contract or the will, is not correct; <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>but the converse of it, viz, that the estate is to be regarded as liable unless expressly exempted by the contract, or the will.

Surely a dead man cannot in the eye of the law have rights or incur liabilities. Nor can his property stand alone, by itself, disconnected from personal ownership and sustain such liability. Nor is it reasonable or logical that a person should be held to be a partner with others without his own agreement to become such express or implied.

An easy means is provided by which a new partnership consisting of the surviving partners and one or more new members who shall take the place of the dead partner may be formed to continue the business. The assignee in the case of a transfer becomes a partner in this new firm by acceptance of the transfer on the books of the association. And it is to be noted that in case of death the executors, administrators and devisees of the stock are mentioned together, the like provision being made as to all.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b359-6" data-blocks='[["BL_359.5",359,[128,1824,1173,558]]]'>“ Unless we are prepared to hold that one to whom stock in such partnership is devised becomes a partner in the new firm, and subject to liability as such partner by virtue of the devise itself, without any acceptance of it on his part, or acquiescence in any way in the provisions of the partnership agreement, we cannot hold that executors or administrators become so liable merely because they are such. If the stock is accepted and the relation of partner established between the survivors and the executors, the ease is free from difficulty. But where it is not so accepted they cannot be charged with liability as partners any more than could the devisee who has not accepted.</p>

Doubtless the right to an account and to withdraw the capital of the testator from the business does not exist, by reason of the partnership agreement to the contrary. And so much of the testator’s estate as was invested in the partnership remains and is liable for the debts incurred in the business. Possibly the language of the partnership agreement may be construed as a covenant by each partner with the others-to indemnify them against more than their proper share of loss. But there is nothing in the agreement which can give the creditors of the partnership, whose debts have arisen since the testator’s death, a right to resort to his general estate. For these reasons we are of opinion that upon the case stated the law is with the defendants.</p>
