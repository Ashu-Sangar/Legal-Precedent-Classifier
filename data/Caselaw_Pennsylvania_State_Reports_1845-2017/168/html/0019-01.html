D. Hight. Viewers were appointed upon petition of the Messrs. Hight in 1855, and damages to the amount of $910 were awarded to the owners. These damages were fully paid by the railroad company. The northern boundary of plaintiff’s property is bounded by the towing path of the Pennsylvania canal, now owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. The western boundaiy is the right of way of the Huntingdon &amp; Broad Top Railroad Company. The. southern boundary is the Juniata river, and the eastern, a mill race. The Huntingdon &amp; Broad Top Railroad is located so as to cut off a small section in the northwestern corner of the tract from the main portion of the land. On this corner a small dwelling house is erected.</p>

The owners of this property were paid for that. Whatever damage was done to this property in the location of the road has been settled for and is not, and cannot be, a claim before this jury. Up to somewhere in the summer of 1891, the owners of this property <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>were accustomed to go to and from the premises by traveling upon the towing path of the canal and passing under the bridge of the railroad company or between the trestles of the road. In 1891, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company straightened their tracks in this borough; and the result was that they changed the location of their road and occupied premises further south. The Broad Top Railroad Company then began to reconstruct their roadbed, that is, that which before had been a trestlework was filled up by a solid embankment. After these changes by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the Huntingdon &amp; Broad Top Railroad Company made a solid roadway for their road, and they had a right to do so, as that was within the corporate powers of the company and for the benefit and safety of the public; and whatever damages the construction of that road caused, are not before this jury to be assessed. But the plaintiff alleges and claims that at that period of time, in 1891, by changing the trestlework into a solid embankment, a necessity arose to build upon these premises a causeway, so that Mr. Port might pass with ease and convenience from one portion of his premises to the other, in the occupation and enjoyment of the land; and he claims that he requested the Broad Top Railroad Company to establish a causeway for him and that they refused; and therefore the damages arise which you are to assess in this case for the failure to build that causeway so as to afford convenience of travel over and across the line of this railroad for the accommodation of the occupant and owner of the premises.</p>

That was the original idea of a causeway. Applying it to railroad construction under the act of assembly to which we will presently call your attention, it would seem to be, and we think is, a means, a way, graded so as to make it convenient to cross the track of the road. Whether it be at, above or under grade, we will refer to again hereafter. But it is a means of approach, constructed in whatever suitable manner it may be required, so as to make a passage across the railroad from one side to the other; and whether it be called a causeway or an archway, or a bridge or any other artificial term, it comes down to a passageway across the line of the track. It is that thing <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>that this company refused to do, according to the allegations of the plaintiff; and for the failure to do it damages are sought here. . . .</p>

You have heard the evidence on that subject. [If you come to the conclusion that there was a necessity to build this causeway, the next important question for you to determinéis: Was it practicable to build one— could one be built on the premises of Mr. Port?] [14] In this connection, we say to you Mr. Port has no right to require the railroad company to build him a causeway on any other person’s land than his own. If he wants exit to other people’s land, that he must obtain in a different way. If you find that it was necessary and that it was practicable, then the last question for you to determine is: What damages has Mr. Port sustained by the failure of the company to build that causeway ?</p>

Damages may be either compensatory or punitive. Compensatory damages are the actual damages that a man sustains. Punitive damages are damages that are in their nature of a vindictive character, that is ‘smart money’ to punish a man for doing or not doing a particular thing. The character of the damages involved in this case is that of compensatory damages. If Mi;. Port is entitled to damages, they are simply such damages as are given under the act of assembly; and I, therefore, reread that portion of the act in connection with what I have said to you:</p>

A causeway is in the nature of an internal improvement within the premises themselves. What damages did Mr. Port sustain by the failure of the company to build that causeway ? He alleges and has adduced testimony to show that he is cut off from that triangle, that he cannot use the triangle in connection with the residue of. his property ; and that is the gravamen or gist of his action and must be under the law, because his damages do not arise from the location of the road.</p>

Damages for the failure to build a causeway are in the nature of internal damages to the property, rendering its use and occupation inconvenient. Therefore, you must take into consideration the relation that this triangle, cut off from the other part of the lot, bears to the other part of the lot, with the two used together. Is it inconvenience to Port to be deprived of the use of the triangle in connection with the residue of the property? If he did not so use it, if it was leased or in the possession of another so that he was not using it as part and parcel of his slaughtering establishment, then of course it would most materially affect the amount of damages, because, if he is not damaged in its usé and enjoyment or in the convenient use and enjoyment, it goes to the very basis of the claim for damages. Because any witness may swear that the damages are $5,000 or $500 or any other sum, you are not to allow that sum. You are not to allow damages based upon that theory. It is the real, actual inconvenience to the owner of the property that you are to consider. How much in dollars and cents does that inconvenience amount to ? You do not estimate it by the profits of the business, be<a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>cause 'you cannot go into the question of whether there will be a profit or a loss upon a man’s business. It is the inconvenience or, in a certain sense, the burden that is cast upon the property by the failure to build a causeway there to connect the two parts together, so as to conveniently enjoy them as they might be enjoyed with a causeway there. That is the real basis of the plaintiff’s cljiim in this case, and it is with reference to that that you must ascertain the damages ; and so that you may understand the trial of this case, a great many propositions as to damages were submitted and rejected by the court, because none of them, in the mind of the court, brought the evidence to the real question that underlies this case. You are not to consider, as the measure of damages in this case, the fact that Mr. Port did not have free access to the town, going off his premises. That would enter into the question of damages arising from the construction or location of the road, and they have been assessed and paid; but it is the internal enjoyment and occupation of the premises that is involved in the failure to build a causeway that you notice. Under the act the purpose is stated to be to enable the occupant or occupants of the land to cross or pass over the same with wagons, carts and implements of husbandry. This act would seem primarily to apply to the same plantation that is used in agriculture, so that the owner of the farm may pass from one side of the farm to the other, across the line of the road, with his carts, wagons and implements of husbandry ; and wherever he is impeded by the locations of the road so that he cannot pass from the one to the other without a causeway, it is the duty of the railroad company to furnish a causeway; and, if they fail to do it, they are to pay the owner whatever damages he sustains by that inconvenience.”</p>

The answer allowed the jury to consider the damage incident to the taking of the land, arising from inconvenience in crossing the road and interference with crossings already established. The Supreme Court held this was correct, saying, in this particular, damages should not be included for making the crossings themselves, for they are to be made by the company, but for damages by reason of their not having <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>been constructed. As it was the duty of the company to construct them in the first instance, without any demand, damage for not so doing commensurate with the injury is an incident of the taking, and may be allowed. It is plain that all such damages are to be assessed as incident to the original taking, and lienee are presumed to be included in the assessment made in 1855.</p>

It has no reference to the road crossings, as they are provided for independent of this requirement. If the evidence shows no necessity for the causeway for such purpose, and if it further shows by the testimony of the landowner himself, that such causeway cannot be built over or under the railroad, then the company cannot be considered in default for not so doing, as the law never requires the doing of a vain or impossible tiling; and if it further appears by the plaintiff’s own testimony, uncontradicted by any testimony, that the causeway sought in the proceeding is not to get to such part of his land, but that he virtually seeks a road to get from his land over lands belonging to others, and thence over the line of the railroad into the streets of the town. Since in default of such road or causeway, as termed by plaintiff, damages are to be assessed against the company, then it is apparent to our mind that plaintiff is seeking a second assessment of damages, which in this case were assessed in 1855 and duly paid. Such damages are in our opinion incident to the original taking and cannot be again assessed. Neither do such damages belong to this plaintiff whose title to the lot did not originate until twenty years or more after the construction of the railroad. The question of the necessity of the causeway, etc., was carefully submitted to the jury and their attention was called to the true rule of damages, so that there should be no double assessment. That the measure of damages was the inconvenience plaintiff suffered in the enjoyment of his premises arising out of a failure to con<a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>struct a causeway, the amount of the verdict indicates to our mind that the jury so considered the case and allowed for such damages only.</p>
