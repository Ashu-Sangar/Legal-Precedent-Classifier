Robert, the plaintiff, claimed to recover an undivided one half interest in the land north of the lane. Defendant claimed that Robert and William had made a parol partition, and that William had taken possession of the northern part, and Robert the southern part of the land. Defendant claimed under a sheriff’s deed of the northern part of the land, which had been sold as the property of William McKnight.

In 1875, when Bell was talking to Robert, it was an accidental meeting, and not one sought to derive information in order to make a purchase. There was no privity of relation between Robert and Bell; Robert owed Bell no duty, nor was the situation such that he should either speak or be silent. Nobody was then misled. Bell did not then wish to buy, nor did he then buy.

It is doubtful if it could have operated then. Does the passage of ten years give it any greater efficacy ? To rest for that length of time before the purpose to act is formed* and then to risk the certainty of the title upon the admission, is to invest the doctrine of estoppel with a character which does not attach to it. For these reasons we refuse to instruct you as requested.</p>

A prima facie case for plaintiff was made out by showing that in 1875, in the division of his father’s lands, the eighty-acre tract was <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>allotted and conveyed, by the other heirs, to himself and his brother William McKnight.</p>
    <p id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[168,471,1168,1373]]]'>In substance, defendant’s contention was that at or about the time of said division, the plaintiff Robert McKnight and his brother William made a parol partition, between themselves, of said eighty acres, adopting as their division line a lane which, crossing the tract about midway divided the same into two very nearly equal parts of about forty acres each ; that in pursuance of said partition and possession taken and held thereunder plaintiff became sole owner of the southerly part of said tract, and his brother William sole owner of the northerly part, —the land now in controversy; that the last mentioned piece, thus acquired in severalty by William McKnight, was after-wards sold by the sheriff, as his property, and conveyed to A. L. McCartney under whom defendant claims. In support of this contention considerable testimony, direct as well as circumstantial, was introduced by the defendant; and on the other hand the plaintiff introduced rebutting evidence, tending to show that no parol partition of the eighty-acre lot had ever been made between him and his brother William. The alleged parol partition, on which defendant relied, thus became the controlling question of fact in the case. It is not our purpose to either review or summarize the testimony bearing on the subject, but an examination of the record has satisfied us that the cause could not have been withdrawn from the jury. The question was fairly submitted to them by the learned trial judge in a clear and able charge, which, considered as a whole, is free from any substantial error. We find nothing in the record that would justify us in reversing the judgment.</p>
