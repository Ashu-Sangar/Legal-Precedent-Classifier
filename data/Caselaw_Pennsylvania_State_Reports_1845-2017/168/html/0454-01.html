The court then ordered that the report be filed and laid before the grand jury at the March sessions. On March 11, 1893, the grand jury made their return approving the action of the viewers. No further action was taken in the matter until Feb. 5, 1894, when exceptions were filed.</p>

A bridge proceeding begins with the petition for viewers and is not complete until the county commissioners make the final order approving the report of viewers. An intermediate order of court is not final and is not the subject of appeal. The litigation attending the appeals from those various stages and orders in the proceeding may be entirely unnecessary, as the commissioners may refuse to approve the matter, or may so exercise the discretion conferred upon them by the act of May 25,1887, 267, that no appeal will be desired.</p>

L. 560, the thirty-fifth section of which provides, among other things, that “ if, on the report of viewers, it shall appear to the court, grand jury and commissioners of the county that such bridge is necessary and would be too expensive for such township or townships, it shall be entered on record as a county bridge.” In the decree of court finding “ that said bridge is necessary and would be too expensive for said boroughs of Connellsville and New Haven,” and approving “ the report <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>of the viewers and finding of the grand jury,” it is accordingly “ ordered that the same be referred to the commissioners .... for such action as they may deem expedient and proper in accordance with law; and, if approved by them, that the same be recorded as a county bridge.” This decree is at best only provisional. It is neither effective nor final unless the county commissioners concur in the findings of the court and the grand jury. If they refuse to concur, without more, the proceeding falls. It they elect to exercise the authority vested in them by the first section of the act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 267, and merely assist in building the bridge, a different result is accomplished. It does not appear in this case, nor is it even alleged that the commissioners have taken any action in the premises. If they have not, this appeal is clearly premature ; and, acting on that assumption, we think the appeal should be quashed.</p>
