Moreover, it is the court which is to judge of the expediency of excluding farm lands under the provisions of the act of 1863. To submit the question to the grand jury would be to deprive the court of the discretion which the legislature plainly intended it should exercise. The court possesses a discretion to grant or refuse the application, but it cannot grant something different from what the petitioners ask. The application of the residents of the northern end of the territory, described in the petition, to be excluded, is clearly beyond any power possessed by the court in any case. The petitions of O. W. Beaty, D. W. Beaty, and others, to have their individual properties excluded as farm lands are not within the powers of the court in the present case; but even if they were, we could not grant them, for the reason that these properties manifestly constitute a part of the village of Glade, and could not be ex-<a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>eluded without leaving a portion of Glade township lying between the two ends of one of the principal streets of the borough, as it would be after annexation.] ” [7]</p>

L. 150. The record shows that the proceedings, from beginning to end, are regular and in strict conformity with all the essential requirements of the act; and, unless there be substantial merit in one or more of the specifications of error, the decree, based on the findings of the grand jury and subsequent approval thereof by the court, should not be disturbed.</p>

Some of the appellants presented petitions, remonstrating against the inclusion of their lands in the territory proposed to be annexed, etc., and moved the court for leave to send the same before the grand jury for their consideration. The court, considering these papers incompetent <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>as evidence, or for any purpose, denied the motion, “ but without prejudice to the right of the remonstrants to show any facts, affecting the expediency of the proposed annexation, to the grand jury.” This conceded to the remonstrants everything they were entitled to. The act after specifically prescribing the form, etc., of application for annexation “ of any lots, out-lots or other tracts adjacent to a borough,” provides that the court “shall cause the application to be laid before the grand jury, and if a majority of said grand jury, after a full investigation of the case shall find that the conditions prescribed by the act have been complied with, and shall believe that it is expedient to grant the prayer of the petitioners, they shall certify the same to the court, which .certificate shall be entered of record, and may be confirmed by the court.” The “full investigation of the case” that the grand jury is thus required to make must, of course, be conducted according to the ordinary rules of evidence. Recitals and allegations of fact, contained in remonstrances, promiscuous^ signed, are not competent evidence of the facts in regard to which it is made the duty of the grand jury to inquire. There is no merit in either of said specifications.</p>

There is no merit in the sixth and seventh specifications ; nor is there anything in either of the other specifications that requires further notice.
