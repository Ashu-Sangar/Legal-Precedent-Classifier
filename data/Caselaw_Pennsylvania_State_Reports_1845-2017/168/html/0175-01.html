The testator created two trusts by his will, first, for the management and administration of his whole estate, undivided, and the distribution of the net income, during his widow’s life and as much longer as the children should agree to continue that arrangement, and secondly, on the severance of the joint management, a separate use trust for his daughters. His intention to exclude the husbands of his daughters covered both situations. Under the first trust the husbands had no control, because the daughters were only entitled to their shares of the net income-<a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>In the second situation a formal separate use was established. As the intent to exclude the husbands in both cases is therefore clear, and as that is all that is required, the interest of Mrs. Cobb in her father’s estate from the time of his death must be treated as a present interest in net revenue only, and a remainder in fee subject to a separate use trust, and whether her death occurred during the prior life estate of the widow, or after its termination made no difference in the substance but only in the form of the trust, and of her control over the property.</p>
    <p id="b197-5" data-blocks='[["BL_197.4",197,[156,852,1169,454]]]'>We have therefore the question whether in the absence of express authority given by the instrument creating the trust, a married woman can pass such an estate by will. It has been argued with great force that as the remainder is in fee simple, and the restriction of alienation is in derogation of an essential incident of that estate, it should not be carried beyond the extent actually necessary to reach the end equity has in view,— the protection of the wife from the influence as well as the power of her husband, — and that does not go beyond her life.</p>

Folwell has been followed uniformly from Stahl v. Crouse, <a href="/pa/1/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="949871" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0111-01">1 Pa.
