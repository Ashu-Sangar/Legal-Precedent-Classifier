To his account was added a suggestion that he has received payment of the principal of certain items in the inventory in cash §16,735.84, and by conveyance of land §2,844. By the will of Christian Long, J. L. Barner, the executor, was made a trustee to hold almost all the personal estate and a portion of the realty for the period of twenty years, “ paying, however, any accumulation greater than may be necessary to pay taxes, insurance, etc., to the six children of the testator or their lineal descendants, should they die before the expiration of said period, and at the termination of said twenty years to sell the same and distribute it as is provided with reference to the income of the property so given in trust.”</p>

Barner, the executor, had claimed and been allowed credits in his accounts which were erroneous and improper. That sums aggregating §1,642 had been paid to Charles Geiger without due proof, and that the same was for exorbitant charges for boarding and so forth. That the compensation for which the accountant took credit, to wit, §15,810.08, was largely in excess of what he was legally entitled to, as not more than §50,000 of the estate had been administered on. That in the debit side of the account upon which the charges for commissions are based is an item of §26,000, which is no part of the general estate, but a trust fund for the use of the children of Ira L. Long, deceased.</p>

He further set forth that $2,147.91 had been paid to the distributees prior to the audit and that during its pendency $2,110 additional had been paid, and that Mabel M.

The appellant John L. Barner was named as his executor, and after the death of Long proceeded to make probate of the will and take letters testamentary. In March, 1893, he settled an account, which is described in the petition as a partial account, and which was at that time confirmed nisi. It was finally confirmed early in May. On the 18th day of May the petition of Mabel M. Wade of Alexandria, Va., by her guardian James H. Loh, was presented in the orphans’ court, asking to have the decree of confirmation set aside or opened, and the account re-examined as to several items specified in the petition. A rule to show cause was granted, upon which the appellant came in and made answer distinctly denying the several allegations on which the prayer for relief in the petition <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>rested. No testimony seems to have been taken to dispose of the issues so made, but the rule was taken up for hearing on petition and answer and made absolute generally. The order appealed from is thus seen to be an interlocutory one. It opens-a decree of confirmation upon an application promptly made by one who was a minor when the account was filed, and unrepresented by a guardian or otherwise. No appeal lies from such an order: Jones’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/99/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="99 Pa. 124" data-case-ids="446119" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0124-01">99 Pa. 124</a>. But as we have the papers before us we feel that it is proper for us to speak of the practice in these cases and the course this proceeding ought now to take. The only item among those enumerated as mistaken or erroneous that could be disposed of by the orphans’ court without testimony was that of compensation.
