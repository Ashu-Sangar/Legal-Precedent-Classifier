On the 8th of October, 1892, the plaintiff sued the company before Harry C. Davidson, Esq., a justice of the peace in Bedford-borough, and recovered a judgment, from which the company appealed and the defendant became surety on the recognizance to secure the appeal. It was taken under the 1st section of the act of March 15, 1847, P. L. 361, in these words:</p>

On June 27, 1893, the parties to this suit entered into an agreement to try it before the court without a jury, under the act of April 22, 1874. On the 17th of July, 1893, the evidence was taken.</p>

Ross, <a href="/pa/107/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="107 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="8857122" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0231-01">107 Pa. 231</a>; Endlich on Int. of Stat., secs. 368, 369.</p>

Co., 2 Pears. 306, to support this theory. That was not the construction placed on the act of 1817: Schuylkill Nav. Co. v. Thomas, 13 S. &amp; R. 431; Morris v. Del. &amp; Schuylkill Cana] Co., <a href="/watts-serg/4/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 461" data-case-ids="1856525" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0461-01">4 W. &amp; S. 461</a>; Turnpike Co. v.

      <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>“ From these oases it will be seen that the act of 1817 was held to apply to appeals from arbitrators, aldermen, and justices of the peace. Hence, under the rule of construction just mentioned, <a href="/pa/107/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="107 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="8857122" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0231-01">107 Pa. 231</a>, 232, it follows that the act of 1847 must likewise be held to apply to appeals in such cases. The latter act was passed, as its language indicates, to settle existing doubts as to the effect of the 1st section of the act of 1845 on appeals and writs of error by corporations, and those doubts were dispelled by a re-enactment of the precise words of the act of 1817. We regard the act of 1847 as being in full force to-day, as far as it relates to appeals from justices of the peace, unaffected by the later enactments of March 21, 1849, P. L. 216, and April 25, 1850, P. L. 571. The first of these relates only to-foreign corporations in suits brought in courts of record, while the 12th section of the other concerns only appeals from awards of arbitrators and leaves untouched the subject of appeals from justices of the peace. The industry and acumen of counsel on both sides, aided by our own examination, have failed to discover any expression of the Supreme Court, since the passage of the latter statutes, as to their effect on the act of 1847, and those of the lower courts are in conflict. By far the best considered case we have seen of the common pleas courts, is that of Rush v. Life Asso., supra, in which Judge Archbald, after a very intelligent review of the various statutes and decisions, holds that the act of 1847 is still in force except as modified by the act of 1850 concerning appeals from awards of arbitrators alone. He says its ‘ provisions as to other appeals by corporations than those from awards of arbitrators, of course, remain unaffected and in force.’</p>

R. 387, yet Judge Furst treats the act of 1847 as in force and applying to appeals from justices of the peace, and the only reason the bail was not held in that case was because the appeal was not filed, and there being no affirmance of the judgment, the condition of the recognizance was not broken.</p>
