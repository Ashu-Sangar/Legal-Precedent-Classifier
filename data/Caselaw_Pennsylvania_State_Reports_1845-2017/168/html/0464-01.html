He was to receive as compensation five per cent on the total cost of the work. On Oct. 28, 1889, he was again employed to draw up plans and specifications for the erection of a- new court house. The evidence showed that in consideration of the fact that the other contract was running at the same time, he agreed to take three per cent for supervising the work under the second contract. After the plans for the new court house had been adopted and the contract- let, the county commissioners determined that additional land was needed for the-proper location of the building. This led to a delay of sixteen-<a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>mouths, and the commissioners accordingly voted to increase the plaintiff’s compensation to four per cent on the total cost of the work.</p>

That under the contract of Oct. 28, 1889, and the acceptance thereof, the plaintiff was bound to prepare all necessary plans and specifications, and give an architectural supervision to said court house during its erection, without regard to the time consumed therein, and that any change required by the commissioners on said plans and designs should be made without extra cost over and above the commission of three percent on the contract price. <em>Answer: </em>That is affirmed, if said contract was not subsequently changed by the parties. We have already so instructed you. If this case depends upon the original contract, this plaintiff would only be entitled to three per cent; but if there was a subsequent contract for a sufficient consideration, as I have explained to you, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover under that contract.” [7]</p>

Nor do we think that either of the-assignments of error requires special consideration.
