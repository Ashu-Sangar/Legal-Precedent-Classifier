A vote was taken the day before the return was made, which resulted in a majority of one in the grand jury in favor of the borough. After the adjournment two of the grand jurors who had voted in favor of the borough desired to change their vote, and consulted counsel not concerned upon either side as to their right to have the finding reconsidered, and he advised them that they had such right. They sent then for one of the witnesses called by the remonstrants, to appear before the grand jury, the next morning, and when he came, at their request, they informed him of their intention to change their votes.

The remonstrance was signed by sixty-five persons besides the eleven who had withdrawn their names from the petition, making seventy-six who were then opposed to the borough. A considerable number of the petitioners were not freeholders, so that a majority of the freeholders then appeared as opposing the borough.

There is nothing in the record which shows that they were residents of the borough as incorporated, or that any resident of it excepts to the decree of.incorporation. If therefore they have any standing to contest the decree we may fairly infer that it is as residents or taxpayers of the township affected by it. But as the township was not prejudiced by a modification of boundaries which saved to it a tract of valuable land they ought to base their attack on the decree on other grounds if any appear in the record to warrant it. We are not prepared to say that parties who opposed the inclusion of the land can object to the exclusion of it on the ground that a formal request to exclude it was not made by the owners of it. An owner who requested that his land be excluded from the proposed borough would not be allowed to attack the decree of incorporation on the ground that his request was complied with, and if in lieu of a formal request he filed a specific objection to the inclusion of it he ought not to complain that his objection was removed by the decree.</p>

We discover no error in the ruling on this exception. Nor do we think any error was committed in overruling the second exception. In that it was alleged that, at the time the petition for the incorporation of the borough was submitted to the grand jury, a sufficient number of petitioners had withdrawn their names from it, by leave of court, to defeat the application. The record does not show that any of the petitioners withdrew their names from the petition or that leave was granted to them by the court to withdraw their names from it. This alone is a sufficient answer to the exception. But the exception was not supported by the evidence. An attempt was made to show that on the day the petition was laid before the grand jury a written request was presented to the court in behalf of some of the petitioners for leave to withdraw their names from the petition, on which request Judge Sittser. made the following indorsement: “ 11 May 1892 leave granted to lay the within before the grand jury.” This indorsement was not in terms or by necessary or reasonable implication leave to withdraw their names. Besides at that stage of the proceedings they had no right to withdraw them. But we need not further discuss or consider the evidence submitted in support of the exceptions. It has been duly considered and passed upon by the court below. All the jurisdictional facts appear upon the record and we find nothing in it to require us to reverse the decree. We therefore overrule the specifications.</p>
