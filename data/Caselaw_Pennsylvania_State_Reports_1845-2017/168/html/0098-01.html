When their mother died, they divided their father’s personal estate between them, and when they sold a piece of real estate the proceeds were also divided, so that whatever came into their hands in the way of cash, whether it was principal or income, was forthwith divided. There was put in evidence the receipts, showing forty-six settlements of this kind since the death of the mother in 1877, in every one of which Edward J. Palethorp participated and took the same share of cash as the other children; besides, he was one of the executors of his mother’s estate, and one of the persons who made the distribution; certainly, if he were alive, he could not gainsay or dispute these forty-six settlements made by him during a period of seventeen years, much less can his widow now do so.</p>

They were entirely satisfied with the accounts, they made their settlements for forty-six times, the last of which was only a few weeks before Edward J. Palethorp’s death. Now there is nothing which the law regards as more sacred than these family settlements, and it would have to be a very strong case indeed, which would justify any court in setting them aside, particularly where they have been continued uninterruptedly for so many years, — nothing short of gross fraud, of which there is no evidence in this case.
