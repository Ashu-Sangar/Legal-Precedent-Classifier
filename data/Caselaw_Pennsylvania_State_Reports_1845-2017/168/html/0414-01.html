Plaintiff claimed that the written agreement did not embody the actual terms of the contract between the parties, and that, in addition to the price named in the written contract, defendant was to pay ten cents per barrel for piping the oil. Plaintiff was the only witness who testified in support of this claim. <em>Held, </em>that in the absence of another witness in support of plaintiff’s claim, or of corroborating circumstances equivalent to the testimony of another witness, plaintiff was not entitled to recover the ten cents per barrel addition for piping.</p>

R. H. Thayer was the only Avitness who testified for plaintiff upon this subject. He stated that his understanding of the agreement Avas that the Thayer Oil Company Avas to receive from Mr. Seep as high a price for the oil to be delivered in the future as should be paid to any other partj'-, and ten cents per barrel in addition thereto, which sum of ten cents per barrel he stated he understood they were to receive as pipage on the future production as a consideration for abandoning their pipe line.</p>

In the present case, there is evidence to submit to the jury of the agreement between the parties, and of the inducement to the plaintiff to sign the contract, and that the contract, as written, does not express the agreement of the parties as to the ten cents per barrel additional price to be paid on account of the abandoning of the plaintiff’s pipe line. If the jury find from the evidence that the witness, O’Day, was acting for and in behalf of the defendant, Joseph Seep, in reference to the negotiations of this contract, and that, in such -negotiations, he was afterwards joined by W. T. Scheide, who was also acting for the defendant, Joseph Seep, and that those two conducted all negotiations with the plaintiffs prior and up to the signing of the contract, the defendant, Joseph Seep, is bound by the contract which they made, and the reading over of the contract, before it was executed, by the defendant’s attorney, if wrongly drawn, did not relieve the defendant from the oral agreement of his agents, if the plaintiff was'misled into signing. Answer: So much of this point as states that there is evidence to submit to the jury of the agreement of the parties, and of the inducement of the plaintiff to sign the contract, and that the contract, as written, does not express the agreement of the parties as to ten cents per barrel additional price to be paid on account of the abandonment of the plaintiff’s pipe line, is denied. In the opinion of the court there is not sufficient evidence to submit to the jury to pass upon that question. The remainder of the point is affirmed.
