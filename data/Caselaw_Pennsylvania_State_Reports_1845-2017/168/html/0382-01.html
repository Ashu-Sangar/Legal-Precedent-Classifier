Evidence for the plaintiff tended to show that at the point where the accident occurred the <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>planks of the sidewalk were worn and loose. One witness testified that the sidewalk had been in a defective condition for six months. Another stated that the planks were rotten, and some were broken off, and that the walk had been in this condition for eleven months. The evidence for defendant showed that plaintiff had walked over the sidewalk daily during the entire spring and winter preceding the accident. Witnesses for defendant also testified that the sidewalk was in good condition.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b403-3" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[186,823,701,43]]]'>The court charged in part as follows :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.5",403,[142,874,1172,507]]]'>“ [Now, gentlemen, any defect which existed in the walk at the time when Mr. Schramling examined it, and which was apparent to a person examining it with ordinary care, of course the borough had actual notice of it; notice to him would be notice to the borough, under those circumstances. This would be an important question for you to determine. What was the condition of the walk at that time ? He testifies that there were no such defects as are described by the plaintiff’s witnesses at that time ; substantially, that there were no broken planks and no loose planks that he discovered.] [1]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.6",403,[143,1387,1171,915]]]'>“ There is evidence, too, that the burgess, Mr. Smith, was accustomed to walk over the walk about every day. That you may consider in respect to the question of actual notice of the defects in the walk. He testifies that he did not discover any such defects as described by the plaintiff, and he thinks he would have discovered them if there had been any there. All this is for you. You must determine from this conflicting testimony what the true facts are. What was the actual condition of this sidewalk at the time when the accident occurred, and how long had it existed prior to that time ? If it was actually known, as I have said to you, by the officers that the sidewalk was dangerous, and for an unreasonable time they neglected to repair it, or, if it had been dangerous so long that, considering its situation, the amount of travel over the walk, the public place the walk occupied and all the circumstances in the case, the officers by exercising reasonable and ordinary care should have known of it and failed to repair it, then they were negligent.” [2]</p>

As I have said, she was not bound to the exercise of extraordinary care ; but she was bound to use such care as a person of ordinaiy prudence, situated as she was, under like circumstances, would use, and if she neglected that it would be negligence.] [7]</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b404-7" data-blocks='[["BL_404.7",404,[271,1584,1171,454]]]'>“ 5. Unless the jury find that the alleged dangerous condition of the walk was so open, notorious and apparent as to be noticeable to all who had occasion to pass the place or to observe the-premises, and unless they disbelieve all the defendant’s witnesses who testify that such was not the case, the verdict should be for the defendant. <em>Answer.: </em>Also the fifth point is-refused, because it assumes that there is no evidence of any kind of actual notice of the condition of the walk, which is not, as I view it. [4]</p>

Reasonable care and reasonable conduct, under all the circumstances, is what you should apply to this plaintiff as well as the defendant’s officers.” [5]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[152,765,1164,713]]]'>“ 3. If the jury believe that the plaintiff was suffering from a rupture before the 10th of May, 1893, there can be no recovery of damages for that cause. <em>Answer: </em>Of course, gentlemen, that is correct; she cannot recover for anything which was not caused by the accident. She testifies that she had no rupture prior to that time; if you are satisfied from all the evidence that she did, and that this statement by her, that the rupture was occasioned by the accident, is not true, you will exclude that entirely from the case ; and it would go a long way to discredit her testimony in every particular where she is contradicted by other witnesses. If you find that she lias testified falsely in respect to that, of course it would make it very difficult for you to believe her wherever she is contradicted by other witnesses as to any other matter.” [6]</p>
