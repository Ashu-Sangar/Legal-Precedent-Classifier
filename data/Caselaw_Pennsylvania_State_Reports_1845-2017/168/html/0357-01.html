That by a supplement to said act of assembly, approved April 12, 1864, entitled ‘ An act extending so much of the provisions of the act to incorporate the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, approved April 13, 1846, as relates to the making of lateral or branch railroads to the Lebanon Valley and Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Companies,’ the right to make lateral or branch roads, leading from the main line of its railroad to places or points in any of the counties into or through which the said main line may pass, was conferred upon the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company. That the defendant the River Front Railroad Company, was incorporated on the 15th day of May, 1876, under the provisions of an act of assembly, approved April 4,1868, entitled ‘ An act to authorize the formation and regulation of railroad companies,’ ‘ for the purpose of constructing, operating, and maintaining a railroad for public use for the conveyance of persons and property to be located in the <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>city and county of Philadelphia and to extend from the point of connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad as then located, constructed, and in use at Delaware avenue and Dock street, by such route as should be approved by the select and common councils of the city of Philadelphia, to a point of connection with the Philadelphia &amp; Trenton Railroad at its Kensington depot grounds at Harrison and Leib streets.’ That by the twelfth section of said act of April 4, 1868, it is provided that ‘ no corporation formed thereunder shall enter upon or occupy any street, lane, or alley in any incorporated city without the consent of such city being first obtained.’ That in 1877 the River Front Railroad Company and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company each proposed building a branch railroad upon the same streets in the city of Philadelphia, and it was agreed between them that the two companies should build and own jointly a single line between Callowhill and Cumberland streets, and an ordinance of the city of Philadelphia was passed and approved May 21, 1877, entitled ‘ An ordinance to authorize the River Front Railroad Company and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company to severally and jointly occupy and use certain streets for railroad purposes.’ That the legal effect of the ordinance was to give the consent of the city of Philadelphia to both of said railroad companies to enter on and occupy the streets named therein. That in accordance with the agreement aforesaid, and the provisions of the ordinance mentioned, the two railroad companies did construct jointly in the year 1881 a double-track railroad extending from the south side of Cumberland street along Beach street to Shackamaxon street; thence through private property to Delaware avenue- and along Delaware avenue to Callowhill street, in the Eleventh ward of the said city, and the cost of construction was borne equally by the said two companies, and the same is owned by them as equal tenants in common. That the said railroad until May 1,1889, was maintained and operated by both the said companies jointly under the terms of an agreement, a copy of which, marked ‘ Exhibit D,’ is annexed as part of the bill. That at present the River Front Railroad Company is leased and operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, a corporation existing under the laws of this commonwealth, and that the president of the said River Front Railroad Company is one of the vice presi<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>dents of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and the board of directors of the former company is composed entirely of persons who are also directors of the latter. That the railroad of the River Front Railroad Company extends both north and south of the joint railroad before mentioned, and connects the railroad of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company at Dock street, in the Fifth ward of the city of Philadelphia, with the Philadelphia &amp; Trenton Railroad Company, which is leased and operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad, at a point in the Twenty-fifth ward of said city. That the said railroad between Callowhill street and Cumberland street is also connected with the main line of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad at a point just north of Cumberland street, and the traffic of said railroad between Callowhill street and Cumberland street is exclusively transported in cars to the separate railroads of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company. Numerous warehouses, wharves, and other places of business are situated along the line of the common railroad, and since its construction, turnouts and sidings have been constructed connecting the same with said warehouses, wharves, and places of business. That in pursuance of the agreement referred to of May 1, 1882, Exhibit D, the plaintiff and defendant alternated in taking charge of the maintenance of said line of railroad on Delaware avenue up to the 1st of May, 1887, when it became the right of. the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad to take charge of the maintenance of said line under said agreement. That said company was then in the hands of receivers, and, at the instance of the River Front Railroad Company, permitted that company to take charge of the maintenance of said line on Delaware avenue from the 1st of May, 1887, to the 1st of May, 1888. That this arrangement was entirely provisional and only had application to the year beginning May 1, 1887, and ending May 1, 1888. That the River Front Railroad continued in charge of said railroad during the year extending from May, 1888, to May, 1889. That prior to the 1st of May, 1889, the plaintiff desired to take charge of the maintenance of the line for the year extending from the 1st of May, 1889, in accordance with said agreement, and notified the River Front Railroad Company of its purpose so to do, and to this end entered into possession of the railroad on Delaware avenue. That the River Front Railroad <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>Company then, unlawfully and in violation of the terms of said agreement, procured a large number of men, and placed them along the line of the railroad, and forcibly prevented the plaintiff from making the repairs necessary to maintain the line on said Delaware avenue, and further obstructed and interfered with the plaintiff in the exercise of the rights vested in it by the terms of the agreement in regard to the maintenance of said road. That in order to preserve the public peace, the mayor of the city of Philadelphia directed the maintenance of said line on Delaware avenue to be taken in charge of the Department of Public Safety of the city of Philadelphia, and that the road since May 1,1889, has been maintained by the mayor of the city of Philadelphia, acting through the Department of Public Safety. That the River Front Railroad Company denies the right of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company to take charge of the said road at any time, under said agreement, and the plaintiff is thereby deprived of the rights vested in it under the agreement, including the right to take charge and maintain said road.</p>
