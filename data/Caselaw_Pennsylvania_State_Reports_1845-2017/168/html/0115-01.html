Of course, if you find that whatever she did for this deceased lady was simply the ordinary, kindly, courteous acts of people living in the same house, that were rendered without expectation of receiving pay, and without expectation of being paid for, your verdict ought to be for the defendant, and the plaintiff ought not to receive any verdict.
