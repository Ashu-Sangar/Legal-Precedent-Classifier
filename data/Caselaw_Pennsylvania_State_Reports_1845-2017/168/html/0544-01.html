This line was completed in July, 1883, but the Reading at that period was involved in financial difficulties and during the three following years was in the hands of receivers and, as the answer alleges, the said line was not ‘properly' completed and operated until March, 1887. Nevertheless it had been used in the transportation of coal, and during the four preceding years nearly a million and a half tons had passed over the road, the Catawissa getting its proportion of the freight on that part of its line between West Milton and Williamsport.</p>

In the same year the Pine Creek Railroad was opened from Newberry Junction to Jersey Shore, and in the course of the two following years the other parties to the aforesaid agreement and its supplements had completed the extensions and made the connections they had stipulated to make, and thus through a system of connecting lines was formed a new line from Philadelphia to Buffalo. These connections greatly increased the business of the Catawissa road. Between the years 1883 and 1887 hard coal was carried from Shamokin to West Milton and thence over the Catawissa to Newberry Junction, and soft coal from Newberry Junction by the way of Williamsport over the Catawissa to its eastern terminus; and passengers and' miscellaneous freights over the entire line of the Catawissa to and from Williamsport.</p>

The anthracite and bituminous coal traffic arose entirely from the connections established by reason of the agreement of Feb. 4, 1882, and its supplements, as well as the miscellaneous through traffic. Apart from these sources of business the traffic proper to the Catawissa road was declining rather than increasing. In 1883 it lost the transportation of oil by reason of the construction of the pipe line, thus causing a reduction in its revenue of nearly $150,000 per annum, and the lumber trade which had been a chief factor in its transportation was from its nature in process of diminution.</p>

The Catawissa had been leased by the Reading for the term of nine, hundred and ninety-nine years; subject to the covenants of the lease the Reading had practically become the owner of the-<em>road; </em>it had passed into its possession and was a part of its. system. The Shamokin, Sunbury <em>&amp; </em>Lewisburg was likewise a part of its system and owned by it. There is nothing in the lease of the Catawissa that restricts the right of the Reading to extend its own line; that such extension is made through, and by means of an independent- organization does not affect: the question. The Shamokin, Sunhury &amp; Lewisburg Road was built, owned and controlled by the Reading Road. The-lease as between the parties was a mere formula. The building of such a road under such circumstances, the master is of opinion, in nowise conflicts with section 4 of article 17 of the constitution of Pennsylvania. The constitutional inhibition-relates to a different condition of things altogether. It is-intended to prevent one independent railroad corporation from, leasing or purchasing or controlling the works or franchises, of another independent corporation having under its eo:itrol or owning a parallel or competing line. The evil aimed at was the acquisition by one railroad of a rival road, and thus suppressing competition. The building by one road of another railroad to facilitate traffic is a totally different thing.</p>

Under any circumstances a parallel road, if it is not at the same time a competing road, doubtless, does not fall within the prohibition of the constitution. And in deciding the question whether a road is a competing road an important factor in the decision must always be the distance on either side of it from which it can draw its traffic. In France, where this question has been studied more scientifically perhaps than elsewhere, in calculating the probable traffic of a new line all <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>sources of traffic lying more than from three to six miles on either side of it are excluded.

    <p class="summary" id="b570-6" data-blocks='[["BL_570.6",570,[316,1065,1163,391]]]'>“5. In stipulating to maintain and increase the business of the Catawissa, by all proper and reasonable means, the Reading did not thereby restrict or yield its right to promote its own business. By the extension of its own line and the connections which it made with other lines it brought into existence a very large amount of new traffic. In the transportation of this new traffic it uses a part of the Catawissa line. The contention is that it was bound to use the whole.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b570-7" data-blocks='[["BL_570.7",570,[317,1474,1162,804]]]'>“ 6. The master does not concur in this view of the question. By making use of the Catawissa as a link in the new line, established by the agreement of <em>Feb. </em>4, 1882, and its supplements, the Reading threw upon that portion of the Catawissa, thus used, as already stated, a very large amount of new traffic. It .could do no more without impairing its own interests. In other words, the Reading while greatly promoting the business of the Catawissa, by using a part of its line in the transportation of the new traffic created by the Reading, was under no moral or legal obligation to diminish or impair its own business, by using the whole line, even though there were no impediments to its use. That it did temporarily use the whole is of no consequence. The Catawissa was benefited by such temporary use. But such temporary use, while the Reading was finally completing or perfecting its own line, established no right to a permanent use.</p>

But <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>this, in the master’s view of the case, is an unimportant inquiry, because he is of opinion that the Reading was bound by no legal duty or obligation to transfer the new traffic to that line, whether rebuilt or not.</p>

It is further contended that at the time the lease was made the Catawissa was contemplating the opening of a western connection, and is entitled to the new business arising from the connections made, or to be made, with other roads.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[148,794,1161,963]]]'>“ 9. Whether the Catawissa before the lease could have made connections (assuming that it contemplated making them) giving it an outlet to northern and western points is conjectural. The chief consideration that enabled the Reading to form these connections was her fields of anthracite coal, and she built the Shamokin, Sunbury &amp; Lewisburg Railroad in order to send it forward, and the other roads to the north and west, extended their liues in order to receive and forward it, as well as to find a new market for their soft coal. But whether the Catawissa could or could not have formed similar connections, had it retained the power to form them, it nevertheless received its equitable proportion of the new traffic created by the connections made by the Reading, by having that part of its road between Williamsport and West Milton used as a link in the new line. There is nothing in the lease, nor in the nature of things, which raises any obligation on the part of the Reading, when, as under the circumstances of this case, it can use with advantage a part of the Catawissa, and with profit to both roads, to use the whole, though with inconvenience and loss to its own.</p>

This is not obvious, and it would seem that the natural growth of a railroad’s traffic is that which comes from the development of the country along its lines, the founding of industries, the opening of mines, if mines there are, and the increase of trade and population. Be this as it may, the master <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>is. of opinion that the clause in the lease requiring, on the part of the lessee, the use of all proper and reasonable means to maintain and increase the business of the road, does not require, as a part of these means, the building of new lines.

By the lease of Oct. 10, 1872, which was for 999 years, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company became the proprietor and virtual owner of the Catawissa Railroad upon the terms and subject to the covenants contained in the lease. At the date of the lease, and previously thereto, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Company operated several small connecting roads, extending from the eastern terminus of the Catawissa Railroad at Tamanend to Shamokin.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b573-3" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[169,948,1165,1216]]]'>“About ten years after the lease of the Catawissa to the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Company entered into contracts with the New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad Company, and several other smaller companies, to build a connecting link from Shamokin to West Milton, intersecting the Catawissa Road at that point.' The chief object of this was to open an outlet from the Schuylkill coal region northward and westward, by the way of Williamsport, for the transportation of anthracite coal to the markets of those regions, and for the mutual benefit of all the roads interested, including the Catawissa, for that road, belonging to the lessee, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, constituted between West. Milton and Newberry Junction a necessary part of the new system of outlet. All the roads interested would, of course, benefit more or less by the building of the new link, for all would share to a greater or less extent in the profits of the newly opened transportation, axxd they woixld share also in the benefit resulting from the return freight over the portions of the sevexul lines used, whether it consisted of the soft coal brought from the west or the general merchandise coming from the same direction. In order that tlxe system of connections should be completed, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, after the lease, extended, at its own cost, the Catawissa Road from Williamsport to Newberx-y Junction.</p>

Was it in any sense a competing road, the acquisition of which is prohibited by article XVII. of <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>the constitution ? The object of the prohibition was clearly, as the master has pointed out, to prevent one independent railroad corporation from acquiring possession of the road of another independent company which is operating a competing line. It was to prevent the buying up by one railroad corporation of a competing line and the establishment thereby of a monopoly. The building by a company of an additional road for the purpose of facilitating and enlarging its own business can, by no fair process of reasoning, be contended to be within the constitutional prohibition, unless, indeed, a man can be said to compete with himself when he enlarges his own business or enters into a new one. Where there is competition there must be competitors, and with what propriety can the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Company, running and operating the Sliamokin, Sunbury &amp; Lewisburg, be said to compete with itself in operating another railroad, which is its property, or is to be under its exclusive control for nine hundred and ninety-nine years ? Competition in business is out of the question where all the business is in the hands of the same individual. It is also quite clear from all the evidence that the Shamokin, Sunbury &amp; Lewisburg Road was not built as a competing road with the Catawissa, nor for any such purpose. Its sole object was to open up new northern and western connections for the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, by an alliance with other interests and powerful roads which had no connections with the Catawissa, and between which and the Catawissa there had never been any competition nor rivalry whatsoever, and could not be under existing conditions at the time when the new road was built</p>

If it was-the owner, then it was simply building an additional line for itself. There is no question in the case, therefore, of baying up a competing line. There was not a word in the lease by which the Philadelphia &amp; Reading acquired the Catawissa which prevented the building of new roads by it and forming any new connections which it might desire or consider profitable for the enlargement of its own business. It is apparent, therefore,' that it was neither prohibited by the constitution <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>nor precluded by its agreement with the Catawissa from continuing its road from Shamokin to West Milton. And if it had the right to build the road it had the right to use it, and to all the profit to be derived from its use and operation, and with this I dismiss the point.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b575-3" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[181,648,1164,1778]],["BL_576.1",576,[249,404,1166,1051]]]'>“Upon the second point, viz, that the defendant has made an unfair use of the Shamokin, Sunbury &amp; Lewisburg Road, by-diverting traffic from the Catawissa Road, and sending it over the Shamokin, Sunbury &amp; Lewisburg, for the purpose of benefiting itself, and at the expense of the rental to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff, we are of the opinion, after the examination of the evidence, that no case has been made out by the plaintiff which entitles it to equitable relief. It is important, in the first place, to understand properly the scope of the covenant which the plaintiff alleges the defendant has broken, and the extent of the obligations which that covenant imposed upon the defendant. What the plaintiff chiefly relies upon is the covenant contained in the eighth article of the lease, by which it was agreed by the defendant that it would maintain the Catawissa in good order and condition, operate it with reasonable care and efficiency, and use all proper and reasonable means to maintain and increase the business thereof. The plaintiff contends that the defendant has broken the last clause of the covenant, in not transporting all freight which comes to West Milton, whether coming either from the north or the south, over the Catawissa instead of the Shamokin, Sunbury &amp; Lewisburg Railroad. I do not, I think, overstate the extent of the plaintiff’s demand in this respect. Not only was it so argued, but it will be observed that by its bill it asks us to enjoin the defendant from carrying over the Shamokin, Sun-bury &amp; Lewisburg Road all freight ‘ originating at West Milton, or at points east, north, or northwest thereof, as well as all freight originating at East Mahanoy Junction, or at -points south, southeast, north or northwest thereof.’ The plaintiff's bill is therefore virtually and in terms a bill to enjoin the defendant from operating the Shamokin, Sunbury &amp; Lewisburg Railroad, as well as the road from Shamokin to East Mahanoy Junction, which was a necessary link in the connection, and which was acquired from several other independent companies by the defendant long before it entered into the agreement <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>with the plaintiff for the lease of the Catawissa. The plaintiff in its bill also asks that the defendant may be compelled to account with it for all freight carried over the Shamokin, Sun-bury &amp; Lewisburg Road. It does not complain that the defendant has appropriated more than its share of the receipts for freight carried over the Shamokin, Sunbury &amp; Lewisburg Road, .but that it has appropriated any part of it. This is, of course, to deny the right of the defendant to build the road at all — a denial which is wholly without evidence to sustain it, unless we are to assume that the words of the covenant, which I have quoted, are sufficiently potential to produce the results contended for. With such a conclusion we can by no means agree. The defendant did not, by entering into the lease with the plaintiff, debar it of any right which it already possessed. It surrendered none of its franchises or corporate powers, nor did it agree to subordinate its own business to the interests of the lessor, nor to abstain from extending its system and making such connections with other roads as might conduce to its profit and advantage. It is not to be presumed that it would have been willing to acquire the plaintiff’s road upon any such terms.</p>

This means that it will do what is usually accounted reasonable, and what ought to be so accounted by reasonable men. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to bring within the limits of a precise definition exactly what is required by an undertaking in such general terms. It can only be determined when questions arise in regard to the particular actions and conduct of the party and their results. The defendant in the present case, by the extension of its own line and its connections, according to the report of the master, greatly benefited the Catawissa, bringing into existence, according to the report of the master, a very large amount of new traffic, in the prosecution of which it used a large portion of the Catawissa road. The plaintiff <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>contended that it was bound to use the whole, and to send the whole traffic over the Catawissa. It could not have done that without greatly injuring its own interests; if it had done so its own road would have been idle. We agree with the master that the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, while greatly promoting the business of the Catawissa, by using a part of its line in the transportation of the new traffic created hy the new northern and western connections, was under no legal obligation to restrict or impair its own business by using the whole Catawissa line to the exclusion of the road which it had itself built at a cost of $4,000,000, for the purpose of establishing the connections which produced the new business. The master, moreover, has reported that the preponderance of the testimony is that, owing to its condition and the peculiarities of the construction of the Catawissa, the new traffic created by the Reading could not have continued to be carried over the Catawissa without first practically rebuilding the road, an expense which is not incumbent on the defendant to incur.</p>

But that is not the case presented by the bill, nor is it the case for which the plaintiff is contending. What it demands is that, in settling the amount of rent to be paid by the defendant, it should account for the gross receipts of the Shamokin, Sunbury &amp; Lewisburg Road since March, 1887, and pay the plaintiff thirty per centum of such gross receipts. We agree with the learned master that the facts of the case do not sustain such a demand, and that the plaintiff has shown no such equity ,as would justify us in making such a decree as it asks for. The plaintiff was protected by a fixed minimum rental stipulated for in the leasel It has not shown any state of facts which entitles it to add to that amount thirty per cent of the gross receipts of the Shamokin, Sunbury &amp; Lewisburg Road.</p>

The plaintiff, on 10th October, 1872, leased to defendant its railroad, for a period of nine hundred and ninety-nine years, as well as all its traffic contract rights with connecting or feeder railroads, and with shippers ; the leased road to be run, used and operated by the defendant, upon certain terms and conditions. As a consideration, the defendant agreed to pay the maturing interest on certain obligations of the plaintiff company, and eventually the principal, and, in addition, semiannually as rental, a sum equal to thirty per cent of the gross receipts of the leased road. This was the minimum ; even this was protected by the further stipulation, that the annual rental was never to fall below $226,000 per year. The lessee further agreed to maintain the road in good order and repair; operate it with all reasonable care and efficiency ; and further, use all proper and reasonable means to maintain and increase the business thereof.</p>

The defendant, about ten years after the lease of the Cata<a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>wissá Railroad, became practically the owner of the Shamokin Railroad, a connecting road, having the same general direction as the Catawissa, and practically east and west the same terminals; while operating this road, nominally, under a lease, defendant really was the owner. The burden of plaintiff’s complaint is, that it being to defendant’s interest to promote traffic on the last named road, it wrongfully, and to the prejudice of the Catawissa, diverted traffic from the Catawissa to the Shamokin.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[273,843,1162,500]]]'>The fact is undisputed, that, by reason of traffic contracts made by defendant with new western connections, the carrying business, thereafter, of anthracite coal west and bituminous east, greatly increased. If the whole of defendant’s coal traffic west from Shamokin had been put on the Catawissa, it would have had a haul of ninety-six miles, the entire length of its road, but as much of it was diverted to the Shamokin at the point of intersection with the Catawissa, the latter got but twenty-eight miles; and the respective hauls were the same with the return freights east.</p>

The defendant covenanted that it would, during the term, “ maintain in good order and condition, keep in public use, and operate with all reasonable care and efficiency, the Catawissa Railroad, and shall anti will use all proper and reasonable means to maintain and increase the business thereof.” As is properly said by the court <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>below, “ It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to bring within the limits of a precise definition exactly what is required hy an undertaking in such general terms.” But we decline to say that the defendant had a right, in view of this covenant, to operate its own road for its own benefit, without incurring any responsibility to the plaintiff. We can easily see how defendant, by the operation of its own road, might violate this stipulation, in both spirit and letter, and thereby become answerable to plaintiff. While it is clear from the evidence, that, up to this time, it has not done so; and while no precise definition of its duty, under this general covenant, ought now to be given ; still, future operations can alone determine its future responsibility. In giving the lease a construction applicable only to the facts before us, we avoid any prejudice of plaintiff’s right, or suggestion of wrong on part of defendant.</p>
