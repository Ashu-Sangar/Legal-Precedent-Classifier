    <p class="summary" id="b22-5" data-blocks='[["BL_22.5",22,[287,525,1165,1510]]]'>“ First. The Susquehanna Mutual Fire Insurance Company established an agency at Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and appointed Mr. I. W. Miller as agent. Mr. Miller, besides personally soliciting insurance for his principal, accepted the assistance of one George W. Thomas, who seems to have been a sort of an itinerant solicitor of insurances in the near vicinity of Wilkes-Barre. He looked up properties to be insured, took verbal applications from the owners, brought them to Mr. Miller, who, after reducing them to writing, forwarded them to his company at Harrisburg, and when they were accepted, and policies issued thereon and sent to him, he usually delivered them to the assured, but sometimes he handed them to Mr. Thomas to be delivered to the assured on the receipt of premiums. In the present mstanee, however, both Mr. Miller and Mr. Thomas had solicited the insurance of Mr. McGonigle, both had been on the premises, and the former had been through the house. They seem to have had a conférence on the subject later, and Mr. Miller directed Thomas to take the insurance. Accordingly the latter, after obtaining from McGonigle, at another interview, further information concerning the premises, and after a satisfactory inspection of them himself, communicated to Miller the result. Miller reduced the same to writing, and signing it himself, forwarded it as an application to his company. It was accepted, and a policy of the character and extent as before indicated was issued and sent to Miller. He delivered it himself to McGonigle at the home of the latter in Plumbtown. McGonigle paid to him a part of the premium and a part of it to Thomas. That the defendant company in due time subsequently received the amounts thus paid, is not denied.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b22-6" data-blocks='[["BL_22.6",22,[287,2053,1160,345]],["BL_23.1",23,[153,385,1162,747]]]'>“ Second. The valuation put upon the property at the time the application was made out by Miller was fixed by Thomas. He was upon the premises many times, and during his negotiation for the insurance, McGonigle told him what he had paid for the property originally, land included, and also what amount of insurance he wished put upon it. He made known to him the fact that there was an incumbrance on the premises held <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>by the executor of an estate. Thomas communicated the knowledge thus obtained to Miller, and fixed the valuation at $3,500. Miller was satisfied, and, indeed, according to his own testimony, he had ‘ dropped in to see McGonigle ’ whenever he went down to Plumbtown before the insurance was taken ; and after it was taken and before the loss occurred, he further testified that he ‘ was down there and looked the building over; it looked nice and I thought everything was all right, and Mr. McGonigle a very nice man.’ In reference to the incumbrance, his testimony was that ‘ Thomas said he didn’t ask McGonigle if the property was mortgaged, or, if so, to what extent;’ and further, that Thomas said ‘ that’s a good property down there at McGonigle’s; he’s making lots of money, and I don’t believe he’s got anything on it.’ Miller says he replied, ‘ Well, mark it no incumbrances.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b23-3" data-blocks='[["BL_23.4",23,[152,1151,1162,400]]]'>“ McGonigle himself testified that he had put improvements on the property since he purchased it, and that it was worth $5,000. This valuation, as I understood it, related to the property as a whole, land included. Under all the testimony in this connection, the referee cannot escape the conclusion that an insurance of $2,300 was not an overinsurance on the building proper; it was at least within the limit of two thirds of the value of the building at the time the policy was issued.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b23-4" data-blocks='[["BL_23.5",23,[150,1559,1164,400]]]'>“ Third. On the morning of Aug. 30, 1892, before daylight, a fire broke out in the village of Plumbtown in a house but a few doors distant from the premises of the plaintiff. The intervening buildings were of wood, built close together, and of course readily inflammable. Awakened dwellers, having only the few facilities for quenching fire common in a country village, were powerless to stay the flames. The plaintiff’s insured property was soon reached and burned up.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b23-5" data-blocks='[["BL_23.6",23,[151,1967,1164,450]],["BL_24.1",24,[267,391,1163,908]]]'>“ Fourth. On the day following the morning of the fire, Mc-Gonigle notified Miller, the local agent at Wilkes-Barre, of the loss, and the latter presumably notified his principal forthwith, for about ten days afterwards Mr. B. K. Huntzinger, who besides being secretary of the defendant company seems to have been the general manager of its affairs and especially the adjuster of its losses, appeared on the ground at Plumbtown accompanied by Miller, the local agent. Mr. Huntzinger was also president of another insurance c'ompany — the Aurora Insurance <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>Company of Harrisburg, Pa., — which likewise had issued a policy on Mr. McGonigle’s property, and hence was interested in the results of the fire. He seems to have occupied a relation to this company altogether similar to that occupied by him in respect to the defendant company, at least as far as the adjustment of losses was concerned. The loss in this case having been total, Mr. Huntzinger declined to exercise the right to build, but desired that the extent or measure of the 'loss, as respected each of the companies named, be appraised in-accordance with the provisions of the policies, promising that each would pay its proportionate amount just as soon as appraisers should reach a finding in the premises. He made no demand whatever for proof of loss at this time. The ashes and débris seemed to furnish all the evidence required upon this point. Some difficulty or difference, however, occurred between the plaintiff and himself in the selection of appraisers satisfactory on the one side and the other, but this was shortly overcome- and an agreement reached in this respect. . . .</p>

A few days after the completion of the appraisement, Mr. Huntzinger had an interview with the plaintiff. The former did not carry out the promise to pay to the latter the proportionate amount found to be chargeable under the award-<a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>to the defendant company. On the contrary, Mr. Huntzinger then set up, as a cause of delay and as a reason why the company would not pay, the fact that ‘a man named Jones had an attachment on the place.’ At a still later day he called at the house of Mr. McGonigle in Plumbtown, and invited him to come to Wilkes-Barre, saying that ‘he would settle the loss.’ Indeed, on several occasions subsequent to the award of the appraisers, Mr. Huntzinger assured the plaintiff that ‘ he was willing and satisfied to pay the loss.’ Payment, however, was not made. Some months of further delay intervened. Mr. Huntzinger added to the reasons already made for nonpayment the declaration that the defendant company ‘ was short of funds.’ Along in December of that year, Hon. W. H. Hines, at that time counsel for the plaintiff, wrote directly to the defendant company at Harrisburg, Pa., asking for compliance with the promises made on their behalf. To that letter, which appears in the attached exhibits, Mr. Huntzinger returned the following reply, which also appears in the attached exhibits.</p>

It is true that Mr. Thomas was not the <em>appointed </em>local agent of the defendant company at Wilkes-Barre, but he was a solicitor of insurance for Mr. Miller, the duly appointed agent at that place; he looked up properties to be insured, took applications, verbal and otherwise, for such insurance, brought them to Mr. Miller who, after reducing them to writing or putting them in proper form, forwarded them to the companies for which he was agent. In the present case both Miller and Thomas were solicitors for this particular insurance, both examined the property, both were satisfied with it in every respect. Miller himself was shown through the house; he instructed Thomas to take the insurance, thus, apart from what he himself did directly in the premises, making the act of Thomas his own act. His principal recognized' his work, issued a policy in conformity with it, received the premium therefor, never challenging any part of the preliminary transactions until the day of trial upwards of seventeen months thereafter. The features of the case in some respects are closely analogous to those of Massachusetts Ins. Co. v. Eshelman, 30 Ohio State, 647, where it was held, substantially, that where an agent, in the due prosecution of the business of his principal, employs another in a branch of the business, the acts of the sub-agent have the same effect as if done by the agent himself. This doctrine was quoted approvingly by our Supreme Court in Swan v. Watertown Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/96/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="96 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="494605" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0037-01">96 Pa. 37</a>. •</p>

Where there is a total loss of the insured building, and the insurance company has been immediately notified as was done in this case, no further technical proof of loss is <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>necessary. Besides, when an insurance company bases its neglect or refusal of payment on the ground that attachments of the claim have been served upon it, or that it is short of funds, or, indeed, on any ground other than the absence of technical proof required by the policy, particularly when the loss has been total, and notice of it has in due time been given to the company, such conduct amounts to a waiver of technical proofs of the loss: Roe v. Dwelling House Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/149/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="149 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="832637" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0094-01">149 Pa. 94</a>; Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. v.

    <p class="summary" id="b32-4" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[254,930,1176,958]]]'>“ Again, an insurance company may waive a condition requiring proof of loss by notifying the insured, in case of a total loss, that the insurance would be paid in full: Stauffer v. Manheim Mut. Ins. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=150%20Pa.%20581" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="150 Pa. 581">150 Pa. 581</a>. The present case differs from this immaterially. Here the loss was total, notice was given to the insurance company at once, the adjuster (secretary), and general manager of the company — all in one — was promptly on the ground, had appraisers appointed according to the terms of the policy, and promised payment forthwith on the finding of the appraisers. This finding having been reached, delay of complainee was not predicated upon a want of proofs of loss, but upon the fact that the claim had been attached in the company’s hands. Indeed, the mutual appointment of appraisers to adjust the loss, and they having made their finding which was not objected to by the company’s recognized adjuster and agent, is competent evidence to submit to a jury or referee, whether the provision in the policy requiring proof of loss to be furnished within a certain specified time had been waived: Fritz v. Lebanon Mut. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/154/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="154 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="842342" data-case-paths="/pa/154/0384-01">154 Pa. 384</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b32-5" data-blocks='[["BL_32.5",32,[253,1899,1170,450]]]'>“ The sixth request of the defense is accorded. The hope of realizing for his loss without litigation, induced perhaps by the contemporaneous letters of the secretary of the company hereinbefore referred to, may have led the plaintiff to furnish proof of loss at the late date indicated. It is immaterial, however, what the reason was. We have already seen that under the law and the evidence, the company had, upwards of four months previously, waived this provision of the policy. The plaintiff’s action was therefore not premature.</p>

Certainly if the plaintiff had made false representations at the time the insurance was solicited as to the condition of his property, or its surroundings, or the uses to which it was then, or was to be in future, subjected, or had concealed any matter material to the risk, a different view might well be taken. The evidence, however, exhibits the contrary. He made no representations whatever in the respects referred to; his building was free to the inspection of both Miller and Thomas, and one of them at least was shown through the house; nothing was said on either side at any time about a hall iii the house or its uses, but the general use of the premises as a whole was apparent to any ordinary observer. So far as the hall was concerned the evidence shows that its size was 22 by 56, in the second story of the building, and that it was used as occasion offered, for church suppers, church festivals, amateur performances and dances. Even though such uses might increase the risk and be cause for a higher rate of insurance ordinarily, still there is no evidence of concealment on the part of the plaintiff as respects the hall, no evidence that he knew such use did increase the risk, and no evidence that he knew that a higher rate of insurance was chargeable where buildings of this character were used for the purposes last mentioned. Knowledge as to both these particulars must be brought home to the insured before his recovery for a loss, otherwise well founded, can be defeated: Lebanon Mut. Ins. Co. v. Losch, <a href="/pa/109/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="109 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="542248" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0100-01">109 Pa. 100</a>; Rife v. Lebanon Mut. Ins.

That the policy contains conditions of a very stringent character as to liability on the part of the company in case of loss, must be admitted, but to say that these conditions, or any of them, can only be waived as prescribed in the policy, would be an assertion not warranted <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>under the law. For example, a policy providing that it should be void if the property be sold, conveyed, incumbered or mortgaged is not rendered invalid by the existence of liens against it when the policy was issued, about which no questions were asked and no statements made: Insurance Co. v. Hoffman, <a href="/pa/125/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="125 Pa. 626" data-case-ids="563950" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0626-01">125 Pa. 626</a>. In the present ease the unauthorized statement of Miller, the local agent, respecting liens, cannot affect the insured who answered truthfully upon this point. It was not competent evidence, even though admitted at the hearing to save time, but under the protest of plaintiff’s counsel: Act of May 11, 1881, P. L. 20. And again, if the insured informed the agent that there was a lien against the property, and a policy was subsequently issued which failed to note that fact, it will be presumed that the company waived the condition in the policy as to the lien: Gould v. Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/134/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="134 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="814923" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0570-01">134 Pa. 570</a>. And further still, a waiver of the condition in a policy against incumbrances may be inferred from the appointment of appraisers after the fire and an adjustment of the loss, the negotiations lasting nearly five months; and this, too, though the policy contained a condition that nothing less than a specific agreement, clearly expressed and indorsed on the policy, should be construed as a waiver of any of its conditions: McFarland v. Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/134/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="134 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="814970" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0590-01">134 Pa. 590</a>.</p>

As a general proposition they all stand practically upon a common plane, no one of them being more sacred or binding than another. And in the case at hand, if the company had remained passive after the fire had occurred, waiting full compliance on the part of the insured with the conditions contained in the policy, very likely there would have been no cause of action against them. But such was not the case. The company did not remain passive. Their action in the premises through their recognized agent after the fire, as disclosed by the evidence in the case, is competent for a jury, or for a referee standing in the place of a jury, and warrants the inference of a waiver on the part of the company of all the conditions in the policy to which attention has been called by the counsel for the defense, and which are hereinbefore noted at length. Hence, a finding accordingly must follow. Whereupon judgment is directed to <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>be entered against the defendant company and in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of 11,186.69, that being the proportionate amount based on the finding of the appraisers as returned, together with interest up to Oct. 28, 1894.”</p>
