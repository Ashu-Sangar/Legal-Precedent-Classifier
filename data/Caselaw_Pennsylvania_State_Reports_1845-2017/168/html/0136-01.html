The defendant, Philippa Harrison, was first married in England to a sea captain, named George Dani, who died Nov. 28, 1856. Dani leftseveral properties in Brunell street, Liverpool, and some shares of stock in the Royal Insurance Company. Prior to his death Teresa L. C. Francis, (afterwards Teresa L. C. Anderson mentioned in the bill,) who was a niece of the defendant, Philippa Dani, lived with her in England. Dani having died, his widow married in England John Harrison, in April, 1858, and shortly afterwards they, with Miss Francis, removed to Philadelphia. For a while the Harrisons conducted a saloon or tavern on Twentieth street, below Callowhill street, until about 1860, when they opened a cloak store at No. 20 South Eighth street. Afterwards, in 1863, the business being prosperous, the Harrisons established another store at No. 60 North Eighth street under the name of Francis &amp; Co., in which Miss Francis was stationed with other girls as a saleswoman. The manufacturing, however, was done at the lower store, and it was clearly established by the testimony that Miss Francis was not interested in the business, except as an employee, her name being used merely as a device to keep the customers from suspecting that the two establishments were in reality but one.</p>

Mr. and Mrs. Anderson had two children, Clara, born Nov. 25, 1866, married Harry It. Stoops, April 30, 1890; and Yiolet, the complainant, born in 1870, and married W. M. Huston, in March, 1886. Mrs. Anderson continued to live with Mrs. Harrison until her death, in December, 1883, and her children continued to live with Mrs. Harrison, who assumed their education and care, until their respective marriages.

In the following year the entire family went to England and lived abroad until 1876, when they returned to Philadelphia and resided here until John Harrison’s death, April 28, 1882. His will was dated in England as far back as 1862, apparently at the time of his visit to obtain funds with which to establish the store at 60 North Eighth street. In it he made his wife, Philippa Harrison, executrix and tenant for life of his personal estate, and at her death bequeathed it to Mrs. Anderson for her life, then to her children. His personal estate was inventoried at $134,014, and did not include any of the bonds or securities now in dispute. On the day following the probate of the will, Mrs. Harrison appointed The Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities her agent for the collection of the income.</p>

She also directed that Mrs. Harrison should take care of her daughters during their unmarried minority. Mrs. Harrison was appointed executrix of the will, and letters were issued to her. The first visit she made to the safe deposit box after Mrs. Anderson’s death was on Dec. 10, 1883, when she took with her the two grandnieces, who were then seventeen and thirteen years of age.

The memorandum standing by itself is not sufficient to prove ownership in her, even if it were distinctly intended as a claim of title, as it would be merely a declaration by Mrs. Anderson in her own interest in the absence of Mrs. Harrison. But the master believes, and so finds, that this was unintentional on Mrs. Anderson’s part, for it seems plain enough that her whole mission and object was to have the income collected from their joint securities in one agreement, and that she never intended to claim ownership or provide a pretext for litigation against her aunt, because, to the credit of both of them, there is no evidence of any quarrel or misunderstanding.

From this testimony it is not doubtful that if Mrs. Anderson had really possessed this alleged estate she would have accepted her husband’s proposition; but as the income from $15,000 would not, in her mind, after maintaining a home including her husband, leave sufficient to defray the expenses of her daughters’ education,-she decided to remain with the Plarrisons.

      <em>“ </em>Again, the conduct of Mrs. Harrison is not easily reconcilable with the complainant’s theory of the case. According to this, Mrs. Harrison, as soon as her niece, Mrs. Anderson, died, took possession of a large estate, appropriated it and the income thereof to her.own use, concealed her fraud from her innocent victims, and for years has been leading a life of fraud, treachery and hypocrisy. On the contrary, the first visit made by Mrs.. Harrison to the safe deposit box after Mrs. Anderson’s death was about one week thereafter on December 10, and she was accompanied by both her grandnieces; and on the 18th of the month she appointed Clara her deputy on the books. Ever afterwards Clara took her mother’s place as assistant or agent,: and even before her marriage to Mr. Stoops, the latter was accustomed to collect her interest and make her investments. She consulted Mr. Stoops about her deed of trust before she made it, and he himself testified he handled all of the estate. It is hardly possible that Mrs. Harrison, if engaged in the perpetration of a fraud, should have selected as her agents and' confidants the persons most of all concerned to prevent it.</p>

If her object was avaricious, she might easily have claimed the usual allowances. This account, as well as l^frs. Anderson’s will, was prepared by E.

It was testified to by numerous witnesses that Mrs. Harrison derived a not inconsiderable estate from her first husband, Dani, which was used either as capital in the business, or lent to her husband. According to Mrs. G-ardeicke’s testimony, it was a generally known fact, and Mrs. Anderson had always said so. Mr. Durell, another employee, testified that Mrs. Anderson told him Mrs. Harrison had lent her husband the money. Mrs. Asay, to the same effect. Mrs. Anderson herself in her letter to Mr. Shapley states that the house was bought with Mrs. Harrison’s monejn H. H. Brown testified that Mrs. Anderson told him she brought Mrs. Harrison’s money to America because it could be used to better advantage. Mrs. Beach to the same effect. The latter, who was a sister of Mrs. Anderson, said, ‘ My Aunt Philippa had property in England left her by her first husband. Aboub the time that the premium on gold was three for one of green backs, my sister Teresa (Mrs. Anderson) went to England and disposed of some of the property and brought the money back to Philadelphia. The amount I do not know, or the amount for which the property was sold. The money she brought back was put into the business conducted by John Harrison.

A good deal was said about a marriage settlement made between Mr. and Mrs. Harrison at the time of their marriage, and some of the witnesses testified to a portion at least of its contents as tending to show what property belonged to Mrs. Harrison. This marriage settlement was claimed to have been lost, but the counsel for the complainant moved to strike out all the testimony relating to it on the ground that its loss or destruction did not sufficiently appear from the evidence to enable secondary evidence to be given. In the opinion of the master it matters but little whether it is stricken out or not. Although secondary and perhaps defective, yet it is probably the best the defendant could secure, as she was herself incompetent and not permitted to testify as to matters occurring before Mrs. Anderson’s death. However, it is sufficiently demonstrated otherwise, and the master finds as a fact that Mrs. Harrison’s separate estate provided the capital, and so far as the evidence goes all the capital which established both stores on Eighth street, out of which the money now in controversy was derived, while John Plarrison contributed his skill and business knowledge which, with the cooperation of his wife, led to the success of the business. The master accordingly, after a careful consideration of the evidence and the probabilities of the case, and the exhaustive arguments of counsel on both sides, is of opinion, and so finds, that the defendant, Philippa Harrison, has shown herself in opposition to the claim, of the plaintiff, to be the actual owner of the disputed property.</p>

But she liad also the very substantial defense on the merits that, as it was shown before the master, she had after their mother’s death expended far more upon the mainténance, support and education of the children, than she had received from Mrs. Anderson’s small estate. Had she filed a strict account, the estate would have been much decreased, and she omitted to do so. The account was filed by Mr. Shapley, as her attorney and under his advice.

The burden of proof is upon the complainant to show that Mrs. Anderson at the time of her death was the owner of the securities in question. The usual rule is, that he who asserts ownership must prove it, and the rule is the same in equity as at law: Pusey v. Wright, <a href="/pa/31/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="31 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="985075" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0387-01">31 Pa. 387</a>. The complainant’s testimony, in the opinion of the master, has failed to overcome this burden. The agreement is insufficient, because it was not intended to operate as an assertion of ownership; because it was not even written or dictated by Mrs. Anderson, but by a third party; because it was never shown to or seen by Mrs. Harrison and is therefore incompetent to affect her, and because it is explained by a mass of evidence to have been made by Mrs. Anderson in behalf of Mrs. Harrison and to save trouble to her.</p>

At most that would only be proof of the ownership of the coupons, and it would not follow that she was therefore the owner of the bonds from which they were cut.

In his opinion, <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>it should require a very high standard of evidence to prove that after the lapse of ten years an executrix, incompetent herself to testify, has been guilty of gross fraud, embezzlement and perjury. But the master does not think that the complainant has produced sufficient evidence to prove title in Mrs. Anderson, even if the issue were directly between Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Harrison herself, under circumstances which precluded both from testifying, and if the fact involved were very recent instead of having occurred many years previous^.</p>

The burden of proof was on the complainant to meet the responsive answer and overcome it with two witnesses or one witness and corroborative circumstances. This, in the master’s opinion, the complainant has failed to do. Even if the Mason agreement of June 6,1882, be considered as a corroborative circumstance or consistent with Mrs. Anderson’s ownership of the bonds, yet there is not the testimony of a single witness to show that Mrs. Anderson was the owner of them.
