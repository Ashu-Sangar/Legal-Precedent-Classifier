The master finds as a fact that at the time of the special meeting of the stockholders, at which it was voted to increase the indebtedness of the company, and at or before the meeting of the board of directors held Oct. 1,1891, at which authority was given the president and secretary of the company to execute and deliver a series of bonds and execute the mortgage for sixty thousand dollars, that both the stockholders and directors had knowledge of said subscription of F.

It may be conceded, as a general rule, that a subscription for stock must, in order to bind the parties, be made in the prescribed form and must be in writing. It does not follow, however, that an oral subscription may not, under certain circumstances, be binding. Where, as in the case at hand, a subscription was made by an agent of the company for the purpose of obtaining from a third party a loan, and such subscription was recognized by the stockholders and directors of the company, who accepted the loan with a knowledge of such subscription, and, presumably, with a knowledge that without such subscription the loan would have been invalid and contrary to law, can it be said that either party under such circumstances would be permitted to deny the validity of such subscription, notwithstanding all the requisites prescribed had not been complied with ? Having received the benefit of this subscription and taken advantage of it, the stockholders and directors of the company are estopped from denying or questioning it. Their acts, if not such as to be an express ratification of the subscription, are at least such as to have that effect and prevent them from now questioning its validity in this or any other proceeding. But it would seem that this subscription was as regular as some other subscriptions for stock of this company. There was not at that time any regular subscription book kept in the office of the company or elsewhere.</p>

We do not think it is necessary, in order to sustain the validity of Mr. Patterson’s claim, to rely on the fact that a lawfully constituted board of directors, by resolution of Nov. 17, 1893, expressly ratified the subscription, for we have a sufficient ratification of it by the company without this. This resolution, however, shows that a legally constituted board of directors of the company recognized the claim of Mr. Patterson, and that there is no disposition on the part of either Mr. Patterson or the company to avoid it.</p>

They, in common with the other stockholders, received the benefit and advantage of this subscription. At the time it was made and in effect ratified by the corporation and its stockholders, none of the complainants are shown to have offered or been willing to subscribe for this stock. No request was made by them for an allotment of it among the stockholders, and it appears it had been acquiesced in by them from October, 1891, until the 19th of October, 1893, a period of upwards of two years. Under such circumstances it is too late for them now to contend that this stock was unlawfully disposed of, because no allotment of it was made among the stockholders. If the stockholders were at any time entitled to an allotment, they have waived such right by their act, and their acquiescence in and recognition of Mr. Patterson’s subscription. But it seems to us that the question of whether the stock should have been allotted among the stockholders, and they given an opportunity to subscribe for it in proportion to the shares of stock held by them, does not in any way affect the legality of the subscription of Mr. Patterson, and really does not arise in this case. There is nothing in any of the authorities cited by counsel which rules that, if no allotment is made giving all the corporators an opportunity to subscribe for untaken stock, that the subscription of any shareholder or other person would be illegal. They hold no more than that untaken stock is held by the corporation in trust for the corporators and must be disposed of for the benefit of all; that it cannot be disposed of unequally to the corporators, and if so disposed of each corporator injured may have his action against the corporation. There is no case that decides that any stockholder, after the stock has been disposed of, even if done by the corporation in violation of the rights of such stockholders, has any remedy in equity to compel the issue of such stock to him, or to have the subscription of the one who subscribed to this stock declared invalid. If injured, he has his remedy at law to recover damages for such injury. But, as was said in Curry v. Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Pa.%20276" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="54 Pa. 276">54 Pa. 276</a>, it is a sufficient answer in this case to say that there is no averment in the bill that at the time Patterson subscribed for this stock that the complainants or any of them offered to take or were willing, to take the stock at par, or that it would have sold for more. Without such <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>averment no injury can be shown to have been sustained by the complainants.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b60-5" data-blocks='[["BL_60.5",60,[260,613,1162,1622]]]'>“ It follows, therefore, that the action of the de facto board of directors in attempting to cancel the certificates of stock issued to* Patterson and in authorizing an allotment of this stock and issuing certificates for two hundred and eighty-seven shares of it was illegal. The subscription of Mr. Patterson left but eleven shares of the authorized capital stock untaken. But we have no doubt of the illegality of the action of the board of directors for other reasons. This board, which has been termed the ‘ Langdon board,’ was not a legal board of directors, and, as a de facto board of directors, it qeeds no argument to show that they could pass no resolution which could affect the Patterson stock, for, as we hold, his claim thereto was valid. De facto officers of a corporation clearly have no right to do any act whereby any stockholder of the corporation would be prejudiced. It is equally clear to our mind that they could not legally issue certificates for this two hundred and eighty-seven shares of stock. ‘ Acts of officers de facto are not valid when such acts are for their own benefit, because they cannot take advantage of their own want of title, which they must be cognizant of. It is only where it is for the benefit of strangers or the public, who are presumed to be ignorant of such defects of title, that their acts are good: ’ Commissioners of Franklin v. Mc-Kissan, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Rawle%20140" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Rawle 140">2 Rawle, 140</a>. They cannot invoke the aid of their own acts as officers de facto to promote their own individual interests, hence the allotment of stock by the complainants to themselves was illegal, invalid and void, even if they had paid for it; but the master finds as a fact that there was no value given for the stock allotted ; that they paid for it merely by an exchange of checks. In our judgment they are neither legally nor equitably entitled to this stock, and we have no hesitancy in holding that the certificates for these two hundred and eighty-seven shares of stock are illegal and invalid.</p>

We might add that it is more than doubtful, however, whether this issue is properly raised by the pleadings in this case.
