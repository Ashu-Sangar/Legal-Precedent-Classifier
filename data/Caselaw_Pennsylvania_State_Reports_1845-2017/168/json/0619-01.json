        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nThe law was correctly given to the jury by the learned judge below. The turning point in the case was the capacity in which the appellant received the grapes, whether as consignee or as purchaser. The definition of consignee by the judge was accurate, and sufficiently comprehensive to direct the attention of the jury to the nature of the contract, and the distinction between a consignment for sale on consignor\u2019s account and a purchase where the title passed though the goods were not paid for.\nNor was there any error in reading the act of assembly to the jury. It was done at the beginning of the charge as a concise and accurate mode of informing the jury of the exact offense for which the prisoner was on trial. That in reading the whole section of the act, the judge necessarily informed the jury what the penalty was which the law imposed for the offense, was merely an incidental result, not at all analogous to the specific direction of the jury\u2019s attention to the consequences of a verdict of guilty which was held to be erroneous in Com. v. Switzer, 134 Pa. 383; Catasauqua Co. v. Hopkins, 141 Pa. 30 (45); and Rosenagle v. Handley, 151 Pa. 107.\nThe learned judge in his charge called the attention of the jury to the fact that the law regarded the act of a consignee in appropriating consigned property to his own use, as a very serious offense, which should not escape punishment, but he also cautioned them in equally explicit terms that for the very reason of the seriousness of the charge the prisoner should not be convicted 'upon slight evidence. We are unable to perceive anything in this of which the appellant has any cause to complain.\nOn the main issue however we think the case is with the appellant. It is peculiar in the respect that substantially the whole evidence is in writing. The dealings between the prosecutor and the prisoner were entirely by letter and telegram, and the judge submitted the case to the jury on these papers, and \u201c all the other facts and circumstances.\u201d These other facts were, first, the shipment of the grapes at prisoner\u2019s request and their receipt by him, facts not disputed, but which were equally consistent with guilt or innocence; secondly, failure of the prisoner to make immediate returns, a fact also undisputed but depending for its character on the capacity in which the receipt and sale of the goods were made ; and, thirdly, the prisoner\u2019s announcement of himself on his letter headings as a commission merchant, and putting his dwelling place in the same heading where it might well be understood as his business address.\nThis was but a mere makeweight at the most. None of these outside facts and circumstances bore directly on the issue which was the fraudulent appropriation by a consignee or factor of the proceeds of sales of consigned goods. Without a foundation of evidence of this crucial fact all the other matters are immaterial, and the evidence of this fact as already said must be found, if at all, in the writings. The parties never met personally until after the transactions were past, and when they did meet nothing is testified to by the prosecutor which is material to the issue. We must turn therefore to the letters. The first of these is from appellant to the prosecutor asking to open business with him, and suggesting a \u201cconsignment.\u201d This word and the printed letter head of \u201c commission merchant \u201d by themselves might as the commonwealth contends sustain the inference that the transaction was a consignment to a factor, but it is plain from the context that the word \u201c consignment \u201d was used in the sense of \u201c shipment,\u201d for the offer immediately follows to \u201c handle all the grapes you can possibly ship on commission or will buy outright from you.\u201d To this letter' the prosecutor replied by telegram \u201c will ship you a mixed lot .... For sample,\u201d and two days later, by letter announcing the shipment as having been made. Neither telegram nor letter took any notice of the alternative to sell on commission or to buy outright which appellant\u2019s letter had offered, nor made any mention of prices or terms either for sale or commission. Both parties seem to have regarded this first transaction as preliminary and experimental, and left it indefinite in all respects. A week later appellant wrote the second letter ordering more grapes of specified kinds, mentioning the price at which he had sold some, \u201c got 18c. for Delawares wholesale,\u201d but concluding \u201c send bill with this order and I will forward you a check for full amount you forgot to state in your letter how much the .grapes was write and let me know send bill for full amount.\u201d While the mention of the price which he got for the Delawares points somewhat towards a sale on commission, this construction is clearly overborne by the call-for a bill, the promise to send cheek for full amount, and the reminder that the shipper had forgotten to state how much the grapes of the first lot were to be. The substantial part of this letter, if not entirely inconsistent with a sale on commission indicates much more clearly a purchase, and was so understood by the prosecutor, for in his answer after acknowledging the receipt of the letter, he says \u201c will ship .... and forward bill of the amount \u201d and further on, \u201c write prices of different kinds that you will take.\u201d A few days later the appellant wrote the third letter ordering more grapes offering 12 cents outright for mixed lots and repeating the direction to send bill for full amount and the promise to forward check. This closed the transactions. Two days after the date of the last letter the prosecutor carne to South Bethlehem and saw appellant for the first time, but nothing took place between them which throws any light on the transactions by letter, for though the prosecutor testifies that the goods were sent \u201c on commission \u201d yet he nowhere says that fact was communicated to the appellant, and his cross-examination indicates apparently that he used the words \u201c on commission \u201d as synonymous with \u201c on credit.\u201d\nAs already said the case must be sustained, if at all, on the letters. They show that the business was conducted with almost incredible looseness on both sides. The prosecutor did not know what he was to get for his goods, which on his present theory was to depend entirely on what the appellant sold them for, a question he never asked, while on the other hand the appellant on his theory was selling goods without knowing what they had cost him, and whether he was making a profit or a loss. Neither version is consistent with the most ordinary principles of business care and prudence. But looseness of method is not fraud, and something more was necessary to sustain the indictment. The basis of the whole case was fraudulent misappropriation by a consignee or factor, and the commonwealth failed to prove that that was the prisoner\u2019s relation to these transactions. Without that foundation there was nothing to which any of the other evidence in the case could be material, and the judge should have affirmed the appellant\u2019s request, and directed a verdict of not guilty.\nJudgment reversed.",

Habbis.\u201d\nDefendant claimed that he bought the goods outright and did not take them to sell on commission.\nThe court charged as follows :\n\u201c The indictment which you have been sworn to try, charges the defendant, Robert P. Harris, with having received into his possession as consignee, a quantity of grapes belonging to the prosecutor, and with having sold the grapes, and with having appropriated the proceeds of sale fraudulently to his own use.\n\u201c [The indictment has been framed under the following act of assembly: \u201c If any consignee or factor having the possession of merchandise, with authority to sell the same, or having possession of any bill of lading, permit, certificate, receipt or order for the delivery of merchandise with the like authority, shall deposit, or pledge such merchandise or document, consigned or intrusted to him as aforesaid, as a security for any money borrowed, or negotiable instrument received by such consignee or factor, and shall apply or dispose of the same to his own use, in violation of good faith, with intent to defraud the owner of such merchandise, and if any consignee or factor shall, with like fraudulent intent, apply or dispose of, to his own use, any money or negotiable instrument, raised or acquired by the sale or other disposition of such merchandise, such consignee or factor in every such case shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and sentenced to pay a fine, not exceeding two thousand dollars, and undergo an imprisonment, not exceeding five years.] \u201d [4]\n\u201c [To constitute this offense, the commonwealth must have satisfied you that the defendant received these grapes as consignee. Many of you among the jury understand what is meant by consignee as distinguished from purchaser. A consignee is a person to whom merchandise or personal property of any kind is committed for the purpose of sale.] [1] Where there is a sale, the title to the property, whether the property is paid for or not, passes to the purchaser, but in the case of a consignment, there the title to the property remains in the consignor, and all that the consignee receives is the right to sell that property for, and on account of, the consignor. [But you know, gentlemen, the difference between a sale of property and a consignment for the mere purposes of a sale.] [2]\n\u201c [The first question for you to determine is, what was this contract between the prosecutor and defendant ? Was it a sale, or was it a consignment? That question you will determine from the letters which have been given in evidence on both sides and from all the other facts and circumstances in the case. If you examine these letters and the other facts in the case and you are unable to say whether beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant is guilty or not, then you must give the defendant the benefit of that doubt and return a verdict of not guilty. If, however, after a careful review of all the evidence in the ease, you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the contract was a consignment then you will inquire further whether the defendant sold the property and appropriated the proceeds to his own use with a fraudulent intent.] [3] It is an element in the case that the defendant must have received the property into his possession. There is no dispute about that. That is admitted. There is another element in the case that the defendant must have sold the property. That is also admitted.\n\u201c In the third place it is necessary for the commonwealth to satisfy you that the defendant appropriated the proceeds of the property to his own use. It is admitted by the defense that he did appropriate a part of the money received from the sale of these grapes to his own use. If that was done with a fraudulent intent and the property was consigned to him instead of having been sold to him, then it would be your duty to return a verdict of guilty. If, however, you have a reasonable doubt whether the money was appropriated by the defendant with a fraudulent intent, you must give the defendant the benefit of that doubt and return a verdict of not guilty.\n\u201c It has been said to you, and very properly, that in the eye of the law this is a very grave and a very serious offense, that is the offense against which this act of assembly is directed. It has \u2022been said with reason, that you ought not to convict the defendant upon slight evidence. That is very true and a very proper caution to give to the jury, and I repeat it to you now, as I have in substance said, that you must be satisfied from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant; and, if you have a reasonable doubt as to any one of the essential features of this case, you must give the defendant the benefit of that doubt and return a verdict of not guilty.\n\u201c But there is another view of the case which it is proper I should call your attention to. Whilst beyond all question in contemplation of the legislature, this offense of a consignee appropriating property consigned to his own use is a most serious offense, and because it is a most serious offense, if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt, then all the more important it is that the defendant who is guilty of such an offense should not escape the punishment which the-enormity of the offense entitles him to receive.] \u201d [5]\nThe court refused to instruct the jury to find a verdict of not guilty.\nVerdict of guilty, upon which the court sentenced the prisoner to pay a fine of one dollar, and to undergo an imprisonment in the county prison for one year.\nErrors assigned were (1-6) above instructions, quoting them.\nRussell C. Stewart, for appellant.\nThe defendant was a purchaser of the goods and not a consignee: Com. v. Newcomer, 49 Pa. 478; English act of Geo. IV. c. 94; Wood v. Rowcliffe, 6 Hare, 188; Monk v. Wittenbury, 2 B. & Ad. 484.\nWe think the court committed clear error in referring to the definition of the word \u201c consignee \u201d as being a matter of no-importance, and in giving to the jury the defective definition we complain of in our first assignment of error: Wharton\u2019s Criminal Pleading and Practice, 8th ed. sec. 709; Meyers v. Com., 83 Pa. 143.\nInstead of telling the jury they were to judge, the court should have construed these written instruments, these letters, and said there was nothing in them to convict the defendant: Com. v. McManus, 143 Pa. 97; Hargrave\u2019s note to Coke, Litt. 155; Wharton\u2019s Criminal Practice and Pleading, 8th ed. 807.\nThe court first read the entire section of the act to the jury, gave them the definition and the punishment. Courts should never refer to the punishment prescribed by the act: Com. v. Switzer, 134 Pa. 389: Catasauqua Mfg. Co. v. Hopkins, 141 Pa. 45.\nIf we are correct in our position that the court should pass on the legal questions, the letters being in writing, the court should have done so, and should have directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty: Bishop on Criminal Procedure 3d ed. sec. 977; People v. Bennett, 49 N. Y. 137.\nA. C. La Barre, district attorney, for the commonwealth.\nThe contract between the prosecution and the defendant was one of consignment, and Harris was a consignee: 3 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 817; Story on Agency, sec. 33.\nThe complaint in appellant\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s instruction to the jury was erroneous because the court did not charge the jury that the acceptance of the trust was necessary to constitute the contract of consignment, is without force, because the defendant\u2019s proposition to the prosecutor was in evidence, the prosecutor complied with the proposition, the minds of the parties therefore having met, and because of the acceptance of the grapes by the defendant.\nA jury may take out with them any writings that have been given in evidence, without distinction as to sealed or unsealed, except the depositions of witnesses: Alexander v. Jameson, 5 Binn. 238; M\u2019Cully v. Barr, 17 S. & R. 445; Sholly v. Diller, 2 Rawle, 179; Spence v. Spence, 4 Watts, 165.\nAlthough parts of a charge when taken separately may seem to be erroneous and indicate a leaning to one side or the other, there is no error if, taken as a whole, the questions at issue are fairly left to the jury: Reese v. Reese, 90 Pa. 89; Lehigh Yalley R. R. v. Brandtmaier, 113 Pa. 610; Reeves v. Del., Lack. & West. R. R., 30 Pa. 454; Irvin v. Kutruff, 152 Pa. 609; Peirson v. Duncan, 162 Pa. 187; Fox v. Fox, 96 Pa. 60; Henry v. Klopfer, 147 Pa. 178.\nMay 30, 1895:"
