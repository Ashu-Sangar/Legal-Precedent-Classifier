Church, my homestead lot and buildings thereon, with the appurtenances, situate in the city of Meadville, Pa., and also all my household goods and furniture, horses, cows, carriages, sleighs, harness, and the like to be occupied and used by her as and for a family home during her widowhood.\u201d The residue of the estate was devised and bequeathed to the wife and children in such shares and estates as they would take under the intestate laws. Held, that the wife took an estate during widowhood, and not in fee.\nArgued April 30, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 50, July T., 1894, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Crawford Co., Sept. T., 1892, No. 28, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nEjectment for an undivided one sixth interest in a lot on the southwest corner of Centre street and Public Square in the city of Meadville. Before Henderson, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that Gaylord Church died in September, 1869, leaving a will, the material portions of which were as follows :\n\u201cFirst. I give, devise, and bequeath unto my wife, Anna B. Church, my homestead lot and buildings thereon, with the appurtenances, situate in the city of Meadville, Pa., and also all my household goods and furniture, horses, cows, carriages, sleighs, harness, and the like to be occupied and used by her as and for a family home during her widowhood. . . .\n\u201c Eighth. And as to all the rest and residue of my estate I give, devise, and bequeath the same to my wife and to my children in such portions, shares and amounts of interest and estate as is directed by the laws of Pennsylvania in cases of intestacy.\u201d\nIn 1888 the plaintiff, James C. Patton, purchased at sheriff\u2019s sale the interest of Alfred G. Church, one of the children of the testator. This was during the lifetime of the testator\u2019s widow, who never remarried, and who died in February, 1892. After her death the plaintiff\u2019s vendee brought this action of ejectment and a verdict was rendered for plaintiff subject to the point reserved, whether the testator\u2019s widow took a fee or life estate under her husband\u2019s will.\nHenderson, P. J., filed the following opinion:\n\u201c The spontaneous interpretation of the first clause of the testator\u2019s will is that it gives to his widow a limited estate and not an estate in fee simple.\n\u201c Taking the whole clause together and giving to each word its appropriate sense, the devise to Anna B. Church is during widowhood.- The testator was a lawyer of ability and merited distinction, and must be presumed to have understood the significance of the terms used by him. If he had intended to devise a fee to his wife no one knew better than he did how to express that intention in apt and effective words.\n\u201c The limitation of the estate devised to the use of the devisee during widowhood was doubtless intended by the testator in the sense in which the language would be ordinarily understood, and as the devisee continued unmarried during the remainder of her life, she took a life estate under the will.\n\u201c By the eighth clause of the will all the residue of the testator\u2019s estate is devised and bequeathed to his wife and children in such shares and estates as they would take under the intestate laws of the commonwealth.\n\u201c It was contended in argument that this clause was inconsistent with the interpretation first given to the first clause. It does not seem so to me, however.\n\u201c The wife was to have the homestead during widowhood; if she remarried she would be entitled to dower thereafter in the same property, and in any event the children would be entitled to the remainder.\n\u201c No disposition was made in the first clause of the fee, and the eighth clause was inserted to cover all property and estate not specifically devised or bequeathed.\n\u201c It is consonant therefore with the first. The interpretation indicated gives effect to all the words of the devise, and judging from the language used by the testator is that which he intended to convey.\n\u201c Judgment is accordingly entered upon the verdict in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d\nFrror assigned was in entering judgment for plaintiff.\nPearson Church, for appellants.\nThe widow took a fee : Smith\u2019s App., 28 Pa. 9; Hall v.
