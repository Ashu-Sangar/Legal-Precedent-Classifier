T., 1895, by Jacob Sandcroft, from order of Q. S. Centre Co., refusing a. retail liquor license.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for a retail liquor license.\nThe record showed that the petition was indorsed as follows:\n\u201c March 12, 1895, it appearing to the court that there was no necessity for the house to be licensed, the license is refused.\u201d\nOn April 3, 1895, the court filed the following paper:\n\u201c The testimony of the applicant and others, showed that the village of Casanova, in Rush township, where the house is located for which the license is applied for, consisted of about thirteen small houses; there are no stores or places of business therein; that in Clearfield county, just across the Moshannon creek, is the town of Munson, and surrounding the town of Munson there are a number of coal mines in Clearfield county; that the court of Clearfield county granted one hotel license and one restaurant license in the town of Munson, deeming .that was all that was necessary.\n\u201c It appeared to the court from the testimony and information he received from other sources, that the object of the license applied for at Casanova was largely to supply the people of Munson and the mines with greater hotel bar facilities. The granting of the license was protested against by the superintendent of the Beech Creek Railroad and others. The village of Casanova is right near the railroad station at Munson of the Beech Creek Railroad Company. The court, therefore, under the facts presented in court, and the information possessed by the court, received from reliable sources, refused the license, it appearing that there was no necessity for the same.\u201d\nError assigned was above order, quoting it.\nWilbur E.
