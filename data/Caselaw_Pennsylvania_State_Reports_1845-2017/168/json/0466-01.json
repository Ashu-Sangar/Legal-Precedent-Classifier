    "head_matter": "William H. Beaver, Trustee for Sarah J. Slear, v. George M. Slear.\nJudgment \u2014 Opening judgment \u2014 -Interest\u2014Husband and wife.\nA judgment note for borrowed money payable one day after date was given by a husband to a trustee for his wife; the wife lived with the husband seventeen years after the date of the note; there was no agreement as to the payment of interest; the wife\u2019s declarations that she did not claim interest were proved. After the wife\u2019s death the trustee entered judgment on the note including interest from its date. The court below opened the judgment, and directed a feigned issue to try how much was due on the note. Held, that there was no such abuse of discretion as would justify the supreme court in reversing the decree.\nArgued May 15, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 445, Jan. T., 1895, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. Union Co., Dec. T., 1893, No. 126, making absolute a rule to open judgment.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBuie to open judgment.\nFrom the record it appears that in 1876 plaintiff received from his wife $1,163, which lie used in paying off charges upon his farm. He gave a judgment note for $1,200, payable one day after date to a trustee for his wife. No agreement was made as to interest, and declarations of the wife offered in evidence showed that she did not claim any. To one witness she said that she thought that when a man and a woman were living together, it was not right for a man to pay a woman interest for money that they had in a farm together. Mr. Slear and his wife continued to live together until the date of 1ns wife\u2019s death, Nov. 1, 1893. After the death of the wife her brother, the trustee named in the note, entered judgment on the note with interest from one day after its date, viz, April 3,1876.\nThe court made absolute a rule to open the judgment, and ordered a feigned issue to try how much was due on the note.\nError assigned was above order.\nJ. M. Linn, P. B. Linn with him, for appellant.\nOn obligations in writing for sums payable upon demand, or upon a day certain, interest is payable, if payment of the principal sum is not made at the time agreed upon : Jacobs v. Adams, 1 Dallas, 52; Pawling v. Pawling, 4 Yeates, 225; Dilworth v. Sinderling, 1 Binn. 488.\nInterest is chargeable in implied contracts, on bills and notes, if payable at a future day certain, after they become due: 1 Bouvier\u2019s Inst. 455, sec. 1107; Randolph on Commercial Paper, sec. 1709; Kittel\u2019s Est., 156 Pa. 445; Hauer\u2019s Est., 140 Pa. 420; Bachman v. Killinger, 55 Pa. 414; Williams\u2019 App., 47 Pa. 307; Wormley\u2019s Est., 137 Pa. 101 \u2022 Hamill\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 363; Grabill v. Moyer, 45 P\u00e1. 530.\nIf it was error to open the judgment upon the facts as they stood when the order was made, it was error to submit the case to the jury: English\u2019s App., 119 Pa. 583; Knarr v. Elgren, 9 Atl. Rep. 875; Scott\u2019s App., 123 Pa. 155 ; Jenkintown Nat. Bank\u2019s App., 124 Pa. 337.\nJoseph C. Bucher and Andrew A. Leiser, for appellee,\nwere not heard, but cited in their printed brief, on the question of a stipulation' necessary to bind husband to pay interest to his wife: Towers v. Hagner, 3 Whart. 48; Reber\u2019s Est., 143 Pa. 308; May v. May, 62 Pa. 206 ; Gocbenaur\u2019s Est., 23 Pa. 460; Mellinger v. Bausman, 45 Pa. 522. The burden of proof is on the wife to show that the interest was not intended as a gift: McGlinsey\u2019s App., 14 S. & R. 64; Edward v. Cheyne, L. R. 13 App. 385 ; In re Flamank, L. R. 40 Ch. Div. 461; Moore\u2019s Est., 47 Pa. 307; Com. v. Vanderslice, 8 S. & R. 452: Williams\u2019 App., 47 Pa. 307; Bown v. Morange, 108 Pa. 69; Moore v. Moore, 165 Pa. 464. Whether the judgment should be opened or not was a matter in the sound discretion of the court below, with which the Supreme Court will not interfere when the discretion has not been abused: Earley\u2019s App., 90 Pa. 321; Herman v. Rinker, 106 Pa. 121; Sossong v. Rosar, 112 Pa. 197 ; Woods v. Irwin, 141 Pa. 278; Kneedler\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 428; Wise\u2019s App., 99 Pa. 193; Wernet\u2019s App., 91 Pa. 319; Jenkintown Nat.
