We have examined the evidence as it appears upon the paper-books. The learned trial judge had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing them. His conscience was not moved by the testimony, and we are not inclined to disturb his conclusion.\nThe appeal from his refusal to open the judgment is dismissed.",
