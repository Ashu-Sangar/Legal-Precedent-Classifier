L. 29, where the evidence shows that the land is part of its capital stock upon which it pays a tax to the state and is necessary and indispensable to the company in carrying out the public purpose for which the company was incorporated.\nArgued May 8, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 85, Jan. T., 1895, by defendants, from decree of C. P. Elk Co., Sept. T., 1894, No. 5, on bill in equity.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity to restrain the collection of a tax.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of Mayer, P. J., which ivas as follows:\n\u201cThe plaintiff, the St. Mary\u2019s Gas Company, has filed its bill against the county of Elk and the treasurer of said county, avering that it is \u2018a corporation duly organized and chartered under the act of assembly of May 29, 1885, for the purpose of producing, dealing in, transporting, storing and supplying natural gas for public consumption, and as such is taxed upon its capital stock under the provisions of the 21st section of the act of assembly of June 21, 1889, and supplements thereto.\n\u201c \u2018 That the St. Mary\u2019s Gas Company is the owner of the natural gas in 684 acres of land situate in Ridgway township, Elk county, which is held and used only by the said St. Mary\u2019s Gas Company for its corporate purposes, and is wholly included in its capital stock.\n\u201c\u2018That the said St. Mary\u2019s Gas Company is a public corporation having the right of eminent domain, and that the natural gas in the above lands is necessary and indispensable to the exercise of its corporate lights as a public corporation for the purpose of producing, dealing in, transporting, storing and supplying natural gas for public consumption.\n\u201c \u2018 That the county of Elk has assessed taxes for local purposes upon the said lands for the years 1890, 1891,1892, 1898, aggregating the sum of one thousand and twenty-four dollars and fifty cents, which the said St. Mary\u2019s Gas Company has refused to pay.\n\u201c \u2018That the said T. J. Shaffer, treasurer of Elk county, has advertised, under the provisions of the act of assembly approved March 13, 1815, the sale of said property, at the court house in Ridgway, on the eleventh day of June, A. D. 1894, for nonpayment of taxes above stated.\n\u201c \u2018 That it is advised and believes and therefore avers that their said property is not liable to taxation by the said county of Elk for local purposes as aforesaid, and that said assessment of taxes is illegal and void.\u2019\n\u201c And praying:\n\u201c \u2018 That the aforesaid assessment of taxes by the county of Elk be decreed to be void and of no effect.\n\u201c \u2018 That an injunction may issue, temporary until hearing, and perpetual thereafter, restraining the said county of Elk from the assessment and collection of taxes upon the said property, and further, restraining the said T. J. Shaffer, treasurer of said county, from selling the said property for nonpayment of taxes as aforesaid.\u2019\n\u201c The defendant has made answer to said bill, which on this hearing is to be regarded as an affidavit, admitting the incorporation of said plaintiff, under the act of May 29, 1885, but denying that it is a public corporation, and averring that the oil and gas in the six hundred and ninety-four acres owned by the said corporation are liable to taxation.\n\u201cThe St. Mary\u2019s Gas Company is a corporation duly chartered and organized under \u2018 An act to provide for the incorporation and regulation of natural gas companies \u2019 approved May 29, 1885, and is invested with all the rights, powers and privileges specified in the act. It is authorized by the first section \u2018 to produce, mine, own, deal in, transport, store, and supply natural gas for either light, heat, or both or other purposes, and have all the rights and privileges necessary or convenient therefor.\u2019 The tenth section of the act provides that \u2018 The transportation and supply of natural gas for public consumption is hereby declared to be a public use, and it shall be the duty of corporations, organized or provided for under this act, to furnish to consumers along their lines and within their respective districts natural gas for heat or light or other purposes as the corporation may determine.\u2019 And provides further, \u2018 Any and all corporations that is or are now or shall hereafter be engaged in such business, shall have the right of eminent domain for the laying of pipe lines for the transportation and distribution of natural gas, the right, however, shall not be exercised as to any burying ground or dwelling, passenger railroad station-house, or any shop or manufactory in which steam or fire is necessarily used for manufacturing or repairing purposes, but shall include the right to appropriate land upon or under which to lay said lines and locate pipes upon and over, under and across, any lands, rivers, streams, bridges, roads, streets, lanes, alleys or other public highways, or other pipe lines, or to cross railroads or canals: Provided, In case the pipe lines cross any railroad operated by steam or canal, and in such manner as the railroad or canal company may reasonably direct: And provided further, That any company laying a pipe line under the provisions hereof shall be liable for all damages occasioned by reason of the negligence of such gas company,\u2019 etc.\n\u201cIt is clear from a consideration of the foregoing and other provisions of the act, that companies organized under it are public corporations. In addition to the legislative declaration that the transportation and supply of natural gas for the public consumption is \u2018a public use,\u2019 corporations organized or provided for under the act are required \u2018 to furnish to consumers along their lines and within their respective districts natural gas for heat or light or other purposes, as the corporation may determine.\u2019 They are also invested in the fullest manner with the right of eminent domain and all other powers and privileges necessary for the prosecution of the business for which they are incorporated.\n\u201c Where use has been declared 1o be public by the legislature the courts will hold it such unless the contrary clearly appears.

Camp, 33 Conn. 532.\n\u201c But this question has been decided by the Supreme Court in the case of Henry M. Johnston against People\u2019s Natural Gas Company, reported in 5 Cent. Rep. page 564, in which it was held: \u2018That the transportation and supplying of natural gas for public consumption is a public use, and the right of eminent domain granted to corporations by the tenth section of the act to provide for incorporation and regulation of natural gas companies of May 29, 1885, is within the constitutional power of the legislature to grant.\u2019\n\u201c It may be proper to state here that no evidence has been adduced by the defendant to show that oil exists in said land or that it is oil territory. On the contrary the evidence of the plaintiff proves that it is not oil territory and that oil has not been discovered upon it, although a number of wells have been drilled. The evidence of the plaintiff shows, and there is no countervailing proof, that the gas in the six hundred and ninety-four acres is necessary and indispensable to it in carrying out the public purposes for which it was incorporated, and is part of its capital stock upon which it pays a tax to the state.\n\u201cBeing of the opinion that the plaintiff is a corporation engaged in a business of a public interest, and that as the evidence shows the gas in the six hundred and ninety-four acres is essential to the exercise of its corporate franchises for public purposes the exemption from taxation claimed must be sustained.\n\u201c \u2018 The principle which appears to be recognized in all the cases is that the public works of a corporation, used as such, with their necessary appurtenances and which are essential to the carrying out of the public purposes of such corporation, are exempt from taxation:\u2019 West Chester Gas Co. v. Chester County, 30 Pa. 232. The works of gas companies were held not to be taxable, and the same thing was again decided in Coatesville Gas Co. v. Chester County, 97 Pa. 476. In Scranton v. The Scranton Electric Light and Power Co., it was decided that the property necessary to carry out the corporate purposes of a corporation engaged in business of public interest, is not liable to local taxation where such property is included in the capital stock which pays a state tax: 8 County Court Rep. 626. To the same effect is Lancaster v. Edison Electric Illuminating Co., 8 County Court Rep. 631. \u2018 A public corporation is one which cannot carry out the purposes of its organization without charter rights from the commonwealth. Railroads, canals and gas companies must have the right of eminent domain in order to perform their functions. Their property, which is indispensable to their charter rights, is represented by their capital stock, and as such is taxed specially by the legislature, and the law will not subject it to duplicate taxation by mere inference: \u2019 Schuylkill Co. v. Citizens Gas Co., 148 Pa. 162.\n\u201c But it is contended by defendant that if the assessment of taxes was illegal, a bill for injunction is not the proper remedy; that the St. Mary\u2019s Gas Company should have proceeded in the manner provided by the act of assembly and appealed from the assessment. This contention is untenable. In the case of Banger\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 91, the Supreme Court laid down the rule. In that case they said: \u2018 It was urged that a court of equity will not interfere to restrain the collection of taxes but will leave the party aggrieved to his remedy at law. This is true where tax is lawfully assessed, or where the matters complained of are mere irregularities in the valuation or assessment, but where for want of power to tax or disregard of the constitution in the mode of assessment, we have no doubt of the power and the duty of a court of equity to interfere: \u2019 St. Clair School Board\u2019s App., 24 P. F. S. 256; Wheeler v. City of Philadelphia, 77 Pa. 338; Kitty Roup\u2019s Case, 81* Pa. 211.\n\u201c In the case referred to by counsel in his brief, Moore v. Taylor, 147 Pa. 481, the property in that case had been exempt for a part of a year, but the exemption ceased and it was then assessed. And it was properly held in that case that, as the property was liable to taxation, the remedy of the party aggrieved was by appeal, and that a bill in equity would not lie.\n\u201c The injunction heretofore granted must, therefore, be continued until final hearing.\u201d\nError assigned was decree continuing injunction.\nW.
