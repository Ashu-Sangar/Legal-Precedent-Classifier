T., 1895, by W: P. Trim, from decree of O. C. Warren Co., Sept. T., 1893, No. 20, dismissing appeal from register of wills.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Williams, McCollum, Dean and Fell,JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from register of wills.\nFrom the record it appeared that Ezra Trim died July 28, 1893, leaving to survive him only collateral kin. The material portion of his will was as follows :\n\u201c As soon after my decease as conveniently may be I give and bequeath unto Each and all of my Legal heirs one dollar a piece after the same is fully paid and Satisfied I Give and bequeath all of my real and personal property including Lands and tenements and all personal Effects to Go to the benefit Of the poor of Eldred Township Warren County Pa to have the use and Nothing more\n\u201c Said land Situated in Eldred Township Warren County and state of Pennsylvania and known as the homestead farm on tract No. 144 & 145 making One hundred and seventy acres and one half acres of Land I also Give and bequeath to the poor of Eldred Township one other piece of Land for their benefit and use Situated in Eldred Township Warren Co Pa Tract No. 194 and when fully proven up to be managed by the overseers of the poor in Said County for the benefit of Eldred Township.\u201d\nUpon the application of the commissioners of the Rouse estate, who are under the act of April 4, 1866, in effect overseers of the poor for the poor district of Warren county, the register appointed John Brightman, administrator c. t. a. The next of kin appealed from the action of the register in granting letters. Noyes, P. J., filed the following opinion:\n\u201c The last will of Ezra Trim gives certain lands specifically described and all the residue of his estate \u2018to go to the benefit of the poor of Eldred Township, Warren County, Pa; to have the use and nothing more .... for their benefit and use .... and when fully proven up to be managed by the overseers of the poor in said County for the benefit of Eldred Township.\u2019 The register appointed the appellee administrator e. t. a., on the nomination of the commissioners of the Rouse estate. If the residue of the testator\u2019s estate is well devised to them in trust, then this was right, otherwise the appeal by the next of kin should be sustained, for if as to the residue he died intestate, the administrator should have been selected from the next of kin.\n\u201c A testamentary disposition for the benefit of the poor of a defined locality is clearly a charitable use, and will be sustained even although it would fall under the condemnation of some rule of law if it were a private or merely benevolent disposition. Although the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty be not in being, yet if they belong to a class so designated by the testator that its members may be ascertained by means of the testator\u2019s description, or, if he has given discretion to some person or body of persons to select them, the gift will be sustained: Witm\u00e1n v. Lex, 17 S. & R. 88. The relief of the poor appears among the \u2018good and godly uses\u2019 recited in the statute 1 Edw. VI. c. 14. \u2018 To the poor of Stratford,\u2019 was enough to carry the charitable gift of William Shakspeare to his townsfolk; and the poor of Eldred township, a definite municipality, is certain as words can make anything: Lawrence County v. Leonard, 83 Pa. 207.\n\u201c Now, is there any doubt as to the trustees designated by the testator? He has not given their correct corporate name, but he has used terms which describe them perfectly, and are applicable to no one else. They are by express provisions of the act incorporating them, \u2018 the overseers of the poor\u2019 in said (Warren) county. The words \u2018 for the benefit of Eldred township,\u2019 which the counsel for the appellant treat as part of the description of the trustees, are not so intended, but are plainly a repetition of the terms and purpose for which the overseers are to manage the property. It is true that this disposition will enure to the benefit of the taxpayers, but that is the effect of every benefaction which provides for any of the burdens of government; and it is also true that inasmuch as Eldred township is not a poor district, some complication may arise in the administration of this trust so as to limit its benefits to the inhabitants of Eldred township, but these difficulties cannot prevent the vesting of the estate, nor does it appear that they cannot be overcome, without the application of the doctrine of cy fres. But if they cannot, the power to apply it in cases in which the testator\u2019s intent is clear and lawful is clearly possessed by the courts of this state, not only as part of their common law power, but by the express provisions of the statute law: Act of April 26,1855, sec. 10 (P. L. 331); act of May 26, 1876 (P.L. 211).\n\u201cNotwithstanding the opinion of Judge Penrose in Alter\u2019s Estate, 4 C. C. R. 558, which from his ability and experience is entitled to great respect, I am not convinced that the act of 1885 (P. L. 259) was intended, or did in fact affect the power of the courts at all. The 10th section of the act of 1855 contains two provisions: That no disposition for charitable uses shall fail for certain defined defects, but that the same shall be carried into effect by the courts \u2018 so far as the same can be ascertained and carried into effect, consistently with law and equity ; \u2019 and second, that such dispositions so far as they cannot be carried into effect shall be understood to be made subject to be disposed of by the legislature, and, failing such disposition, to go into the public treasury. The act of 1885 repeals the ey pres power thus assumed by the legislature which existed only in cases where the courts could not sustain the disposition, and directs that in such cases the estate shall go to the heirs at law. The commissioners of the Rouse estate are a corporation expressly authorized to receive property by devise, and the purpose of their incorporation was to administer a similar charity. The testator\u2019s will, though not elegantly expressed, is not ambiguous or doubtful, nor is his disposition illegal; but on the contrary it is highly meritorious \u2014 charitable in the broad and legal sense of the word. It is clearly our duty to sustain it.\n\u201c The appeal is dismissed and the . decree of the register affirmed at the costs of the appellant.\nError assigned was above decree.\nJ. H.
