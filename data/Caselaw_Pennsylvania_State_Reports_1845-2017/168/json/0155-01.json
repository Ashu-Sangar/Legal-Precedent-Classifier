        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThe case stated is intended to take the place of a bill in equity to enforce the specific performance by the defendant of a contract for the sale of real estate made by his predecessor in the trust. Th.e primary question is whether the agreement entered into by Charles Still as executor was a valid exercise of the power of sale conferred upon him by the will of Sarah K. Still. The power given is in these words: \u201c I authorize and empower my executor at any time during the lifetime of my husband with his assent, and I direct him immediately upon the decease of my said husband, or so soon thereafter as may be, to sell the whole or any part of my real estate for cash, upon credit or ground rent \u201d etc. On Oct. 20, 1890, Charles Still, executor, agreed with the plaintiff in writing as follows: \u201c . . . . that if Geraldine H. Hickok desire to become a purchaser of that piece of ground or land, with house and appurtenances thereon .... of which she is now lessee and occupier at any time during her leasing of the property she may do so for the sum of nine (9) thousand dollars, to be paid as follows,\u201d etc. The plaintiff was then in possession under a lease from the executor, which did not end until May 1, 1894. Charles Still died Feb. 13, 1892, and letters of administration de bonis non cum testamento annexo were granted to Albanus C. Still, the defendant in the case stated, and the appellee. On Dec. 3, 1893, the plaintiff notified the defendant of her intention to purchase under the agreement.\nThe power conferred is an authority to sell during the life of the husband, and a peremptory direction to sell immediately after his death. As the husband of the testatrix was the executor, and during his life the sole possessor of the power, he might have made a sale deferring the time of settlement. This however he did not do. He did not sell the property, hut entered into an agreement with the plaintiff which gave her the privilege of buying at any time within three and a half years. By this agreement she was entirely free; she was not bound to purchase. But he, and in the event of his death his successor in the trust, was bound to sell to no one else during the period fixed. The vice of the agreement is that it bound the trust estate, no matter what the detriment to it might be, without giving it any corresponding advantage. This was not a use of the power, but a surrender of it for the time. It suspended the exercise of the discretion which had been given the executor, and defeated the direction in the will for an immediate sale upon his death. A trustee cannot be permitted to deprive himself of a power conferred for the benefit of the trust, or so to fetter its exercise by himself or his successor as to defeat the purpose of the trust.\nWe do not find that the question involved has been decided in our oases, but it has been considered in two English cases, Clay v. Rufford, 5 De Gex & Smale, 786, and Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Sutherberry, L. R. 16 Ch. Div. 236, which, while differing somewhat in their facts from the one under consideration, are decided upon principles which are fully applicable to it. Although they are against his contention, our notice has been directed to these cases by the learned counsel for the appellant with the highly commendable purpose of aiding the court in the examination of a question which is almost barren of authority.\nWe are of opinion that the contract made with the plaintiff by Charles Still was not a valid exercise of the power of sale conferred upon him by the will of Sarah K. Still, and the judgment of the court of common pleas is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.",

Still, Trustee, etc.\nTrusts and trustees \u2014 Power of sale.\nA trustee cannot be permitted to deprive liimself of a power conferred upon him for the benefit of the trust, or so to fetter its exercise by himself or his successor'as to defeat the purpose of the trust.\nTestatrix by her will directed as follows: \u201c I authorize and empower my executor at any time during the lifetime of my husband with his assent, and I direct him immediately upon the decease of my said husband, or so soon thereafter as may be, to sell the whole or any part of my real estate for cash, upon credit or ground rent,\u201d etc. On Oct. 20, 1890, the executor who was also the husband agreed with the plaintiff as follows : \u201c That if Geraldine H. Hickok desire to become a purchaser of that piece of ground or land, with house and appurtenances thereon .... \u2014of which she is now lessee and occupier \u2014 at any time during her leasing of the property she may do so for the sum of nine (9) thousand dollars, to be paid as follows,\u201d etc. The plaintiff was then in possession under a lease from the executor which did not end until May 1, 1894. The husband died ori Feb. 13, 1892, and on Dec. 3, 1893, plaintiff notified the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of her intention to purchase under the agreement. Held, that she was not entitled to a specific performance of the contract.\nThe vice of the agreement was that it bound the trust estate no matter what the detriment to it might be, without giving it any corresponding advantage. This was not a use of the power, but a surrender of it for the time. It suspended the exercise of the discretion which had been given the executor and defeated the direction in the will for an immediate sale upon the husband\u2019s death.\nArgued Jan. 29, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 5, Jan. T., 1895, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Phila. Co., March T., 1894, No. 1028, for defendant, on ease stated in equity.\nBefore Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated in the nature of a bill in equity for specific performance.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nJSrror assigned was in dismissing plaintiff\u2019s bill.\nGeorge Stuart Patterson, for appellant.\nThis contract of sale was a valid exercise of the power of sale given the executor under the will: Jones v. Wood, 16 Pa. 25 ; Lancaster v. Dolan, 1 Rawle, 231; King v. Merritt, 67 Mich. 194; Demurest v. Ray, 29 Barbour, 563; Ex parte Huff, 2 Pa. 227; Ship-pen v. Clapp, 29 Pa. 265 ; Corson v. Mulvany, 49 Pa. 88.\nThere are no American authorities, so far as the counsel for the appellant knows, which impeach the validity of such a contract. There are two English cases, however, which may be urged on behalf of the position of the appellee: Clay v. Rufford, 5 De Gex & Smale, 768 ; Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Sutherberry, L. R. 16 Ch. Div. 236. These however may be distinguished.\nA court of equity will grant specific performance of the contract : Catheart v. Robinson, 5 Peters, 263; Marble Co. v. Ripley, 10 Wall. 339; Franklin Tel. Co. v. Harrison, 145 U. S. 459; Corson v. Mulvany, 49 Pa. 88; Smith\u2019s App., 69 Pa. 474 ; Childs v. Gillespie, 147 Pa. 173 ; Green v.

Rufford, 5 De Gex & Smale, 768; Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Sutherberry, L. R. 16 Ch. Div. 236.\nA decree enforcing specific performance of the agreement executed by Charles Still, Sr., would not be in accordance with the principles of equity: Fry on Specific Performance, sec. 389 ; Perry on Trusts, vol. 2, sec. 787.\nMay 20, 1895:"
