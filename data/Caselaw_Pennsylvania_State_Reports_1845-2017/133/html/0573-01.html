In Thomas v. Smith, 1 T. <em>&amp; </em>H. Pr. § 610, note, asimilar application was dismissed for the following very satisfactory reasons : “The act of February 27, 1798,” say the court, “is a highly penal statute, and although in terms it does not confine the rule to produce books and papers to the trial of the cause, yet the uniform practice under the act has so confined it. To extend it further would be accompanied with great danger and inconvenience. The right to inspect books and papers before the trial has therefore been confined to the cases where the parties have-a common interest in the instrument of evidence called for. Where books and papers are produced before the court and jury, in a public court, there is an evident restraint upon making an improper use of them. Were we to establish the precedent asked for, every defendant who was unwilling to pay the plaintiff’s demand, would resort to this mode for the purpose of fishing up a defence or attack upon the plaintiff, from his boobs and papers.” We can add nothing profitably to what is here so well said.

In Chambers v. Jaynes, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Pa.%2043" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Pa. 43">4 Pa. 43</a>, it is said: “ It is contended by the counsel for the defendant that the plaintiff, having averred complete performance of his contract within the time specified, is bound to make out his case precisely as he has stated it, and that the verdict shows that he did not complete his contract within the time specified, and in fact has never done it; that, too, without any fault or interference of the defendant. As a general rule, it is undoubtedly true that where a contract is entire it is incumbent on the plaintiff to show a performance of all that was stipulated on his part to be performed, and, on failure so to do, he is not entitled to recover anything. But there is an exception to this rule, and that is, that where there has been a substantial and bona fide compliance on the part of the plaintiff with his <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>contract, he shall not be precluded from recovery of his compensation on account of some slight imperfection, for which the defendant may be compensated in damages. This doctrine was first established by the case of Boon v. Eyer, 1 H. Black. 273, in note, and has been fully adopted in our Supreme Court in the cases of Ligget v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.%20331" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 W. 331">3 W. 331</a>; Preston v.

So, if he obstinately and perversely refuse to go on and complete it when it is in his power, and when the other party requests it and offers to pay for it, as was the case in Shaw v. Turnpike Co., <a href="/pen-w/3/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 445" data-case-ids="1827590" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0445-01">3 P. &amp; W. 445</a>. But suppose the party acting honestly and with a bona fide intention of fulfilling the contract, perform it substantially, but fails in some comparatively slight particulars, ought the other party to hold and enjoy the fruits of his labor and money and time, without paying a fair compensation, according to the contract, receiving credit for whatever loss or damage he may have sustained by these deviations ? We think not. In those cases where the law allows a party to recover on a quantum meruit or quantum valebat, where there is a special contract, this is the principle which applies. The party is allowed to recover, says Parker, C. J., in Hayward v. Leonard, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Pick.%20187" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 Pick. 187">7 Pick. 187</a>, in those cases only in which there is an honest intention to go by the contract, and a substantive execution of it, but some comparatively slight deviations as to some particulars provided for. Cases of fraud or gross negligence may be exceptions.”</p>

Pomroy, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Pa.%20159" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="15 Pa. 159">15 Pa. 159</a>: “ So, too, a covenant which is in form entire, but in truth embraces a variety of acts, more or less essential to the whole performance, may be so discharged as to sustain an averment of performance, though a literal compliance cannot be alleged. Wilhelm v. Caul, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 26" data-case-ids="1853556" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0026-01">2 W. &amp; S. 26</a>; Preston y.

And, perhaps, it may be asserted that where a thing is so far perfected as to answer the intended purpose, and it is taken possession of and turned to that purpose by the party for whom it is constructed, no mere imperfection or omission, which does not virtually affect its usefulness, can be interposed to prevent a recovery, subject to a deduction for damages, consequent upon the imperfection complained of. Of course, the indulgence is not to be so stretched as to cover fraud, gross negligence, or obstinate and wilful refusal to fulfil the whole engagement, or even a voluntary and causeless abandonment of it.”] 1</p>

[But, in your deliberations, you may search for a middle ground between these two positions ; that is to say, you may arrive at the conclusion that the plaintiff did not perform all his covenants, but that he performed them substantially, and honestly intended to perform them to the strict letter, but that he failed to do so in some comparatively unimportant particulars, which failure may be compensated in damages.
