On that day the defendant sold and conveyed to the plaintiff a part of said lot, viz., a strip of ground lying next to the said property of the plaintiff and extending through from Main to Lafayette street, with a frontage of 20.05 feet on the former and of 19.95 feet on the latter.</p>

Under both these buildings and along the line of Mill street, ran an artificial aqueduct known as Heebner’s race, conducting water from a place called Heebner’s meadows to a mill at the foot of Mill street, and passing in its course through various private properties and under several streets. This race had been in existence and use for a long time prior to 1884, <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>and was still in use. Throughout the entire length of the defendant’s lot the race was constructed with a wall on each side of the channel, and was covered with an arch except a section of it next to Lafayette street the covering of which was of flat stones, all the walls enclosing it, including the covering, being under ground. The depth of the channel below the covering was between five and one half and six feet. Where the race entered the defendant’s lot, at Main and Mill streets, it was about seven feet wide inside the walls which support the arch, and at that point the space between the race and the lot sold by the defendant to the plaintiff was about fourteen and one , half feet. As it approached Lafayette street the race became narrower, so that the channel was between two and one half and three feet wide when it reached that street, and the distance at the line of Lafayette street between the race and the lot purchased by the plaintiff was correspondingly increased.</p>

These buildings were constructed without cellars. The first two of them were erected in 1884, were located at the corner of Lafayette and Mill streets, and fronted on the latter. Their front walls were a continuation above ground of the wall on the side of the race next the street. Their rear walls were wholly upon the defendant’s ground. Between the rear walls and the race, the defendant dug trenches for three foundation walls extending across his lot. In building the walls which were placed in these trenches, the stones were laid without mortar for the first course, and the same plan was followed in building the rear foundation wall. In digging the trenches across the lot, the earth was entirely removed from the race wall, which in some places was taken down and rebuilt by the defendant, and these foundation walls were so built that their ends abutted against the wall of the race, and upon reaching the proper height they were carried across the race to the line of Mill street. “ According to the testimony of Alexander If. Calhoun, civil engineer, they and the back line wall are four inches below the surface of the water in the race, by actual measure<a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>ment.” During the construction of these two buildings no complaint as to the manner of their construction was made by the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b621-4" data-blocks='[["BL_621.4",621,[174,507,1165,1271]]]'>In the summer of 1886 the plaintiff commenced the erection of two brick dwelling houses upon the Lafayette street end of the lot purchased by him from the defendant. The cellars of these houses were about forty feet in length and were dug to the ordinary depth, the one next the defendant’s buildings being sunk ten inches below the bottom of the defendant’s rear foundation wall, and the plaintiff’s cellar wall was built up against the line of the defendant’s wall, starting six inches deeper than the floor of the cellar. During its building, water came into the plaintiff’s cellar at different points through the bottom of the defendant’s wall. The plaintiff went on with his building notwithstanding, and finished it in due time. He rented the house next adjoining the defendant’s premises, the tenant taking possession in March, 1887, and remaining until August, 1887, when he moved out. During that time the cellar of that house contained, and it has contained ever since, water coming from the mill race. In the judgment of the master, this water was conducted from the race to the plaintiff’s cellar by the three foundation walls extending across the defendant’s lot, under the first two of the buildings erected by him ; but none of the water came through the building which the defendant subsequently constructed on the Main street end of his lot, the foundations of that building having been so constructed that the walls were prevented by T’s, or short cross walls, laid in cement, from operating as conduits.</p>

A number of witnesses testified in rebuttal for the plaintiff as to the character of the ground, some of whom admitted that silt from the race and rubbish had been used to fill up the lots. The defendant, the mechanics who constructed his foundation walls, and other witnesses, testified that the bottoms of the walls running across his lot were all at a higher level than the high-water mark in the race, and several of these witnesses stated that there was no water in or about the foundations when they were laid. The testimony of Calhoun, referred to in the master’s findings of fact, to the effect that those walls extended below the surface of the water, was based, according to his statements while upon the stand, in part upon an inspection and measurements made in the race and in the plaintiff’s cellar, about the last of December, 1888, or early in January, 1889, and in part upon the facts stated by the witnesses for the defendant. He testified further that when he inspected the race he found a deposit of silt and mud in it, which was about two and one half feet deep at a point above Main street, and eight inches deep at a point below Lafayette street, but that in his opinion, in view of the width of the channel and the velocity of the current, this deposit would not raise the level of the surface of the water in the race. Calhoun’s testimony, as well as other testimony tending to show the source of the water in the plaintiff’s cellar, was delivered as a part of the plaintiff’s rebutting case, after an objection by the defendant to the admission of any testimony not properly in rebuttal. Witnesses for the plaintiff testified that by making an expenditure of from $8 to $10 for cement, the plaintiff could have constructed a water-tight wall which would have prevented the passage of any water into his cellar through the defendant’s foundations, and that the foundations were necessary for the defendant’s buildings and were properly constructed. The plaintiff testified that while the defendant’s building operations were in progress, he notified the latter that he would be held responsible for any damages arising from flooding the cellar. It appeared, further, that the plaintiff had brought an action <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>at law against the defendant soon after the filing of his bill in equity, to recover damages ior the flooding of his cellar by the same water complained of in the bill; that said action was tried on June 11,1888, when the jury disagreed and were discharged, and it was afterwards set for trial several times during the pendency of the present case before the master, but was each time continued.</p>

It is simply now a question of negligence. The fact that defendant made a legitimate use or appropriation of his own property, in a reasonable, usual and proper manner, is undoubted. That he had a lawful right to improve his lot, for business or other purposes, lawful in themselves, can not be questioned. He has absolute dominion over it, and is only restrained by the maxim, that in the use of it, he shall not injure his neighbor. The present Chief Justice has defined negligence to be “the absence of care according to the circumstances.” A man may be negligent, without an intention to injure his neighbor. His act, lawful in itself, may be wrongful to his neighbor, by reason of circumstances, and there are a thousand and one circumstances incident to a populous town or city, that do not exist in an agricultural or mining community.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b626-7" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[277,1675,1176,763]]]'>The test here involves actionable negligence, and it is the same in equity as at law. The defendant had the undoubted right to put these buildings on his lot, but then the question arises, how should he have put them there ? The answer is plain. It should have been done in the usual way that such buildings are ordinarily constructed, according to the usual practice and mode of skillful, civil or hydraulic engineering. Aqua currit, et debet currere, and of this maxim he should not have been unmindful. Removing the clay soil, or earth from the walls, enclosing the race; inserting the foundation walls of his buildings at right angles with the naked race walls; running them entirely across his own lot to the line of plaintiff’s lot, and sinking them below the surface of the water in the race, are a piece of unskillful engineering, and constitute actionable negligence against which equity will relieve.</p>

Supine or concurrent negligence which, in any way, contributes to the injury complained of will excuse the act of the party complainant. In this respect equity follows the law. Was the plaintiff here guilty of contributory negligence ? It will not be forgotten that the plaintiff did not dig his cellar, the injury to which is the subject of complaint here, until two years after the defendant erected his buildings; but the plaintiff’s lot was there, and the water was drained into it, without any act on the part of the plaintiff.

But the master gives no weight to this and takes the unsupported testimony of Calhoun, based partly upon an inspection made at the end of 1888, when the condition of things had changed by an accumulation of silt in the race more than great enough to account for the water being four inches above the bottom of the walls. The defendant was not bound to keep the race clean; that duty devolved upon the mill owners, and their neglect of it will not render the defendant responsible because the race passes through his laud. Was he negligent?

The weight of the evidence is overwhelming that it was at least partly made ground, and was wet and spongy at the time of the purchase, and long before. Defendant, Corson, Gehringer, Oberholzer, <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>and Rayner all so testify, and even the rebutting witnesses to the contrary nearly all admit that the silt from the cleaning out of the race, and the refuse from the cooper-shop from time to time, were dumped on it. Complainant knew the character of the land, and that dry cellars could not be built on it. The testimony of defendant, Oberholzer, Rose, Moore, Sr., and Ramey to that effect, is practically uneontradicted. Complainant, with this knowledge, started to put cellars on his lot, the floors of which were below the level of the water in the race. His own witness Hallman, the mason who laid the cellar walls, says the water came in on him so he had to build it in small sections; yet, in spite of this warning, complainant did not lay his wall in cement, nor even puddle the earth, as he did in the second cellar which was thereby kept dry. All the witnesses agree that he might have cemented his wall, or Moore’s line wall and his own cellar wall both, so as to have kept out any water from Moore’s lot, and at trifling expense. Even his own main witness, Calhoun, says it could have been done, but would have been expensive. He does not- say how much, but equally competent witnesses, Corson and Oberholzer, put the additional cost at ten dollars. Unless these witnesses are far astray in their judgment, the complainant’s act in building as he did was one of inexcusable negligence.</p>

He was the owner of a lot subject to the easement of this mill-race, with no control over it, and, so far as appears, no duty to repair. He knew the ground was wet, and showed his appreciation of the fact by constructing all his buildings from Main to Lafayette streets without cellars. When he built he put what is called a line wall on the boundary between his land and complainant's, but all within his own premises, and cross-walls from the Mill street side to this line wall. There is no evidence in the case that this was an unusual way to build. On the contrary, even plaintiff’s witnesses say (Houpt,) that “ cross-walls were the proper thing to put in,” and (Mayberry,) that they “ were necessary to be put there for the construction of Moore’s buildings, and were well constructed.” The only thing suggested is that defendant might have built differently; might have laid a wall in cement parallel to the race. But no witness even now says he was bound to do so, or that it was <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>unusual or improper or negligent to build, as he did. In the absence of such testimony, it is difficult to see wherein the defendant’s fault lay from which any liability would arise.</p>
    <p id="b634-6" data-blocks='[["BL_634.4",634,[257,521,1174,803]]]'>At law the plaintiff would have to make out a case of negligence on the part of defendant, and clear of it on his own part. The rule in equity is certainly no harder on a defendant. Even if this were an action at law, it is doubtful if plaintiff had made out his case. No better evidence of doubtfulness could be found than the failure of a jury to agree in an action for damages for this very same injury. This fact, which was put before the master, showed conclusively that the case was too doubtful for original relief in equity, and should at once have terminated the proceedings. But as the case went to final hearing and decree, we have examined the whole evidence, and are of opinion that in any aspect, whether of negligence of defendant, or contributory negligence of complainant, the complainant has not only failed to make out a clear case in his favor, but has left the weight of evidence on the side of defendant.</p>

It was not properly answer to new matter introduced by the defence, but merely cumulative on the ease in chief.</p>
    <p id="b634-8" data-blocks='[["BL_634.6",634,[518,1595,882,39]]]'>Decree reversed, and bill dismissed, with costs.</p>
