One of these channels, crossing what is now Monroe and' Madison avenues between Olive and Pine streets, carried water over the property now owned by the plaintiff. <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>The Dunmore Road, constructed prior to 1840, and afterwards worked and used by the city as one of its highways, drained into this channel some water that had naturally gone to the north into Pine Brook.

This grading of Olive street was well calculated to take from the property a large portion of the water which had })reviously flowed over it, but at the corner of Monroe avenue they had placed an obstruction in the gutter which turned the whole of the water coming down that side of that street into Monroe avenue, where it flowed to about the middle of the block and was there turned by another obstruction into a paved gutter, across the avenue, and from this gutter was discharged upon vacant lots over which it flowed to a culvert under Madison avenue, thence over a vacant lot and over plaintiff’s property. About the time of plaintiff’s purchase of the property, in 1885, this culvert under Madison avenue was closed up by the parties of whom he bought. In April, 1886, occurred a severe rain causing the water to come over Madison avenue, flooding plaintiff’s property, and damaging it to the extent of four hundred dollars.</p>

A uniform descending grade of five feet in one hundred from Olive towards Gibson street had been determined on, and the grading had been actually done, so that the water would have flowed along the unpaved gutter on the northerly side of that avenue to Pine street, but for the fact that at a point about midway between Olive street and Pine street there had been placed an obstruction, which turned the water into a paved gutter placed diagonally across the avenue, in such manner as to assist the flow of water to the lots above plaintiff’s property, and the water so conducted accumulated there and contributed to the injury complained of.</p>

The referee does not question the principles on which that case was decided, but this case is ruled by others not inconsistent therewith, and equally well established. In the case referred to, “the question,” says Lowrie, C. J., “is really reduced to this: Have the citizens of our incorporated towns a legal right to call upon the portion of the peopLe thus incorporated, to devise and execute such a system of drainage as will secure all private property against all ordinary and extraordinary flooding by rain or melted snow ? ” That is not the question in this case. Here the plaintiff is complaining not of inadequate drainage, but of obstructions to regular drainage for the express purpose of casting the water upon her. The corporation was under no original obligation to the plaintiff, or to other property holders, to grade Olive street, or to gutter it, <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>or to turn into its gutters the drainage of a large area; but, having exercised the power so to do, it was bound so to care for the water as not to inflict injury on the property of the plaintiff. Instead of doing this, it placed obstructions in the gutters that were the proximate cause of the injuries complained of. The distinction between the case of Carr v. Northern Liberties and this case, is clearly shown by Ag-new, J., in Allentown v. Kramer, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20Pa.%20409" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="73 Pa. 409">73 Pa. 409</a>.</p>

West Bellevue Bor., Ill Pa. 110. “ The injury complained of in this case flows from a scheme put into execution by the municipal authorities by which the water is prevented from following the grade of the streets. The defendant arrested the water in its course down the declivities of the highways, as they were graded, and, by artificial means turned it out of its course and in a direction it would not otherwise have gone, and, having thus collected it from a large district of country, poured it in its accumulated volume and force on the complainant’s land. If the defendant could do this without being answerable for the consequences, it would, in effect, have power to condemn private property to public use without compensation: ” Field v.

The law in Pennsylvania does not give to corporate authorities, by reason of their control over streets and the power to grade and improve them, the legal right intentionally to divert water therefrom, as a means of protecting the streets, and discharging it by artificial means in increased quantities and with increased force and destructiveness upon the property, perhaps improved, of the adjoining owner: Dillon on Mun.
