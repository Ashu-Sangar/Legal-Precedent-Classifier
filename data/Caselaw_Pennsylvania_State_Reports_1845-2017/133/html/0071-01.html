Killmer, had at or about the time when Henry Kintzel made the assignment for the benefit of creditors, she stated that knowing that Henry was unable to pay them she had bestowed the arrears to him. He also proved that some time in the fall of 1886, Henry had made an effort to sell the real estate at public sale, or a part of it, and that it was the understanding of the parties that the proceeds were to be applied, first to the payment of the Uhrich mortgage, then to the Kintzel mortgage, and then to Killmer’s as far as it would reach. No sale of the property was made, however, at that time. The same declarations as to a bestowal were shown to have been made by Henry, not however in the presence or hearing of Mary Kintzel. At the time of the hearing before your auditor, both Mary Kintzel and her son Henry were called, and both denied making the statement and <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>denied the fact of a gift or bestowal having ever been made, bnt alleged that the money was due and unpaid, and the claim just. Henry qualified his denial by saying that if he ever said so it was a mistake. Upon these facts, substantially, must depend the fact of a gift of these arrears and of course the fact of collusion.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b93-5" data-blocks='[["BL_93.4",93,[161,660,1167,603]]]'>It will be noticed that, so far as the testimony shows, the plaintiff and the defendant in the judgment are never brought face to face; no conversation or agreement is shown, as between themselves, in regard to the alleged gift or bestowal. The declarations of Henry D. Kintzel, made in the absence of his mother, can only be considered to fortify and strengthen the evidence of collusion, and not to establish it in the first instance. It is only after a confederation has been shown to exist, that the declarations of alleged confederates made in the absence of the other party, can be evidence to affect the rights or interests of the absent: Confer v. McNeal, <a href="/pa/74/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="74 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="1034675" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0112-01">74 Pa. 112</a>; Price v.

    <p class="summary" id="b93-6" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[159,1276,1166,658]]]'>The testimony of both plaintiff and defendant, denying the fact that any gift or bestowal of the arrears had ever been made, must outweigh the plaintiff’s declarations to Killmer that she had bestowed them. Supposing even -that at some time prior to the confession of the judgment a gift had been intended, what would be requisite to make it valid, against subsequent protest? There could be no manual delivery of the thing to be bestowed, from its nature. No release or receipt was executed or delivered. She never even said to her son, “ I make a gift of this charge to you.” No declaration by one to the other; nor is there any evidence that she promised or undertook to do or not to do anything in regard to the charge, and no time is suggested when the gift was made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b93-7" data-blocks='[["BL_93.6",93,[158,1942,1167,453]]]'>In regard to the understanding that the property was to be sold at private sale and the proceeds used first to discharge the Uhrich mortgage and then the others in their order as it would reach to pay them, so far as a gift is concerned it seems to be a sufficient answer to say that it was never consummated. If the money had been raised and so appropriated there would probably be an end of it. But intending to do so did not constitute the transaction an irrevocable gift of the charge, which could be enforced against the widow by the son or his creditors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.3",94,[255,341,1175,854]]]'>
      <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>It is difficult to determine what is necessary, in a case like the present, to constitute a valid gift. It is argued with some show of reason that no donation in the case could have been valid without a writing of some sort. But there is no difficulty, considering all the evidence upon this branch of the case, in determining that no valid gift or bestowal of these arrears has ever been made to the son. Furthermore, the status of the contesting parties has remained unchanged. No injury has been sustained by or right accrued to either party, by reason of what has been said or done; both claims have stood open for years equally ripe for process. It is not claimed that the arrears were paid or satisfied in any other way than by gift; and if there was no valid gift, there can be no collusion in the confession of the judgment. As the claim stood open and unsatisfied, it became the duty of the defendant to pay it, and therefore his duty not to hinder and delay but rather assist the collection of it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b94-6" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[253,1211,1174,961]]]'>It is also argued that tins judgment is fraudulent as against other creditors, by reason of having been confessed by an insolvent for a larger amount than is due, there being included in it the sum of 1548.55 for interest on the unpaid annual charges, in the absence.of a contract for the payment of interest. It will be recollected that no part of these charges were paid as they came due. The widow derived no support from her son, but advanced him money on at least several occasions. She did not live with him, nor on the premises subject to the charge. The payments were to be made on a day certain; when not so made, ordinarily they became a new principal upon which interest is properly chargeable without denqand. If the property had passed into the hands of a stranger, it is clear that interest would be properly chargeable, and, as the circumstances of each particular case must govern the question as to the right to charge interest, it is not so clear that interest in this case is not a lawful charge: HamilTs App., <a href="/citations/?q=88%20Pa.%20868" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="88 Pa. 868">88 Pa. 868</a>; West Republic M.

The question is, does its inclusion, under the circumstances, constitute the judgment fraudulent and collusive. The evidence is, that the judgment is based upon a calculation <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>as to tbe amount of money due, made by M. S. Thierwecher, a surveyor and scrivener. From it no fraud or collusion can be presumed. He was undoubtedly of the opinion that interest was properly allowable, and if it were necessary to go into the merits of that opinion, if it were found to be erroneous it would only establish his mistaken view of the law. The judgment is therefore on that account not fraudulent as to other creditors, and in this proceeding cannot be questioned on the ground that, interest was improperly included. That mistake, if it is a mistake, could only be rectified by the proper party attacking the judgment directly: Meckley’s App., <a href="/pa/102/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="102 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="502707" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0536-01">102 Pa. 536</a>.</p>

The ease of Gaskins v. Gaskins, 17 S. &amp; R. 390, which is said to be inconsistent with these conclusions, was decided “on its peculiar circumstances” as was said in Knettle v. Crouse, and in view of the later cases above cited cannot be generally accepted as authority. The costs, however, were properly imposed on the fund. The widow’s claim was of long standing, and, under all the facts in proof, we are of opinion that the creditors had reasonable ground for the contest.
