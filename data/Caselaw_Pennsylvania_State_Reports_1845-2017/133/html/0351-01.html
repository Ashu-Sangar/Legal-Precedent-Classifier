The difference in the terms of the bequests which he makes to and for his children shows that his intention was to give Howard but a life-interest and to create an active trust. The law of Pennsylvania is not inimical to such trusts: Earp’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20123" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="75 Pa. 123">75 Pa. 123</a>. The duties imposed upon the trustees by this will are such as constitute their trust an active one : Sheets’ Est., <a href="/pa/52/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="52 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1002227" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0257-01">52 Pa. 257</a>; Bacon’s App., <a href="/pa/57/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="57 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1010429" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0504-01">57 Pa. 504</a>. The property in the hands of the trustees is in fact all personalty, and courts are more anxious to support limitations in the case of personal estate than they are in the case of realty, and are more ready to construe the estate of the first taker as an estate for life: Bacon’s App., <a href="/pa/57/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="57 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1010429" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0504-01">57 Pa. 504</a>; Myers’s App., <a href="/pa/49/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="49 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="998443" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0111-01">49 Pa. 111</a>; Davis’s App., <a href="/pa/100/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="100 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="498385" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0201-01">100 Pa. 201</a>.

Harbster has but a life-interest in the bequest to him, for the reason that the words “ children and children’s children in the proper line of descent ” are used by the testator as words of purchase, and the limitation over refers to a definite failure of issue, to wit, a default of children or grandchildren at the death of the first taker: Rapp v. Rapp, <a href="/pa/6/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="6 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="954547" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0045-01">6 Pa. 45</a>; Bedford’s App., <a href="/pa/40/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="40 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="477998" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0018-01">40 Pa. 18</a>. “ Children ” is almost invariably a word of purchase and not of limitation, and the rule in Shelley’s Case will be applied where that word is used, only when the terms of the will exhibit an intention that the remaindermen shall take as heirs of <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>the devisee, instead of themselves becoming the root of a new succession : Guthrie’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%2010" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="37 Pa. 10">37 Pa. 10</a>. The court below relied entirely on Haldeman v.

Again, the estates cannot coalesce unless they are both legal or both equitable : Little v. Wilcox, <a href="/pa/119/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="119 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="558084" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0439-01">119 Pa. 439</a>.</p>

    <p id="b376-7" data-blocks='[["BL_376.5",376,[282,902,1177,1163]]]'>This will does not attempt to create a spendthrift trust, and there is no reason for the creation of any active and continuing trust. The language used should receive a strict legal construction. In all material points the facts are like those in Haldeman v. Haldeman, <a href="/pa/40/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="40 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="478140" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0029-01">40 Pa. 29</a>, though the words of the will are in this case even stronger. Even in the respect that all the legatees were not placed upon the same footing, the Haldeman case resembles this, which answers the argument based upon the fact that in the present case two of the daughters were given their shares absolutely. We submit that the trust created by Harbster’s will is in all respects similar to that created in the Haldeman case, and, like it, does not prevent the operation of the Rule in Shelley’s Case. The case cited was approved and reaffirmed in Huber’s App., 2 W. N. 579. There can be no doubt that William Harbster intended to make his son the real beneficiary, and the will discloses no intent to furnish protection against improvidence, etc., or to provide for possible children of his son.

The whole of the residue was directed to be divided into seven equal shares or parts, two of which he gave absolutely to two of his daughter’s. He <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>then directs that his executors shall invest one seventh for each of two daughters and two sons; one of the latter being Howard, the appellee. The investment is to be made by the executors “ in good and reliable securities, for the use of my son Howard Ellsworth Harbster.” The testator then further directs “ that the interest of the respective shares or parts bequeathed to my four last-named children, in trust as aforesaid, shall be paid to each of them, semi-annually, for and during their natural lives, and after their death the principal shall go and be paid to their children or children’s children in the proper line of descent; but if either of my said four last-named children, whose shares are thus given in trust, shall die without leaving children or grandchildren, as aforesaid, or any direct descendants from their bodies begotten, then such share shall revert back to my estate and be inherited by my children or their legal heirs.”</p>
    <p id="b377-4" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[138,1201,1174,917]]]'>It will be perceived at once that none of these four legatees was ever to have any possession, estate, or interest in the principal sum of the several shares. There was no bequest to them for life, with remainder to their children. They could in no circumstances take anything but the interest accruing upon the securities in which the shares were invested; and this interest they could only get from the executors, whose duty it was to invest the shares in good and reliable securities, and pay to each of them, semi-annually, the interest, only, upon the amounts of the respective shares. In order to carry out this positive provision of the will, it is indispensable that the executors shall have in their own possession the whole of the residue set apart for them,—four shares,—and invest the same in good and reliable securities. Of course, this duty could never be performed if the principal of the shares is given to the four children of the testator, and we could not make a decree giving it to them absolutely, without striking down entirely the express and peremptory provisions of the will.</p>

And still another duty devolves upon them in regard to the principal. If there are no children or other lineal descendants of any one of the original children of the testator who may die, the principal of the fund invested for that share reverts back to the testator’s estate, and must be paid to the other children or their heirs. In this case the original children of the testator take the share of the one so dying, directly and absolutely, and this makes another and different disposition of that part of the residue. Now, if we give these several original shares of the residue to the legatees of the interest only, this part of the will can never be carried out. It is very clear, indeed, to us that the trust reposed in the executors is an active trust, which makes it necessary at all times for them to have possession of the fund until it is ultimately paid over to the persons entitled to the principal.</p>
