F. M. Rick. After the judgment was entered, and without an execution and a return thereon of nulla bona, the plaintiff Rick caused a transcript to be filed with a justice of the peace of Berks county, who then issued an execution which was returned <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>nulla bona. This was followed by an attachment-execution, which was served upon Davilla Snyder, the defendant in the present suit, as garnishee, Elizabeth Miller, the defendant in the judgment, not being served. Judgment in the attachment having been entered against Snyder, on his answers to interrogatories filed, the amount thereof was paid by him. Afterward, Elizabeth Miller brought this suit against Snyder, in Lebanon county, alleging that the garnishee was not discharged by the payment of the judgment in the attachment proceedings in Berks county.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b44-5" data-blocks='[["BL_44.5",44,[263,1153,1167,500]]]'>This case turns on a very narrow point, and one which will not be at rest until it has been settled by the court of last resort. It is, as stated in the reserved question, “ whether, it being the fact that the’ defendant in the original judgment was a resident of Lebanon county, and a transcript having been taken from the docket of the justice in Lebanon county who rendered a judgment against her, and an attachment-execution having been issued thereon by the justice of Berks county, where the defendant did not reside, the justice in Berks county had jurisdiction to render any judgment in the case.”</p>

L. 512, provides that proceedings under §§ 35 and 36 of the act of 1836 shall be valid without service of the writ on the defendant, in case he reside out of the county; and § 4, act of March 20,1845, P. L. 189, repeals so much of § 36 of the act of 1836 as requires service of the attachment on any defendant, “except where the defendant is a resident of the county in which attachment is issued.” These <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>acts were held in Hains v. Viereck, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Phila.%2040" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Phila. 40">2 Phila. 40</a>, to require service to be made upon the defendant, if he resided or could be found in the county in which the execution was issued; but it was clearly the opinion of the learned judge who decided that case that the acts above cited placed attachment-executions issued by a justice of the peace on the same footing as those issued from a court of record.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b45-5" data-blocks='[["BL_45.4",45,[172,698,1165,848]]]'>It might, therefore, seem the proper conclusion that, as the defendant need not be served if he does not reside in the county, the attachment execution might be issued in any county in the state. But, as stated in Hintermeister v. Ithaca Organ Co., 1 Pa. C. C. R. 268, the question of jurisdiction still remains. If the justice has jurisdiction, the execution may issue and be valid without service on defendant. But the jurisdiction being statutory, we must find it conferred, if it exists, in the words of the statute, which are, “any alderman or justice of the peace, before whom any judgment remains unsatisfied, and an execution has returned no goods, may, on the application of the plaintiff, and his compliance with the requisitions of the act to which this is a supplement, issue an attachment in the nature of an execution, as therein provided, to levy upon stock, debts and deposits of money belonging, or due to the defendant, in satisfaction of said judgment:” Section 2, act of April 15,1845, P. L. 459.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b45-6" data-blocks='[["BL_45.5",45,[172,1565,1165,745]]]'>This seems to limit the jurisdiction to the justice “before whom” the judgment has been recovered, or at least by whom the “execution has been issued and returned no goods.” But we think an execution cannot legally be issued in a county where the defendant does not reside or cannot be found, for § 12, act of March 20, 1810, 5 Sm. L. 167, requires the execution to be directed to the “ constable of the ward, district or township where the defendant resides, or the next constable most convenient to the defendant,” which has been held in Clark v. Worley, 7 S. &amp; R. 853, to mean, any constable of the county. Therefore, the justice of the county where defendant does not reside, and cannot be found, cannot legally do that which is necessary to give him jurisdiction to issue the attachment-execution, and if issued without jurisdiction it is of course void.</p>

We need not discuss the effect of filing the transcript before the justice in Berks, as neither justice, as his docket stood, had the right to issue an attachment. The second section of the act of April 15, 1845, P. L. 459, enacts that “any alderman or justice of the peace, before whom any judgment remains unsatisfied, and an execution has returned no goods, may, on the application of the plaintiff, and his compliance with the requisitions of the act to which this is a supplement, issue an attachment in the nature of an execution, as therein provided, to levy upon stock, debts and deposits of money belonging, or due to the defendant, in satisfaction of said judgment.” It will thus be seen that an execution, and a return thereto of “ no goods,” is a prerequisite to an attachment execution before a justice. Whatever might have been the plaintiff’s right to take his transcript and use it in Berks county, he could not have had <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>an attachment in Lebanon county without this prerequisite; much less can he have an attachment upon his transcript in Berks county without it.
