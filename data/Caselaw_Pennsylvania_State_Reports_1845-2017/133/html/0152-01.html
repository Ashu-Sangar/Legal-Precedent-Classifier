These principles are self-evident and apply to the present case, in which the policy was a contract to indemnify against loss by reason of having to pay rent while the premises might be untenantable. The question presented is, did the plaintiff “ have to pay rent,” or did she pay it voluntarily? An entry by a landlord to rebuild, after a fire, if made without the tenant’s consent, is an eviction; if with such consent, it is a rescission of the lease; and in either case the tenant’s liability for rent at once ceases: Magaw v. Lambert, <a href="/pa/3/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="400531" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0444-01">3 Pa. 444</a>: Hoeveler v.

The landlord’s entry suspends rent so long as the tenant remains evicted: Platt on Covenants, 197. It was in reference to this rule of the law of Pennsylvania that both the landlord and the tenant insured the rent in this case; the latter, because she wordd remain liable for rent after a fire until the commencement of rebuilding, and the former because her liability would cease as soon as rebuilding was commenced, and his insurance would then become effective for his protection.</p>

If the landlord did not intend to rebuild, there was no necessity for his insuring the rent, as such insurance does not protect against the insolvency of the tenant, and no loss is adjustable on the policy so long as rent is collectible under the lease: Excelsior F. Ins. Co. v. Royal Ins. Co., <a href="/ny/55/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="55 N.Y. 343" data-case-ids="517323" data-case-paths="/ny/55/0343-01">55 N.

Moreover, it was not to his interest to depreciate the value of his property, as a place of business, by leaving it in ruins for the remainder of the plaintiff’s term. He would not needlessly injure his tenant by exacting from her the continued payment of rent for a heap of ruins, without at the same time injuring himself. Therefore, when she agreed to continue to pay rent after July 24, 1888, it was a voluntary act, „by which she assumed a continuing liability after the time when the law relieved her. Under decisions already cited, her agreement, in consideration of a voluntary donation from the landlord’s insurer, and a more valuable lease from the landlord, to extend her liability in order to exonerate the landlord’s insurer, was inconsistent with the contract of indemnity between the defendant and herself, and <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>cannot extend the defendant’s liability. The words of the agreement, stipulating that the liability for rent should continue under the existing lease, are unimportant, since it was only by virtue of the new agreement that the rent continued payable.' The whole transaction was an attempt to create a fictitious loss.</p>

It is manifest that if the plaintiff had not permitted the landlord to rebuild within a year after the fire, the defendant would be liable for the full amount of its policy. But her insurance would then have availed her nothing, as she was liable for three years’ rent and would have had to pay rent while the landlord was rebuilding after the expiration of the year. The reply of the defendant, when asked to consent to the landlord’s rebuilding without prejudice to its liability upon the policy, although refusing to agree in words to the plaintiff’s proposition, nevertheless means, if it mean anything, that she must permit the rebuilding, if the landlord desires it, and informs her that the defence of re-entry will not be raised. Now, after she has complied with the notice, she is told that she must lose her insurance, although the only terms on which she could get the ■ landlord to rebuild were that her covenant to pay rent should not be impaired thereby.

But the relation of the landlord to the insurer cannot affect the liability of the defendant upon its own policy. The two policies insured different liabilities. The tenant continued liable for rent after the fire : Bussman v. Ganster, <a href="/pa/72/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="72 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="434759" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0285-01">72 Pa. 285</a> : and so long as she paid it, the landlord had no claim against his insurer. If she had refused to pay it, the landlord’s insurer, on paying him, would have been subrogated to his rights and could have collected rent from the tenant: Porter on Insurance, 60, 66, 67, 251; May on Insurance, §§ 456 et seq.; Wood on Fire Insurance, 1072; Darrell v. Tibbetts, L. R. 5 Q. B. 560; North British Ins. Co. v. London Ins. Co., L. R. 5 Ch. Div. 569. But whether this be so or not, it was competent for the landlord to assign his claim for rent to his insurer on receiving payment, and he doubtless would have done so. As a practical question, then, the plaintiff had to pay her rent, and having no defence she paid it. The two policies, however, realty have nothing to do with each other.</p>
    <p id="b179-4" data-blocks='[["BL_179.4",179,[168,1221,1169,811]]]'>4. It is not averred that the 82,000 mentioned in the affidavit of defence was paid on account of the tenant’s liability for rent. But even if i't were so, as that liability amounted to $8,500 per year, and the plaintiff’s insurance amounted to but $6,000, she will be the loser to the extent of $500, after recovering in full on her policy. Another and conclusive answer to the defendant’s position respecting the payment of the $2,000, is that the landlord was at liberty to make any settlement with his insurer that he saw fit. The only question in the case, therefore, is whether the tenant was liable for this rent; if she was, the defendant is bound to indemnify her. The statement that the transaction was an attempt to create a fictitious loss, is gratuitous and unjustified. It is absurd to talk about the payment of this rent being voluntary, when a liability for three years, involving $25,000, stared the plaintiff in the face. Her agreement did not injure the defendant in any particular.</p>

Defendant, by its policy, agreed to indemnify plaintiff for “ any loss accruing to her by reason of having to pay rent for the (therein) described <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>building such time or times as the building may be untenantable by reason of fire or fires occurring during the continuance of this policy.” A fire occurred in January, 1888, and the landlord entered to rebuild in J uly. That, as a legal consequence, would have suspended the payment of rent. It was a rescission pro tanto of the lease : Magaw v. Lambert, <a href="/pa/3/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="3 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="400531" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0444-01">3 Pa. 444</a>; Hoeveler v. Fleming, <a href="/pa/91/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="91 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="488324" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0322-01">91 Pa. 322</a>. Defendant was liable, under its policy for the rent from January to July, and that amount it paid. But the plaintiff and her landlord entered into an agreement by which the former agreed to continue to pay rent during the rebuilding of the store, and, in consideration therefor, the latter agreed to rebuild with certain improvements, and to give a new lease on more favorable terms. This agreement discharged the defendant. The payment of rent under it by plaintiff was a voluntary undertaking, not a legal obligation under the first lease, against which alone the policy undertook to indemnify her. It is set out in the pleadings that the landlord was insured as to his rent in the Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Company, and that that company, asserting a right of subrogation to the landlord’s claim for rent against the tenant, procured the landlord not to re-enter until the plaintiff made the agreement in question, and that by that agreement it was expressly stipulated that the rights and liabilities as to rent, and as to claims under their respective insurance policies, should not be affected. But these facts are entirely immaterial. If true, they showed a fraudulent attempt on part of the plaintiff, the landlord, and the Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Company, to shift a burden which belonged on them to the defendant. But, even if there was no such fraudulent purpose, the effect of the agreement was to continue upon the defendant an obligation from which the law.relieved it, and no stipulation between the other parties, without its consent, could accomplish such a result.</p>

Perhaps so; perhaps not. What the landlord would have done there are no means of ascertaining, but what it was his interest to do is clear enough. He might have lain by and collected his rent from plaintiff till <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>the end of her lease, blit then he would have had to lose rent while he rebuilt; or, he might have rebuilt during her lease, and looked to his insurance for indemnity while the rent was suspended by the rebuilding. It was manifestly his interest,' therefore, to enter and rebuild during the running of plaintiff’s lease and his own policy in the Pennsylvania company. He had nothing to gain, and something to lose, by delay. The hardship in plaintiff’s situation was in having an insufficient insurance. She was bound to pay rent for three years, and only indemnified for one. It was her interest, therefore, to have the rebuilding done as soon as possible. The honest and proper course for all parties would have been to rebuild at the earliest convenient time. The plaintiff would then have paid rent until the rebuilding commenced, and would have been indemnified by the defendant. The rent would have been suspended during the rebuilding, and the landlord would have been indemnified by the Pennsylvania company. No one had anything to gain by departing from this plain course, except the Pennsylvania company, which, if the scheme had succeeded, would have transferred its own proper loss to the defendant. But, when the parties undertook to vary the defendant’s contract liability from that which the law imposed, their action was ineffective for such purpose, and as to the defendant totally void.</p>

But such a view is untenable. The meaning of the letter of defendant’s counsel, dated April 17, 1888, is entirely clear. The defence which it says will not be raised is that defendant will be “ discharged from liability by reason of the landlord entering for the purpose of rebuilding.” Of course not. The fire had taken place in the preceding January, and nearly three months’ rent was due at the date of the letter. From liability for this rent, and such other as should accrue up to the entry of the landlord, such entry would not be a dis^ charge, and the letter says that such a defence will not be raised. But then, to make certain that its meaning is not more than this, it go.es on to say explicitly that defendant will not consent to anything which will vary the legal effect of tlie landlord’s entry, to wit, the suspension of the rent during the <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>rebuilding. There is here no waiver of any of defendant’s rights.</p>
