Rauch and James K. Rauch. In order to constitute a joint contract, it is not necessary that both parties should have been present at the time the contract was made. If the contract was made at all, and it was made by Charles R. Rauch on behalf of James K. Rauch, and J ames K. Rauch had authorized him to make that contract in that way, it would have been a joint contract on the part of both. So, also, if Charles R. Rauch made the contract, if one was made, without any authority from James to make the contract, but James, with a full knowledge of all the facts, subsequently ratified the contract made in his name, then it would also be the joint contract of Charles R. and J ames K. Rauch. But before you can return a verdict against these defendants, the plaintiff must have satisfied you, by the weight of the evidence, that the contract was the joint contract of these two defendants ; for, if the evidence should satisfy you that Riere was a contract of this kind, but that it was made by Charles R. Rauch alone, then, no matter how conclusive that evidence might be, it would not entitle the plaintiff to a verdict at your hands.</p>

This will require you to consider what took place in New York on February 10th. It is admitted by both parties that on that day Charles W. Rauch and Charles R. Rauch went to New York, where Mr. Zoebisch is in business, and that they called on Mr. Zoebisch, and that there was a conversation between these three parties in reference to this life-estate. [The plaintiff alleges that that conversation amounted to a contract for the purchase of the life-estate, and ground rent. It is for you to say how that is. Were all the terms of the contract at that meeting fully and definitely agreed upon ? Was the subject matter of the contract fully defined so that the parties understood exactly what they were contracting about? Was the price at that conversation determined upon, and were the terms upon which the price was to be paid fully <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>determined upon by the parties ?

Rauch, you will next inquire whether he, at the time he made the contract, represented himself to be authorized to act, so far as the contract is concerned, for his brother James K. Rauch. Did he, if he made a contract at all, make the contract in his own behalf alone, or did he make it on behalf of himself and of his brother James K. Rauch ? As I have already said to you, if he made the contract on behalf of himself alone, there can be no recovery in this case. [If, however, you find that he undertook to contract, not only for himself but also for his brother, then you will inquire in the next place whether his brother James K. Rauch ratified what Charles had done in the premises, and when you reach that point in the case, if you reach it at all, it will be for you to say whether, subsequently, at the time when the plaintiff says that this ratification took place, James K. Rauch was fully informed of all that had been done in reference to the contract in the office of Mr. Zoebisch in New York on February 10th. Was he informed then that Charles R. Rauch had made a contract for the purchase of this life-estate, and of the ground rent, for the sum of $1,675, and that he was to pay $1,500 in cash, and to give a note for the remaining $175, and that this contract had been made by Charles R. Rauch not only on his own behalf, but also representing that he had authority to act for James K. Rauch at the time he made the contract.

This letter bore directly upon that question.

And it was not error to say that there could have been no binding ratification of the contract by James K. Rauch, unless the latter had been fully informed of what his brother had done.
