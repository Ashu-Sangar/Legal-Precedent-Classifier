In Leeds v.

The money alleged to have been paid the decedent in his life<a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>time for the wife, and for which this claim is made, arose from the payment of certain royalties for oil lands, in which it was alleged Mr. Irwin had one half interest, and which were leased by J. Wilson Irwin and other parties. But one witness was produced and examined before the former auditor, and none here. He was examined and questioned about certain papers in regard to this matter, but none were offered in evidence or admitted, and there the matter ended. The auditor did not pass upon or allow the claim; it was not acted upon or adjudicated. It is true, no formal objections wore made at the time, but the lengthy cross-examination of the only witness called by plaintiff would seem to indicate that when the necessary papers would have been offered in evidence objections would have been made. The claim certainly was not admitted and the evidence then offered did not sustain it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b27-5" data-blocks='[["BL_27.4",27,[217,1103,1165,914]]]'>What additional testimony have we now ? Nothing except a few exhibits have been offered, marked A, D, E and 0, which have not been properly proven and identified; but even these, if proven, do not of themselves establish the claim and show any indebtedness of the decedent to his wife. These exhibits do not correspond or agree as to the amounts. Exhibit A shows $18,003.82. Lead-pencil marks and figures on the back of exhibit D, said to be in the handwriting of decedent, shows $16,205.04, and, according to J. Wilson Irwin’s testimony, it was as high as $20,000; and a comparison of certificates contained in exhibit E with exhibit A, of which the latter is a cojiy, shows a marked difference in the number of payments and amounts. With such differences how can a safe conclusion be reached ? According to exhibit A, the last payment was made August, 1871, six years prior to decedent’s death. His will, made March, 1875, says nothing about any indebtedness to the wife, and there is no proof of any acknowledgment of anything due her. The claim fails, therefore, for want of proof.</p>

The last payment of the money alleged to have been received by the decedent for the wife was made in August, 1871, and the claim was first presented at the meeting of audit, June 4, 1881, nearly ten years after it was due, and now again after a lapse of seventeen years.</p>

The statute does not begin to run against a married woman until the death of her husband. In Towers v. Hagner, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Whart.%2048" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Whart. 48">8 Wh. 48</a>, it was ruled that when a wife lends the income of her separate estate to her husband, the statute of limitations does not begin to run against her claim until the death of her husband.

The reason given was that until then she could sue. The debt exists, but the remedy is suspended. This decedent died May 4, 1877, and nine years and upwards have now elapsed since the first meeting of this audit and the claim not having been seated upon the trust, or established, and the right of action having accrued at the death of decedent, May 4, 1877, the claim is now certainly barred.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b29-6" data-blocks='[["BL_29.5",29,[154,1160,1169,391]]]'>But the statute of limitations is fatal. This alleged claim was due and suit could have been brought on it before the death of decedent, to wit: September 7, 1876, when it is alleged Andrew Baney became of age. The statute therefore would begin to run from that date. The claim not being seated on the trust, or established as required by law, and over ten years having now elapsed, it certainly under Yorks’ Appeal is barred bj1- the statute.</p>

It is not ear marked or traced as a trust fund, but on the contrary, it appears to have been mixed with decedent’s own money. Neither does it appear that decedent kept a separate account, or had this money invested as trustee or guardian for said Baney. The money was due before Irwin’s death and it was not a direct and continuing trust and exclusively cognizable in equity, but the relation of debtor and creditor existed, and therefore it is within the ruling of Yorks’ Appeal.</p>

We also think that his conclusions of law that the presentation of these claims, with that of Hannah Woods, to use, etc., before the auditor appointed to distribute a previous fund, without any further action by him, was not sufficient to remove the bar of the statute of limitations.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b30-6" data-blocks='[["BL_30.4",30,[287,740,1170,299]]]'>We cannot see how the mere presentation of a claim to an auditor, without an adjudication thereon, can have any more weight or effect than a presentation to an executor or administrator. Nor does there appear to be any hardship in such a rule; for the creditor, by bringing suit in the Common Pleas, can at all times protect himself.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b30-7" data-blocks='[["BL_30.5",30,[283,1046,1174,861]]]'>If the contention of these claimants is correct, then the mere offering of a claim to an auditor without evidence to support it, or to indicate its character or amount, is equivalent to a suit at law, although the offer may not be followed up or not contested, simply because it would not be awarded anything out of the fund if established. This is not, in our opinion, the intention of the law in this regard. The true intent is, that creditors 'shall either have their claims adjudicated so as to have a decree or its equivalent, or, by bringing suit, give record notice of their existence. Whilst it is true that the mere bringing of a suit without pleadings or statement is sufficient to toll the statute in the Common Pleas, it is only so because the statute thus <em>provides; </em>but it does not follow that a demand for payment before an auditor, without more, will have the same result, and we think that the decisions of the Supreme Court since Yorks’ Appeal are to the effect that nothing short of an adjudication or decree of the court will answer.</p>

A mere demand upon an executor is not such equivalent, and it does not toll the statute.” In Reber’s App., <a href="/pa/125/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="125 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="563958" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0020-01">125 Pa. 20</a>, the same justice explains what is meant by its “equivalent in the Orphans’ Court.” The claim had been presented, adjudicated and allowed, and a payment on account in pursuance thereof. The court say, “ the liability of the maker of the notes was thus <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>established by the decree of the Orphans’ Court..... It is the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, and is as effectual to toll the statute as would be a judgment at law..... It is a question of adjudication; of the establishment of the claim in the Orphans’ Court. When so established the statute has no application.” The plain meaning of this language cannot be misunderstood, and it defeats the claims of these creditors. It plainly says that it is not the demand alone which is sufficient, but that it must be established by proof, adjudicated by the auditor or court; and when by decree it is thus given the force of a judgment, it will be sufficient to toll the statute, and not otherwise.</p>

The death of Ninian Irwin prevented her from testifying. There was not a particle of testimony in contradiction of the facts shown by the papers or of the statements of the witnesses.

      <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>2. The statute of limitations does not apply. The decision in Yorks’ App., <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>, was of course not intended to apply retroactively, and ruin innocent persons who had relied upon the law as solemnly declared and acted upon for thirty years. Even the legislature could not enact such an ex post facto law. But the claims involved in this appeal were presented and proved before an auditor in the Orphans’ Court, four years after the decedent’s death. That was the equivalent of a suit and tolled the statute: Keyser’s App., <a href="/pa/124/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="124 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="563113" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0080-01">124 Pa. 80</a>. The statute was tolled also by their being spread upon the records of the court in the proceeding to sell: Arndt’s App., <a href="/pa/117/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="117 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="555826" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0120-01">117 Pa. 120</a>.</p>
    <p id="b32-6" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[252,968,1169,501]]]'>3. As against the decedent and his personal estate, the Baney claim surely was not within the statute. This fund was all personalty, and there was in the decedent, as executor and guardian, a subsisting trust which must continue until payment, or the presumption of it by lapse of time: Oliver’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=101%20Pa.%20302" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="101 Pa. 302">101 Pa. 302</a>. This was a preferred claim and the payment on account of it was proper. The auditor was mistaken in reporting that the accountant’s counsel had abandoned her claim to have credit for the $500 paid J. W. Irwin. There is no evidence of any such abandonment, and nothing of the sort was intended.</p>
