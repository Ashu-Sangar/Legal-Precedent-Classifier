They allege that they had the right to fish there, because,- for a period of years exceeding twenty-one in number, they had exercised that right continuously.

The ordinary rule is, that when a plaintiff is entitled to recover in an action of this kind, he is entitled to recover sufficient to make good to him the injury which was done to him in so many dollars and cents, his actual loss; that is the ordinary rule. In addition to that rule, there is a further rule, that in actions of this kind the <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>motive of the defendant becomes material. [In those trespasses that are committed through mistake, ignorance, or mere negligence, the ordinary rule is mere compensation; but in such as are committed wilfully, maliciously, or so negligently as to indicate a wanton disregard of the rights of others, the jury are not restricted to compensation merely. They may, if the evidence justifies it, give vindictive damages, or, as they are sometimes called, exemplary damages, such as will not only compensate the injured party, but at the same time tend to prevent a repetition of the wrong, either by the defendants or by others. If you find therefore, gentlemen of the jury, in the evidence, proof of malice, or proof of a reckless disregard of the plaintiff’s rights upon the part of the defendants, you have a right to add to the ordinary compensation damages by way of vindication. And it is your duty, gentlemen of the jury, if you find that element in the evidence, to fix those exemplary damages to such an amount as will prevent a repetition of these trespasses. Of course you are to exercise common sense and good judgment. The parties are before you. You must judge from their conduct, as it appears from the evidence.] 39</p>

The question whether they were sufficiently domesticated, is one for you, under all the evidence in the case. If they were reduced to possession, put in the pond for the purpose of propagation and cultivating them, then, when Mr. Baylor became the owner of the pond, whether he had put these fish in himself or not, he became the owner of the fish that were in it, and if they were domesticated, they belonged to him.
