On March 28, 1885, he executed and delivered the deed of assignment upon which these proceedings were based.</p>

On December 31, 1888, judgment was rendered in their favor upon the scire facias for $5,177.86, subject to certain credits for payments made to them out of the funds of the assigned estate, the court ordering that these credits should not affect the right of the use plaintiffs, in the distribution of the assigned estate, to receive a dividend calculated upon the full amount of the judgment.</p>

So, the principal on which they would be entitled to a dividend would be $5,630.82, unless they are entitled to a dividend on the full amount of the bond as they claim. We have found the real debt to be $3,218.71.</p>

The very object of the bond given to the county is to secure the county funds, and for that purpose the county received $90,000 of security. If the county were here claiming a dividend out of this estate, it would claim it on the full amount for which the county took security, until the real debt were paid in full, in furtherance of the purpose for which this bond was given. These sureties have the same rights the county would have. Your auditor, therefore, sustains this claim, and allows them a dividend on $90,000, until the $3,218.71 actually due them has been paid; and, as a dividend on that amount would much more than pay their claim in full, we will simplify the calculation of the dividends, in the distribution, by first deducting the claim of these sureties from the fund for distribution, and then dividing the balance among the remaining creditors in proportion to their respective claims.</p>

Lessley for $420.96, and accounted for by the assignee in his first account. The facts are, that Boltz, prior to the assignment, held title to two lots of ground, forming a single tract of land in Belleview. There was some evidence that he held the title as security, i. e. an unrecorded mortgage, but that was not clearly established. After the assignment on May 23, 1885, the assignee conveyed these premises to Lessley by deed of that date and received the purchase money.</p>

The exception to which we refer is the allowance to the sureties of a dividend upon the nominal amount of the assignor’s official bond as county treasurer, viz.: $90,000, instead of upon the actual debt due thereon to the county at the date .of the assignment. This nominal amount is merely the penalty, and fixes a limit beyond which the liability of the obligors is not to go, but it does not make them liable straightway for the full amount. They might never become liable at all, or if at all. the amount was certainly contingent, wholly depending upon future events. In other words, the penalty here is not the debt; and it is the debt which fixes the proportion of each creditor’s interest.</p>

In our opinion, the true claim is the measure of ownership ; the real debt, and not a mere nominal penalty, which may be readily put at any extravagant figure. We must therefore send the report back to the auditor to make a new distribution, awarding to the sureties a dividend based upon the real debt due to the county at the date of the assignment.</p>

Without insisting on this point, however, it is evident from the fact that the commonwealth acquires such a lien, that the penalty is regarded as the real debt. The demand is for the penalty, and the condition providing for a release upon certain terms, is no part of the obligation: Miltenberger v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/14/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="14 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="405983" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0071-01">14 Pa. 71</a>; Farni v.

Official bonds are a higher order of security than the bonds to secure the performance of agreements, under §§ 1 to 5, act of June 14, 1836, P. L. 638. The statute confers upon them greater rights, and they are executed for the protection of great public interests. The court below has failed to grasp the meaning of the statutes from which this bond derives its vitality, and, moreover, has forgotten that formerly the penalty was only the real debt, but was collectible as such, and even yet the judgment is always for the penalty, and execution issues for that sum, to be released upon payment in full of the damages assessed, with interest and costs: Barnes v. Webster, <a href="/mo/16/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="16 Mo. 258" data-case-ids="8854275" data-case-paths="/mo/16/0258-01">16 Mo. 258</a> (<a href="/citations/?q=57%20Am.%20Dec.%20232" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="57 Am.

If the penalty is the real debt, as the act of assembly makes it, why is not the obligee entitled to a dividend upon that sum, until the damages due him have been reached ? A creditor may proceed on all the securities he holds, at the same time, until he has made his money : Hildeburn’s Est., 8 W. N. 310; Dyott’s Est., <a href="/watts-serg/2/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 557" data-case-ids="1853564" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0557-01">2 W. &amp; S. 557</a>; Ayres v.

Hence, if the penalty stands only as collateral security, after breach of the condition the creditor takes an equitable interest in the assigned property in the proportion the penalty bears to the aggregate of the debts. There is another important consideration : the person who first brings suit upon an official bond is entitled to take the whole penalty as security for the payment of his claim, to the exclusion of every other claimant: Dallas v. Chaloner, <a href="/us/3/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="3 Dall. 500" data-case-ids="11739413" data-case-paths="/us/3/0500-01">3 Dall. 500</a> ; McKean v.

They were the sureties upon the official bond of the county treasurer, and had made good his deficit in his accounts as such treasurer. When, therefore, the assigned estate of the insolvent treasurer came before the court for distribution, they had the right to claim a dividend out of the said estate, and it is immaterial whether there was a formal substitution or not. It is the right of substitution which is the substantial thing. The right of substitution being shown, and the surety having paid the debt, he succeeds by operation of law to the rights of the creditor. This is settled by a bead-roll of authority.

The bond was in the sum of $90,000. The deficit of the county treasurer was $4,354.82. Had suit been brought upon the bond, and judgment entered thereon, the said judgment would have been for ,$90,000, with leave to take out execution for the said sum of $4,354.82. The latter is the real debt, and upon this s'um the appellants were entitled to a dividend out of the assigned estate. In the case of a voluntary assignment, the estate passes to the creditors in proportion to their respective claims. In the case of an ordinary bond, where the penalty is usually double the amount of the real debt, it is not pretended that the holder thereof can claim a dividend upon the penalty. All the cases say the dividend must be upon the debt: Miller’s Est., <a href="/pa/82/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="82 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1047844" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0113-01">82 Pa. 113</a>; Graeff’s App., <a href="/pa/79/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="79 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="438393" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0146-01">79 Pa. 146</a>; Dean’s App., <a href="/pa/98/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="98 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="496927" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0101-01">98 Pa. 101</a>; Jordan’s App., <a href="/pa/107/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="107 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="8856313" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0075-01">107 Pa. 75</a>. Regarding the creditors of an assigned estate as the equitable owners thereof, the principle contended for would give the county of Lebanon an ownership in this estate to the extent of $90,000, whereas its claim is limited to a little over $4,000. We know of no rule of law which would give the county such an advantage over other creditors.</p>
