The deed of the defendant company, dated that day, was delivered by the agent to the plaintiff, the latter giving, for the consideration to be paid, his note for $625, payable to the order of Samuel M. Schenck, the company’s secretary, three months after date. The plaintiff at once began to build upon the lots. On May 22, 1884, having been informed that the lots were outside the borough limits, he complained about the matter to Westbrook, who assured him that the lots were within the borough, but he was not satisfied and stated that he would not go on with his building. Thereupon Westbrook drew and executed an agreement, on the part of the defendant company, in substance to the effect that if the lots were not within . the borough, the company would hold the plaintiff’s note for two years, and in the meantime endeavor to get them in; and, if at the end of two years the lots were not in the borough, the note should be considered paid and should be returned to the plaintiff. This agreement was not under seal, and it was signed, “Pen Argyl Land Improvement Company, by H. Westbrook, agent.”</p>
