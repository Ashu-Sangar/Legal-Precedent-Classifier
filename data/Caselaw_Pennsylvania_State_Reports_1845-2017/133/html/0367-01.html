    <p class="summary" id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[135,730,1164,439]]]'>The exceptants, however, contend that because of the facts that the decedent was stricken with apoplexy July 22, 1887 ; that from and after said affliction he was incapable of transacting any business, and in point of fact was totally helpless and in a comatose condition to the day of his death, which occurred August 23, 1887; and that for the furthur reason that said bank had notice of 1ns condition previous to the time it discounted the note on August 16, 1887, the note is uncollectible from the estate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b389-7" data-blocks='[["BL_389.6",389,[130,1188,1166,804]]]'>The bank did have notice of the indorser’s disease and the nature and extent of his afflictions, but this notice was not given for the purpose of preventing the discounting of the note discounted August 16, 1887. Albert, one of the sons, knowing that the note of May 11,1887, had become due and was protested, informed the officers of the bank, by way of apology, that his father was not in a condition to replace the note by a new one, by reason of his sickness. The officers so understood it, and when the note last discounted was brought into the bank it was dated and discomited. They, however, took the precaution to retain the note of May 11, 1887, as collateral security for the payment of it. The exceptants may not now use the notice of the sickness for the purpose of tricking the claimant out of its claim. To allow them to do so would be to mock justice. Laws are not made for the purpose of doing outrage.</p>

But he indorsed the note for the purpose of renewing the old note when it matured, and gave it to Joseph B.
