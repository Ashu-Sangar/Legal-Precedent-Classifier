This railway was built with the flat or flange rail throughout its entire length, and the company continued to use this railway and this style of rail until November, 1888. In November, 1888, the -complainant took up the flat rail on South Third street and relaid the track with T rail, until within twenty yards of the Lehigh bridge. At this point a flat rail about eight feet in length was used to connect the T rail with a cast iron grooved or slot rail, that was used on a sharp curve as the track entered on the bridge. These curved slot rails were cast expressly for the curve at the bridge from patterns made by a surveyor who had determined the exact radius of the curve at the entrance of the bridge, and could only be used again at a place where the curve was the same as at the place in question. They could not be straightened or bent in any manner, and had to be used as they were first made or cast.</p>

They were laid according to a grade furnished on application to the city engineer by the company, and without any application on the part of the company to the city for permission to use T rails, and without any notice from the city to the company not to use them.</p>

The only changes that were made in the approach to the bridge at its northern end, <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>were a lowering of the grade to the extent of five feet; and the bridge was moved west about fifteen feet, the centre line of the new bridge being the same as the centre line of the old bridge. The street approach was lowered and widened to meet the changes in the bridge. On Sunday morning, June 23, 1889, the city, in pursuance of a contract made by it with the commissioners of the county of Northampton, acting by its contractor, took up and removed the track of the complainant from the bridge, north to the northern side of Washington street.. This portion of the track was composed of the grooved or slot rail and one length of T rail.</p>

The condition of the street and of the bridge was such that the track could have been laid while the work of lowering the approach was going on, but no track was laid by the city, nor does it appear that the city made any preparation to re-lay the track or to procure proper materials for so doing. As found above, the old slot rails could not have been used in the construction of the new track after the bridge was changed.</p>

The ground occupied by the track as laid on June 29th and 30th was not exactly the same as the ground occupied by the old track. Commencing from the same point at the northern portion of the new track, a centre line to the bridge would be fifteen feet to the west of a centre line of the old track at its southern end; but with reference to the side of the bridge, and to the side of the street, the new track occupied substantially the same location as the old track. The sharp curve and the switch were done away with; and, with the exception of a slight curve the line was nearly straight. At the time of the hearing, the line occupied this latter location, and was built at grade, with the exception of a necessary elevation on outer rail of the slight curve referred to.</p>

The plaintiff having accepted the constitution of 1874, its provisions must be given the same effect as if written in the plaintiff’s charter. By it the construction of street railways, that is, the manner of laying the tracks, is placed within the control of the municipal authorities. It is clear that the company’s change in its style of rail rests upon no real necessity, but simply upon a convenience of its own making and having regard to expense only. Economy is not a sufficient reason for making such a change to the detriment of the public and the city: Penna. R.

The testimony being conflicting as to whether the use of the T rail creates a public nuisance, equity will not interfere until that question of fact is determined by a jury.

The plaintiff stands in the attitude of maintaining a nuisance and asking a court of equity to assist it in its wrong doing.

They shall submit all plans, courses, styles of rails, and the manner of laying the same, either as to repairs, extension, or construction of such railway, to the highway department, for their approval and sanction, <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>which shall be obtained before they proceed to make such repairs, break ground, or occupy any of the streets, avenues, or alleys within the limits of the city.” Without going into tedious detail, it is sufficient to state that in June, 1889, upon the rebuilding of the county bridge over the Lehigh river, the street approach was lowered and widened to meet the changes of the bridge; the track of the company from the bridge to the northern side of Washington street was taken up without notice to the company, by the contractor in charge of the work; that the city refused to re-lay the track, and, after several days had elapsed, the company, on June 29th, proceeded to re-lay it; that, a few-days before the track was so re-laid, a notice from the commissioners of highways was served on the company not to re-lay said track with T rails; that on the morning of Monday, July 1st, the city, through its officers and agents, proceeded to tear up the track which had been thus re-laid. The company then filed this bill against the city, its mayor, officers, and members of its highway department, praying for an injunction to restrain them from any further interference with its road; a temporary injunction was granted; the track was re-laid; the case proceeded to final hearing; and it now comes up upon appeal from the final decree of the court below dismissing the plaintiff’s bill.</p>
    <p id="b538-6" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[254,1523,1175,861]],["BL_539.1",539,[222,343,1167,659]]]'>The contention of the city is that it has the absolute right to control the kind of rail to be used by the company, the manner of laying it, and also the repairs to the track. The company contends, on the other hand, that by its charter it has the right to lay down any rail in its discretion, suitable for the purposes of its road, which does not interfere seriously with the rights of the citizens to use their streets; that they are not to be held to the rail first adopted, because first used, but may take advantage of any improvements in railroad construction; and that the T rail which they have adopted, from its small size, and the manner in which it is laid, interferes with the public use of the streets as little as the flat rail formerly in use, while it is far cheaper and more economical. The master took a vast amount of testimony as to the merits of the respective rails, ninety-nine witnesses having been examined on this point alone, and found as a matter of fact that the T rail used by the company was one suitable for the purposes of a <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>street-passenger railway; that the burden imposed on the street by the use of the T rail, both as to the inconvenience of the traveling public and encumbrance to the highway, was no greater than would have been occasioned by the use of a flange or flat rail; and that he cannot find that the use of a T rail imposes upon the municipality a greater burden in keeping the street in repair than does a flat or flange rail. The learned judge below practically reversed the master upon all these findings of fact, and dismissed the bill. While this matter is not of much importance, in our view of the case, it is only fair to the master to say that his findings are fully sustained by the evidence. As now presented, however, it must be disposed of upon other principles.</p>
    <p id="b539-5" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[224,1010,1167,711]]]'>The bill was filed by the appellant company to re strain the city and its officers from “ obstructing, taking up, removing, or otherwise interfering with the plaintiff’s railway track on South Third street, in the city of Easton or elsewhere, or in anywise obstructing or interfering with plaintiff in the exercise of its franchises.” The company has alleged and proved the commission of certain acts which it contends were unlawful, and which resulted in the tearing up of its track, and an interference with its franchises, traffic, and business. There is no manner of dispute as to what the city has done, and it remains to determine whether such action was lawful, and performed in a lawful manner. If unlawful, it is very plain that the decree below must be reversed, and the injunction must go.</p>

There was a dispute between them and the appellant company as to the kind of rail to be used. It was a dispute not unlikely to arise, under such circumstances. It presented a fair subject for contention, and the law provides adequate and orderly ways of settling such differences. The question here is, not what were the merits of this controversy, —upon that subject we are not now called upon to express an opinion,—but were the city officials justified in deciding this question, both as to its law and its facts, and then carrying their decree into effect by an act of brute force ? Could the officials of the highway department, after seeing these rails laid down months before, and making no objection thereto, sud<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>denly decide that it was an unlawful structure, and proceed to abate it with a strong hand? Conceding that the city had .rights in this matter which the company were bound to respect, it is equally clear that the company had rights which the city officials were bound to respect. It is true a municipality may, with the strong hand, abate a public or commón nuisance, which endangers either the health or the safety of its citizens. This much was decided in Klingler v. Bickel, <a href="/pa/117/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="117 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="555802" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0326-01">117 Pa. 326</a>. But no one contends that this road was a nuisance of this character, if a nuisance at all. Nor is there any analogy between this case and that of the obstruction of a public highway by an unauthorized person. It was a track laid down upon the streets, under the authority of chartered rights, and if the kind of rail used was not the best for the interests of the city, yet it was put down in entire good faith and by authority of law. We cannot assent to the proposition that the company is bound by its charter to the same kind of rail in use when the charter was granted. There is neither reason nor law to sustain it. Such a construction would deprive the company of the benefit of any advance in railroad science, and would prevent the adoption of a better. rail, even if the same were advantageous both to the company and to the city. There was nothing in the case to justify the conclusion that this track as laid with the T rail was a public or common nuisance, which the highway department could forcibly and of its own will abate. The learned judge below appears to have felt the force of this, for, after a discussion of the facts, he makes use of this language: “ Under such circumstances, the plaintiff had no right to call upon the master, and has no right to call upon the court, oh a motion for an injunction, to decide the question of nuisance or no nuisance;” citing New Castle v. Raney, <a href="/pa/130/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="130 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="568959" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0546-01">130 Pa. 546</a>. In this he was entirely right, yet the question naturally suggests itself, if the master and the court below had no right to decide a question of nuisance or no nuisance upon a motion for a special injunction, what .right had the chief commissioner of highways and his assistants, who are not presumed to be learned in the law, to decide for themselves, without any proceeding before them, that this track as laid was a common nuisance ? If they did not so decide; if in point of fact the track was not a common nui<a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>sanee, they had no right to tear it up; they were merely trespassers and rioters, and liable civilly and criminally as such. We aro emphatic upon this point, because we do not wish to be misunderstood. There is a growing disposition in this commonwealth, especially on the part of corporations, private as well as municipal, to take the law into their own hands, and settle controversies by force, instead of appealing to the courts to redress their wrongs and enforce their rights in an orderly and peaceable manner. Instances are not rare, and are of recent occurrence, where bands of men have stood confronting each 'other, some of them with arms in their hands, in the assertion of supposed rights. The public peace has been threatened in this manner, sometimes resulting in loss of life. It is well that it should be known that such persons, whether representing individuals, private corporations, or municipalities, are simply rioters, and answerable to the criminal law for their conduct. It is a serious mistake to suppose that municipal officers are above the law, and can enforce civil rights, or perform even police duties, in their own way, in disregard of the forms of law. The officers of a municipality, from the mayor down to a police officer, are as much bound by the law as a private citizen, and have no license to transgress the law in the enforcement of the law.</p>

They have not filed a cross-bill, nor have they applied to this court or any other court to adjust the differences between the city and the appellant company. They have no prayer for relief. On the contrary, they have assumed to decide the delicate questions involved for themselves, and to enforce their decision by the strong hand. This cannot be permitted. We are of opinion that their acts were unlawful, and that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for.</p>
