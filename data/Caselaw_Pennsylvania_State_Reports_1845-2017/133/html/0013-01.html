A. Yes. I was sick and in my bed. Christ, came there, and I said to him, “How is it now with Jake? Must he pay this money out?” Q. What mone3r? A. This insurance money he had drawn. Q. On whom? A. On Wolf. Q. What did he say ? A. He <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>said “ Oh no, that we can fix. I will take judgment, and we will fix it that way.” Q. Well what did he say? A. I then said to him “ How can you take judgment ? ” He said such things can be fixed, if you are sharp enough. Then he said “ We are sharp enough for Wolf and Boyer.” Q. What further did he say ? A. That is all that I know of at that time. He had no reason why this was to be done, other than the statement. Ho said they would fix it in this way so that Boyer and Wolf could not get at it..... Q. Now, Mr. Boardner, this was in the fall of 1883. Did you have a conversation with him afterwards, and if so when was it and where was it? A. On the fifteenth of May, 1884,1 came to the house of Christ. Kohr; and, whether it was the same week or the week after, we had this conversation, I don’t lightly know. Then the train went up, and I said “ There goes Boyer.” .... Q. What else was said at that time and place ? A. I then said to Christ., “How is it with Jake and Wolf?” Q. What did he say? A. He said he held judgments of $2,900: I said to him, “If you would want to, you would not have to give this money back to Jake.” Q. What did he say? A. He said “ Oh it is a brother.” We then spoke about the others; about Bill Kohr and about Alf. H. Young and about Bill Miller’s wife; how much it was I don’t know. Q. What was said of the judgments which they held against Jake Kohr? A. Well he said they had judgments too. I said <em>“ </em>Why I supposed they owed Jake.” He said “ Well, they have judgments now.” Q. Was anything said at that time about Jake not being able to own anything? A. Didn’t I say that before? Q. No you didn’t say anything about that. A. I then said to him, “ Then Jake can’t own anything.” He said, “No, but he gets the worth of it anyhow.” Q. Did Christ, say anything as to what those judgments were given to him and the others for? A. No, he didn’t say for what the judgments were given. Q. Was anything said by Christ. Kohr, at that time, that this was being done for the purpose of keeping the Wolfs out? A. No. Q. Was anything at that time said about being too sharp for Wolf and myself ? A. I think not, I don’t know..... Q. During either of these conversations was anything said about Christ, owing him $1,000? A. Yes, he told me that he owed Jake $1,000. Q. How did you get at it? A.

During any of these conversations, was anything said about his owing Jake $1,000, and how he could take a judgment from Jake when he owed him money? A. At this conversation we spoke about, I said to him, “ How is it that you can take a judgment from Jake, when you yourself owe him $1,000 ? ” And he said “ If one is sharp enough he can fix it.” ....</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b39-6" data-blocks='[["BL_39.5",39,[150,947,1167,1220]]]'>Briefly stated, the testimony of the plaintiff is to this effect: Jacob Kohr, finding that the estate of Wolf was about to bring suit against him upon a certain claim, and fearing recovery, he was anxious that his estate should not go to the payment of this claim; and, therefore, with the intention of hindering, defrauding and delaying the estate of Jacob Wolf, he confessed judgment, among others to Christian Kohr, in order to keep the estate of Jacob Wolf from realizing its claim out of Jacob Kohr’s property; that in pursuance of this design he confessed this judgment to Christian Kohr. In support of that allegation you were shown that a good many other judgments were confessed at about the same time, just before the arbitrators were to meet. You have also the evidence of Boardner, who testifies to a declaration with regard to the purpose for which this judgment was confessed, and from this and other testimony the jury might infer that the judgments were confessed for fraudulent purposes. It has also been urged that the indebtedness, even at the best, existing between Jacob and Christian, was only for one of the Hess children, Ida Hess, and about $200 in the Lebanon Bank, making seven or eight hundred dollars in all. That has been urged as at least another fact tending to show that this judgment was fraudulent. That is the plaintiff’s case, as I understand it, or substantially so, and if I have omitted any facts I have not done so consciously.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b39-7" data-blocks='[["BL_39.6",39,[149,2171,1165,253]],["BL_40.1",40,[297,373,1169,1117]]]'>On the other side, although Christian and Jacob Kohr deny any intention to defraud any one, they state that the consideration of this judgment was to secure an indebtedness of Jacob Kohr, who was the guardian of two children whose money he had spent, and that the rest of the amount was made up of <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>some money which Christian was responsible for in the Lebanon National Bank. It appears that Jacob was the guardian of these children. It also appears beyond question that Christian was his bail in the sum of §2,000. You have also heard that Jacob was responsible for, and had spent this money which he received for the two children, and, as Christian is his only surety, Christian will be called upon to refund that money. Now, if this testimony is believed by the jury, there is the sum of §1,100 accounted for, in this judgment, «which it would be entirely proper that Jacob should secure. With regard to the amount of the notes in the Lebanon Bank, it is not denied that there was a note, and Jacob Kohr testifies that while he got the money, Christian was security and paid all of it. If that testimony is believed, that Jacob got the money and Christian was only the surety, of course that would be another sum which it would be entirely honest and right that Jacob should secure Christian, as it was a debt which he owed to Christian and which he was bound to discharge. That would make very nearly the amount of this bond, and, with the interest, no doubt the whole sum would be accounted for. Mr. Weidman’s testimony, you will remember, is to the calculations by which they arrived at the amount of the judgment.</p>

No fraud could be found from such facts, if the jury believed them to be true. Jacob could satisfy his creditor only to the amount of his indebtedness, and no farther. That i's what a debtor has a right to do to any creditor. <em>He </em>has a right to prefer one over another, of course with the limitation that it must be for an honest debt, and must not be for more than the amount of the real indebtedness.</p>

I suppose the jury can readily see from all the testimony that Jacob Kohr did not want to have this claim of Wolf’s collected from his <em>estate; </em>that he did confess these judgments at the time this claim was pushed, ,for the purpose of preventing Wolf’s estate from collecting <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>tlieir claim. But he had a right to prefer this claim, if he really owed the money. Now, as to this statement, that the claim of Wolfs would not be collected because he would confess judgment, if it were a declaration of intention to confess judgment for honest debts, that he had a perfect right to do. 1 am only suggesting this to you as a possible conclusion. On the other hand, the jury must determine of course how it was.</p>

On the other hand, if you find that the defendant has satisfactorily explained the judgment, and that it was for no more than was actually due, then your verdict must be for the defendant.

It was urged, however, on the part of the plaintiff, that certain evidence was excluded which ought to have gone to the jury, and which might have led them to-a different conclusion. This forms the subject of the first and second assignments of error. The evidence referred to, however, was clearly inadmissible; It was in no way connected with the defendant. The declarations of Jacob Kohr, in his absence, were not competent. Nor do we see any error in the admission of the evidence referred to in the third and fourth assignments. It was offered and received for the purpose of showing the consideration of the judgment. The fifth and sixth assignments allege error in the answer to the plaintiff’s points, and are not sustained. They were properly answered'in connection with the general charge, in which the learned judge said: “ Upon the whole question as to whether or not this judgment was a collusive or fraudulent one, as between these two parties; whether it was confessed for a larger sum than was due; whether it was confessed without consideration in that sum, with intent to hinder, defraud or delay the estate of Jacob Wolf from collecting its claim, if that was the case in whole or in part, the judgment is not good against <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>Wolf, and your verdict would have to be for the plaintiff.” The learned judge committed no error in submitting the facts involved in these points to the jury.</p>
