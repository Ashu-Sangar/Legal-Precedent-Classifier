The question is, therefore, what effect has these pencil marks and lines upon the will and bequests in the will, as written by Mr. Dutton and signed in Ms presence by the testator.

A revocation by obliteration may be either partial or total; when a pen is drawn over part of the will only, a revocation is effected pro tanto and the unobliterated portions remain in force: Jarman on Wills, 291. In Cook’s Est., 5 Clark 1, the court cites Roberts v. Round, 3 Hagg. 552, which held that when the first part of a will had been mutilated, and different parts cut out, Sir John Nicholl, carrying out the principle, says: “ This mutilation of the first part, leaving the sigilature untouched, would not be a total <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>revocation; it would be a revocation of these parts of the devises only.” It is, therefore, apparent from the authorities, that the cancellation or obliteration made in this ease, if effectual, can only be so upon the particular bequests through which the pencil lines are drawn, and opposite to which crosses have been made over the words “ Item ” on the margin of the paper.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[155,697,1168,607]]]'>That a testator can revoke his will by canceling or obliterating his name by drawing a line through his name at the end of his will, without more, has been decided: Baptist Church v.

If, therefore, a codicil was executed in pencil and proved according to the statute, canceling certain bequests in a will, it would have the effect of revoking the bequests originally made therein, because it is one of the "ways pointed out by the statute to do so. And if it is held that an ink line drawn across a particular bequest will revoke the bequest, it would seem clear that a pencil line obliterating the bequest would have the same effect, wlieu done with the intention of revoking it.</p>

      <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>It is laid down in the text books, Williams on Executors, 63 and 111; Jarman on Wills, 291; Greenleaf’s Evidence, 595, that if an alteration or obliteration is in pencil it may be final, or it may be deliberative. Our own decisions seem to have abolished the distinction between a pen and pencil, and therefore, whether a revocation is intended as final or deliberative, must depend upon the intention of the testator. In this case, there is nothing outside of the will itself, as produced after his death and now of record, to explain these marks and lines. The testator clearly intended something by making a cross over the “Items” in the margin, and running his pencil several times through the bequests. What was his intention in so doing ? The only evidence to determine this intention is the will itself. The paper “ C. H. S.,” found long after the pro-bale of the will, in his box with his securities, part of which is in the handwriting of the testator, if it throws anj'1 light upon the question, is rather confirmatory of his intention that he had canceled these bequests......The only inference to be drawn from it is, that he was counting up his estate and that he had already canceled these bequests, or might have done so about this date. In either event there is nothing to show that the testator did not consider the will, as now found, as not his final disposition of his estate.</p>

In 4 Kent’s Com., 531, if the will be found canceled, the law infers an intentional revocation, for it is prima facie evidence of it and the inference stands good until it is rebutted. “ A paper purporting to be testamentary being found with the signature obliterated, the presumption is it was obliterated by the testator; without evidence, the legal inference is that the testator did it himself: ” Baptist Church v. Robbarts, supra. Cancellation of a will means any act done to it which in common understanding is regarded as cancellation when done to any other instrument. It must be an act done to the will itself, animo cancellandi: Evans’s Appeal, supra.

All the legatees named in the will bear this relation to the testator. Had he never written the names crossed out, the residue would still be distributable to the relations named, so that the description is equally applicable to the remaining legatees ; and, having made the bequests void by canceling them, it has the same effect as though they never had been named. It is therefore concluded that they are not entitled to participate in the distribution of the residue. To do so would in effect recognize them as legatees “ mentioned in the will.”</p>

The care exercised originally in the preparation of the will; the careless manner in which the pencil lines were drawn, some words in the legacy escaping the pencil entirely; the cutting of the paper in drawing the pencil line, and placing the instrument in a drawer with other worthless matter, while his valuable papers were carefully kept in a box at bank, are all facts indicating to my mind that the testator’s acts were deliberative only. He intended to use this penciled, cast-off paper to aid him in having a new will drawn, as soon as his mind should be fully made up and prepared to execute such new will.</p>

In England it is held that lead-pencil erasures may be deliberative or they may be final, the question being one of fact, to be determined from the character of the erasures or alterations or from the surrounding facts and circumstances. In none of the cases cited by the court below, and in none that I have found, has the -rule been laid down that they are prima facie deliberative only. The opinion of the court below reversing the auditor is based upon a single sentence of the report, to the effect that there is no evidence outside of the will itself to explain the marks and lines, and this sentence is taken as if it stood alone. It should be considered in connection with the <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>remainder of the report, which contains the finding of a number of facts, and a further finding “ based upon a full consideration of the facts and the law,” that the testator intended to and did cancel these bequests.

It may very well be that the cancellations were made before the subscribing witnesses were called in, as the date of the paper found in the bank is very uncertain. The year may be deciphered as 1883, just as well as 1887, though the auditor has found it to be 1887. But, however that may be, it is clear that the testator first marked off from that paper the bequests he intended to cancel, and, guided by it, made the crosses on the word “ Item ” at the proper places in the will, and then, guided by these crosses, struck out the bequests. Doubtless his mind was vacillating at the time ho was making the paper which he left in the bank, for at one moment he evidently intended to revoke the legacy to John Keller and went so far as partially to strike it from the list, but then changed his mind. Tie left that legacy unchanged in the will. There is no evidence of vacillation upon the face of the will. Had his marks there been deliberative only, he would have done no more than make the crosses on the margin.</p>

Although they were of no account to the executors, having no money value to the estate, they were regarded by the testator as valuable to him, as is evidenced by the jealous care with which he guarded them and the will, which he concealed beneath them. The Wills Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249, is silent both as to the instrument or material with which a will may be written, and as to that with which the “ canceling or obliterating,” which it allows as a mode of revocation, may be done. A will written with a lead pencil is valid: Myers v. Vanderbelt, <a href="/pa/84/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="84 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="1053554" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0510-01">84 Pa. 510</a>.

The careful manner in which the will was originally prepared, and the careless manner of the cancellations ; the fact that the will was found in a drawer among papers of no account, indicating it was thrown aside among old papers in contemplation of making another one; the failure to make any change in the footings on the paper found in the bank; the crossing over the word “ Item” which was the equivalent of the word “ query ” as written in the case of Goods of Hall, supra; and the delivery not of a single key, but of two or three, are all evidence, under the authorities cited, of the absence of an intention that the pencil lines on the will should not be treated as final. The auditor does not appear to have considered these circumstances. He based his finding entirely on the assumption that the distinction between ink and pencil writing was abolished by Myers v.

Vanderbelt, <a href="/pa/84/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="84 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="1053554" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0510-01">84 Pa. 510</a>, make it very clear that we intended to decide, and did decide, that the writing of a will in pencil is the full equivalent for a writing in ink. Mr. Justice Mercur, in the course of the opinion, said: “ So we think the authorities establish that a valid will may be drawn with the same materials that will suffice for the drawing of any written contract. As was well said by Mr. Justice Coulter in Hill v. Scott, <a href="/pa/12/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="12 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="963797" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0168-01">supra</a> (<a href="/citations/?q=12%20Pa.%20169" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="12 Pa. 169">12 Pa. 169</a>), they abundantly prove that a writing in pencil is equivalent and tantamount to a writing in ink.” We there held that a will, the whole of which was written in lead pencil, was in compliance with the requirement of the Wills Act of April 8, 1833, that “ every will shall bo in writing.” We are entirely satisfied with that decision, and have no disposition to change or modify it. The learned court below thought that, because the cancellation-<a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>was in pencil, while the will itself was in ink, the cancellation was deliberative only, and not final, and he therefore overruled the auditor, who held it to be final. In doing this the court followed a few English decisions, which, while agreeing that wills written in pencil are valid, yet hold that where alterations were made in pencil they would be regarded, if the will was in ink, as deliberative only. It would not be difficult, upon a review of those cases, to show that in most, if not' all of them, the decision was based as well upon other facts and circumstances as upon the fact of the alterations being in pencil, but we do not think it necessary to engage in such a review. We regard our ruling in Myers v. Vanderbelt as obliterating the distinction between writings in ink and pencil, and assigning precisely the same legal effect to the instrument in either case. If there be no distinction between these methods of writing, so far as their legal effect is concerned, we can see no reason for assigning an effect to a pencil alteration different from that which we would assign to an alteration in ink. If we do that, we say they are not the same, whereas we have deliberately decided they are the same, not'only in relation to wills, but to other solemn instruments, as was shown in the opinion in Myers v. Vanderbelt. We do not care to repeat the reasoning and authorities of that opinion, because we deem it entirely unnecessary. It would certainly be inconsistent to hold that in alterations of wills pencil writing and ink writing have not the same effect, when in all other cases we say they have. As indicative of the testator’s intent, the pencil alterations speak quite as certainly as if they were in ink. The will was found after the testator’s death, locked up in a drawer in his own room. He chose to leave it in the exact condition in which it was found. As it was found, it clearly canceled certain of the legacies. By what authority can we say that they were not canceled, when in point of fact they were ? How can we say it was not the intention of the testator to make these cancellations, when in reality he has made them ? Do they not signify the same intent being in pencil that they would have signified being in ink ? We have no right to say they do not, and, that being so, they prevail alike, whether in ink or pencil.</p>

If it was found in a place of sufficiently careful custody to sustain it as a will, that custody was equally sufficient to sustain the alterations. Moreover, if sustained at all, it must be only in the condition in which it is found. But the argument upon this ground has no merit. The will was found locked up in a drawer in a bureau, standing in the testator’s room in which he lay sick and died. The keys, one of which unlocked the drawer, were delivered by the testator shortly before his death to Miss Cressman, a relative and his nurse, with direction to hand them to Mr. Dutton, one of the executors, as soon as lie was dead. To hold that such a custody was a careless custody, sufficient to raise even a doubt about the intention of the testator in regard to its contents, is simply impossible.</p>
    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[164,1147,1174,965]]]'>Another circumstance, to which the court attached consequence, was that a paper was found in the testator’s box at bank which contained a list of the legatees as they were named in the will, and with all of the legacies canceled in pencil that were so canceled in the will, except one, John Keller, whose name was canceled, but not the amount, $500. The court thought this was proof that the testator was still vacillating, (in 1883 or 1887,) because John Keller’s name and legacy were not canceled in the will, and therefore that all the cancellations should be regarded as deliberative only. We cannot consider this circumstance as having such a meaning. To us it is indicative rather that the paper found in the bank was probably his first or deliberative memorandum, which he made final when he made the cancellations in the will, and there he concluded to let Keller’s legacy remain. We find no other facts in the ease indicating that the testator did not intend to do that which in fact he did do, and hence we are of opinion that the view of the whole subject taken by the learned auditor was the correct view, and that it was error to overrule his report.</p>
