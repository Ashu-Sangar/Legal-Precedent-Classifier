This was contended for, on the principle, well settled in this state, that <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>when the legacy is not of a gross sum, but of an income or interest, for his support, then the legatee is allowed it from the death of the testator. The auditor has shown why, under the terms of the will, this could not have been the intention of the testator in the present instance; first, because the executors were to pay the bequests over to the trustee at their convenience ; and second, because it was to be paid without interest. To these reasons might be added a third, that the cestuis que trust were only interested in the income as it might come through the trustee. It was the trustee who was required to receive the money from the executors and invest it, and pay over the income from it, in half-yearly instalments to the cestuis que trust. The fact that the money was to be paid over to the trustee, to be by him invested and the income arising from this investment to be paid to the legatees, refutes the idea that the principal sum was to carry interest from the time of the death of the testator. The testator must have had in his mind that some time must necessarily elapse between his death and the payment of the moneys to the trustee and their investment, and when he therefore directed that the income should be paid out of the investments made by the trustee, it shows clearly in connection with the other reasons given, that it was not intended that these bequests should bear interest from the death of the testator.</p>

The bequests made in trust for the appellants and the widow were not of a gross sum, but of annual income only, to be paid in half-yearly instalments.

A most important fact, evidently lost sight of by the auditor and court below, is that the testator left a large personal estate, over and above the amountsof all his debts and funeral expenses, consisting of mortgages and corporate stocks and bonds. These were valuable investments such as the will contemplated, and they remained intact until the day of payment to the trustee. They were more than sufficient to pay all bequests and the widow’s portion. In such circumstances, the appellants, and not the residuary legatees, are morally and legally entitled to the income claimed in this proceeding: Hewitt v. Russell, 1 Turn. &amp; R. 241; Hilyard’s Est., <a href="/watts-serg/5/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 30" data-case-ids="478866" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0030-01">5 W. &amp; S. 30</a>; Landis v.

The facts of the present case are identical with those of Bird’s Estate, and strikingly similar to those of Townsend’s Appeal.

To all this weight of legal authority the residuary legatees oppose three positions : First, they say that, as their father evidently intended to put their mother and the appellants on a worse footing than themselves as to the principal, it follows that he intended to do the same as to the interest. But the fair eon elusion is just the contrary. In the second place, they say <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>they are not trustees for the appellants, who are entitled to interest only as it might come through the trustee, and that the legacies are expressly payable at the convenience of the executors. .The fallacy of these propositions is fully shown by Pennsylvania Co.’s App. in Brown’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=41%20Leg.%20Int.%2026" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="41 Leg. Int. 26">41 Leg.

If the provision for payment at the convenience of the executors were construed as leaving the time of payment to their pleasure, without any benefit to the appellants from the income till payment is made, they can defeat the will entirely by not paying at all. We claim that it means that the bequests shall be paid when the executors come into the possession of sufficient assets, and thejr did so immediately after the testator’s death. If, however, it is construed as referring to the statutory period, then the appellants are entitled to the income which.accrued thereafter. Lastly, it is said that the legacies are expressly payable without interest. But the income is not interest as to the appellants; it is principal as to them: Addams v. Heffernan, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.%20543" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="9 W. 543">9 W. 543</a>. The construction contended for by the residuary legatees is at variance with the whole tenor of the will.</p>

The facts that are before the court show that the delay in payment is attributable to the litigiousness of the appellants, and that would have the effect of suspending interest, even if it had already commenced to run: Vandergrift’s App., <a href="/pa/80/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="80 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1042369" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0118-01">80 Pa. 118</a>. But the intention that these legacies should not bear interest clearly appears in the will of the testator. It differs from the wills involved in all the cases cited by the appellants. In all of them the same persons were both executors and trustees for investment; and if that were the ease here, the trustee might be regarded as having possession of the fund for investment from the date of the testator’s death. But in this case the executors were trustees for collection and distribution simply. In various other respects the present case differs from those cited on the other side and none of them are applicable to it.</p>

It is conceded that when the interest of a sum of money is directed to be paid by an executor to a legatee annually, the interest runs from the death of the testator, because the <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>bequest is in tbe nature of an annuity and is to be paid, not out of the income of the principal, but out of the corpus of the estate: Swett v.

In the present case, the testator’s intention was that the legatees should not receive interest until they received it by and through their trustee. When no other time is designated in the will, the legacies are payable at the end of a year: Koon’s App., <a href="/pa/113/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="113 Pa. 621" data-case-ids="457572" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0621-01">113 Pa. 621</a>. It is said the testator intended interest should be paid, because he made no provision for the widow’s maintenance during the year. But she is not here complaining, and, moreover, a widow is not upon the same footing, as to maintenance, as a minor child: Gill’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pa.%20222" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 Pa. 222">2 Pa. 222</a>.</p>

Phillips, and A. Lincoln Phillips, and their heirs, forever, and appointed them the executors of his will. On April 5, 1887, the widow notified the execdtors of her refusal to accept the provision made for her in the will of her husband, and of her election to take under the intestate laws of the commonwealth. On April 16, 1887, the executors filed an inventory and appraisement of the personal estate, amounting to $247,215.20. The real estate of the testator was of the estimated value of $100,000 to $120,000.</p>
    <p id="b456-6" data-blocks='[["BL_456.4",456,[282,918,1178,708]]]'>The appellants’ contention is that they are entitled to have interest upon the bequests made for their benefit, from the date of the testator’s decease until the date of payment thereof to the trustee. Whether this is so or not, depends upon the intention of the testator, to be gathered from the body of the will under the ordinary rules of construction applicable in such cases. The fifty-first section of the act of February 24, 1834, provides that “ legacies, if no time be limited for the payment thereof, shall in all cases be deemed to be due and payable at the expiration of one year from the death of the testator.” This section was declaratory merely of the law as it had previously existed: Wood v. Penoyre, 13 Ves. 326; Huston’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.%20477" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="9 W. 477">9 W. 477</a>; it supplies a testamentary intent, where none is expressed in the will: Koon’s App., <a href="/pa/113/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="113 Pa. 621" data-case-ids="457572" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0621-01">113 Pa. 621</a>.</p>

    <p id="b457-5" data-blocks='[["BL_457.4",457,[152,616,1168,1323]]]'>It is only when the testator’s intention has not been expressed in the will that the artificial rules already referred to are resorted to, to supply that intention. In this instance, however, the testator has in very plain words expressed his intention that these bequests were to be paid to the trustee, at the convenience of his executors, without interest, and that the income thereof was payable by the trustee to the beneficiaries, and not by the executors. The executors, of course, had no absolute, arbitrary discretion in the matter; they were bound to pay whenever, according to their judgment, exercised in a reasonable manner, it was safe and suitable for them to do so, and when payment could not reasonably be supposed to involve them in any danger or difficulty. To this extent, he confided in his executors and invested them with the exercise of a discretion, for their own protection as well as for the interest of those beneficially interested in the estate. After the testator’s death, the widow elected to reject the provisions made for her in the will, and to take under the intestate law. It seems, also, that the appellants, or some of them, for a considerable time after the granting of the letters, were making an effort to induce the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives, etc., the trustee, to relinquish the trust, and desired the executors to pay the legacies over to them directly, and that these negotiations, and the dissatisfaction of the appellants witli the trustee, “ were the chief causes of the delay in the liquidation of the bequests to the trust company.”</p>
    <p id="b457-6" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[154,1949,1167,350]]]'>In fixing a convenient time for payment of these bequests, the executors do not appear to have exercised their discretion in any arbitrary way, much less to have acted in any bad faith; the delay being mainly attributable, as the auditor finds, to the acts of the appellants themselves. In view of all the circumstances, therefore, we are of the opinion that the auditor and the court were right in refusing to allow the interest.</p>
