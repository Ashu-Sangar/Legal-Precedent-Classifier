It is admitted that, at the time of the assignment, Amandus owed debts to the amount of $300, and that the value of his entire property at that time, outside of his interest in his father’s estate, did not exceed that amount. It is also admitted that his interest in his father’s estate, which he assigned, was worth $1,330.50. When we consider that by claiming the exemption he could remove all his unassigned property beyond the reach of his creditors, it goes without saying that the assignment was more than a reasonable provision for his wife, and being such, citation of authorities would be superfluous to show that it was fraudulent and void in law as to then existing creditors.

But we think it immaterial whether he was or not. The judgment, stipulated for in the case stated, is not made to turn upon that question, but turns upon the question o.f the validity of the assignment, and as to that we have reached a decision without the help of Cornelius’s claim.</p>

Again; those other debts were neither of the right kind nor of sufficient amount- to cast the burden of proof on the plaintiff. The court was in error in saying that those debts amounted to $300. What was admitted in the case stated was that there were a few small debts, which the $300 worth of property was more than sufficient to pay; and it is fair to presume they were paid out of it, in view of the lapse of time and the fact that not one of those creditors have come forward.

There is another reason why the estate of Cornelius should not be permitted to take this money. By so doing, it would enjoy the fruit of his own wrong. The money it claims was in the hands of Cornelius himself as a trustee for Amandus, from December 24, 1866, to October 9, 1878, and all that <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>time he concealed from Amandus the fact that any such money was due him. Having rendered a false account in 1866, he thereby induced Amandus to give him a mortgage for a greater amount than it would have been given for, had Amandus known that Cornelius owed him a balance of $1,880.50. His conduct thus contains all the elements of an estoppel, as laid down in Bigelow on Estoppel, 484. Cornelius evidently was satisfied with the mortgage as security, and his waiting to sue on the mortgage bond until Amandus commenced proceedings to have a new accounting, shows that he regarded the foreclosure of the mortgage as a satisfaction of the debt. In view of the divestiture of his wife’s right of dower by the foreclosure sale, the act of Amandus in making this assignment was but a fair and just provision for her, which Cornelius ought not to be permitted to defeat. But, independent of the wrongful conduct of Cornelius, the existence of this mortgage debt is of no importance as to the validity of the assignment, because Cornelius had in the mortgage all the security he bargained for: May on Fraudulent Conveyances, 58. A fortiori, is this so in view of the value of the property. When there is no evidence of intention to defraud creditors, the fact that the property conveyed is all that the husband owned, is immaterial: Nippes’s App., <a href="/pa/75/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="75 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1036797" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0472-01">75 Pa. 472</a> ; Williams v.

The matters upon which the plaintiff contends for an equitable estoppel are irrelevant, and the question whether Cornelius was an unfaithful trustee is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court. The assignment made by Amandus to his wife was fraudulent. While the law recognizes the wife as a proper person for the husband’s bounty, it requires that a gift to her be confined to a proper proportion of his whole fortune, and that he retain sufficient to satisfy his creditors. Whether, even then, a gift to the wife of the entire remainder of his property would be valid in all cases, is doubtful.</p>

The contention that the purchase by Cornelius at judicial sale not only discharged the lien of his mortgage but also extinguished the debt, is unsound'. There is no method of making a valuation of land so purchased and crediting that valuation on the debt,'and the creditor may proceed upon the bond to recover the portion of the debt left unpaid by the sale. But if it were so that in equity, and in New Jersey, the value of the property can thus be credited, this would be a matter of defence to be set up in the suit on the bond, and the debtor, if he omit to make such defence in that suit, cannot after judgment has gone against him, set it up in a collateral proceeding.</p>

They were substantially, but not exactly, the words prescribed by act of assembly, but neither the debt nor the bond are mentioned: ‘ I, Andrew Fleming, do hereby acknowledge to have received satisfaction in full of this mortgage.’ These words, signed and sealed by the mortgagee, were all-sufficient to put the mortgage out of existence, and sufficient, too, to satisfy the debt, if so intended. Prima facie, they would, indeed, import 'extinguishment of the debt as well as <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>the mortgage, and the burden of showing they were not so intended was on the creditor.”</p>

And, again: “A ease stated, when well drawn, is like an issue developed by special pleading, and presents in a single point, or in a series of points, the very matter that is up for judgment. The court cannot go beyond the issue that is thus brought upon the record, however manifest the justice that might be reached by going further. The duty of the court is to decide the case that is stated, and to presume that what is not included was kept out for sufficient reason: ” Phil. etc. R. Co. v. Waterman, <a href="/pa/54/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="54 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1006280" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0337-01">54 Pa. 337</a>. In Diehl v.

Mr. Justice Sergeant said, in delivering the opinion: “ Where, according' to the rule of law, the jury are bound to make that presumption, it still remains an inference of fact. The circumstance that the jury are bound to make it does not render it matter of law, so that the court can draw the presumption. From evidence of any fact which in law is <em>deemed </em>conclusive, the jury-are bound to infer the fact, and the court would so instruct them, and would grant a new trial if they refused. That would not authorize the court, in a common-law suit, to usurp the province of the jury, and adjudge, on a special verdict or demurrer, that the statement of the evidence proving a fact was equivalent to stating the fact thus proved.”</p>

The fund was claimed by the wife of Amandus Seiple, the use plaintiff in the present proceeding, by virtue of a voluntary assignment made to her by her husband, on January 14, 1878, of his interest in his father’s estate; and, on the other hand, it was claimed by the administrators of Cornelius Seiple, a brother of Amandus, who had recovered a judgment for <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>$3,718.92 on March 25, 1878, against Amandus, on a bond for $2,497.96 given for owelty of partition by Amandus to Cornelius, and secured by a mortgage on certain real estate taken by Amandus in the partition of their father’s real estate. The case stated declares that this mortgage was satisfied in 1886 or 1887 by the administrators of Cornelius, at the request of the purchaser of the real estate of Cornelius, which was originally taken in partition by Amandus and upon which the mortgage was a lien, but which had subsequently been bought by Cornelius upon foreclosure proceedings. The administrators of Cornelius claimed the fund by virtue of an attachment in execution issued on the judgment against Amandus on March 27, 1878. These administrators claimed that the assignment by Amandus to his wife, although made prior both to the judgment and attachment, was fraudulent and void against Cornelius, as being without consideration and intended to hinder, delay, and defraud creditors. The case stated simply sets forth the facts, but entirely omits to state that there was any intent to defraud creditors. The learned court below held that they could not infer such intent as against subsequent creditors, but that such an inference was not essential to defeat the assignment as against persons who were creditors of Amandus prior to and at the time of the assignment, and accordingly entered judgment for the administrators of Cornelius, who were defendants in the case stated, on the ground that Cornelius was a prior creditor.</p>

The legal presumption is that the satisfaction of the mortgage works an extinguishment of the debt, and the burden of removing that presumption is thrown upon the creditor: Fleming v. Parry, supra. This is a presumption of law which necessarily flows from the fact of satisfaction set forth in the case stated, and, unless facts are averred in the case stated which rebut the presumption of extinguishment of the debt, the court cannot infer them. Now, upon an inspection of the case stated, we are unable to find any such facts. It is not averred that the debt was not, in point of fact, paid, nor that it was the intention of <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>tlie parties that the debt should remain, although the mortgage was satisfied. It is alleged that the mortgage was satisfied at the request of the purchaser of the land, but, as such a request would be entirely consistent with the fact of actual payment, we can make no inference of non-payment on that account. It is not even alleged in the case stated that the administrators of Cornelius still hold the bond of Amandus, or that Cornelius held it at the time of his death; but it is alleged that no further proceedings were ever had on the attachment after the service of the writ, which took place in 1878, eight or nine years before the mortgage was satisfied. In order to sustain the attachment and its claim upon the present fund, we would be obliged to infer, without any averment to that effect in the case stated, that the debt still exists, notwithstanding the entry of satisfaction on the mortgage given to secure that same debt. Had the judgment been obtained after the entry of satisfaction was made, it might have rebutted the presumption of payment growing out of the satisfaction; but the facts are precisely-the other way, and the satisfaction, occurring long after the judgment, presumably extinguishes it, as well as the mortgage. We are not at liberty to make an inference of non-payment to defeat the effect of the satisfaction, and must therefore render judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
