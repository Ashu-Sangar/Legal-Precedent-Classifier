The chief contention of the accountant’s attorneys is, that there should not be a surcharge of the $750, the balance of the principal of the note, because in the first clause of the will it is bequeathed to the widow, falling within the denomination of “all and whatever is remaining of my property of whatever kind and nature the same may be,” and, as there is no gift over of it, for the <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>reason that whatever is disposed of in the residuary clause, is only such personal property as is usually the subject of sale.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[285,453,1171,236]]]'>That a bequest for life, without a gift over, is absolute in the first taker, is so well settled as to require no citations of adjudicated cases.

    <p class="summary" id="b518-7" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[283,708,1174,1321]]]'>The two clauses for consideration are as follows: (after payment of funeral expenses and debts) “ I give and bequeath to my wife Abigail all and whatever is remaining of my property of whatever kind and nature the same may be ..... to have, hold, use, possess, and enjoy the same during her lifetime.” After the death of his wife, “all the remaining property of whatever kind shall be sold and divided amongst my five children in equal shares.” The former clause, as regards the realty, creates, as distinctly as language can .do, an estate for life, and presumably, if not explicitly, a life-estate only as regards the personalty. It is presumably a life-estate, at least, as to personalty; because, where the realty and personalty are blended in one gift, they will both take the same direction, the personalty following the real estate, unless some clearly expressed intention gives it a different direction: Morrison v. Semple, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Binn.%2098" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Binn. 98">6 Binn. 98</a>.

The former clause, after the payment of funeral expenses and the debts, clearly gives to the widow for life all the remaining property of whatever kind, including the realty and personalty of every description, by-reason of the generality of the expression sufficiently comprehensive to include the note, and the latter or residuary clause is equally as comprehensive.</p>

The rule which militates against this construction of the former of these clauses is, that, where there is a conflict, the latter clause prevails ; and it would seem to follow, if the nqte does not pass <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>by the latter and is excluded from it, the former clause must be so construed as to exclude it also, and in that event an intestacy results in relation to the note......</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b519-6" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[161,915,1169,1415]]]'>The rulings made in these last four citations seem to have been made to give effect to what has been declared to be the intent of the testator. Looking again at the last two clauses of Jacob Gold’s will, it will be observed that by the first clause, after the payment of funeral expenses and debts, whatever is remaining of testator’s property, of every kind and nature it may be, is bequeathed to his wife during her lifetime, and by the latter clause, “all the remaining property of whatever kind shall be sold and divided amongst my five children share and share alike.” These clauses are descriptive of the same species of property. If the one contains real and personal property, including in the personalty household goods, farm implements, live stock, debts due and a promissory note, the other contains the like species of personal effects. The expression in the former clause, “ whatever is remaining of my property of whatever kind and nature,” and the expression in the latter clause “ all the remaining property whatever ” are the equivalents of each other. In the former, it is given to the widow for life, to have, hold, use, possess and enjoy; and by the latter, it is to be sold and the proceeds divided amongst the five children. If the expressions “ whatsoever is remaining of my property of whatever kind and nature ” and “ all the remaining property whatever,” are equivalents, and descriptive of the same real and personal property, then the whole quantity of the estate given to the widow for life, less the consumption of that which is consumable by use, is a bequest over and must be accounted for as part of the residuary estate to be distributed after her death.</p>

German and its congeners, it would seem to follow that an intestacy occurs as to the Messinger note. But, looking, however, to other modes of interpretation, and regarding the doctrine that no presumption can be made in favor of intestacy, that in a blending of the realty and personalty both take the same direction, the personalty following the realty, and, considering the circumstances of the testator, the quantum and value of his estate, the amount necessary for the comfortable support of his widow, and the general intent ■ manifested and as gathered from the four corners of the will, all seem to lead to the conclusion that the primary object of testator’s bounty is his wife, and the clear intent as expressed is a bequest of the whole estate to her for life. To declare an intestacy as to the note would seem to be a perversion of the manifest intent, and to hold that the widow takes absolutely the note would be a plain disregard of the law as declared in Board of Missions’ App., <a href="/citations/?q=91%20Pa.%20510" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="91 Pa. 510">91 Pa. 510</a>.

These words, “ to have, hold, use, possess and enjoy,” in so far as they authorize the consumption of personalty, are not limited to such articles as pork, flour etc., but extend to every possible mode of having, holding, using, possessing and enjoying the bequest which the words signify.

Each was decided upon the ground that the bequest was residuary, and that the testator expressed an intention not to die intestate. In our case, there is no residuary bequest in the proper acceptation of the term. Construing together the two clauses to which we have referred, we submit that the testator deliberately limited the property which his children were to have the benefit of after the widow’s death, to such as was the subject of sale, so as to express his intention that the note should be excluded. There is no question of intestacy in this casé. And even though the widow was given a life-estate merely in the note, as there is no bequest of it over, the note vested in her absolutely by construction and operation of law. Nor does the blending of realty and personalty in the bequest for life interfere with this view, as the intent of the testator must be gathered from the whole will. Under the decisions at the time of the testator’s death, the executor’s counsel was justified in advising him that the widow owned the note. A surcharge of it now would be a great injustice.</p>

He contends that the note was bequeathed to the widow. If so, it <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>passed, to her personal representatives on her death, for the benefit of her creditors. The accountant is attempting, therefore, to set off claims that are not mutual, nor due in the same right. Even in the lifetime of the widow he could not do this, as against another of her creditors: Lorenz v. King, <a href="/pa/38/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="38 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="994047" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0093-01">38 Pa. 93</a>. Much less can he do so after her death, when the rights of all parties have become fixed and vested.</p>
    <p id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[190,715,1169,557]]]'>2. The bequest to the widow, standing alone, cannot be considered as anything else than a life-estate. The argument that she might consume the personal property, and if so, she could sell it, and if she could sell it, she owned it, is a species of reasoning that would destroy all life-estates in personal property. The rule that there can be no life-estate in things consumable by nature, such as a bag of flour, does not extend to choses in action, such as notes and money. Moreover, there is a bequest of the note over to the children. The words “ remaining property” embrace the same things here that they do in the bequest to the widow.</p>
    <p id="b523-6" data-blocks='[["BL_523.5",523,[191,1275,1167,459]]]'>3. *The proposition that the word, “ sold,” cannot apply to a note, is not supported by any decision of this court. The very question was decided the other way in Board of Missions’ App., <a href="/pa/91/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="91 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="487903" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0507-01">91 Pa. 507</a>. The eases cited by the appellant do not sustain his contention; and when it is remembered that the meaning of the testator is to be gathered from the whole will, it will be found that they are all in harmony with Board of Missions’ App., supra. McGlaughlin v. McGlaughlin, <a href="/pa/24/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="24 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="9502957" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0020-01">24 Pa. 20</a>, is so clearly against the appellant, that it is a wonder he cited it.</p>

    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[274,707,1173,969]]]'>It is clear that the testator’s wife was the first object of his bounty, and that he intended she should use so much of his personal property as might be necessary to her support during her lifetime. The language of the will is very emphatic. She is to “have, hold, use, possess, and enjoy the same during her lifetime,” and it is only the remainder, that is, what is left thereof, that is to be sold- and distributed among his children after his wife’s death. There can be no possible doubt as to this construction, so far as'regards the perishable property, such as household goods, farming implements, stock, and produce of the farm. Nor do we think there can be any doubt as to the two notes. They were intended for her support, if needed; what was left was to go to the children. We therefore think it was error to refuse to allow the accountant credit for the amount of the disbursements made by him to the widow, in discharge of the note held by the testator against the accountant. This view is not in conflict with Hofius v. Hofius, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20Pa.%20308" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="92 Pa. 308">92 Pa. 308</a>.
