The plaintiff, being dissatisfied with said report, on the 27th day of the same month, filed a paper in said court, of which the following is a copy: “John A.

The act'of assembly regulating the latter class of appeals, as is well known, provides that to be effectual such appeals must be entered within twenty days from the date of judgment. In Carothers v. Cummings, <a href="/pa/63/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="63 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="1018968" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0199-01">63 Pa. 199</a>, the appeal was taken more than twenty days after the day on which judgment was entered by the justice, and the Supreme Court said, “if the appellee had done anything in the case after the entry of the appeal, towards getting it ready for trial, we have no doubt this would have waived the laches in taking the appeal: ” citing Sleek v.

The same principle has been applied to appeals from the awards of arbitrators. In Clarke v.

The street is 60 feet in width, and it extends of that width for a distance of between five and six hundred feet through <em>the </em>property of <em>John </em>A. Geissinger', the plaintiff. The present proceeding has been instituted »by Mr. Geissinger for the purpose of recovering damages for the injury which he alleges he has sustained by reason of the opening of this street through his land.</p>

In opening the street, the borough filled in the street with cinder, at some places creating an embankment as high as two feet. The plaintiff claims that this has caused an injury to him; he says that before the street was opened, and before this filling was done-, he could farm this whole piece of ground as one piece, but that now, on account of the opening of the street and the creating of the embankment, it is necessary for him to farm it in two pieces. He also alleges that this embankment prevents the irrigation of the land, or of that portion of it which lies between Front street and the railroad. He says that this is an injury to him. [He also says that now he will be compelled to fence his land on both sides of Front street in order to enable Mm to farm it properly and conveniently, and he claims that this is another element of damage for which he claims compensation. He also contends that in the future he may be required to lay a pavement on both sides of Front street which would cost a very considerable amount of money, first, for the <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>filling in of the side of the street in order to make a place for the pavement so that it would be at grade, and then for the laying of the pavement itself. I say to you, that all these matters are matters that are proper for you to take into consideration in deciding the question as to whether the opening of this street has been an injury to the plaintiff’s property.] 3</p>

The defendant claims that as soon as the street was opened the land adjoining this street on both sides, at least upon one side, became immediately valuable for building purposes, and that, as a property adapted for building purposes, it was of much greater value to the plaintiff for that purpose than it was before, merely for farming purposes. If that is true, the Supreme Court have decided that that is a matter that you have a right to take into consideration, and it is your duty to do so in determining the question whether or not the plaintiff has suffered any damage by reason of the opening of the street. In fact, the act of assembly requires that the viewers, and you are the viewers within the meaning of the act, are to take into consideration not only the disadvantages that a claimant may suffer, but you are also to take into consideration the advantages derived; and if you find that the advantages exceed the disadvantages, then the party who comes into court claiming damages has no case and your verdict would be against him.</p>
