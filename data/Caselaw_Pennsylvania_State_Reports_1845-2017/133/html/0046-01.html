This was followed by testimony tending to show, inter alia, that Miller was in possession of the land in 1830, the lines being well located and known; that Miller had about an acre and a half cleared and fenced, a house erected within the clearing, with a dozen or so of fine apple trees growing in 1835, and that he grew corn and buckwheat on the land; that in 1841, Miller traded farms with John Hand, Sr., who went into possession; that John Hand, Sr., died about 1846, and about 1847 or 1848 the fence around the clearing was burned; that John Hand, Jr., purchased the land at the partition sale of John Hand, Sr.’s estate, went into possession, repaired the fences, took timber from the land, harvested apples and cultivated buckwheat thereon; that in 1854, <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>John Dietrich bought the land of John Hand, Jr., again repaired the fences, harvested apples, cultivated buckwheat, and cut and hauled timber from the tract; that in 1864, Thompson, the plaintiff, bought the land from Dietrich, at which time the clearing was still fenced, used timber for his fences, and at times sold timber to the defendant company; that sometime between 1864 and 1872, the fences, being neglected by Thompson, who was a miner, were again burned away; that in August, 1885, the employees of the defendant company took possession of the tract and began cutting timber, when the writ in this case issued, followed by a writ of estrepement.</p>

When a party claims title to land by virtue of the statute of limitations, it is necessary for him to prove a possession actual, continued, visible, notorious, distinct and hostile for twenty-one years, to entitle him to recover the land in an ejectment against one having the legal title. Although the plaintiff in this case has proved that for one or two years at a time, at distant and unconnected periods, he, or those under whom he claims, had such adverse and notorious possession of the land in dispute in this case, yet he has failed to prove such possession as the law requires to enable him to recover, during a continued, consecutive and connected period of twenty-one years.</p>
