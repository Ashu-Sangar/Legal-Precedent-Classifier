The side door of the hotel leading into it was there, and, therefore, when he built he walled in the tenant’s yard from the area and alley of the hotel, keeping out of the tenant’s yard the guests who might-pass through the side entrance to enter the hotel, and securing privacy for the tenants, the principal use of the alley for the hotel, with its many comers and goers, its way by privilege for the few of the private families upon the adjoining lots.

    <p id="b338-10" data-blocks='[["BL_338.8",338,[234,706,1178,755]]]'>1. The theory upon which the court below decided the case was that because the clause upon which it was ruled followed the devise to Mary Hartman and reserved to Daniel the right to the use of the alley, therefore there was an implication that the fee-simple title to the alley was to pass to Mary. Such a construction cannot be correct, because it makes an implication overrule a ‘previous express grant, and because it does violence to the circumstances and conditions then existing, and is unreasonable. Under the facts found by the court, the alley and area were a natural part of the plaintiff’s property, as it existed at the time of the making of Frederick Maurer’s will, were not a natural part of the defendant’s property, and the will having devised the former property to Daniel in express terms, a mere implication cannot take the alley out of that devise: Inchequin v. French, Ambler 33.</p>
    <p id="b338-11" data-blocks='[["BL_338.9",338,[231,1473,1175,808]]]'>2. The reservation was manifestly an error. Daniel, in whose favor it was made, did not need it, while Mary did need it. This leads to the conclusion that it was intended for her; and that by mistake of the scrivener the clause was added to the devise in favor of Mary, instead of to the devise in Daniel’s favor, and the wrong name was used in it, or else the word “ from ” was intended to be used instead of “ for,” making it a reservation from Daniel’s devise, instead of one for him. So changed, the reservation becomes sensible; otherwise the most absurd and inconvenient results follow, such as that Mary and her successors in the title may prohibit the enlargement or rebuilding of Daniel’s house, and may overlap it by building the second story of their house over the uncovered part of the alley called the area. Upon the defendant’s construction, the reservation takes from Mary something which had not been granted to her, and gives to Daniel something he already had.</p>

      <em>Mr. Henry A. </em>Muhlenberg, for the appellees :</p>
    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.3",339,[133,346,1166,606]]]'>
      <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>1. The first and main principle in the construction of a will is that the meaning of the testator is to be gathered from its four corners. If it can be ascertained from the words of the testator alone, this must be done. What words can be clearer than those used by the maker of this will ? He knew that the second story of the house devised to Daniel extended over, and its cellar extended under the alley, and the language of the devise to Daniel, coupled with the reservation appended to the devise in favor of Mary Hartman, almost irresistibly leads to the conclusion that the will was intended to give to the son and his successors in title an easement over the alley, and to the daughter and her successors in title the fee to the alley.</p>
    <p id="b339-6" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[130,960,1169,758]]]'>2. The proposition that the alley and area were a natural part of the property devised to Daniel, is a mere matter of opinion. Even if it would be accurate, in ordinary circumstances, these circumstances are controlled and altered by the will in the present case. As the alley was not included in the express devise to Daniel, the position that an implication cannot overrule an express devise need not be considered. The argument that the reservation nrast have been made in favor of Daniel instead of Mary by mistake, and that the testator intended to say an entirely different thing from what his words so plainly set forth, violates the elementary principle of construction above mentioned, and involves the assumption of a double mistake,—the writing of the wrong name by the scrivener, and a failure by the testator to discover it during the ten years he had the will in his possession.</p>
    <p id="b339-7" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[129,1727,1168,652]],["BL_340.1",340,[279,349,1173,493]]]'>3. The alternative supposition of a substitution by mistake of the word “ for ” in place of “ from,” would make the reservation operate, using the word “ from ” to exclude the owners of Daniel’s two houses from the privilege of passing and re-passing along the alley; yet the uncontradicted evidence is that the alley has always been used jointly by the owners and occupants of all three houses. The will creates an easement in Daniel’s favor, as to the alley, by express grant; in such case, the only questions open for consideration concern the proper construction of the language of the grant: Meyer v. Young, 7 W. N. 60; Washburn on Easements, § 28. Nothing passes as an incident to an easement but what is requisite to its free enjoyment: 3 Kent’s Com., 420 ; Washburn on Easements, <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>§ 28, note-5, page 44. The rights of the parties are determined by the grant, not by their intentions or declarations or the use of the property: Meyer v. Young, 7 W. N. 60; Pickering v. Stapler, 5 S. &amp; R. 107; Kirkham v. Sharp, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Whart.%20332" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Whart. 332">1 Wh. 332</a>; Connery v.

It being found as a fact that the platform does not obstruct the exercise of the plaintiff’s easement, this action cannot be maintained: Connery v.

    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.6",340,[276,963,1173,400]]]'>This case involves incidentally the title to the soil of an alley way in the city of Reading. The alley is between the two properties of the plaintiff and the defendants, respectively. Both properties belonged at one time to Frederick Maurer, who remained the-owner thereof to the time of his death. Frederick Maurer died in 1828, and by his last will and testament devised to his son, Daniel Maurer, the property now owned by the plaintiff. The language of the devise was as follows :</p>
    <p id="b340-6" data-blocks='[["BL_340.7",340,[275,1371,1171,297]]]'>“ Also two houses adjoining each other, situate on the west side of Callowhill street, and the lot thereto belonging, in the tenure of John Potter and Joshua David, with the appurtenances, to have and to hold the said messuage or tenements, houses, tracts, lots, or pieces of land unto the said Daniel Maurer, his heirs and assigns, forever.”</p>
    <p id="b340-7" data-blocks='[["BL_340.8",340,[273,1676,1173,502]]]'>The learned judge below has found, and the fact is not disputed, that “ at and before the making of the will of Frederick Maurer, deceased, viz., in 1818, the second story of the northern one of the two houses devised to Daniel Maurer, and now belonging to the plaintiff, was built over the alley in question; and the cellar of the said northern house extended under the said alley to the foundation walls of the defendants’ house, the surface of the alley being supported over the said cellar by a series of arches, and the said house and cellar have, with reference to the said alley, continued the same to this time.”</p>
    <p id="b340-8" data-blocks='[["BL_340.9",340,[274,2188,1171,196]],["BL_341.1",341,[139,354,1170,965]]]'>We have thus the fact established beyond dispute that, at the time Frederick Maurer made his will, the alley Way was an integral part of the house devised to his son; the house was built both over and under the alley; it was there, visible to the eye, <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>and forming an actual portion of the house. It is therefore obvious that a devise of the house and its appurtenances passed, not only the right to use the alley, but the soil thereof. The learned judge below held, however, that the alley did not pass by the devise for the following reason: The adjoining property owned by the present defendants was devised by Frederick Maurer to his daughter, Mary Hartman, and in that devise he made the following exception or reservation in favor of the property before referred to as devised to Daniel Maurer: “ Excepting and forever reserving, for the use of the owners and occupiers of the said two houses devised to my son, the privilege of passing and re-passing the alley between the new and old house, at all times and seasons.” This exception, being admittedly inconsistent with the devise already referred to in favor of his son Daniel, led the court below to the conclusion that the testator intended to give Daniel and his heirs the use of said alley merely, and to his daughter the soil thereof in fee. The effect of this decision is to take from Daniel not only the alley already given by the will, but also a part of his house.</p>
    <p id="b341-5" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[135,1327,1169,543]]]'>There is an obscurity or inconsistency in this will which may be attributed to the testator himself, but is as likely to have been the blunder of the conveyancer. The reservation was wholly useless, as in view of the situation of the alley, and its previous use, the devisees of both houses would have been entitled to the use of the alley. It was unnecessary to give to Daniel and his heirs the use of an alley which he had already devised to him in fee ; it would have been equally unnecessary to devise to his daughter the use of an alley which the situation of the respective properties showed was common to each. It was a manifest blunder in the will.</p>
    <p id="b341-6" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[134,1888,1170,498]],["BL_342.1",342,[293,359,1174,350]]]'>A positive grant cannot be taken away by mere implication ; and, if we attribute to the testator the intent to give the daughter the soil of the alley, we must also attribute to him the intention to give her also a part of the house devised to Daniel. It would be a violent presumption—too violent to be seriously entertained—that he intended to devise to Daniel a part only of his house; that the rear end of said house over the alley, and of the cellar under it, were to pass to his daughter. It is much more rational to suppose that the testator made-a mistake in the reservation, than that he intended to cut off <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>thé rear end of his son’s house for his daughter’s benefit. There was no possible motive for such an act. It was not required for any useful purpose. The property devised to his daughter,could be enjoyed to the full extent without it. The devise gave her the use of her house, as it had always existed, including the use of the alley, and, ás before observed, the reservation was not needed for the benefit of either party.</p>
    <p id="b342-6" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[292,718,1175,247]]]'>We are of opinion that the defendants had no right to construct the platform over the alley, and that the court below should have entered judgment for the plaintiff. Our decision does not cover the area referred to. That claim was practically abandoned here.</p>
