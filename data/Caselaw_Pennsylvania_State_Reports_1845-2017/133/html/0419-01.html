The real estate was purchased by Mr. A. P. Spinney for himself and the plaintiffs in the present case, for the sum of $12,050, and said plaintiffs purchased personal property to the amount of $698. No money was paid to the sheriff for either the real or the personal property at the time of the sale, and the latter remaiued upon the foundry premises. On October 8, 1875, the plaintiffs in this suit agreed to sell to the defendants, all said property, both real and personal, embodied in the agreement in the written contract in evidence. The understanding of the parties, at the time of executing that contract, was that the defendants should pay to the sheriff the amounts of the bids at which the properties had been purchased at the sheriff’s sale, and should pay to the plaintiffs the remainder of the consideration money named in the contract. The defendants at once took possession of the real and personal property, but knowing that the sheriff had not yet made a deed for the real estate. On the same day, Mr. Spinney entered into a written contract, at Philadelphia, with one William Torrey, for the sale of the same real estate to him, and notified the plaintiffs thereof by telegraph, whereupon they gave notice to the defendants that the contract made by them with the defendants could not be carried out.</p>

On October 18, 1875, the defendants tendered to the sheriff the amount bid by Mr. Spinney for the real estate, viz. $12,050; but the sheriff refused to receive it, having already been paid the same by Mr. Spinney, who had obtained the money from Torrey. The defendants thereupon filed a bill in equity against Torrey, the Cleavers, the sheriff and Spinney, praying for the specific enforcement of the agreement <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>for the conveyance of title to the real estate made by the Cleavers. This suit in equity resulted finally in a decree by the Supreme Court that Spinney held the title to the real estate, under his purchase at the sheriff’s sale, in trust for himself and the Cleavers, the latter being entitled to the two thirds thereof upon payment of two thirds of the purchase money: Garner’s App., 1 Leg. Rec. R. 1. Spinney, thereupon, tendered a deed for the two thirds of the real estate to the Cleavers, demanding a corresponding part of the purchase money from them. They refused to accept the deed or pay the money demanded, whereupon he tendered a similar deed, to the defendants, accompanying it with a similar demand. The latter tender and demand being refused, he conveyed the entire title to the real estate to Torrey, as whose property it was afterwards sold by the United States marshal to the defendants for $8,100.</p>

It appears in evidence that <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>the plaintiffs paid to the sheriff for the personal property, for which they seek to recover in this action, on October 12, 1875. This appears from the bill of sale and from the sheriff’s sales book, and is testified to by one of the plaintiffs. [If you should find from the evidence before you that the defendants took possession of the personal property for which the plaintiffs seek to recover under the agreement of October 8, 1875, and that they, the defendants, agreed to pay to the sheriff the sum of $698, out of the $16,711, which the agreement obligated them to pay, and that they failed to so pay the said sum of $698 to the sheriff, and that the plaintiffs paid to the sheriff that sum on October 12, 1875, in pursuance of their, the plaintiffs’, bid, then you should find for the plaintiffs for the sum or amount thus paid by plaintiffs with interest thereon, unless you find that the plaintiffs failed to perform their covenants and thereby subjected the defendants to the necessary payment of sums amounting to or exceeding the consideration mentioned in the agreement of October 8, 1875.] 3 . . . .</p>

There is no dispute as to the title of this personal property. We think therefore that the defendants by their acts elected not to rescind the contract of October 8, 1875, but to enforce it. If therefore you find the plaintiffs have not failed to perform their covenants, or that the defendants by reason of any such failure have not necessarily expended an amount so great as not to leave $698 remaining out of the consideration of $16,711, then we think that the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover; and if you so find you should render a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for the $698 remaining out of the consideration of $16,711, with interest thereon from the time that the plaintiffs paid the sheriff, np to the time of the tender of payment by the defendants.] 3</p>

In the action of covenant, the only breach that can be made a basis of recovery, is a breach of some covenant contained in the written instrument on which the suit is brought. To base a recovery upon a contemporaneous parol stipulation, not only must the plaintiff aver in the declaration its omission from the writing by fraud or mistake, but he must establish this by the measure of proof required by a chancellor for the re-formation of a written instrument: Merriman v.

But, whether they had or had not elected not to rescind the agreement, is a question of fact, which, if at all material in this case, is to be found by the jury, and not to be determined by the court. Can the plaintiffs, after repudiating the contract and failing to carry out its provisions, recover upon it ?
