    <p class="summary" id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[167,515,1162,493]]]'>The main question that arises in this case is whether the defendant was entitled to the benefit of the exemption law. Under the general act of 1845, the wages of labor could not be attached, and under the act of May 8, 1876, P. L. 139, which allowed the wages of labor to be attached for board, it has been decided that the defendant was not deprived of the benefit of the exemption law. But the act of April 4, 1889, P. L. 23, enacts “that no exemption of property from levy and sale or attachment shall be allowed, on judgment obtained for board for four weeks or less.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b111-6" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[169,1026,1164,553]]]'>The record does not show whether the original judgment was for four weeks or less board, or for more, neither does the record of the proceedings in the attachment execution show this fact. But the latter record does show that defendant claimed the exemption before the justice, and that the exemption was “disallowed” on account of the act of assembly passed and approved April 4,1889. The question of the right to the exemption was passed upon by the justice, and the fact is, I think, sufficiently set forth in his record. If the defendant was dissatisfied, his proper course was to take an appeal. Having taken a certiorari he must be tried by the record.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b111-7" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[170,1587,1165,452]]]'>The question whether judgments for more than four weeks board are to participate in the benefits of the act of 1889, to the extent of four weeks or less board, does not fairly arise here, because the record does not show that more than four weeks board was attached, and there is always a fair presumption in favor of the correctness of the record and proceedings before the justice. Any other construction would introduce a technical rule, which would go far to render the law a practical nullity and defeat the manifest intent of the legislature.</p>

Judge Brewster regrets the decision, but feels constrained to make it, because the same thing has been decided in a number of unreported cases. The language of the law does not re<a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>quire that the record should state the hour. In Kraus v. Albert, 27 P. L. J. 87, it was decided that the record need not state the hour. This court, in case of Gage v. Gage, 85 March Term 1882, decided in the same way, and this is, I think, the more reasonable construction of the law. This exception is overruled as is also the fourth exception.</p>

It is true that under the act of 1845 the wages of labor could not be attached. The act of May 8, 1876, allowed wages to be attached for board, but under it the defendant was not deprived of his exemption. Then came the act of April 4, 1889, P. L. 23, which enacts “ that, from and after the passage of this act, no exemption of property..... shall be allowed on judgment obtained for board for four weeks or less.” The attachment here was issued by the justice for four weeks ’ board. A claim for exemption was made, and <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>disallowed by him, upon tbe ground that it could not be claimed under tbe act of 1889.</p>

What an “attachment in case” is, has not been made to appear. It is true the act of May 8, 1876, P. L. 189, does use this expression, where it authorizes an attachment of wages for board, but it manifestly means “ an attachment in <em>such </em>case.” Any other reading of it makes it insensible. There is evidently a clerical or typographical blunder in the act as printed.</p>
    <p id="b113-6" data-blocks='[["BL_113.5",113,[147,922,1167,708]]]'>We think the docket of the justice sets out the proceedings in the attachment with sufficient certainty. All the essential matters are found there. It is not as full and accurate as it would probably have been, had it been made up by an experienced lawyer, but we must not expect too much from a justice of the peace. Few of them have any legal training, and we must look at their records with a benign eye. To hold them to the strictest accuracy in every little detail would greatly impair the usefulness of this large class of magistrates. Judgment was regularly entered against the garnishees for an amount of money admittedly in their hands, and they do not complain of it. It would have been wiser for the appellant to have paid his four weeks’ board than to waste his money in this frivolous litigation.</p>
