In referring to the liability of the stockholders to contribute a ratable share of the debts of the bank, Mr. Justice Gordon says : “ It is asked, how is this contributory share to be ascertained, apportioned or enforced? We answer, either by process analogous to that prescribed for the benefit of note holders, in the thirty-second and thirty-third sections of the banking act of 1850, or by a bill in equity; but, however this may be, one tiling is certain; that is, that an auditor has no such power. It is not his business to estimate the value of the property of the bank and apportion the deficit among the stockholders ; that power is by law committed to the assignee.”</p>

The view of the master and court below that that act does not apply, for the reason that the Miners’ Bank is not a bank of issue, is erroneous, because the act plainly provides that every banking corporation thereafter created shall be subject to its provisions ; because by the terms of its charter the Miners’ Bank is a banking corporation, and because the act of 1850 provides not only for banks of issue, but for banks of discount and deposit also, and the latter are properly embraced within the term banking corporation: Oultou v.

The finding that John Allen was a stockholder was based upon the fact that his name appeared upon the stock ledger.

Their statutory liability to creditors, imposed by § 13 of the act of incorporation, is distinct from the contract liability to the bank created by their stock subscriptions, and the former accrues only when the assets of the bank, including the capital subscribed, have been exhausted: Craig’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=92%20Pa.%20400" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="92 Pa. 400">92 Pa. 400</a>; Means’s App., <a href="/pa/85/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="85 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="440459" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0075-01">85 Pa. 75</a>. It follows, that the double liability means a liability for $100, if the stock is $50 per share, or $50 if it is $25 per share. A clause imposing the liability “ to the amount of the stock,” makes the stockholders liable beyond their stock subscriptions. The argument of the defendants, therefore, involves the absurd anomaly of construing that phrase and the one in the charter of this bank, viz., “ to the extent of double the amount of the stock,” as meaning one and the same thing. But the doctrine we contend for is authoritatively settled by Lane’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=105%20Pa.%2057" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="105 Pa. 57">105 Pa. 57</a>; and it is unnecessary to contend that the reduction of the stock was unauthorized, since the assessment upon it as reduced is sufficient to pay the bank’s indebtedness.</p>

If John Allen made any transfer of his stock, the transfer itself was the best evidence, and should have been produced, and as to the liability of the married women, we claim to recover in this case upon a statutory liability, as distinct from a contract liability. The defendants admit that a married woman may hold and transfer stock, and the case they cite, Hahn’s App., <a href="/pa/114/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="114 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="550056" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0153-01">114 Pa. 153</a>, so rules. As the charter of the Miners’ Bank exempts no stockholder, but makes all individually responsible, it follows that they are liable for the contracts and debts of the bank, which is a different thing from holding them liable upon their own contracts. In Amer v. Armstrong, 6 Pa. C. C. R. 392, the master held them liable, though the court did not pass upon the question. The existence of such a liability was adjudged by the U. S. Circuit Court for the district of Vermont, in Withers v. Sowles, 1 Lawy. Rep. 64, under § 5151, U. S. Rev. Stat., the provisions of which are similar to those of this bank’s charter. The liability rests upon the same basis as that for taxes and division fences, being an incident annexed by the law of the ownership of the stock.</p>

His main contention was that there can be no recovery against the defendants, in tbe present proceeding, because the act of April 16,1850, entitled “ An Act regulating banks,” gives a full, complete, and adequate remedy at law for tlie relief sought by tlie present bill. It is very true, and we have so held repeatedly, tbat since the act of 1806, where a remedy is given by statute such remedy must be pursued.

Tbe thirteenth section of the act of incorporation of this bank, act of April 10, 1873, P. L. 674, provides that “the stockholders of said bank shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all contracts, debts, and engagements of said bank, to the extent of double the amount of the stock subscribed for or held by tbem.” It was contended by the appellants tbat this means that tbe stockholders are responsible to the amount of stock subscribed and unpaid for, and as much more; if the share subscribed for is paid up, the shareholder would be responsible to tlie extent of the par value of another share. We cannot assent to this view. Tbe liability to tbe corporation for tbe amount of subscriptions unpaid exists without tliis personal liability clause in tbe charter. The clause referred to for the benefit of tbe creditors was plainly intended to give them a claim upon the stockholders to double the amount of tbe stock held by tbem, respectively. The stock in such cases is presumed to be paid up in whole, or in part at least, and this fund was necessarily liable to creditors without any individual liability clause. The contention of the appellants would make the stockholders liable for only an amount <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>equal to the capital stock. In Lane’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="105 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="454279" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0049-01">105 Pa. 49</a>, where the stockholders were individually liable to the amount of the shares of capital stock subscribed or held by them, it was said by our Brother Green, in delivering the opinion of the court: “Moreover, the liability created by this section [fourteenth section of the act of April 29, 1874] is a direct liability from the stockholder to the creditor, and it exists to the amount of the stock held by the stockholder, without any reference to the question whether it has been paid for or not. Hence the stockholder, although he has paid in full to the corporation for his stock, is nevertheless still liable to the extent of the whole value of his stock.” This is the rule when the liability of the stockholder is single, i. e., to the value of his stock. It follows logically that, where the liability is double, he is liable not only to the corporation for the balance, if any, unpaid upon his stock, but also to creditors to double the amount of said stock. As was well said by the learned judge of the court below : “ The language of the statute, ex vi termini, it seems to us, can mean nothing less.”</p>
    <p id="b592-6" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[272,1331,1174,197]]]'>John Allen, one of the appellants, complains that the master erred in finding as a fact that he was a stockholder. This finding of fact was approved by the court below, and we are not prepared to say it was not justified by the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b592-7" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[268,1537,1179,760]]]'>The only remaining question which requires notice, is that raised by the twelfth assignment, in which it was alleged that married women were not liable under the individual liability clause of the charter. If their liability were a contractual one, as was the case in Wolbach v. Building Ass’n, <a href="/pa/84/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="84 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="1053527" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0211-01">84 Pa. 211</a>, and other cases cited by the appellants, we would be disposed to regard this point as well taken. But the liability is one created by statute, and a married woman who holds shares of stock in such a corporation takes it cum onere, subject to whatever responsibility the law imposes upon the holders of such shares. She is as much liable to creditors, in such case, as she would be liable for taxes upon her real estate. In either case the liability is purely statutory, and arises from no contractual relation, but solely from the possession and ownership of the property.</p>
