These marks that the parties have selected, they no doubt intended to be permanent, but they appear, some of them at least, to have changed, even in the short space of a lifetime. The tree now stands farther up from the water, and instead of being now a young, thrifty tree, is an old, dead and withered stump, or I take it to be so from the photograph I have seen. You have seen it. Tins appears to be the tree referred to in the deed; or, possibly, there may have been some other tree, but the probability is that this is the tree which was referred to. It was then but six feet from the water; now it is sixteen. The rock of which we have heard so much, the rock with the hole in it, <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>I presume, is the rock mentioned, is about twenty-five feet from the tree; into it the parties bored the hole, intending that to be a remaining monument to settle all disputes between them. But now, it is alleged that the rock was not permanent, and that it has either sunk, moved or tilted, so as to change the hole and make it lower than it was when the mark was originally made. But, unfortunately, also, while the parties may have agreed positively, clearly and precisely as to what their rights were in 1816 and in 1885 and 1836, the law admits what is called an uninterrupted user for twenty-one years to obliterate the most stable monuments man can establish; and, while it may be that the rock has not moved, or tilted, or sunk, yet it may be that that is not the mark, that that does not indicate the height to which the defendant is entitled to maintain his water. [And while you may therefore find that these marks have not changed, yet, if you find that for a period of twenty-one years the waters of that dam have been maintained at the height they now are, continuously, uninterruptedly, adversely for twenty-one years, the law as firmly settles that right as if the parties had reduced it to writing and established it by the most solemn monuments, deeds and documents.] 8 . . . .</p>

In 1836 their rights were well defined and could be established with precision. There was an award made at that time, and it was agreed that the hole in the rock that had been made as far back as 1816 was the proper line, the proper mark for the height of the water. In 1835 the award was made and was submitted to by the parties. That award was just as binding as the verdict of a jury would have been, if made at that time. They then adopted the hole in the rock. They not only adopted the rock, but they adopted the hole in the rock that had been made in 1816. So you need not go beyond 1836. One year was given to lower the water, for it seems that the water at that time was too high; how much too high does not appear, but one year was given to lower the water. The probability is that it was done; they were here no more; no complaints were made until at a more recent period.</p>

Adopting the line of 1836 as the mark, has the defendant between that time and the commencement of this suit, for an uninterrupted period of twenty-one years maintained the water at its present height? If you find that he has, you need go no further. It will not be necessary for you to consider any other mark or any other line. The law gives him as good a title to maintain the dam and the water at that height, as if the parties had agreed upon it by deeds. In fact, the law presumes that there has been a grant of that right.] 8 Now that will he the first question, and I would advise you to take that question up first, because if you find that question in favor of the defendant, it is an end of the case and you need go no further; your verdict will simply be for the defendant.</p>

That question will be: Are there any well established land marks or water marks by which you can ascertain to a reasonable certainty to what height the defendant is entitled to maintain the water of his dam?

Now, understand, always remembering that the first question must be disposed of adversely to the defendant before you take up the second question, because if you should find the first question in his favor, that there had been twenty-one years uninterrupted and continuous user, then the land-marks have nothing to do with it, the present line of the water must control the ease; but, having found that point against him, then you will proceed to say whether this rock with the hole in it is sufficiently permanent; <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>whether it is now where it was in 1836; and, if you find that it is, then your verdict ought to be for the plaintiffs.

Now, remember, 1836 is one year after the award fixing the hole in the rook as the mark. In 1846 the big dam was built, Avhen the old dam which was in existence when the hole in the rock was bored appears to have been abandoned, and a large dam built farther down the creek and called the big dam. Now, about the waters of the big dam the Avitnesses differ. The witnesses upon the part of the defendant say that it filled the dam completely up and covered what they call the old dam, except the stepping stones. I suppose that it raised the water at least as high as the old dam raised it. And then you come to the period of 1873 when the big dam was washed away and the old dam was then brought into use again, repaired and used. Then some disputes were raised between the parties. They did not amount to a lawsuit. There was some talk, there Avere some complaints, but there was no action taken either to have the dam lowered or raised.] 1 [The effect of the big dam, and the height of the water, have a material bearing upon the old dam. If you find that it did, when up to its usual height, overflow the breast of the big dam or of the old dam, then unless the old dam has been raised, there ought to be no dispute about the height of the water to which the defendant was entitled to raise his dam or keep his water. Noav, this old dam, as I remember it, was washed away in 1877. If I am not correct you will remember. And in 1881 about twenty-five feet of it was Avashed out, which was repaired in 1882, and that is the time when the principal dispute commenced, as I understand.] 3 The defendant alleges that when he repaired the dam he did not raise it, but kept it down some two or three inches below what he was entitled to have it. The plaintiffs allege that that dam has been made too high by several inches. If you find that the hole in the rock was correct, that would indicate how much too high it was; if the hole in the rock is not correct, you Avill have to find out yourselves how much too high it is. So you see, the next subordinate question in the <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>case is whether the dam, when repaired in 1882, was built higher than the level of the water, as maintained in the dam of 1846, and, if it was, then the plaintiffs would be entitled to a verdict, providing that you find that the statute has not run against his claim.....[Now let me repeat in brief. Just consider whether the statute of limitations has barred the plaintiff’s case; that is to sajq just consider whether for a period of twenty-one years continuously since 1886 to the commencement of this suit or at any time between those dates, the defendant has adversely, continuously and uninterruptedly maintained the water of his dam at its present height. If you find that he has, as I said before, that is an end of the case; it is not worth while to consider the subordinate question; you will find your verdict for the defendant.] 8.....</p>

What was known as the big dam was built in 1846 and washed out in 1873. Hence, if there was no change in its height, a title by prescription was obtained by the owners of the defendant’s property. Accordingly, the plaintiffs endeavored to prove that that dam was raised between 1868 and 1870, by showing that about that period the water was raised at their mills, and that about 1870 there were complaints about the height of the dam. The instruction referred to in the first assignment of error directed the minds of the jury from the real cause of complaint, the raising of the water between 1868 and 1870, and the further instructions' when the jury were called back, did not remedy its damaging effect.</p>

The judge’s summary of the case is strictly in accordance with the defendant’s theory that there was no change in the height of the dam that was washed away in 1873, and no reference is made to the plaintiff’s case, except that part referring to the grant and the rock, and. the charge improperly tends to throw discredit upon the stability of the rock.

The direction to find whether the waters of the dam had been maintained at their present height for twenty-one years was erroneous. Although the right of the defendant, under the express grant to his predecessors, is measured by the height of the water at the tree and the rock, the true rule upon the subject of the acquisition of an additional right by prescription is just the reverse, the right so acquired being measured by the height of the dam structure continuously maintained for twenty-one years: Gehman v.

The court was wrong, for this reason, in affirming those points. And to what statute did the court refer, in its answer to the plaintiffs’ second point ?

There certainly was no “ very serious dispute” between the parties from 1836 to 1873. In 1868, 1869, or 1870, Kent is said to have complained that the water was too high, and Kelly sent a man to see whether there was any cause for complaint; others heard there was some dispute about that time, as to the height of the water, but had no personal knowledge of the facts. It does not appear that there was any work done on the dam, or that the height of the water was increased by this or any other means during these years. There certainly was no interference with Kelly’s use of the .water; no suit was brought, no adjustment made; in fact, there was no evidence of any such dispute as could have had any effect whatever in this case.

The defendant further contended that the present height of the water is the same as it was in 1836, and that it has since that time continuously, and 'without interruption, been so maintained, under adverse claim of right; and there was evidence adduced in support of both of these propositions.

In that case, as we there said, “ the defendant contended, and called witnesses to show, that the dam was built in the year 1843, and that since that time, and for twenty-one years prior to the bringing of the suit, it had been maintained in precisely the same form, and to the same and no greater height; that the structure was identically the same, in all respects, at the time when the suit was brought, as it had been at any time during the twenty-one years prior to that time, and that this long-continued enjoyment of the easement or water privilege, under the facts and circumstances of the case, raised a legal presumption of a corresponding grant, and of his right to hold it.” There was nothing to rebut this proof, but testimony as to the height of the water at different times and under varying circumstances, and the opinions of witnesses as to what was the depth, at ordinary stages of the water. In this condition of the proofs we said: “ If the defendant, or those under whom he claims, for a period of twenty-one years before suit brought, under a claim of right, openly, continuously, and uninterruptedly maintained his dam, the breast-wall or structure of which was at all times during that period of the same height, while the owner and possessor of the lands upon which the reservoir and race were located was under no disability to resist the use, the law will presume a grant of the easement, the extent of which is to be measured, not by the actual or average depth of the water at any given point, but by the nature and extent of the obstruction itself. The depth of the water, even in such a basin, is necessarily inconstant and variable; but the height of the dam structure is fixed and certain, and readily ascertainable.” It must be conceded that, owing to the changing condition of the stream from rain and drought, the ascertainment of the extent of an easement, by the height of the water alone, is difficult; so difficult, in some cases at least, as to render the ascertainment, in any exact sense, impracticable, if not impossible. What is the ordinary stage or level of a stream of water, or of a pool supplied by a stream, may be a matter of opinion merely. As Mr. Justice Lowbie said in McCoy v. Danley, <a href="/pa/20/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="20 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="972382" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0091-01">20 Pa. 91</a>, that depends upon the seasons and the weather, and it is a matter about which people <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>differ; but the dam is a permanent and fixed structure, and, when its proper height is agreed upon or otherwise established, as long’ as its elevation is actually unchanged it affords the most satisfactory proof of the level to which the water may be raised.</p>
    <p id="b418-6" data-blocks='[["BL_418.4",418,[268,562,1174,1059]]]'>It is certainly true that the presumption of a grant, arising from long-continued user, applies to the land occupied, and not to the dam, and the extent of the easement is measured by the extent to which the servient tenement is overflowed; but as long as the dam structure is of the same height, it may be assumed, in most cases at least, that the water is held to the same general level, and the extent of the land flooded from time to time is the same. The height of the water at what may be considered its ordinary level, as compared with known water marks, and the extent of land covered by the water at its ordinary stages from time to time, are proper evidence, of course, in this class of cases; but if it clearly appear that the dam-breast, through a period of twenty-one years prior to the time of the complaint, has been in fact unchanged, variations in the depth of the water, during the continuance, after that, of the structure, at the same height, may be fairly attributed -to the varying condition of the stream, or the evidence thereof to a difference of opinion as to what is the ordinary stage of the water.
