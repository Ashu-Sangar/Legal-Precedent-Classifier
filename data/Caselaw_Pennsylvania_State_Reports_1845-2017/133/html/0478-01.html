The testator in express terms declares that his sons shall not have “ the right, liberty or privilege to divide or to sell or to convey the said premises, or any part or. parcel thereof, during the natural life or widowhood of my said wife Elizabeth.” This provision was violated by the partition made February 17,1853, under which the father, John P.

We contend that Catharine’s rights ceased with the death <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>of her mother. This is the proper construction of the provision that if the “ said devise ” should in the opinion of the executors be insufficient for the support of the widow and Catharine “ during said term,” the sum of $100 shall be paid “ annually during said term ” to the widow and Catharine “ and the survivor.” The words, “said devise,” mean only the devise to the widow. There is but one devise, and that is to her. The whole of the house, farm products, etc., were given to the widow, but her enjoyment of them was made subject to a charge in Catharine’s favor. There was no devise to Catharine herself, and the phrase in question can mean nothing else than the devise to the widow. The conclusion thus arrived at, by a process of reasoning, is supported by the decision in Kearns v. Kearns, <a href="/pa/107/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="107 Pa. 575" data-case-ids="8858756" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0575-01">107 Pa. 575</a>, a case on all fours with this one.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[269,1123,1173,849]]]'>2. So, the words, “ during said term,” mean the term of the devise to the widow. She was the object of the testator’s bounty, in this clause, and the charge in Catharine’s favor upon the devise to the widow was solely for the purpose of inducing Catharine to remain with and care for the widow. The only thing in the will that creates any ambiguity is the phrase, “ and the survivor of them.” But these words must be considered in connection with the entire clause, and in subordination to the intention of the testator as manifested by the will as a whole: Still v. Spear, <a href="/pa/45/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="45 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="9502519" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0168-01">45 Pa. 168</a>; Reck’s App., <a href="/pa/78/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="78 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1040350" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0432-01">78 Pa. 432</a>; Musselman’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=5%20W.%209" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 W. 9">5 W. 9</a>; Schott’s Est., <a href="/pa/78/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="78 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1040354" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0040-01">78 Pa. 40</a>; Lynn v.

So considered, this phrase must be treated, in view of what we have already said as to the “ devise ” and the “term,” either as surplusage, or, as added out of a superabundance of caution to preserve to the widow the benefit of the provision for her, in the event of Catharine’s dying before she did.</p>

If Catharine be entitled to the annuity after her mother’s death, when does it commence ? Rachel Riehl never formed or expressed an opinion that it was necessary for Catharine’s support, or communicated such an opinion to the appellants or any one else, so far as the testimony shows, until after Catharine filed her bill in equity in 1881. Her opinion, then first expressed, cannot be antedated so as to create a liability for the annuity from the widow’s death. And her opinion <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>must be formed in tbe exercise of a sound discretion; a necessity created by Catharine’s improvidence would not be sufficient. There was no demand for the annuity prior to 1881, and the necessity for a demand was not dispensed with by the partition between the sons, who were all sui juris and could make what agreement they chose. At most, the annuity could be recovered only from 1881.

We do not agree with the position assumed by the appellants that the devise in the will of Joseph Brotzman was intended only for the benefit of his widow, and that the rights, if any, of his daughter Catharine, fell with the death of her mother. It is plain, from a careful examination of the whole will, that the testator intended to make a provision for Catharine so long “as she remains single and unmarried.” He makes a provision for the support of his widow, the details of which it is unnecessary to repeat, and couples it with a direction that bis daughter Catharine shall share the benefit thereof so long as she remains single and unmarried, and then adds this clause: “ In case the said devise should, in the opinion of my son Abraham and daughter Rachel and the survivor, be insufficient for the comfortable <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>support and maintenance of my wife and daughter Catharine during said term, then I order that the sum of $100 shall be paid annually during said term to my said wife and daughter and the survivor, out of the proceeds of the rent of the ore-bed.” Here is a distinct charge upon the real estate for the benefit of both the widow and Catharine, and of the survivor of them. It was to continue for the widow diiring her widowhood, and for Catharine so long “ as she remains single and unmarried.” This is what was intended by the use of the words <em>“ </em>during said term.” Why should the testator cut off • Catharine’s support at the death of the mother? The plain intent of the will is to provide for the one during widowhood, and for the other so long as she remained single. In this respect the case differs essentially from Kearns v. Kearns, <a href="/pa/107/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="107 Pa. 575" data-case-ids="8858756" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0575-01">107 Pa. 575</a>.</p>

It was made so, in part, at least, by the conduct of the testator’s sons. The homestead privileges given by the will were rendered fruitless, to a great extent, by the sale of the property in violation of the terms of the will. Abraham Brotzman, one of the executors, died in 1860. Rachel Riehl, the surviving executrix, and one of the respondents in this proceeding, who, by the terms of the will, is made the judge of the sufficiency of the devise for Catharine’s support, makes answer as follows : “ I state and aver, further, that my opinion of the insufficiency of said devise for said comfortable support and maintenance, and of the necessity of such yearly payments, was known to respondent, whose land was charged with payment of the same, at the time of said first payment, and that he, and his representatives since his decease, have known of the same, and that complaints were then made, and have since continued to be made by complainant, of her need for such yearly payments by reason of the insufficiency of said devise for her (Catharine’s) comfortable support and maintenance, repeatedly made by her therefor, and that then, and since, I have repeatedly asked and demanded of respondents that said yearly payments be made promptly, as provided by said will.” The neglect and refusal of the respondents to make these payments are the more inexcusable from the fact that the ore-beds, upon which this sum <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>was charged, were remunerative, and amply sufficient to meet it.</p>
