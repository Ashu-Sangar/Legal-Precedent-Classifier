Baird. In December, 1886, Martin made a contract to sell one of the lots to John R. Levering, and applied to John Ruhl, a conveyancer, who had transacted business for him previously, to have the necessary conveyance from himself to Levering prepared. Desiring to give Levering a title that would not be subject to the whole of the Baird mortgage, he consulted Ruhl, also, concerning a proposed application to the representatives of the Baird estate for its apportionment between the two lots. Ruhl advised him that as there were minors interested in that estate it would be expensive to obtain an apportionment, and suggested the plan of borrowing on separate mortgages of the lots a sufficient sum to pay off the Baird mortgage. This plan having been determined on, it was arranged that Levering would execute a mortgage for $2,800 upon the house and lot sold to him, and Martin would execute one for $2,500 upon the other house and lot. On December 29, 1886, Ruhl wrote to J. D. Sergeant, one of the plaintiffs, who was trustee of several estates, including the estate of Thomas Sergeant and the Sepviva estate, as follows:</p>

I did- not have many dealings with him. I bought ground from the Sepviva estate-I recognized Buhl as agent for the Sepviva estate. I have had about four transactions with Buhl. The first time I had dealings with John Buhl was about four years ago, about a ground rent on Otis street; then this property on Park avenue. I authorized him to offer $18,000 for it; afterwards they accepted my offer. He drew the deed to this property for me and he bought this property for me. I had four transactions with him as conveyancer. He did not keep my deed. He did collect moneys for me and make payments for me. He collected a small mortgage for me. He did not collect money for me from E. B. Williams, or E. Kruger. In the Otis street matter, he drew my papers and recorded them. He only had a regular account against me for costs and charges. He did prepare leases and mortgages for me and recorded papers for me. In the Otis street matter, I didn’t receive a bill from Buhl for services, but I received a bill from Joseph M. Pile. He (Buhl) prepared mortgages for me from building associations. He had something to do with all my properties, because he looked <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>after tlie interests of the building associations. He acted for me in four matters. I had no other conveyancer during the time I have referred to. He drew tlie deed to Levering and the deed to me. The Baird mortgage was $5,375. I expected that the parties who were getting these two mortgages would see that the other mortgage due the Baird estate would be satisfied.</p>

I never authorized John Ruhl to pay off this mortgage for me. John Ruhl was never employed by me as the trustee of the Sergeant estate. I gave him a check for $2,500.

That mortgage had been given, as the testimony shows, to Mr. Baird, or to parties interested in his estate.</p>

You have heard the correspondence read, how, and what was said, before this occurred; before the mortgages were executed, before they were prepared. Upon the receipt of this letter, [Mr. Sergeant wrote to Mr. Ruhl to see that the title was good, and that everything connected with the mortgages was right, was in proper order and condition.] a And, either at that time or shortly afterwards, certainly before the mortgages were executed, he sent the money in a check drawn to Mr. Ruhl’s order.

Now, gentlemen, on the other hand, it appears that Mr. Ruhl had to a certain extent gained the confidence of the defendant in this case; he had, further, four distinct and several transactions covering a period of three or four years; that, in addition to his own transaction, he dealt with Mr. Ruhl, or Mr. Ruhl conducted the affairs of a building association, in which Mr. Martin had some concern.

And transactions grew out of them.] 5 In addition to that, there is evidence to show that in relation to this very transaction, this mortgage and the money connected with it, he had correspondence with Ruhl. The importance of that is entirely a matter for you. But all of these things are to be considered in determining, as I said before, the principal question in this case, for whom was Ruhl agent? Was Ruhl acting for Sergeant? If he was acting for Sergeant, and did not pay the money to Martin, the plaintiffs cannot recover. The plaintiffs cannot recover, unless in receiving the money Ruhl was authorized to receive it as Martin’s agent.</p>

So, in this transaction, you are to determine from the evidence who Ruhl was acting for at the time he received the money. In this particular case, the evidence shows that Mr. Sergeant paid over the money to Ruhl, or sent him his check, a considerable time before any examination of title or searches or the mortgage was drafted or executed ; and therefore he could not be said to have paid the money because Mr. Martin had put the executed mortgage in the hands of Ruhk and by that act authorized him to receive the money.

He got it to pay off the Baird mortgage for Martin, and tljat is what he failed to do. Martin could not have received the money, because Ruhl was to apply it on the Baird mortgage, and not to pay it to Martin. ■ Everything in the matter was done by Ruhl for Martin. He had been Martin’s conveyancer for several years, and there was a running account between them. Unquestionably he was Martin’s agent in this instance, and Martin is responsible for his misfeasance in the course of his employment: Bank of Ky. v. Bank, 1 Pars. 248. Even if Ruhl were held the agent of both parties, the burden of the fraud in embezzling the money must be placed where the fraudulent agent placed it: Wright’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=99%20Pa.%20481" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="99 Pa. 481">99 Pa. 481</a>.</p>

As Martin, by his misplaced confidence in the agent whom he employed to get the money, and with whom he left the mortgage after execution, was the cause of the loss which one of two innocent parties must suffer, he cannot throw it upon the other party: Penna. R. Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/86/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="86 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1056655" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0080-01">86 Pa. 80</a>. The fact that Sergeant paid Ruhl the money before he secured the mortgage, will not avail Martin as a defence, inasmuch as he executed the mortgage and left it with Rulil for the purpose of obtaining the money on it and having it recorded. Having done so, he cannot set up a claim that Sergeant was negligent: Penna. R. Co.’s App., supra. The fraud commenced after the completion of the mortgage and the payment of the money. Having trusted to Ruhl to apply the money for him, and having put it into his jpower to inflict the loss, Martin must bear <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>it: Morris v.

The statements in the portions of the charge excepted to were too sweeping to be considered as mere slips of the tongue, and the withdrawal of them was too feeble to dissipate their effect. It was like breaking off a sword and leaving the point in the wound. In Coxe v. Deringer, <a href="/pa/82/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="82 Pa. 236" data-case-ids="1047882" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0236-01">82 Pa. 236</a>, and Linn v.

Moreover the questions covered by the seventh and eighth assignments of error -should not have been allowed. The first was improper, because the defendant had shown by his own testimony that Ruhl was his agent to get the money and pay off another mortgage with it. Whether the witness received the money was therefore imrnarterial, and whether he got any consideration for the mortgage was a question of law, and not of fact. The other question was totally irrelevant; it is not pretended that Martin expected to receive the check.</p>

    <p id="b151-7" data-blocks='[["BL_151.6",151,[162,1434,1161,551]]]'>1. The plaintiffs were not entitled to a binding charge in their favor, but such a charge should have been delivered in favor of the defendant. Martin believed that Ruhl was Sergeant’s agent, and in that belief applied to him for a loan. Whether he was right or wrong, such was his belief. He executed the mortgage expecting that the mortgagee would pay off the first mortgage. Sergeant never saw the $2,500 mortgage until after Ruhl’s flight; had no brief of title; caused no investigation to be made; and looked to Ruhl, whom he held responsible, that all should be right. In such circumstances, the loss should fall upon the plaintiffs.</p>

It is incredible that any trustee would have trusted Ruhl and would have given him the money in advance of the receipt of the mortgage, if ho had believed him to be acting for Martin; and as soon as it appeared that Sergeant had not paid the check to Ruhl upon the faith of the Martin mortgage, there was an end to the plaintiffs’ right to recover. They had been misled by no authority in Ruhl, real or apparent. Moreover, it was the defendant, and not the plaintiffs, who was injured <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>by tbe course of tbe trial. By tbe statement of certain facts in the charge, and their subsequent withdrawal, the benefit of the charge was partially lost to us. We thought the statements of the trial judge were substantially right upon the facts.</p>

      <p id="b142-15" data-blocks='[["BL_142.14",142,[274,1960,1175,423]]]'>Note the distinction between the facts in Pepper v. Cairns, ante, page 114, and those of this ease. In the former, Ruhl brought to Sergeant the mortgage which Cairns had executed and placed in his hands for delivery, and Sergeant paid him the money upon receiving the mortgage from him. Iiis possession of the mortgage for the purpose of delivery justified Sergeant in assuming that he was authorized to receive the money upon it when he delivered it. In Sergeant v. Martin, however, the money was paid to Ruhl, not only before delivery of the mortgage, but actually prior to its execution, and at the time of receiving Sergeant’s check Ruhl had no indicia of authority to represent Martin in so doing.</p>

The defendant never received a cent of the $2,500 loan, which the mortgage in suit was intended to secure. It was paid to John Ruhl, by check of one of the plaintiffs, to his order, before they ever saw the mortgage ; in fact, it was so paid sixteen days before the mortgage was even executed, and without the slightest evidence that Mr. Ruhl was authorized to receive it, and, so far as the evidence shows, without any inquiry on that subject.</p>

I looked at the papers myself afterwards. In this instance, I depended on the conveyancer who brought the security to me. I thought he was acting for the other man. If the mortgage had not been a first mortgage, I would have held Ruhl responsible. Ruhl was not my conveyancer, but Martin’s. If a conveyancer comes to me, and says a matter is all right, I give him a check. I have no conveyancer. I supposed that Ruhl was an honest and capable conveyancer.....I did not investigate the matter. I don’t think I have a brief of <em>title; </em>if I have, it is with the papers. .....I gave this cheek January 22,1887. I cannot recollect but I presume I received a note from Ruhl saying the mortgage was correct.....All I know or recollect is, that before I got the mortgage I gave the check to Ruhl, and didn’t know anything more about it until Ruhl ran away.” The same witness had previously testified in regard to his mode of doing business with Mr. Ruhl, indicating the confidence he had in his personal integrity, etc.: “ Ruhl would come in or send me <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>word tliat papers were ready, and that he wanted the money, and I would send him my check.”</p>

The jury, however, rightly settled that question by finding, in accordance with the decided weight of plaintiffs’ own testimony, that Ruhl had no such authority.</p>

Upon the conclusion of the general charge, each of these excerpts was excepted to, and thereupon the learned judge, addressing the jury, said: “ I have said that, upon receipt of a letter, Mr. Sergeant wrote to Ruhl to see that the title was good; I also said that Mr. Ruhl had an office with Mr. Sergeant; and I said that Martin repeatedly saw Ruhl at Mr. Sergeant’s office, and about other transactions connected with the Sepviva estate. I withdraw what I said upon those points, as there is no evidence to that effect.” The withdrawal of the statements complained of was so distinct and emphatic that the jury could not fail to understand that they were thus wholly eliminated from the charge, and therefore to be treated by them as though they had never been uttered.</p>
