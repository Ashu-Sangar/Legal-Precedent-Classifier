The provisions contained in §§ 35, 36, 39, and 41 to 43 of the act of 1874, fully bear out this statement. The treasurer of the school funds, under the act of 1874, is an entirely different officer in everything but name from the school treasurer under the act of 1854.

    <p id="b228-8" data-blocks='[["BL_228.6",228,[250,1465,1177,703]]]'>1. The act of 1874 not only does not abolish the office of school treasurer, but clearly and repeatedly recognizes its existence as a separate office. The law makes the two offices separate and distinct, because they belong to two independent bodies, but it provides that they shall be held by the same person for the greater convenience of the people in paying their taxes. The two offices are not merged into one because the city treasurer holds by election and the school treasurer ex officio. There are numerous instances of the same person filling two offices in this way, and receiving a salary for each: § 9, article IY. of the constitution: act of May 24, 1878, P. L. 126 ; act of February 24, 1876, P. L. 3 ; § 47, act of April 13, 1887, P.

It follows as a logical sequence, that the compensation allowed by the city councils does not include payment for services as treasurer of the school board; The statutory recognition of the distinctness of the two offices implies that the <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>officer may have the salary attached to each, and the city has no authority to fix or pay the compensation of a school officer. The school board is not made a department of the city government, nor does the act of 1874 make the school treasurer an officer without compensation; it leaves the provisions of the act of 1854 upon this subject in force. The decision in this case will not compel the payment of any money, but will leave it to the school board to fix the compensation at such amount as they see fit, a merely nominal sum if they choose.</p>

It is true it is now filled by the city treasurer; he is ex officio school treasurer, and acts in a dual character; he gives bond for each office, and takes a separate oath of office for each. As city treasurer his salary is fixed at $4,000; can he also claim the salary or compensation affixed by la\v to the office of school treasurer ? We see nothing to prevent it, unless it has been taken away by an act of assembly. This has not been shown. The defendant claims to retain the sum of 86,231.65, as his compensation under the act of May 8, 1854, until such time as his compensation shall be fixed by the board of school controllers, as provided by the act of 1854. They may fix it at any sum not exceeding two per centum upon the amount of school taxes collected. The school controllers have refused to fix his compensation, alleging, as we understand it, that he is not entitled to any pay whatever, be<a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>yond his salary as city treasurer. For the reasons given, we do not think this position can be sustained. We are of opinion that the court below took the proper view of it.</p>
    <p id="b230-6" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[259,510,1189,556]]]'>This decision does not entitle Mr. Simpson to the whole of the fund retained by him. The school controllers may fix his compensation at any amount less than that sum. All the court below decided, and all we decide, is that, until his compensation is fixed, he has the right to retain the sum referred to. The school controllers have practically the amount of his compensation under their control, and, if it is thought that he* o.uglit' not to be entitled to any pay beyond his salary as city treasurer, the legislature can say so, and end the matter so far as his compensation for the future is concerned. This has not yet been done.</p>
    <p id="b230-7" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[249,1075,1187,863]]]'>The foregoing expresses our view of the law of this case. The fifth assignment was intended to reach the form of the proceeding below. The record shows that the plaintiff excepted to the order framing an issue. The assignment, however, only goes to the replication. It is too plain for argument that it was a mistake to have awarded an issue. There was .nothing but a question of lawr to be decided by the court. There were no disputed facts for a jury to try. Hence it was clear error to award an issue. Had the assignment of error been as broad as the exception, we would have been compelled to reverse the case. And while we might still do so, for the reason that the replication ordered by the court does not meet the plaintiff’s case, we can see no good reason why we should do so. It would only lead to further litigation, and as we have the question of law presented, although in a singularly indirect and inartificial manner, we have concluded, though not without hesitation, to decide the case as it stands.</p>
