Payment of back freight was a condition upon which the bill of lading was issued and goods shipped, and does not pass title to plaintiffs unless they comply with the condition, and does not avail them as evidence to show ownership of goods or title to them. The consignors or consignees might have objected to the shipment of the goods on this condition, and it would not have been binding, but having accepted the condition without objection it became part of the contract of affreightment.</p>

The consignors are Ashworth <em>&amp; Downey; </em>as to them the contract was good, so far as they were concerned, or so far as any property of theirs was concerned in the hands of the company, but the consignors could not pledge goods which they had already sold and to which they had parted with the title, for the payment of other debts due by them without special authority from the purchasers. If the sale had not been consummated and the title was in them, they could make such a contract, but the law does not permit one man to pay his debts with another man’s property. Such a contract would be void, as it is unreasonable and against public policy. So you <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>see, gentlemen, the chief points in the case are two: First, Were the goods sold either by Ashworth &amp; Downey, or by their commission merchant, Talcot, in New York, in the due course, of trade and in the usual way, unconditionally, with no special contract as to delivery other than that which is implied in all sales ? That is the first question. Second, Did the plaintiffs correct their mistake within a reasonable time ? If you find these points in favor of the plaintiffs they are entitled to your verdict. If you find them against them, the verdict should be for the defendants. As before stated you have nothing to do with the dispute between Talcot and the plaintiffs, as to which of them held the title. If either of them held the title to these goods at the date of the shipment, it makes no difference to you which one sues; they have settled that matter between themselves. Bacharach, Loeb &amp; Co. are here as plaintiffs, affirming their contract and claiming title to these goods. The only two questions for you are those before stated; first, was the sale a regular one in good faith, in due course of trade; an unconditional sale, without any other than the usual conditions of sale. If it was, then the title passed to the purchasers, not at the moment of the shipment on the boat, but as soon as the goods left the manufacturers’ house; as soon as they were packed up, boxed and set apart they were at the purchasers’ risk and were the purchasers’ goods. The mere fact that directions had been given to send them to Philadelphia, New York or any other place, does not change the title, but if there was a special agreement at the time the contract was made or an understanding that the goods be received in Philadelphia, then it would be otherwise. The second question, as I said before, is, was the refusal to receive the goods a mistake corrected within due time, within a reasonable time ? If it was, then it was the duty of the freight house to deliver the goods on the correction of it.3.....</p>

The learned court below very correctly and fairly left to the jury the only questions of fact which could affect the determination of the case, and those questions were found for the plaintiffs. The goods were delivered to the carrier, consigned generally to the plaintiffs at Philadelphia, without any particular place of delivery being designated, and upon such a delivery to the carrier the title of Ashworth &amp; Downey certainly passed: Schumacher v. Eby, <a href="/pa/24/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="24 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="9505292" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0521-01">24 Pa. 521</a>; Phila. etc. R. Co. v.

It is true that the plaintiffs at first declined to receive them under the influence of a mistake, but as they promptly corrected it upon its discovery, and the goods were still in the hands of the defendant when the plaintiffs requested their delivery, on October 19th, and demanded it on November 3d, and no other rights had intervened, the situation was the same as if there had been no refusal. The 'action of the defendant in refusing delivery after the notice to deliver had been sent to them, was without excuse. The attempt to subject the goods to a lien for prior freights due from Ashworth &amp; Downey on other consignments was without legal right: Penna. R. Co. v. Am. Oil Works, <a href="/pa/126/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="126 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="968914" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0485-01">126 Pa. 485</a>. The bona fides of the sale to the plaintiffs was also submitted to the jury, and found for them. As to the <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>right of these plaintiffs to maintain the action there can be no question, and whether Taleot has an interest in their recovery is not a matter of any concern to the defendant, who is a mere carrier. The plaintiffs were the consignees, and, as against the carrier, they had a clear right of recovery, after their notice to deliver the goods and a refusal by the carrier. There is no error in the answers to the eighth and ninth points of the defendants, when read together, as they should be. Of course, Morton &amp; Black have no title under the constable’s sale.</p>
