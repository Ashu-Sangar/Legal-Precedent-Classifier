Rule of Court 42, gave five days from that date for presenting exceptions to the auditor for his consideration. No exceptions were filed before him, although his report was placed in the possession of W. F. Shepherd, Esq., at the same date he was notified of its completion. The auditor waited till October 29th, and then filed his report. Mr. Shepherd, who represents the only contestants, appears to have filed exceptions with the clerk of the court on November 8, 1888. It is a part of the rule of court above referred to, that no <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>exceptions will be noticed by the court, unless specially allowed for good cause, that were not filed before the auditor. In this case, the exceptions were not specially allowed, nor does an examination of the auditor’s report convince us that there is any good cause for their existence. Fairness to the auditor, (and to the court as well), required that he should have the opportunity of examining and reporting upon them, in the light of the voluminous evidence before him. And now, December 24, 1888, the report of the auditor is confirmed.</p>
