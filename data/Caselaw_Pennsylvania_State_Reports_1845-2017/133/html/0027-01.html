It was given for a debt of $1,500 to II. F. Mark by D. R. Speck, as principal, and William Ulrich and John II. Speck, as sureties. When entered, it became a first lien upon two tracts of land then owned by Ulrich, and certain real estate owned by John H. Speck. On March 6,1888, Ulrich conveyed one tract to Daniel Roebuck, the petitioner, for $550, and received the purchase money in full, shortly afterwards conveying the other tract to Samuel Fry for $5,865. On April 3, 1888, Mark assigned the judgment to Fry, who on May 1st assigned it to David M. Rank, the present use plaintiff. On April 5th, John II. Speck paid $500 on account of the debt. On May 15th, Rank released the land conveyed to Fry by Ulrich from the lien of the judgment, and on June 11th the present fieri facias was issued and levied upon the tract sold by Ulrich to Roebuck. Both Ulrich and D. R. Speck are insolvent. Roebuck now asks us to relieve his land, and to compel the plaintiff to make his money out of the personal or real property of John II. Speck, mainly on the ground that the release of May 15th was such an injury to his rights as to wholly relieve him from liability.</p>

So far as appears, Rank had no knowledge who was the principal in the bond and who were the sureties, nor did either Mark or Rank have any knowledge of the sale by Ulrich to Roebuck. Upon this important fact of notice, there is no evidence whatever. It seems clear enough, therefore, that Rank might treat the three signers as principals, if he chose, and might release a portion of the property owned by one of them if he saw fit to do so. Not knowing their several rights, so far as appears, he might do with his own what he pleased, and if thereby he hurt the petitioner seriously, the latter has no one to blame but himself. A judgment creditor is not bound to search for subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers: it is their duty to warn him of their rights, if they intend to hold him responsible for future injury thereto. As is said in Mcllvain v. Mut. Assurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=93%20Pa.%2034" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="93 Pa. 34">93 Pa. 34</a>, “ A mortgagee may, at the request of the mortgagor, release part or the whole of the mortgaged premises, without inquiring whether a junior encumbrancer has intervened. It is the duty of the latter, if he intends to claim an <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>equity through, the prior encumbrance to give the holder notice, so that he may act with his own understanding^, and if he fails to do so the consequences of his neglect must be visited on himself.” See also Horning’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=90%20Pa.%20391" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="90 Pa. 391">90 Pa. 391</a>; Conrad’s App., 11 W.

Rank on November 18, 1888, when he issued the alias fieri facias, that he had so informed Fry, and that if he, Rank, would not pursue the lien he had by reason of the issuance of the fieri facias on the personal property of John H. Speck, which was sufficient to pay the debt in full, he would hold himself relieved from all liability; praying the court, upon the foregoing averments, “to grant him a rule on D. M. Rank, John H. Speck and Daniel Roebuck to show cause why David M. Rank should not levy the remainder of said debt due on judgment No. 58 August Term 1886, from the personal property and real estate of the other two defendants in the judgment ; why the levy made and the inquisition had on the real estate of Daniel Roebuck under alias fieri facias No. 30 De<a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>cember Term 1888, should not be set aside and the plaintiff restrained from levying again upon the property of this petitioner or the real estate of Daniel Roebuck, his grantee; or, to grant him a rule on D.

Speck, and not a co-surety with him for Daniel R. Speck. The fact was found to be otherwise, however, in an earlier stage of this proceeding before he became a formal party on the record, and we now re-affinn that finding. It is therefore of little consequence that he denied the fact and <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>gave Fry notice of his denial. His denial and notice did not establish his claim; they simply made it known to Fry, so that he was obliged to take the risk of its being well founded, and must now go for nothing since the claim itself has not been made out.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b52-6" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[260,617,1173,506]]]'>Further, there is no proof that Rank, who released the Fry farm, had then any notice of Ulrich’s claim. It is true, that the assignee of a bond takes it subject to any defence which the obligor may have against the obligee, but this rule does not govern the case in hand. Ulrich’s claim is not a defence against Mark, t*he obligor; it is an equity alleged to exist between himself and another obligor, and about this Rank was not bound to inquire. Fry’s knowledge of the claim did not bind Rank, who took the bond subject only to such defences as might be made to the instrument itself.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b52-7" data-blocks='[["BL_52.5",52,[260,1129,1174,1015]]]'>But, even if Fry’s knowledge of Ulrich’s claim is to be imputed to Rank, it still remains true that the claim has not been proved, and the situation would then be this: Rank, with imputed knowledge that Ulrich was a co-surety with John H. Speck, (for he could only be bound by the fact, and not by Ulrich’s claim, opposed to the fact,) released certain realty of Ulrich, having- already received from Speck $500 on account of the debt, and is now seeking to collect about the same amount from Ulrich’s remaining property. No injury, therefore, was done to Ulrich by the release, which relieved a part of his land of a burden, and he is now asked to contribute only the same amount as has already been paid by his co-surety. If he had already sold the remainder of his land to Roebuck, by an unrecorded deed, and may be obliged to indemnify him for its loss, this comes to the same result as if the land were still his own. Upon Roebuck’s petition, decided November 1, 1888, upon the facts then before us, no ground whatever for interference was shown. The subsequent petitions to which Ulrich is a party, add the fact of notice to Fry, but for reasons given above do not justify us in controlling the execution. Rule discharged.</p>
