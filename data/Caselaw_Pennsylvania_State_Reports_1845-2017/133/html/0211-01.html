His mental condition was bad. He showed this by his talking. He recognized witness when he went in, but after he had been there an hour, lost sight of his presence. Complained of his head and lungs. Had a hurt on the head, a slight wound. Said he was very sick, and wanted relief. Was given medicine ; was conscious at brief intervals; talked but little and that”to himself ; was delirious, out of his head. Afterwards, this was more marked until he lost consciousness before he died. His mind and memory seemed to have failed him entirely almost from May 19th. His mind seemed to be wandering, disturbed, and <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>be was unfit to transact any business of any kind or character.

His pulse was 180 to 140, and his tongue black and dry. Previous to the illness the doctor had observed him to act strange. In his opinion, from what he saw of Mr. Lillibridge, between May 19, 1869, and the time of his death June 6,1869, he was just as “ incompetent and incapacitated as a cat ” to transact any business.</p>

First went there about the 21st or 22d of May. Deceased was very sick lying in bed; big spot on the side of the head; he looked like a man in his last sickness, as though he was stricken with death. Had high fever and great difficulty in breathing. Did not talk much. When witness first went into the room, deceased said he was glad to see him; said he was glad to see somebody around the house that was quiet; said the folks around the house had been going around the house with their eyes stuck out of their heads, as though they were wild; glad to see some one who was not excited. Witness was with deceased mostly during the day time. He had typhoid pneumonia, and was under the control of the disease physically and mentally. Slept a great deal during the day, and when not asleep seemed to be in distress. Did not talk except to answer a question or ask one, and very little of that. A good deal of the time his mind was not clear. Asked one day how many children witness had. Witness is husband of one of the daughters of deceased. One day he spoke about Deacon Young, who had died in the same room in which he, Lillibridge, was, some four or five years before that. Does not recall anything more, particularly. The two cases given are a fair illustration of what deceased said when talking to himself. There was no sense to his talk at such times. In the opinion of the witness, the deceased was not capable of transacting any business requiring the exercise of his mental faculties, while he was there.</p>

In other words, Mr. Lillibridge did not divide up and distribute his property as Mr. Callender would have done.

It is difficult to measure the amount of testimony that may he lost by death during such a period; it is almost equally difficult to ascertain how much, and to what extent, the testimony of well-meaning surviving witnesses may he affected by loss of memory. It may not be impossible to test a testator’s testamentary capacity by wbat witnesses remember about him twenty years ago, but sucb a lapse of time certainly renders it more difficult, and therefore more unsafe. We do not think a trial judge would be justified in sustaining a verdict against this will upon this testimony, and if a verdict in favor of the contestants ought not to be sustained, the issue should not bo granted.</p>
