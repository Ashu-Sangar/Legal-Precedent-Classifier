She was divorced from her husband on August 12,1876, thereafter assumed her maiden name, and died on February 23, 1886. In March, 1878, she owned a small frame house and lot of ground on the west side of Eleventh street, north of Washington street.

Elizabeth Rightmyer’s life-estate and Margaret Riglitmyer’s right to live there one year after the termination of the said life-estate. The only witness who was competent to testify, who placed a high valuation on it, was Leander Rightmyer, who is a' brother of Mrs. Bennethum and who displayed a great deal of bitterness, and valued the corner property at $2,500, an amount which was beyond all reason in the year 1878. The master has examined the premises himself, and he doubts, if now, with the life-estate terminated, whether it would even bring $800.</p>

This leaves open only the question of fraud, and this has been found against the appellants by the master, which finding has been approved by the court below.
