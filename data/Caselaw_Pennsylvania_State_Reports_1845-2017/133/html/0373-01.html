    <p id="b397-4" data-blocks='[["BL_397.4",397,[161,441,1164,959]]]'>1. It is believed that the reason why the court entered judgment against the defendant notwithstanding his discharge in bankruptcy, was that he failed to plead the discharge in the suit brought in the New York court. But, as the present suit is based, not upon the New York judgment, but upon the agreement, and includes expenditures not embraced in the judgment, which is set out in the statement of claim merely as matter of inducement, the judgment should be eliminated from the case entirely, and this being so, there can be no doubt respecting the effect of the discharge in bankruptcy. Under §§19 and 34 of the Bankrupt Act of 1867, §§ 5067-72, 5119, U. S. Rev. St., all liabilities, other than those created by fraud or embezzlement,' are provable against the bankrupt’s estate and are embraced within the operation of his discharge, although they may not yet be payable, or may be contingent in their character. It would be vain to discharge a partner or joint debtor from his liability directly to the creditor, if he were to be subjected to the same liability, for the same claims, to the other partner or joint debtor.</p>

The contingent liability of this defendant to the plaintiff for his proportionate part of any losses which the latter might be compelled to pay, might have been valued and proved in the bankruptcy proceeding. If authority be needed for so plain a proposition, it may be found in Mace v. Wells, <a href="/us/48/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 How. 272" data-case-ids="6138348" data-case-paths="/us/48/0272-01">7 How. 272</a>. The cases of McMullin v.

At all events, that portion of the plaintiff’s claim which never formed a part of the judgment, must necessarily be treated as we have suggested; but the plaintiff himself has affirmed our position by treating the whole of the claim alike. The failure to plead the discharge did not affect the plaintiff; he would have remained liable for and would have paid the whole debt in any event.</p>

When the suit was again started, over ten years after its institution, and nearly nine years after any step taken in it, he assumed to act on behalf of the other defendants. In view of the agency, thus voluntarily assumed, and of the confidence implied from the relationship of partners, it was his duty to make every defence possible; or, if he believedthat the interests clashed, to notify Duncan, so that, if necessary, he might retain separate counsel. He cannot now avail himself of his own failure to plead our defence. As we have explained, however, the question of Duncan’s liability to the former plaintiffs is not now involved. The question is, whether he is liable to Flanagan on his old contract.</p>

The plaintiff’s claim obviously does not fall within the provisions of any of the sections of the bankrupt act specifying the claims which may be proved against the bankrupt’s estate.

The plaintiff, the defendant, <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>and several others were parties to that agreement, and in it they all agreed that the charter of the steamship Francis Wright was accepted, and was “ for the account and risk of all concerned in the joint venture.” The owners of the Francis Wright brought the action in New York, in 1874, against the plaintiff, the defendant, and some of the other parties to the agreement, claiming the sum of $6,966.86, as a balance due for the charter and hire of the vessel during the joint venture mentioned in the agreement. For some unexplained reason, the case seems to have slumbered for nine years, and it was not until 1883 that the action was tried and resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs, and against four of the defendants, including the plaintiff and defendant in the present suit. The liability upon which that action was founded, and for which the judgment was recovered, arose exclusively from the agreement of 1872. It was therefore in existence at the time Duncan’s proceeding in bankruptcy was commenced, and at the time of the adjudication in 1878 and the discharge in 1881. We know of no reason why that liability could not have been proved against Duncan. It was, at least, a claim for unliquidated damages arising out of a contract, which is provided for by § 5067 of the Bankrupt Act.</p>
    <p id="b400-6" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[212,1485,1180,915]],["BL_401.1",401,[171,350,1172,762]]]'>In the affidavit of defence it is alleged that the defendant was informed that the New York suit had been abandoned, and that nearly nine years after the suit was commenced a supplemental complaint was filed to which Flanagan made answer, but never notified Duncan of it, and that he (Duncan) had no knowledge of it; and, also, that the suit was tried practically on the supplemental complaint and answer. The affidavit also alleges that Flanagan was represented in that suit by Benedict, Taft &amp; Benedict, New York lawyers, who undertook to appear for all of the defendants, and who were aware that Duncan had been adjudged a bankrupt; that, subsequently to his discharge, Flanagan and the lawyers ignored him, and undertook the conduct of the case ; and that it was the duty of the lawyers to have pleaded Duncan’s discharge while assuming to act for him. The affidavit further charges Flanagan with having renewed the proceedings in 1883 without notice to or knowledge by Duncan, and without having given him an opportunity to plead his discharge. As Flanagan now seeks to <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>recover, in this action against Duncan, upon the equitable principle o£ contribution, it is necessary that his hands should be clean. His good faith is impugned by the facts alleged in the affidavit of defence, which we must assume to be true; and, as those facts tend to show that he acted in bad faith in so conducting the defence in the New York suit that a judgment was recovered against Duncan which might have been prevented by pleading the discharge of the latter, and in giving Duncan no opportunity to plead the discharge himself, he is certainly not entitled to judgment in this action for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. The defendant has a right to be heard by a jury upon his allegations of fact. Whether the defendant can plead his discharge against the present claim of the plaintiff, is a question which can be determined on the trial,' after all the facts on both sides are brought out.</p>
