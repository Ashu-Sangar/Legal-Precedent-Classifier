If you believe, however, that this is not the case, and that the lot was not purchased upon the credit of the separate estate of Mrs. Dinan, then you will proceed to the consideration of another question: Did this claim, for which Perrine &amp; Co. obtained judgment against Michael Dinan, exist as a credit prior to the time that the lot was acquired and the building erected by Mrs. Dinan ? [ Because, if Michael Dinan put his own money into that property, and the property was acquired by Mrs. Dinan because of Michael Dinan’s purchase of the property and his gift to her either of the property or the money with which to purchase the property and erect the building, it is a good title in Mrs. Dinan, unless it was done for the purpose of defrauding creditors;] 16 that is to say, gentlemen, either one of yon would have a perfect right to give any property which you possess to your wife, and she would take a good title as against all the world, except as against existing creditors, or unless it were done for the purpose of defrauding future creditors. As long as the gift to the wife is made in good faith, no one, except a creditor whose claim is in existence at the time, can call the gift in question. A man has a perfect right to buy property and give it to his wife, and she takes a good title to the <em>property; </em>and the creditor whose claim is created subsequent to the gift cannot successfully question or disturb the title of the wife, unless he proves that the gift to the wife was for the very purpose of defrauding creditors.</p>

That would be a void transaction. But, unless I contemplate some such fraud as that, I have, a perfect right to give all my property to my wife and children, and nobody can successfully question it unless they prove that such fraud is contemplated, except in the case of an existing creditor at the time of the transfer. [Even though you may believe that Michael Dinan’s money paid for this property, and that his money went into the erection of this building, and that he gave the title to his wife as a gift to her, nevertheless it is a good title in her as against any future creditors, unless the transfer to Mrs. Dinan was not made in good faith, but was made to her for the very purpose of defeating future creditors.] 18.....</p>

[So, if you find that Mrs. Dinan owned this lot herself, and that Mrs. Dinan contributed the greater part of the money towards the erection of this building, and you should find that Michael Dinan contributed some of the money, and you must find that from the testimony, nevertheless it would be a good title in her, ■ and the plaintiffs would not have a right to recover, unless you believe from the testimony that at the time he contributed that money toward the purchase of the lot or toward the erection of the building, this claim of Perrine &amp; Co. was a living, existing indebtedness, or unless you believe that the money was put in the property for the purpose of defeating future creditors for contemplated indebtedness.] 19.....</p>
