As was said in Bodine v. Glading, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%2053" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="21 Pa. 53">21 Pa. 53</a>: “Both parties must, by the agreement, have a right to compel specific performance; otherwise, it would follow that the court would decree a specific performance when the party called upon to perform it might <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>be in this situation, that if the agreement was disadvantageous to him he would be liable to the performance, and <em>yet if </em>advantageous to him he could not compel a performance.” And in Meason v. Kaine, <a href="/pa/68/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="68 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1024582" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0340-01">68 Pa. 340</a>, the court say: “ One of the fundamental principles adopted by courts of equity in bills for specific performance, is that there must be mutuality of remedy. Both parties must have a right to a decree.” See, also, New-ell’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=100%20Pa.%20518" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="100 Pa. 518">100 Pa. 518</a>, where Bodine v. Grlading is recognized as authority. Another rule upon this subject is thus stated in Hammer v. McEldowney, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20Pa.%20336" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="46 Pa. 336">46 Pa. 336</a>: “ It is a settled rule in equity, that the specific performance of a contract will not be decreed, unless its terms are clear and capable of ascertainment from the instrument itself.” To the same effect is Backus’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=58%20Pa.%20195" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="58 Pa. 195">58 Pa. 195</a>: “An agi’eement to be carried into specific performance ought to be certain, fair, and just in all its parts.” <em>We </em>also refer to Waterman on Specif. Perf., ch. III. and VI. Tested by these rules, the bill before us cannot be sustained, because the contract sought to be enforced is, in some material parts, too vague and uncertain, and because, therefore, the remedy here is not mutual.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[263,1383,1171,1009]],["BL_89.1",89,[172,361,1158,144]]]'>The contract is too vague and uncertain, because the consideration agreed to be given to March is not sufficiently determined. He agrees to accept from a corporation thereafter to be organized, “ securities thereof for my judgment, interest, costs, franchises, rights, and property, and a contract for the construction of a part of said road.” But the contract does not inform us what securities are meant, whether bonds alone,, or stock alone, or bonds and stocks together; or, in the latter event, what proportion of each. Neither do we know at what rate these securities are to be accepted, whether at par, at a premium, or at a discount; or, whatever be the rate, to what amount they are to be given. In reference to the construction contract, we have as little information. We do not even know between what points the South Mountain Railroad is to run; the length of the road which the defendant is to be allowed to build, and the situation of this section and the price he is to receive for the work are equally undetermined. It may very well be, that under the circumstances, the consideration could not have been more precisely specified. As to this we cannot speak; the fact certainly is, that such gen<a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>eral terms are used that no definite conclusion upon this matter can possibly be reached. In other words, the contract is one which the defendant cannot specifically enforce.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[173,513,1159,759]]]'>The contract is too uncertain also, because of the doubt whether the plaintiffs ever will be in a situation to carry out its provisions. Assuming that the plaintiffs are personally bound to March, how can it be said with certainty, or even with sufficient probability, that the proposed corporation will be organized by them or in their interest? They desire to use March’s judgment in order to sell the franchises of the road, expecting to buy them at the sheriff’s sale, to reorganize under existing legislation, and thus, and not otherwise, to be in a position to give March his securities and award him his construction contract. But suppose, as may readily happen, that other persons buy at the sheriff’s sale and organize a corporation from which the plaintiffs are wholly excluded; how then could March compel specific performance by the plaintiffs, whatever his legal rights under the contract might be ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-6" data-blocks='[["BL_89.5",89,[172,1281,1161,490]]]'>Assuming, however, that the proposed corporation is organized by the plaintiffs, or in their interest, and that the contract in question is held to bind the corporation as far as it now binds the plaintiffs, could March compel the company to deliver securities to him and award him a construction contract? Obviously, the uncertainty already referred to, as surrounding both these matters, would still exist, and would be fatal to his bill for this purpose against whomsoever it might be brought, and he would be turned over to whatever legal rights he might be found to have.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-7" data-blocks='[["BL_89.6",89,[173,1789,1159,449]]]'>Without further elaboration, it seems to follow that, if the considerations thus briefly indicated are well founded, the remedy by specific performance upon this contract is not mutual, and therefore that the bill must be dismissed. In this view of the case, it is unnecessary to discuss the other question suggested and we intimate no opinion thereon. We simply decide, that because of the uncertainties above referred to and the consequent lack of mutuality in the remedy, this proceeding cannot be maintained.</p>
