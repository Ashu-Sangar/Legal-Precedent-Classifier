It never could have been contemplated that this fund should be used for other alien purposes.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[149,708,1166,494]]]'>We have heretofore considered the matter as if insanity was a case of “accident, sickness, distress or disability.” That it is all of this, in some sense, is undoubtedly true. But was it intended to bo one of the calamities for which they provided?

Insanity is not considered L a “ sickness ” by men generally, and disability, among workingmen, is a physical injury which interferes with their ability to perform labor.</p>

Article IX. requires the stewards to visit the sick weekly, and pay them and take their receipts. All these requirements indicate a sickness or disability which is consistent with a mental capacity to perform them.

The opinion of the court below starts out with the assumption that McAneny ceased to be a member when he became sick, because he was thereby prevented from performing any of the duties of membership and. dues could not be exacted from him. This assumption is against all the decided cases. The only duty that can be exacted from a sick member is the payment of his dues, and a failure to pay them would not be excused on the ground of insanity, because payment is an act that can be performed by another person for the beneficiary: Hawshaw v. Supreme Lodge, <a href="/f/29/0770-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="29 F. 770" data-case-ids="3765388" data-case-paths="/f/29/0770-01">29 Fed. R. 770</a>; Wheeler v.

    <p id="b168-7" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[286,1180,1176,758]]]'>2. The argument that payment of benefits would not aid the insane member, but would go to his creditors or heirs, is unsound. When he became insane, he did not lose his physical existence, and the benefits are needed to supply his physical wants. As his relatives were unable to provide for these, he was committed to the state hospital for the insane; but the state should not be compelled 'to aid him, as it is the duty of the association to do so under its contract. It has never been doubted that insanity is a sickness entitling a member of such a society to sick benefits: Burton v. Eyden, L. R. 8 Q. B. 295; Kelley v. Hibernians, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Daly%20292" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="9 Daly 292">9 Daly 292</a> ; Niblack on Mutual Benefit Societies, § 173.

The court below, however, held that by the amended bylaw, § 1, of article XIII., which was passed some five months after McAneny became entitled to benefits, the association intended to exclude insanity. It is difficult to understand how such a construction can be placed upon it as to exclude from benefits a member whose sickness or disability, although permanent, is of such a nature as to prevent his following any occupation whatsoever. McAneny was admittedly unable, during the period for which benefits are here claimed, to follow his <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>usual calling or any other. But, if it were possible to hold that insanity were intended to be excluded by this by-law, it would be void as applied to McAneny, since his rights were vested on September 9, 1883, and he was no party to the amendment. It has never been doubted that a committee is the proper person to sue for moneys due the lunatic.</p>

    <p id="b169-6" data-blocks='[["BL_169.5",169,[157,762,1161,653]]]'>1. As McAneny became a member of the association on September 9, 1883, and became insane in April, 1884, he had not been a member for the period of one year, and was not entitled to benefits. Nor can it be said that he continued a member by reason of some other person paying his dues for him, for a lunatic cannot be a member. He cannot perform his duties as such. He cannot answer roll-call so as to pay his dues, as required by § 1-4 of by-law II. nor can any one answer for him. He thus becomes in arrears, and after six months shall be dropped from the roll; and no excuse whatsoever shall be entertained : § 16, by-law II. Further, how can an insane man comply with the rules respecting applications for benefits, especially § 3 of by-law XIII. ?</p>
    <p id="b169-7" data-blocks='[["BL_169.6",169,[159,1424,1160,593]]]'>2. Moreover, it is not shown that the stewards were ever asked to take action in this case, and no decision by them in McAneny’s favor is shown. This suit is therefore barred by § 4 of by-law XVII. If McAneny could not recover as a sane man, by reason of failure to comply with the by-laws, why should he recover when insane ? If an insane member is to have a different rule from sane members, where is it in the constitution and by-laws ? It is of no importance, in this connection, whether insanity is sickness or not, because if it is, the member must comply with the law of the association on the subject of sick benefits, or he cannot recover, and McAneny has not done so.</p>

Scientific schools have been unable to decide it. Nine tenths of the insanity that exists is hereditaiy. Who can tell to which tenth McAneny’s belongs? None of the writers on the medical jurisprudence of insanity define any of its manifestations under the term sickness. Burton v. Eyden, L. R. 8 Q. B. 295, is the only case deciding that insan<a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>ity is sickness, and Niblack on Mutual Benefit Societies so defines it on the authority of that case alone. The funds of this association are not intended for a member’s creditors, nor for the benefit of any person else. Money cannot be paid for Mc-Aneny’s benefit. The state has no claim on the association. The error of the appellant’s argument lies in the supposition that sick benefits are weekly debts due by the association. Such is not the case; its relation to its members is not that of debtor and creditor: St. Patrick’s Beneficial Soc. v.

This disposes of a considerable part of the argument for the appellee, and leaves open to us only the question of law involved in the point reserved, whether insanity is sickness or disability, within the meaning of the contract.</p>
    <p id="b170-8" data-blocks='[["BL_170.7",170,[267,1280,1170,1111]],["BL_171.1",171,[188,354,1166,760]]]'>The operative words are contained in the following passages from the constitution and by-laws of the association: Constitution, article 9 : “ Every member.....who, through sickness or other disability, is unable to follow his usual business or some other occupation whereby he may earn a livelihood for himself and family, shall be entitled to such sums (as weekly benefits) as the by-laws shall specify; ” and by-laws, article 13, § 1: “ Any member, who, after twelve months’ membership, through sickness or disability is unable to follow his usual or some other business or occupation whatsoever.....shall receive,” etc. We cannot regard the meaning of this language as at all doubtful. That insanity is a sickness in some senses of the word is beyond question, and such legal authorities as appear to have considered the question hold that it is sickness within the meaning of such charters and articles of association as the defendant’s. Thus in Burton v. Eyden, L. R. 8 Q. B. 295, an action against a “ friendly society,” the English designation of associations like the present appellee, the words of the by-law were, “ during any sickness or accident that may befall him.” Blackburn, J., said: “ I am of opinion that lunacy is sickness, within the meaning of the rules of this society.....Insanity depends on the state of mind and body <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>of tile person......It certainly seems to me that lunacy is a sickness affecting the health of the body in such a way as to prevent a man’s ability of earning his livelihood. If it were not the intention to include it, the rules of the society should be framed so as expressly to exclude it.” And Quain, J., said further: “ I am also of opinion that insanity is sickness within the society’s rules.....The words entitling the member to relief are, ‘during any sickness or accident,’ except certain excluded cases, insanity not being one.” In Kelly v. Ancient Order, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Daly%20292" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Daly 292">9 Daly 292</a>, Van Brunt, J., says: “Insanity has always been considered a disease, and comes strictly within the meaning of the term sickness.” And in Pellazzino v. St. Joseph’s Society, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Cin.%20L.%20Bull.%2027" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="16 Cin. L. Bull. 27">16 Cin. Law Bul. 27</a>, it is assumed by Harmon, J., apparently without question by either party, that insanity entitles a member of such society to sick benefits.</p>
    <p id="b171-6" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[188,1121,1165,1268]],["BL_172.1",172,[265,352,1170,351]]]'>But, even -if the extent of the word sickness were doubtful, the present case is relieved of all difficulty by the additional phrase “other disability.” The purpose of the association is defined by article II. of the constitution as the accumulation of a fund to enable the members “ to assist each other in cases of accident, sickness, or other distress, and their families in case of death.” The common class of those who are expected to need the benefits, is defined in article IX., as already said, as those who, through sickness or other disability, are unable to follow their usual or some other business, whereby they may earn a livelihood for themselves and their families. To this class is added another in article X., to wit, the families of members who die, and members themselves whose wives die. The latter are clearly examples of that pecuniary distress which is enumerated in the constitution among the ills which it is the object to relieve. But the main idea, throughout, is the assistance of those who are incapacitated for earning their living, and the condition that the incapacity shall be from “ sickness or other disability ” is as comprehensive as language could well make it. If insanity is not sickness, it is certainly disability, and clearly within the prescribed condition for aid. Certain excepted cases are specified, but not only is insanity not one of them, but all of those which are thus specified, such as want of membership for twelve months, arrearages to the association, or sickness originating from intemperance, vicious or immoral <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>conduct, either fail in some necessary requirement, or bear some taint of fault which takes them out of the category of the innocent unfortunate for whom the relief is intended. If any of these exceptional facts were charged against the plaintiff, the verdict of the jury has settled them in his favor, and there is no reason shown why he should not have the relief to which under the rules of the association his disability entitles him.</p>
    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[526,711,909,84]]]'>Judgment reversed, and now judgment for plaintiff on the verdict.</p>
