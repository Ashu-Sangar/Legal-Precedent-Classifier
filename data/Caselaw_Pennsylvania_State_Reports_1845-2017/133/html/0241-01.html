Reid mentioned in said letter was a shipper of wool, doing business in Montana territory. It was known to the plaintiff that the business referred to in said letter consisted in the shipping of wool by said Reid to the defendants for sale on commission. It was a fact also well known to the plaintiff that said business was conducted usually as follows, viz.: The shipper would ship the wool to his commission merchant and draw on the latter for an amount from two thirds to three quarters of the selling value of the wool, at the time of its arrival at the place of business of the commission merchant. The commission merchant would make advances on said wool, by paying said drafts, providing they did not exceed a reasonable amount, which was understood in the trade to be an amount never exceeding three fourths of the said selling value of the wool. It was well understood by the plaintiff that the drafts to be honored by the defendants were to be honored upon the security of the wool, bills of lading for which were attached to the drafts, and were not to exceed in amount the customary advances upon such wool.</p>

When the drafts and bills of lading were presented to the defendants, they refused for this reason either to accept the wool or honor the drafts, and the wool was subsequently sold on behalf of the plaintiff at its full value, and the plaintiff received the proceeds. The amount for which plaintiff now claims to recover is the excess of said drafts over the full value of the wool. Defendants never agreed to accept drafts to any extent to which Reid might draw, but only to accept drafts in the course of the business referred to in their letter, and in accordance with the custom of the said business already mentioned, which custom was well known to plaintiff.”</p>

Reid was a shipper of wool, doing business at Butte, Montana. On May 23, 1887, the defendants wrote to the plaintiff as follows: “We expect to have some business with Mr. James R. Reid when the wool season opens, in which <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>case we will honor his drafts with bill lading attached.” On August 12, 1887, the plaintiff cashed Reid’s draft on the defendants for $4,007.80, with bill of lading attached for 22,285 lbs. of wool, shipped by Reid to defendants at Philadelphia, and on the next day a like draft for $2,752.97, with a like bill of lading attached for 14,951 lbs. of wool. The defendants refused to honor these drafts, or to receive the wool described in the bills of lading attached, on the ground that Reid, in drawing drafts for these amounts, had exceeded his authority. The drafts with the bills of lading attached were returned to the plaintiff, and at Reid’s instance the bills of lading were forwarded to Justice, Bateman &amp; Co., wool merchants in Philadelphia, who had them indorsed by the consignees, delivered them to the carrier, received the wool described in them, and sold it in the market for its full value. The proceeds of this sale were received by the plaintiff, and were $1,480.82 less than the amount called for by the drafts. This action was brought to recover the difference.</p>

The usage described in the affidavit is not unreasonable, or in conflict with positive law. It does not contradict the terms of the instrument on which the plaintiff relies, but it explains them, and gives effect to the intention of the parties. The letter of the defendants must be read in the light of the usage known to the parties, and applicable to the transaction between them. When so read, it is fatal to the plaintiff’s claim for the overdraft. We think the affidavit presents a good defence to the action.</p>
