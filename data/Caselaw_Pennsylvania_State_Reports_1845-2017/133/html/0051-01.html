These bequests are generally placed in the hands of a trustee, so that the cestui que trust cannot touch or control the principal sum, but will have a certain annual income. It is frequently called a spendthrift’s trust, the object being to provide annually for the unfortunate, the improvident, or the spendthrift; and if this sum, so placed in the hands of a trustee, and interest thereon arising, can be secured from the creditors of the cestui que trust, we see no reason why a testator cannot provide that the share given to one shall not be subject to attachment or liability for debts; otherwise, the intention of a testator is disregarded, and, as we have just seen in Rick’s Appeal, the plainly expressed intention of the testator must prevail.</p>

There may be doubt whether the bequest is in the best legal form for the protection of the beneficiary. The testatrix expressly declares that the share of her estate, bequeathed to her step-daughter, “is in consideration of work done and faithful attendance upon me during my illness.” ’ Hence, she provides that her bounty shall not be liable to be attached or seized for any debts of her step-daughter, but that the whole amount thereof should be paid directly to said Elizabeth Beck by the executor named in the will. In this she did no wrong to Winfield Hendricks, a creditor of her beneficiary. The testatrix was under no obligation, moral or legal, to pay, or to permit her estate to pay, the judgment on which Hendricks has issued his attachment. To allow him to succeed in taking away the money of the testatrix bequeathed to her step-daughter, would defeat the very purpose of the will.</p>

The will provided that the share bequeathed to the son should not be subject to execution, attachment or sequestration, for any debts or liabilities whatever. The Supreme Court said :The testator made no distinction between the character of the obligations which might rest on George, the beneficiary. He designed to cover all obligations, legal, equitable and moral. If we depart from <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>the clearly expressed will of the testator in this respect, we make a new will instead of enforcing the one he made.”</p>

But in the case in hand, the intention of the testatrix is so plainly expressed that a refusal to carry it out would be to take from her the control of her own property; to disregard substance for form.

Duffield, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Pa.%20279" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="12 Pa. 279">12 Pa. 279</a>, said: “There is such flagrant injustice in applying the bounty of a testator to the benefit of those for whom it was not intended, that the mind revolts from it.” That eminent jurist characterized it as a fraud upon the testator, that his property should be diverted from the objects of his bounty to other parties whom he did not have in contemplation.</p>

In all the cases cited by the auditor in support of his erroneous ruling, either the legacies were contingent, or else a properly framed trust had been created and the title to the funds or property was vested in trustees. All that those cases decide is, that when the title is vested in trustees, with a discretion as to the time and manner of payment, as the cestuis que trust cannot compel payment to themselves, neither can their attaching creditors, who claim under them, compel payment. The cases cited by the court below likewise have no application, either in their facts or their principles, to the case at bar ; and the court is in error in speaking of this money as the property of the testatrix or her estate. It is the property of the legatee, and the control of the testatrix over it ceased as soon as the title vested in the legatee. The uniform rule, in such cases, is that the legacy is attachable, and in cases of trust, where the courts have decided against attach ability, they have done so, not because of a declaration against liability, but because of a discretion vested in the trustee.</p>

Guillou, <a href="/pa/100/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="100 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="498462" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0254-01">100 Pa. 254</a>, construing language similar to that of the present will, clearly shows the unsoundness of the argument that this money would be protected from execution in the hands of the legatee.</p>

The real point decided by the authorities cited for the appellant, as to the effect of an attachment, is that when the right to attach exists, the attaching creditor is entitled to recover from the garnishee just what the debtor would be, and no more. But in this case, the right to attach is the question to be determined, and these authorities do not touch it. The intention of the testatrix to place this money directly in the hands of the beneficiary must be carried out unless illegal: Rick’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=105%20Pa.%20535" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="105 Pa. 535">105 Pa. 535</a>.

Upon the point whether it is illegal, as being contrary to the policy of the law, a refer<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>ence to the contrast between the English law on the subject and our own, will render easier the application of the Pennsylvania eases to this will.</p>

In England, a trust giving the income of a fund to a beneficiary for life is considered as conferring a life-estate, subject to all the incidents of such an estate. But prohibition against alienation at any time before the property falls into possession, is enforced by the English courts if the gift is contingent: 2 Jarman on Wills, 538. In our state, neither of these rules was ever recognized; this court expressly declaring that it is not contrary to the policy of the law to permit a testator to protect a legacy from the beneficiary’s creditors: Fisher v. Taylor, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%2033" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="2 R. 33">2 R. 33</a>; Vaux v.

Thus, it appears that our courts are more liberal than those of England in protecting a gift of income for life, and it would seem that they ought to be as liberal in protecting a fund until it is paid over to the legatee.</p>

Johnston, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Pa.%20289" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="5 Pa. 289">5 Pa. 289</a>, brings this case within the English doctrine that the share may be protected until it comes into the possession of the donee ; for, as that decision establishes, limitations may here be imposed upon a gift, without resorting to a trust with a provision for a forfeiture.

But this court has uniformly held that the protection against attachment does not depend upon the creation of a trust, and the vesting in the trustee a discretion as to payment. In addition to the cases already cited, particular attention is directed to Stover’s App., <a href="/pa/77/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="77 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="436292" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0282-01">77 Pa. 282</a>, which clearly shows that <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>the testator has the right to direct the manner of payment, and that full effect will be given to his direction. What might have been the result if the legatee could have, and had, taken land instead of money, is immaterial, since it is money that she is claiming; but the will as a whole excluded her from any such choice, and confined her right to a share in the proceeds of sale. Moreover, the testimony shows that the legatee had a claim upon the estate for services, and the will declares that the legacy is given in consideration of work done. The money awarded her is therefore clearly wages, and wages are not attachable, whatever form the claim for them may assume : Penna. Coal Co. v.

    <p id="b79-6" data-blocks='[["BL_79.6",79,[160,1118,1163,696]]]'>Elizabeth Beck, the testator, in and by her last will and testament gave to her step-daughter, also named Elizabeth Beck, a one fourth interest in her estate, upon the following condition : “And whereas, the said Elizabeth Beck was unfortunate in business transactions, whereby she became indebted, part of which still remains unpaid, and having no means to pay the same, now it is my will that the above equal share in my estate, as well as the specific bequest given to her, are given to her expressly upon condition that they shall not be liable to be attached or seized for the debts or moneys which said Elizabeth Beck may owe at the time of my decease, but that the whole amount of her share shall be paid directly to said Elizabeth Beck by my executor, without diminution for the payment of her said indebtedness.”</p>
    <p id="b79-7" data-blocks='[["BL_79.7",79,[160,1833,1163,297]]]'>The share aforesaid has not yet been paid to the said legatee, for the reason that the appellant, who held a judgment against her, attached the fund in the hands of the executor. The learned court below held that the attachment would not bind the fund in the hands of the executor, and awarded it to the legatee. Prom this decree the attaching creditor has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b79-8" data-blocks='[["BL_79.8",79,[158,2138,1163,246]],["BL_80.1",80,[273,346,1169,503]]]'>No one doubts that it was competent for the testator to have placed this fund forever beyond the reach of the creditors of her legatee, by creating a trust for that purpose. This she has not done, and the question which arises is, whether she has protected the fund in its transit from the executor to the <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>legatee. That she had a right to do this must be conceded. Has she done so? We may dismiss from the case the learning about vested and contingent legacies. This was not, as was assumed by the learned counsel for appellant, an absolute gift of the property. It was a gift upon the express condition that, in the hands of her executor, it should not be liable to the debts of the legatee, but should “be paid directly to the said Elizabeth Beck by my executor, without diminution for the payment of her said indebtedness.” The executor was thus clothed with an express trust in regard to this share.</p>
    <p id="b80-6" data-blocks='[["BL_80.4",80,[274,857,1169,910]]]'>It is true, the trust would end the moment the money was paid to the legatee, but during the transit, while the money remained in his hands, it was as much protected from creditors as if a separate trust had been created for that purpose. It was the right of the testatrix to say that her estate should not go to pay her step-daughter’s creditors. She has said so as emphatically as language can express it, for the time that the money remains in the hands of her executor. Does the fact that she did not protect it further, by raising up another trustee of the fund, after it left the executor’s hands, destroy the trust she did create, and nullify the positive directions of the will that it should not be attached in transit? Why shall the will of the testator be defeated in this respect ? She had a right to do what she willed with her own. The creditors of her legatee had no claim upon her estate, and when she directed that the share should be paid to her step-daughter, and not to the creditors of the latter, who shall gainsay her ? The creditor is not injured, and has no right to complain.</p>
    <p id="b80-7" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[274,1774,1167,142]]]'>I have not discussed the authorities, because we have no case which precisely covers this; but, upon reason, and analogy to the decisions we have, this case must be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b80-8" data-blocks='[["BL_80.6",80,[534,1927,906,92]]]'>The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>
