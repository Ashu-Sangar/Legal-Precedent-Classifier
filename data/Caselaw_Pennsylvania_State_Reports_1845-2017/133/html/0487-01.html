Rothrock was elected controller of the city of Easton on the third Tuesday of February, 1887.

By reason of their non-acceptance of the act of 1874, they had a right to elect a treasurer of the school fund. This they did, electing the then city treasurer. They also had a right to elect an auditor; this they did when they elected the city controller to act for them in that capacity. The special act provides that the auditor shall be compensated for his services. What that amount may be, it is not necessary for us to consider here, as by the case stated it is agreed that if the controller is entitled to any compensation at all, he shall have judgment for $200.</p>

But we are not called upon here to- pass upon that question. The fact is, they did not accept the act of 1874, and were therefore not bound by its provisions. They exercised the right of election granted them by the special acts relating to that matter, and elected the plaintiff, who was the controller, to perforin those duties imposed by the special acts of assembly upon an auditor, and they are therefore bound to compensate him for such labor.</p>

      <em>Mr. William </em>Mutchler, for the appellant:</p>
    <p id="b510-7" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[262,654,1172,707]]]'>1. The court below seems to admit that, as city controller, acting under the municipal act of May 23, 1874, the plaintiff could not recover, but bases the judgment on the ground that he acted as borough auditor, and not as city controller. This was not the question submitted by the case stated, and none of the special acts relating to the public schools of Easton provide for compensation to auditors to be paid by the school district. The acceptance or non-acceptance of the act of 1874, by the district, has nothing to do with the question. The thirty-ninth section of the act makes it the imperative duty of the city controller to act for the school district. The proviso to § 41, relating to public schools, has no reference to city controllers, and applies only to cities in existence at the time of the passage of the act.</p>
    <p id="b510-8" data-blocks='[["BL_510.6",510,[259,1368,1170,500]]]'>2. Whatever services were rendered by the plaintiff were rendered in his capacity as controller. The performance of these services was made incumbent upon him by the act of 1874. That act also provides for his compensation by the city, to be fixed by ordinance, but omits any reference to the school district. In this state, the courts have always proceeded on the safe principle of requiring statutory authority for all claims upon the public treasury, and because of the absence of any such authority the claim of the plaintiff must fall: Lehigh Co. v. Semmel, <a href="/pa/124/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="124 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="563066" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0358-01">124 Pa. 358</a>; Wayne Co. v.

Moreover, the plaintiff’s right to recover depends upon the performance of his duties as controller for the school district, under the act of 1874. If that part of the act relating to school matters be unconstitutional, clearly he would have no standing to recover. The constitution forbids the passage of local or special laws relating to school districts; and school districts are separate quasi corporations, distinct from the general municipality: Dillon on Mun. Corp., §§ 22, 24; Wharton v. School D., <a href="/pa/42/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="42 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="481505" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0358-01">42 Pa. 358</a>. Neither does the title of the act of 1874 contain any reference to school matters, as is required by <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>the constitution, article III., § 3; Hatfield v.

      <em>Mr. Aaron Goldsmith, </em>for the appellee :</p>
    <p id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[203,559,1165,607]]]'>1. The power given by the act of March 27, 1873, P. L. 429, to appoint “ one person to be borough auditor,” was superseded when the borough of Easton became a city under the act of May 23, 1874, P. L. 230. Henee the school district was compelled to appoint its own auditor, otherwise its accounts could not have been audited and settled. It selected the plaintiff, not because it was his duty as city controller to perform such service, but because, as he was city controller, he was in a position to be better able to supervise and audit the accounts of the school treasurer, who was likewise city treasurer. The services having been performed solely for the school district, it must pay for them.</p>
    <p id="b511-7" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[203,1174,1166,605]]]'>2. The proviso to § 41 of the act of 1874, and all the other sections of that act, relating to the public schools, are unconstitutional : Penna. R. Co. v. Riblet, <a href="/pa/66/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="66 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="432510" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0164-01">66 Pa. 164</a>; Eby’s App., <a href="/pa/70/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="70 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1028184" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0311-01">70 Pa. 311</a>; Hatfield v.

This appears to be conceded by the defendant, and if true, all argument based upon that act must fall with it. This at one blow strikes down the position that by the act of 1874 it is the duty of the city controller to audit and settle the accounts of the school district. It was not, therefore, the duty of the city controller to perform such service, and the plaintiff having acted as the auditor of said district, is entitled to compensation for the same.</p>

L. 287, entitled “ An Act relating to Common Schools of the Borough of Easton.” It also appears that, by virtue of the several other acts referred to in the case stated, the said school district had the power to appoint an auditor or auditors to examine the accounts of the treasurer. The learned judge below states in his opinion that “ the special act provides that the auditor shall be compensated <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>for his services.” It was contended by the appellant that the learned judge was mistaken in this, and that all of the acts referred to omit any reference to compensation from the school district. This is certainly so as to the act of 1866. The other acts I have not examined, as they are not considei’ed to have any bearing upon the question now before us.</p>

The councils of said city, on April 12, 1887, enacted an ordinance fixing the compensation of the city controller. Henry A. Rothrock, the plaintiff above named, was duly elected controller, and entered upon the duties of his office on the first Monday of April, 1887. He declined to act as controller or auditor of the school district, whereupon the board of school directors passed a resolution declaring that it was his duty as city controller to audit said accounts. In pursuance of or obedience to this resolution, the plaintiff proceeded to audit the accounts of the school district, and this suit was brought to recover compensation therefor.</p>

If he cannot show such act, he cannot recover. The plaintiff’s compensation as city controller was fixed by ordinance of councils. As controller, he is entitled to the compensation thus fixed, and nothing more. But it was urged he was also auditor for the school board, and is entitled to compensation for services in that capacity. If we concede the facts, we might possibly concede the inference drawn from them by appellant. But he was never elected or appointed auditor for the school district. Instead of electing him auditor, the contention of the school board was that, as city controller, it was his duty to audit the accounts of the school district, and he acquiesced in that view so far as to audit said accounts. It is manifest that he never held the independent office of auditor of the school district, and it follows logically that he cannot claim compensation for performing the duties of an office which he never filled. We are not called upon to inquire, therefore, what, if any, compensation a duly-elected auditor would have been entitled to claim.</p>
