It would be a waste of time to discuss what we see so ably discussed in the opinion of Lewis, C. J., in the last-mentioned case.</p>
    <p id="b484-8" data-blocks='[["BL_484.8",484,[298,1029,1152,387]]]'>There are a number of legatees under the will of Isaac Brown Parker in this Commonwealth, and it being admitted that there are no debts to be paid in New Jersey, there is no reason whatever for sending the Pennsylvania assets there for distribution, especially as the same persons are accountants in both states. The rule against transmission when there are domestic claimants, creditors or legatees, is too firmly settled upon authority, and is not to be departed from or doubted. The auditor and court were entirely right in maintaining, as they did, this principle.</p>

    <p id="b484-10" data-blocks='[["BL_484.10",484,[298,1544,1161,904]]]'>Several English cases have been cited, and among them Bush <em>v. </em>Allen, 5 Mod. 63, and South <em>v. </em>Allen, Id. 101, in which trusts to executors are implied from provisions very similar to the case in hand, and it is not improbable that we might feel ourselves impelled to imply such a trust in this and cases like it, were it not that the legatees for life are placed on the footing of trustees for those in remainder, in regard to the thing, or the principal of the fund devised for life, by the 44th section of the Act 24th of February 1834. That act requires legatees to give security in the Orphans’ Court having jurisdiction of the account of the executors, to protect the interest of those in remainder, before the executors shall deliver the property or pay over the money to the legatees for life, and which security, like that of trustees by appointment, is liable to the supervision of the Orphans’ Court at all times. The existence of the law is a reason for inferring that no trust in the executors was contemplated by the testator in this case. But these considerations, while they persuade us, we will not say they rule our decision, for it rests also upon our own precedents. Our courts follow the rule, whenever it is applicable, that <em>“ </em>the bequest of the use of a thing, or the product or interest of a fund, is as a rule to be regarded as a bequest of the thing itself.”</p>

      <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>The bequests in question, although restricted in extent, are direct as to the <em>corpus. </em>They are: “I bequeath to her (the legatee) $50,000, the interest of which to be paid to her during life, and the principal to her children at her death.” This is a direct bequest of the principal for life, and is not to be overcome by the implication arising from the words “ to be paid” or “ shall be paid,” that it is to be paid by the executors, and thus continue their duties to an indefinite period. Implications often yield to counter implications, and always to positive and clear directions. These implicative words, or claimed to be such, seem to me to depend mainly on the use to which the interest is to go, rather than an implication of a trust. As the principal fund was necessarily intended to be invested in some way in order to produce an interest, it was not an uncommon mode of expression to say it was “ to be paid” to the legatee entitled to receive it. If invested, the interest would be paid by somebody to the party entitled, and in this sense we may regard the words to have been used, especially in the presence of the clear bequest of the fund to the legatee. The cases of Rodgers <em>v. </em>Rodgers, <a href="/watts/7/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="7 Watts 15" data-case-ids="1846766" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0015-01">7 Watts 15</a>, and Clevenstine’s Appeal, 3 Harris 495, are cases like the present; they were bequests of the principal, coupled with a trust, the interest to be enjoyed for life on giving security under the Act of Assembly to preserve the principal or property for children. The learned auditor was entirely right, therefore, in the view he took of these bequests, and in holding the principal payable to the legatees for life, on giving security, as required by the Act of Assembly.</p>
    <p id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[180,1586,1160,511]]]'>We see no good reason for setting aside the decree in this case on the ground that a credit of $14,802, uncollected bonds, in New Jersey, was not credited to their account in this state, instead of being included in their account in adjusting the proportions to be distributed under the account here. I see no difficulty in correcting that, in the account not yet settled in New Jersey, or in the final account of the executors. If they account for moneys of the estate here, strictly within the jurisdiction of the surrogate in New Jersey, there cannot be a doubt but that it would be allowed as a credit there, a final account of the New Jersey assets not having passed, and the executors and claimants being the same in both states.</p>

There being no exceptions to' the account, the court might have decided the questions of law in the ease without an auditor. Still we see nothing in the Acts of Assembly, applicable to the Orphans’ Court of this county, to prevent the appointment of an auditor or auditors to make distribution in the absence of exceptions ; while there is, in other parts <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>of the state, by the Act of 14th April 1835, § 1: Rhoads’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20187" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="3 Wright 187">3 Wright 187</a>. Even if we were in error as to this, the report of the auditor would not vitiate the décree predicated of it. The only redress would be to strike off the compensation allowed to the auditor. The business of the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia is so large that it is hardly possible for the court to get along without the aid of auditors, and we do not see that the court are confined to the cases where there are exceptions in appointing them; but unconscionable charges should be guarded against. The auditor should be allowed compensation according to his work, and not measured by the ability of the estate to pay.</p>
