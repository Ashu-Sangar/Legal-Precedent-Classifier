    <p class="summary" id="b292-11" data-blocks='[["BL_292.10",292,[287,880,1154,557]]]'>This was an action of trespass <em>d. </em>5. <em>a. </em>by John B. Kenyon against Philander Gould and others, issued May 12th 1866. The parties filed a case stated in the suit, which embodied these facts: — Gould, one of the defendants, and his wife, sued Kenyon the plaintiff in slander, and obtained a verdict, on which judgment was entered. An execution was issued on the judgment, and -divers goods of Kenyon were levied on, which were appraised at $271.50. Kenyon claimed the benefit of the exemption law, but the sheriff sold them under the execution. Amongst the goods were a' wagon, plough, cook-stove and pipe, horse and harness, &amp;c. . The question submitted to the court was whether the plaintiff (in this action) was entitled to recover for the whole or any part of the articles, &amp;c.</p>

Upon this judgment a writ of fi. fa. was issued, which was levied on personal • property. The defendant in the writ then made claim for the benefit of the exemption laws, which was disregarded, and the articles levied upon were sold by the sheriff. This seizure and sale are the trespass complained of; the plaintiff in this action alleging that he was entitled to claim the specific articles enumerated in the Act of 1828 as exempt from levy and sale, notwithstanding the fact that the judgment was obtained in an action <em>ex delicto. </em>The case stated therefore raises the question whether, since the Act of 1849, a defendant in an action founded upon ‘ tort’ has a right to hold any property as exempt from levy and sale for the damages recovered in such action. That no such right is conferred by the Act of 1849 is admitted. If it exists at all, it must be by virtue of some unrepealed provision of the earlier Acts of Assembly on the subject. The Act of 1828, Pamph. L. 285, entitled ‘An Act for the relief of the poor,’ provided for the exemption of certain specific articles, not only upon <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>execution issued for ‘ debt or rent,’ but also for <em>‘ </em>damages, except it be for damages done to real estate,’ &amp;c.</p>

And in the 26th section, the provisions of the Act of 1828 relating to exemptions were incorporated. The Act of 1849, in explicit terms, repeals the 26th section of the Act of 1836, as .also the 7th and 8th sections of the Act of 22d of April 1846, and provides a system of exemption, from which the provision relating to damages is omitted.</p>

It provided a system. The repeal of the 26th section, without more, would have struck the provisions relating to exemptions out of existence.</p>

It then expressly repeals the sections of the Acts of 1836 and 1846, which embodied the old system.</p>
