Harriet McCall died in 1848 and Catharine in 1859, both unmarried, whereby the whole title vested in Margaret in fee. Margaret by her will proved January 6th 1860, devised her real estate to her brother, Robert McCall, and her sister, Catharine McCall, during their joint lives and the life of the survivor, and the residue of her real estate to her nephews, Peter McCall, Harry McCall and George Read; Robert McCall and Catharine McCall died in the lifetime of Margaret McCall. On the 6th of April 1864, these three nephews conveyed to the plaintiff all their interest in the above lot; that the plaintiff is extending her messuage of the width of <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>24 feet to the depth of 98 feet, for the purpose of making the first and second stories into stores, one for making and selling millinery, &amp;c., and expects to have many females employed, who will be entitled to the privileges and privacy of the yard connected with the store; that the cost of the plaintiff’s premises and improvements is above $35,000 ; that she is entitled to use, &amp;c., the messuage, &amp;c., for her own benefit, enjoyment, &amp;c., for ever, so that she shall not he deprived or annoyed in such enjoyment, &amp;c., as the defendant claims he has a right to do, and threatens to continue to do, to the irreparable damage of the plaintiff and ruin of the value of said premises and business as thereafter set forth : that the defendant owns and occupies a lot adjoining the above-mentioned lot of the plaintiff; that before the death of Catharine McCall, and whilst the said life estates were subsisting, and the premises of the plaintiff were in the tenure of one A. Tompkins as tenant for years, the defendant, under the pretence that he intended to build a party-wall in accordance with law, entered on the plaintiff’s lot, laid the foundation and erected a wall of great length and thickness on the west side of the plaintiff’s lot northward from Sansom street, about 100 feet, of the height of one story, and knowing that there could be no owner of the fee of the lot during the life estates to call him to account, intending to build windows in the remaining stories of the building designed for a factory, and in abuse of the right allowed him by law to take part of the plaintiff’s ground as a rest for a party-wall, extended said wall five stories high under pretence of erecting a party-wall; and contrary to law inserted window-frames, sashes and vacant spaces in said wall, and hung window-shutters on the same or some of them wholly upon the ground of the plaintiff, to wit, four windows, frames and sashes in each of the four upper stories, and has maintained them to the injury of the plaintiff’s estate and discomfort of the occupants of her said premises, and has enjoyed an easement of the annual value to him of $300, which belongs to the plaintiff’s said premises ; that upon the plaintiff’s asking from defendant an acknowledgment of her right to the said wall so as to exclude any presumption from length of time, the defendant refused, and said het would close the windows; that the request to remove the windows has been frequently repeated and the defendant has refused, alleging that no one looks out of the windows, and that they afford the only light in the other part of the shop; and pretends that the wall and ground on which it stands is his; that the defendant insists that the plaintiff desires a lawsuit, and he has but the alternative to meet it; that the plaintiff will suffer in the user of the premises in having the domestic privacy of herself, family and those employed by her exposed to men, and the value of her premises consequently lessened; that to close the windows by her authority scaffolding and materials must be placed on her lot at <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>unreasonable cost, ‘which ought not to be imposed upon her by the defendant’s wrong; that the defendant pretends that the law relating to party-walls authorizes both the use of her ground for a rest, and also the making of many windows for workmen to ■work at, and overlook and constrain the doings of his neighbor so as to oblige her to build or to sell her premises at reduced rate to remove the nuisance without a lawsuit.

He further denied that he had taken advantage of the law to build on the plaintiff’s lot, so as to have the free use of it without cost, by erecting numerous windows in his building, and window-frames put partly on her ground and partly on his own ground, but averred that all the windows in his back building are almost if not entirely on his own ground, 'and not upon that which he had a right to take in using the said party-wall. He further averred that in 1856 he wished to extend his buildings on his own ground south from his main building on Chestnut street; that he employed an experienced builder to put up a brick building beginning on Sansom street, and extending on his lot to his front building; that the foundation was laid by measurement under the direction of the authorized officer of Philadelphia, in pursuance of the Act of Assembly regulating party-walls, and the builder laid the east wall over on the plaintiff’s lot according to the measurement of the officer, so that the owner of that could use it when she wished to build there; that he erected his back building on the foundation 100-feet long, the width of the lot, and five stories high. When the first story had been raised and put up about 20 feet, the builder put four windows in the second story, about 24 feet from the ground, and each story <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>four windows more, except one, so that there are fifteen windows; this was done by the builder without any direction from the defendant, the builder at the time saying to the defendant that when the owner of the east lot wished to use the party-wall, all the defendant need do would be to take out the window and sash, fill up their spaces with brick. He further averred that when the windows were put in by the workmen, Harry McCall, who claimed to be the owner of the house and lot now owned by the plaintiff, told the defendant that he had no objection to the windows being placed in the wall, but McCall or the owner of the lot should not be prevented from erecting a building on their lotj and the defendant should not claim any privilege from the use, to which the defendant agreed and now agrees, and so informed the plaintiff, that if she desires to use the party-wall, he is ready to put in the necessary brick, so that joists and girders may be put thereon, she paying the value of the party-wall, that he does not claim any easement in the lights. He denied that there were shutters on the east side of his building, or that the windows were constructed on the premises of the plaintiff, but averred that they were on his own lot. He further denied that he knew there was no one to call him to account as to the manner in which he was using the party-wall, but all the owners knew he was using it, and he believed all assented to it. He admitted that the plaintiff requested him to close up said windows, to which he replied he was ready to do so when she wished to use the party-wall, until which time he claims that he is not bound to close them, and denied that he had done or intended to do any injury to the plaintiff, or to her estate or property.</p>

The defendant was present whilst this was being done. “ According to the plan of the building it was a dead wall on the east, and made no provision for the spaces where the widows are.” Joseph Denegre, Jr., the superintendent of the building,, gave witness direction to leave spaces for windows to be put in thereafter. Witness said to him that windows could not be put into a party-wall. Dengre said they would put them in and take the brickwork out afterwards, and “they’ll not know anything about it.” Stein directed him to take out the bricks, and put in the window-frames.

L., p. 467.) “Proceeding with the east wall,” says Mr. Reynolds, the bricklayer, my orders were to leave out openings, to insert window-frames hereafter; as we went along with the wall, we walled up four inches, the outside of the window spaces. I ran up four inches of brickwork, the outside of the wall, where window frames were to go, and left nine inches of brickwork out, where the window-frames were to go ; this was done in each story, except the first. I was directed after the roof was on, and the floors laid, to go up there and take out those four inches of bricks, to put window-frames in; they were working there, the carpenters, when I went there to take out the bricks. They made the window-frames out of scantling, and I put them in each story; there were no sills that I remember put in; they were just scantling joined together; some of the frames were there when I went to take out the bricks, and some were made after I came there; until the roof was on, it was one solid wall. It might be <em>three </em>or six weeks after the roof was on, before I was sent there to put in the window-frames. I think it was six weeks. The roof was put on just as soon as it could possibly be put on. When we started the top bricks of the space, the others came out easily, because they were put in with a straight joint, to be taken out. That was my order to have it built in that way.” “We were more than one day doing it — between three and five days— Mr. Yollmer was present at different times, while we were proceeding in the matter, two or three times a day;” on cross-examination by Judge Parsons, he testified, “Young Joseph (Denegre) said they were going to put in windows, and I said you can’t put in windows in a party-wall overlooking another man’s property.
