Slocum was a judgment creditor of Kelly about 1851, and under an execution on his judgment sold a tract of land belonging to Kelly, and containing about 140 acres. There <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>was an arrangement that about 100 acres of the land should be for the benefit of Slocum and other creditors of Kelly, and the remainder was to be reconveyed to Kelly. Peter P. Lee was to take a conveyance of the whole tract and convey Kelly’s portion to Susan J. Kelly, his wife. A conveyance of the land in two tracts was accordingly made by Slocum to Lee about the 1st of December 1854: one tract contained 91 acres and the other 52 acres. On the 1st of December 1854, Lee conveyed the 52 acre tract to Mrs. Kelly. Kelly after this went to California, and whilst he was there his wife exchanged this tract for one of about 96 acres, belonging to Morris Gothheimer, and afterwards, on the 1st of July 1859, she bought the 80 acres, the land in controversy, from John B. Lake, by articles of agreement of the same date, in consideration of the conveyance to him of the 96 acres, and the payment of $650, all of which was done by Mrs. Kelly. On the 11th day of September 1865 an agreement was made “ between Susan J. and Thomas Kelly, of Clifford township,” &amp;c., of the first part, and Joseph P. Colburn and Floyd Colburn, of the second part, by which the parties of the first part agreed to sell to the parties of the second part the 80 acres, and “ make them a good and sufficient warranty deed,” for the consideration of $3122, of which $800 were to be paid “ down,” and the remainder in annual payments of unequal amounts, the last payment to be made in 1875. There was also a warrant of attorney to confess judgment should any part of the purchase money be unpaid for a year. The articles were otherwise in the usual form. The agreement was signed by Thomas Kelly and Susan J. Kelly and the Colburns, but it was not acknowledged by Mrs. Kelly or any of the other parties.</p>

B. Lake, whom she paid for it by the proceeds (which had undergone certain transmutations) of fifty acres of land, conveyed to her by J. B. Slocum. Slocum had purchased Thomas Kelly’s title to one hundred and fifty acres of land, at the sheriff’s sale, for the benefit of himself and two other creditors of Kelly. Kelly then left for California, and Mrs. Kelly procured a contract from Slocum and others, to let her have all the land of her husband not needed to pay their claims. After Kelly’s return, this agreement was carried out by Kelly procuring a purchaser for one hundred acres of the land, at a sum sufficient to pay off the claims of Slocum and his associates. The whole land was conveyed to Peter P. Lee, the purchaser, who reconveyed the fifty acres intended for Mrs. Kelly to her. The contract of J. B. Lake for the eighty acres of land, the subject <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>of this ejectment, was with Mrs. Kelly vesting the only title for it in her, and not her husband. The sale to the defendants below was made in the name of Susan Kelly, as well as of her husband, her name preceding his, and in the bargaining for the land by the defendants (as testified by Mr. Dart, who was present), the title was spoken of as hers; defendants claim under this purchase, which on its face gave notice of a title in Mrs. Kelly, for she is first named, and joined in the covenant for title. The article was not acknowledged, nor is there anything on its face indicating that her name was used to bar a dower estate only. • The title when followed up, as has been stated, was vested alone in her. It is clear, therefore, that this is nothing more than the purchase of a wife’s land, by an unacknowledged agreement, which does not bind her, and the case falls directly within the principle of Gliddon <em>v. </em>Strupler, 2 P. F. Smith 400, and the cases there referred to.</p>
    <p id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[663,1047,626,44]]]'>The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>
