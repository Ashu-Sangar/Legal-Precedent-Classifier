It is called a drain, but is more properly a sewer. The borough had the right to lay out and ordain the construction of common sewers or drains, under the Act of 1851, but whether at the expense of the property owners fronting it, we are not asked to say. Our question is, whether the borough could file a lien against the defendant where property fronted on the drain or sewer in question for his <em>pro rata </em>of the expense. That there was no authority for this we are quite certain. The matters which are the subjects of liens by the borough against the owners of adjoining ground are enumerated in Art. 5 of § 2 of the Act of 1851, the General Borough Act. They are for “ grading, curbing, paving and guttering of the side or foot walks.” The work in question is not within any of the works enumerated, and consequently not the subject of the lien. “ <em>JSxpressio unius, est exclusio </em>alterius.” The judgment of the court on the case stated, being in our opinion right, it is affirmed.</p>
