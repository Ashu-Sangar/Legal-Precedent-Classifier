He then offered to prove that Lee and William Silvey were partners, and entered into a contract with James Yocum, who was a carpenter, to build a house for them, and receive the lot in controversy in consideration. The offer was objected to by the defendant, admitted by the court and a bill of exceptions sealed. The plaintiff then showed by a witness that Lee and Silvey were partners in 1842, and agreed in writing with Yocum to build a house for them; that witness saw the agreement in 1842 in presence of the parties. Yocum had a copy; witness never saw it since. Plaintiff read Silvey’s testimony from Judge Sharswood’s notes at a former trial, under objection to their relevancy and exception by the defendant.</p>

Lee died about 1857; Yocum was to take the lot for $500 in payment of the building; the lot was owned by both, but the deed was in Lee’s name. Yocum went into possession at the time of the contract, and continued in possession until his death in 1846. Mrs. Yocum, the widow, testified that the contract was in Yocum’s possession at his death, his desk was broken open after his death, and the paper was lost. The defendant objected to evidence of the contents of the paper, the objection was overruled and a bill of exceptions sealed. Plaintiff then gave evidence that Yocum was to take the lot, subject to the ground-rent, &amp;e., for building the house; he did build the house; the deed was to lie in Lee’s hands till the house was finished, and the <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>liens released. There was other evidence of Yocum’s possession. Yocum left a widow and two children, one of whom died after him, leaving the plaintiff surviving. The defendant gave in evidence a deed of the whole premises, dated January 6th 1847, from B. Lee to Margaret Yocum, the widow of James Yocum, and deed of the same premises, dated January 3d 1848, from Mrs. Yocum to Samuel Butcher, together with other evidence in support of his title. The plaintiff in rebuttal called Joseph Huston, the father of Mrs. Yocum, who testified that Butcher in 1847 told witness that he had been urged to buy the property; that it had been advertised for sale by an agent of Mrs. Yocum; witness told Butcher that Mrs. Yocum had no right to sell; the property was not hers; it was the property of her husband who was dead, it fell to his children, and could not be sold from them. W. Haas testified that after Butcher had bought, witness told him that Mrs. Yocum could not sell, and that a good title could not be made, except through the Orphans’ Court, and advised Butcher not to build.</p>

This proposition the court refused to affirm, but told the jury, that if they should find, from the evidence, that Joseph Huston was the grandfather of Edmund G. Yocum, the plaintiff, and that before Butcher bought the property, he was distinctly informed by Huston that no title could be made for the property, except through the Orphans’ Court, because James Yocum owned the property at his death, and had died intestate, leaving two children, of whom the plaintiff was one, such notice was not to be regarded as coming from a stranger, and is sufficient to have put Butcher on inquiry as to the title of any one else offering to sell it.</p>

    <p id="b170-9" data-blocks='[["BL_170.12",170,[310,1182,1160,1027]]]'>On the part of the plaintiff it clearly appeared that these premises were the property of James Yocum, the husband of the said Margaret Yocum, and that he died on 9th September 1846, leaving a widow and a child, the present plaintiff, a boy a few years old. The first three exceptions, which are the subject of the first three specifications, were to matters showing the nature of the title of the decedent Yocum, and were clearly evidence in the cause. The 4th specification of error raises the real question in the case; it is that the court erred in refusing to charge as requested in defendant’s 3d point, and in telling the jury <em>“ </em>that if they should find from the evidence that Joseph Huston was the grandfather of Edmund G. Yocum, the plaintiff, and that before Butcher bought the property he was distinctly informed by Huston that no title could be made for the property, except through the Orphans’ Court, because James Yocum, owned the property at his death and had died intestate, leaving two children, of whom the plaintiff was one, such notice was not to be regarded as coming from a stranger and is sufficient to have put Butcher on inquiry as to the title of any one else offering to sell it.” The verdict of the jury found the facts required by the charge of the court, and the evidence was clear, distinct and positive on the question of notice. The only point open is whether the court were right in saying that notice by the grandfather was not to be regarded as coming from a stranger.</p>

This course of reasoning seems amply sufficient to sustain the case of Ripple <em>v. </em>Ripple, <a href="/rawle/1/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Rawle 386" data-case-ids="1819227" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0386-01">1 Rawle 386</a>, where information of the existence of an equitable charge on land was held to be notice, although not proceeding from the parties directly interested, without a resort to the special ground on which it was decided.” The late case of Lloyd <em>v. </em>Banks, Law Rep. 3 Ch. Ap. 488, 37 L. J. R. N. S. 881, decided by Lord Cairns, clearly supports this doctrine. In this case (Ripple <em>v. </em>Ripple), the notice was given by an uncle of a female in a state of idiocy, “ and surely,” says Glibson, C. J., “ one so near in blood as an uncle might lawfully interpose for their protection.” In the present case the plaintiff was. an infant of tender years, his mother the person, to convey away his estate, his guardian standing by. Was not his grandfather not only a proper person to give notice to a purchaser, but bound as an honest man to do so ? In Seibert’s Appeal, 7 Harris 56, Judge Lewis says, “ In Pennsylvania the grandfather as well as the father is required by the Act of 13th June 1836, § 28, to rélieve and maintain his grandchildren when their necessities require it. This statute- is in accordance with the moral sense of mankind. Those who suppose that infant grandchildren do not, upon the death of their parents, take the place of the latter in the affections of their grandfather, are strangers to the most ordinary manifestations of the best feelings of the human heart; as the mementos of the departed child, they have peculiar claims to his regard; and their unprotected helplessness, produced by the common bereavement, in most cases rivets his affections to them closer than they ever clung to their parents.”</p>
