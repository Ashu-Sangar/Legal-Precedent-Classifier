Beilis. The writ was issued December 13th 1867. The plaintiffs declared against the defendant as endorser of a note dated March 19th 1867, at 60 days, drawn to his order by G. S. Burroughs, treasurer, for $2039.06. The defendant was president of the Port Richmond Pottery Company. The plaintiffs gave in evidence the deposition of Henry J. Martindale. He testified, that he acted as salesman of the Pottery Company, and purchased coal and supplies.for them; G. S. Burroughs was the superintendent, secretary and treasurer. He had purchased the coal which was the consideration of the note, and it had been delivered. The plaintiffs asked for payment for the coal, and declined to take the company’s note. Witness having gone to see them by the direction of Burroughs, asked them if they would take the defendant’s note, and referred them to a Mr. Salter for his standing. The plaintiffs were to make inquiries on the subject, and witness left them without any <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>understanding whether they would take the defendant’s note. The plaintiffs afterwards sent word to Burroughs that they would take the defendant’s individual note. Witness then went to the defendant’s house in Trenton, N. J., with the note in suit; “ it was not then filled up — being merely a blank note.” Burroughs asked the defendant if he would give his note to plaintiffs: he said he would not, but would endorse the note as president.</p>

Bellis, Pres’t.” At this interview Beilis repeatedly declared, that he would not as an individual assume any of the company’s debts, and particularized the note in suit. The note was taken by witness and Burroughs to the company’s office in Philadelphia, “Burroughs made out the amount and filled up the note,” and said he would scratch “Pres’t” off, which he did with a penknife in the presence of witness. The note was delivered to the plaintiffs, who were not then informed of the alteration that had been made, nor afterwards until the note fell due. There was no authority from Bellis to erase the word “Pr.es’t” in case the plaintiff should refuse to take the note without the defendant’s individual endorsement.</p>

      <em>Or. </em>B. Newton, the general agent of the plaintiffs, testified for them: Witness received the note from Martindale for the Pottery Company, as the company’s note endorsed by the defendant. Martindale had offered the defendant’s individual endorsement as security, which witness took after some inquiry. The note was given for coal sold to the company for cash. Witness first heard of or saw the erasure after the note had been protested, when the plaintiff’s agent went to see the defendant about payment. The coal was charged to the company. The receipt given for the note was for the bill of coal “when paid.”</p>

It changed the nature of the defendant’s obligation from an official representative act to a personal undertaking. It was then not admissible in evidence, provided that fact sufficiently appeared before its offer; that it did in the proof made by the plaintiffs, is clear beyond controversy. The claim for which the note was given was for coal sold to the company by the plaintiffs. They applied to the company for payment and the treasurer, Burroughs, and the witness, Martindale, a stockholder and salesman of the company, endeavored to get the plaintiffs to agree to take a company note for their debt. This they declined, but agreed to take Mr. Beilis’s note. Mr. Beilis, when applied to by the treasurer of his company to give his individual note for the demand, positively refused, but endorsed a blank note, signing as president. This, Burroughs filled up with his name as payee and erased very skilfully the word “ Pres’t” from his signature as endorser and passed the note over to -the plaintiffs; thus committing a gross fraud on him, as well as practising a great deception on the plaintiffs. Eo other inference could arise from the testimony than that the plaintiffs knew that Beilis was the president of the pottery company at the time they received his note. They were the creditors of his company and had presented their claim against the company, and pressed it for payment. This was the proof. The erasure was also clearly proved by the plaintiffs before the note was offered. They then stood in the position of a party offering in evidence a note with a material alteration fraudulently made and proved, without being holders for value, the note having been given for a precedent debt and without the surrender of any security and upon a receipt given on the claim “by note when paid.” The note was therefore not admissible on the ground of the fraudulent alteration. Eor would it have sustained the plaintiff’s <em>narr., </em>taking it as it was endorsed; for if the plaintiffs knew, as we have shown they must have known, that he was the president of the pottery company, when he endorsed as president, then it was the note of the company, and not his individual note, and as the company was not sued it was not evidence in the case on trial. In both views the note, under the plaintiffs’ proof, was inadmissible, and the learned judge committed no error in rejecting it. As there was no other ground of recovery against the defendant, the non-suit was properly ordered.</p>
