Fallon the undivided half of 5000 acres of land in Elk county, on or before the 1st of January 1856, for the consideration of $30,000, payable in instalments, the last being on the 13th of April 1857, and as soon as the conveyance should be made the Fallons should lease the premises to Winslow for one year, and thereafter from year to year so long as the parties agreed, he paying half-yearly a rent equal to the interest of the purchase-money, together with taxes, and to cut no more than 800,000 feet of timber in any one year; the cost of improving the property, &amp;c., to be borne rateably by both parties. That on the 18th of December Winslow conveyed the one-half the property to the Fallons; that on the 4th of March 1856 the Fallons leased to Winslow their half of the property for one year from January 1st 1856, and until six months’ notice be given by either party that- the lease should be determined, Winslow agreeing to pay therefor at different rates for the different years, as designated in the lease, payable semi-annually; Winslow to pay the Fallons, in addition, a sum equal to six per cent on any moneys which might be paid by them for the purchase of any adjoining land in which Winslow should take an interest; Winslow to give account of all lumber cut, and pay for all over 800,000 feet yearly, at such price as might be determined on, &amp;c. That on the 24th of April 1858, C. Fallon conveyed all his interest in the land to J. Fallon; that the Fallons held the title in trust for A. Sanches, Duke of Riansares, a resident of France; that J. Fallon, on the 8th of October 1859, conveyed the premises to F. Probst, who on the same day conveyed them to J. Fallon and P. P. Morris for the use of the Duke of Riansares; and that Fallon and Morris, on the 19th of January 1864, conveyed the premises to the plaintiff in fee, together with all their right and claim against Winslow and Petriken under the agreements. The bill averred that a large portion of the consideration ($30,000) payable to Winslow was paid to him in cash and a mortgage dated April 4th 1856 given to him, for $18,171, the residue; which mortgage is recorded in Elk county.</p>

That a levari facias was issued September 14th 1859, and 3d day of October, then next the property was sold by the sheriff to Winslow for $5375; that all these proceedings were had without any knowledge of the Fallons, the Duke of Riansares or his attorney; and although Winslow, and Petriken his son-in-law, and acting for Winslow, had conversations with J. Fallon whilst the proceedings were progressing, they studiously concealed these proceedings, and led Fallon to believe that he and Winslow held the property jointly as they had originally. That Petriken, in 1861, told the attorney in fact of Riansares that the sale under the mortgage had been brought about in consequence of differences between O. and J. Fallon, and if these could be settled J. Fallon’s interest would be conveyed in trust for Riansares. That Petriken acted from the beginning as the agent and attorney of Wins-low, and with his knowledge and assent. That the plaintiff, on the 3d of April 1864, tendered to Winslow $10,028.70, the full amount of the judgment on the mortgage, with interest, and demanded of him a conveyance of the one-half part of the land, but Winslow refused to accept the tender or make the conveyance. The plaintiff also averred that the differences between the two Fallons had long since been settled; that Petriken was interested in the original sale to the Fallons, and in the purchase by Wins-low at the sheriff’s sale; that Winslow was not entitled to a foreclosure of the mortgage until an account had been rendered to J. Fallon or Riansares of the timber cut, with an offer to pay for the same and to pay the rent according to the agreement. That the acts of Winslow before set out are fraudulent, and by them large and valuable tracts of land, which had been bought for Riansares through the advice and influence of Winslow and Petriken, had been by their combination and fraud swept away, and now claim as their own under the sheriff’s sale.</p>

Fallon conveyed his interest in the Elk county lands to J. Fallon, by deed of sale, 24th April 1858. J.

P. Morris, in trust, for said Duke of Riansares. James McHenry purchased from the Duke, and a conveyance was made to him by J. Fallon and P. P. Morris, on behalf of their principal, on the 19th January 1864. This was more than four years after the sheriff’s sale, and more than three years after the sheriff’s deed to Winslow had been placed upon record. McHenry is, therefore, a purchaser with notice, and succeeds only to the rights of J. Fallon, who was the sole owner of the mortgaged interest in these lands, when proceedings were instituted upon the mortgage. If the relations subsisting, between Fallon and Winslow were such as to make the sheriff’s sale fraudulent as to Fallon, then McHenry, his vendee, is entitled to avail himself of that fraud to the same extent that Fallon could do, if this bill had been filed by him. The material inquiry, therefore, and that upon which the case depends, is, what were the relations subsisting between Winslow and his vendees after the execution of the lease and mortgage by them ?

This notice was dated 13th July 1857, 'and stated the intention of Winslow to terminate the lease of March 4th 1856, on and after the 31st of December 1857. That this was actually served, or that John Eallon afterwards treated the lease as at an end, would seem reasonably clear from his letter of May 10th 1859, in which he authorizes Winslow to rent the saw-mill for $300, and the timber lands at $2 per thousand feet for the timber-leave or stump-age.</p>

Winslow and Julius Jones, to show the cutting of timber upon these lands during 1858-9. They both state that they have a general knowledge of the ‘body of lands in which O. and J. Eallon were interested with Winslow,’ and that large quantities of pine timber were cut in 1858-9. Both Winslow and Petriken, in their answers, deny that timber was cut on these lands during- these years. Mr. Winslow, in his deposition, states there was cut, under his direction, quite a large quantity on the one-half of one of these warrants, which he says belonged wholly to himself, viz., No. 5; but that he neither cut timber himself or sold the stumpage or standing timber to others from any of the lands in which the Eallons were interested; and that the saw-mill standing upon these lands was idle during the years 1858 and 1859. The timber spoken of by J. W. Winslow and Jones may have been, and we think it reasonable to believe was, that of which Reuben Winslow spoke as cut upon warrant No. 5. If so, then the liability of Winslow to account as a tenant ceased when the lease became inoperative, and no new liability was created, either as co-tenant of the fee or otherwise, because no profits were received from the joint estate for which to account. Indeed, the tender which was made by the complainant, and is set out in the bill, may be fairly regarded as an admission of the amount due upon the mortgage; and it is inconsistent with the allegation that defendant has not accounted for the rents accrued underthe lease and the profits made prior to the sheriff’s sale.</p>

He testifies that ‘ at the last interview I had with John Fallon before issuing sci. fa. on the mortgage, I informed him distinctly, that if I was not paid, I should look to the land for payment.’ Petriken, in his answer to the sixteenth interrogatory, says, ‘ I called at the office of John Fallon, and told him the lands were advertised to be sold at the then coming court.’ We understand John Fallon to deny that he received information of the sale until some time after its occurrence. If he did receive notice he has nothing of which to complain. If he did not, while he may justly complain of a resort to proceedings on the mortgage as inconsistent with the friendly relations existing between himself and Winslow, yet we hold that no obligation to give notice of such proceeding grew out of the situation of Win-slow toward Fallon or toward the land, that we can enforce. The bill filed in this case is dismissed.” November 16th 1868.</p>

When he purchased from Eallon he had constructive notice of Winslow’s title, and could take no greater interest in the mortgaged premises than Eallon himself had. Did Winslow then take an absolute title to the mortgaged premises under the sheriff’s sale, or did he take the title, subject to the payment of the debt, in trust for Eallon ? The scire facias was not issued on the mortgage until more than a year after it became due, and all the proceedings, including the judgment, execution and sale thereon, were regular and in strict conformity with the requirements of the statute and the uniform practice in such cases. It is not alleged that there was any irregularity or defect in the proceedings, or that the judgment was taken for an amount greater than the sum actually due. It follows that Winslow took a good title to the premises unless his relations to Eallon were such as to render the sale fraudulent or voidable. What, then, were the relations subsisting between them at the date of the sale, and were they such as to prevent Winslow from taking a valid title to the land for his own use ? Had he a legal right to institute proceedings on the mortgage at the time and in the manner he did; or was he bound to account for the rents and profits <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>of the premises before proceeding adversely on the mortgage? The appellant contends that he was the lessee of the mortgaged premises, and, therefore, that he had no right to proceed on the mortgage until he had first accounted for the rent which he' had stipulated to pay. But the evidence shows that the lease was terminated on the 1st of January 1858, prior to the institution of the suit on the mortgage, and that Winslow had fully accounted for the rent up to that date. The appellant further contends that he was a co-tenant with Fallon of the lands bound by the lien of the mortgage, and that he was in possession of the premises as co-tenant and mortgagee, and in the receipt of profits arising from the sale of timber and stumpage, for which he was bound to account and apply to the extinguishment of the debt, before taking adverse proceedings on the mortgage. It is true that Winslow was a co-tenant with Fallon, but there is no evidence that he was in the actual occupancy of the premises either for the purpose of residence or cultivation. They consisted chiefly of uncultivated woodland, or forests of white-pine, and if Winslow cut no timber and sold no stumpage, as the court below found, then he received no profits from the estate, which they held as tenants in common, for which he was bound to account. There is some evidence that large quantities of timber were cut on the tracts included in the mortgage, in the years 1858 and 1859, but Winslow, in his answer, denies that any timber was cut thereon during either of these years, and the court was of the opinion that the timber mentioned in the depositions of appellant’s witnesses, was cut on that part of “ Warrant No. 5 ” which belonged wholly to the defendant, Wins-low. The witnesses testify that they are acquainted with the tracts, but they do not designate or distinguish them in any way, nor indicate the tract on which the timber was cut to which they refer. As Winslow admits that he cut a large quantity of timber on his portion of “Warrant No. 5,” and positively denies that he cut any timber on either of the tracts included in the mortgage, we should not be justified in setting aside the finding of the court below on evidence so vague and unsatisfactory. The burden of showing that Winslow cut or sold timber for w7hich he is bound to account was on the appellant, and in order to overcome his positive denial in response to the allegations in the appellant’s bill, the fact should have been established by clear and satisfactory evidence. There is, then, no sufficient evidence that Winslow had any other possession of the mortgaged premises than that which followed his legal title, and as Fallon was part owner of the lands, he had, by virtue of his legal title, the same possession that Winslow had. Nor is there any evidence that he was acting as the agent of Fallon at the date of the sheriff’s sale, in the supervision, care and management of the lands. It is true that, under Fallon’s letter of the 10th May 1859, he was authorized to rent the saw-mill, with <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>the right to cut timber for one year, and to make any arrangement for the cultivation of the farm lands on shares or otherwise that he might think advisable, but there' is no evidence that he accepted the authority, or that he attempted to act under it. Nor can such agency be inferred from the fact that he paid the taxes assessed on the lands of which he was part owner, even if it had been shown that he paid them at the request of Fallon and upon his promise to repay him his share. The performance of a particular service in pursuance of a special request is no evidence of a general agency, even as it respects strangers, much less as between the parties themselves.</p>
    <p id="b443-6" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[185,886,1165,1547]],["BL_444.1",444,[305,426,1160,340]]]'>Is there anything in his relation to Fallon as co-tenant of the land bound by the lien of the mortgage which would prevent him from instituting proceedings thereon without first giving notice of his intention, or which made it his duty to give Fallon personal notice of the proceedings after they were commenced ? If Fallon failed to pay the mortgage-debt at maturity, why were not the same remedies open to him to enforce its payment as if he had not been his co-tenant? We can discover nothing in the relation which ought to modify or affect his rights or remedies, and which should prevent him from proceeding on the mortgage in the same manner and with the same effect as if no such relation had subsisted between them. And for the same reason we are of the opinion that Winslow was under no imperative legal obligation to give Fallon personal notice that he had commenced proceedings on the mortgage. His failure to give him such notice may have been inconsistent with the friendly relations existing between them; yet if he was under no legal obligation to give him personal notice, then the duty, though morally binding in the forum of conscience, is not such as can be enforced by the court. He gave all the notice the law requires, and there is no evidence that he was guilty of any fraudulent concealment or misrepresentation. If Fallon has any reason to complain of his conduct it is of his silence, and not of any positive act done with the intent of misleading him. Nor was there any such haste in the proceedings as would indicate an intention on the part of Winslow to take any undue advantage of Fallon. The property was not exposed to sale until about a year after the judgment had been obtained, and the sheriff’s deed was not acknowledged until three months thereafter ; and the evidence shows that Fallon was informed that the property had been advertised for sale just before or soon after it took place, and in ample time to have prevented the consummation of the sale, if he had been disposed to prevent it. If he had notice of its advertisement, as he admits that he had, it was his duty to have prevented the consummation of the sale by the payment of the mortgage-debt before the acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed. And if he did not, it was his own fault; and as <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>the appellant stands in his shoes, he must bear the consequences of his laches. Eallon knew that the debt was due, and he was informed by Winslow that he should look to the land for its payment, and yet there is not a particle of evidence that he ever offered to make any arrangement whatever for the payment of the mortgage until long after the sheriff’s sale. Under all the facts of this case we think the court below was fully justified in dismissing the bill.</p>
