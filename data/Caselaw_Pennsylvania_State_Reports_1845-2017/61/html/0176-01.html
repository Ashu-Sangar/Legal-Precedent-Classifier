Jordan and Henry Buchenhorst, partners, &amp;c., on a judgment recovered by them against Robert J. Sheridan. Louis Headman was the garnishee. The amount in the garnishee’s hands was $118. The question was whether it belonged to the defendant in the execution or to his wife. From the evidence given in the case it appeared that Headman, the garnishee, purchased from Robert Sheridan building stone which was quarried by him from real estate that <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>had belonged to his father, Owen Sheridan, then deceased. By his will the decedent, amongst other things, directed his executors to sell his real estate at such times as they should think most advisable for the interest of all concerned, and apportion the proceeds into four equal shares from time to time, as the said real estate should be sold by them. He further provided as follows: —“ One of said shares I direct’ my said executors to invest in good securities at interest, and during the lifetime of my son, Robert J. Sheridan, to pay over the net income thereof quarterly to his wife, Annie Sheridan, to be used by her for the support of my said son Robert, and herself and his children, and her receipt shall be a good and valid discharge therefor to said trustees, and upon the death of my said son Robert, then I give and bequeath the said one-fourth part of the principal of my estate unto all his children who may be living at the death of my said son Robert.” The contract for the stone was made by Headman with Robert Sheridan. Headman testified:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b177-6" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[206,1123,1160,603]]]'>“ I asked Robert about whether he had to get the executors to release off about that stone. He said he had arranged everything right about that with them. It wasn’t necessary. He said he was to pay 12J or 20 cents a perch for the stone in the ground. He did not tell, when he made the contract, that he was acting as agent for his wife. He hauled the stone to me. He drove himself, most of the time. Mr. Sheridan didn’t say he was acting as agent for his wife until the first receipt. This was in the name of the wife. I didn’t know the meaning, and asked. He said he was agent of his wife. I paid him two instalments, $45 and $20. "When I made the contract I asked him who were the executors, and he told me. I asked him then if I paid him the money if it was necessary for her to release off. He said he had all that fixed. He had to pay so much a perch for the stone.”</p>

If so, she and the other legatees were the persons equitably entitled to the benefit of the proceeds; and if, under those circumstances, a contract was made between the executors and husband, in good faith, that he should take out stone from a portion of the land and sell it for the benefit of the wife, I think that the proceeds of that sale would not be liable to be taken in execution for his debts.</p>

This stone had been quarried by the defendant from real estate which had belonged to his father, Owen Sheridan, who, by his last will and testament, after ordering his real estate to be sold, directed one-fourth of the proceeds to be invested by his executors, and the net income thereof to be paid over to Annie Sheridan, the wife of his son Robert, to be used by her for the support of his said son and hex-self and children, with a bequest over to his children. According to the testimony of Louis Headman, the garnishee, and the only witness in the case, he purchased the stone from Robert Sheridan. <em>“ </em>I asked Robert about whether he had to get'the executors to release off about that stone. He said he had arranged everything right about that with them; it wasn’t necessary.

If there had been- any evidence whatever in the ease that the executors had contracted with Robert Sheridan, as agent for his wife, that she should receive the stone in part of her share, the profit gained by the sale of it would have been hers, though her husband may have bestowed his own labor in quarrying and hauling it. But we have looked in vain through the testimony for any spark of evidence from which such a contract could be inferred. Surely, the act of the husband, in receipting for the payments as agent for the wife, would not make it hers. Primfi facie, he was the purchaser from the executors, and if she was, and not he, nothing would have been easier than to have proved it. It was incumbent on the wife, as against her husband’s creditors, to prove that it was hers. It was error, therefore, to submit to the jury to determine whethér “ a contract was made between the executors and husband, in good faith, that he should take out stone from a portion of the land and sell it for the benefit of the wife,” when there was no evidence whatever of any such contract.</p>
