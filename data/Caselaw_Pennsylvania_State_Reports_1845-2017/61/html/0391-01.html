On the 13th the cashier of the bank transmitted to the savings institution the note and statement of Cronise &amp; Co., with a memorandum at the foot by the cashier, saying that $492.72, the amount less expenses, were to the credit of the savings institution in the Allentown Bank. On the 22d December Cronise &amp; Co. deposited with the Manufacturers’ and Mechanics’ Bank, to the credit of the Allentown Bank, their check on the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank for-$493.22. On the same day the Manufacturers’ and Mechanics’ Bank advised the Allentown Bank as follows: “ Cronise <em>&amp; </em>Co. have deposited to your credit $493.22.” The check of Cronise &amp; Co. was protested.

There was testimony that tended to show that Cronise &amp; Co. were selected by Dimes Savings Bank as their own agents, evidence of cashier Dimes Savings Bank and Saeger, cashier Catasauqua Bank — evidence (pretty strong) that the bag was not delivered to Allentown Bank as its own property, but was intrusted to Mr. Cooper only to forward to Cronise &amp; Co. Cooper suggested so sending it, because his contract with express company would <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>lessen expenses. He directed Bush to put it in hag, direct it, seal it, mark amount on it. The hag was so sent to Allentown Bank, delivered without counting or changing it. That at delivery it was said Cooper knew what to do with it, and the Allentown Bank gave no credit, as Cooper had undertaken to forward the coin, it would follow that he would give these instructions to Cronise &amp; Co. to convert it at best rates, which was the object in sending it to them.</p>

About that time the notes of the Allentown Bank were running in for redemption in Philadelphia pretty rapidly. After 10th December 1860 Bush admits that Cooper told him the Dimes Savings Bank could no longer depend on Allentown Bank for advances. Bush calculated to charge Allentown Bank with proceeds, to which may be added the actual disposition of the proceeds by the parties themselves.</p>

The judge thought it proper to read to the jury the opinion of this court reversing his former judgment and to submit the case thereon. Why he did so, it is difficult to know. The opinion of this court <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>upon the case as exhibited in the former trial was not a fair presentation of the case on the second trial. It was in no sense a charge to the jury, its purpose being wholly different. In the first trial the judge had taken the case away from the jury, without submitting to them the facts on part of the plaintiff bearing on the disputed credit. We thought he erred in this, inasmuch as there were facts and circumstances the plaintiff was entitled to have submitted for consideration, tending to show that Cronise &amp; Co. were the agents of the Dimes Bank instead of the Allentown Bank, and that the credit of $493.22 might have resulted from their fraud as agents of the Dimes Bank. It became necessary, therefore, to state.in our opinion these circumstances, in order to show the possibility that the Dimes Bank and not the Allentown Bank might be responsible for the fraud of Cronise &amp; Co. Hence, the very purpose of the opinion made it one-sided, and was to develop the strength of the evidence which the judge had dismissed as unimportant; and not to state that of the other side, which might have been its counterpoise.. When that opinion, therefore, was converted into a charge to the jury, it was not a fair presentation of both sides of the case, and the error was greatly augmented by omitting to answer the defendants’ points. These errors of commission and omission made the charge too limited, and tended to exclude from a full consideration the views of the evidence taken by the defendant. • The error was heightened when the judge told the jury that the evidence in this trial did not, in any substantial particular, vary from what it was. on the former trial. Whether this is true we do not remember, and certainly the jury had no means of knowing. The effect of the whole charge was to. lead the jury to believe that the case was precisely that upon which we had passed, and had been decided by this court in favor of the plaintiff. It left very little room for a successful defence.</p>
