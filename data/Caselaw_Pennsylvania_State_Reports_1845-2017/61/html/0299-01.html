The court below held that he could, but for insufficient reasons, we think.</p>

One demand might be the entire assets of even a large estate; it would not do, therefore, to make this the test. The rule in <a href="/binn/1/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Binn. 63" data-case-ids="1787963" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0063-01">1 Binn. 63</a>, sanctioning suit by a foreign administrator, has long since ceased to be <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>law in this Commonwealth. To allow it, would he to enable executors or administrators authorized by a foreign jurisdiction, to collect and carry away the assets of a foreign decedent’s estate, and compel domestic claimants to follow them. And to remedy this, the 6th section of the Act of 15th March 1832, relating to Registers and Registers’ Courts, Pamph. L. 135, contains this provision among others, that “ no letters testamentary or of administration, or otherwise, purporting to authorize any person to inter-meddle with the estate of a decedent which may be granted out of this Commonwealth, shall confer upon- such person any of the powers and authorities possessed by an executor or administrator, under letters granted within this state.” In Moore <em>v. </em>Fields, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20467" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Wright 467">6 Wright 467</a>, we distinctly held that executors and administrators of another state could not sue here by virtue of letters granted there; but the recovery in that case was sustained on its own peculiar circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b301-6" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[181,1076,1158,343]]]'>The idea advanced that there was no place for administration to be granted in this state, was also a mistake. The section partially quoted provides, that letters shall- be granted in the county of the decedent’s residence, but if he have no residence, then by “ the régister in the county where the principal part of the goods and estate of such decedent shall be.” That means the principal part by reference to the estate within this Commonwealth, and not by comparison with the estate outside of it.</p>
    <p id="b301-7" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[178,1420,1160,418]]]'>The claim in suit being admitted to be the only estate of the decedent in this Commonwealth, its <em>situs </em>was the place for administration, by the express terms of the statute. Thus auxiliary adnrinistration ought to have been granted in order to collect the debt in question. After collecting the debts here under letters thus granted, and a discharge of all domestic claims against the funds, the Orphans’ Court having jurisdiction of the accounts of the administrator, would direct the balance to be remitted to the place of primary administration. That is the only mode of precedure in a case of this kind.</p>
