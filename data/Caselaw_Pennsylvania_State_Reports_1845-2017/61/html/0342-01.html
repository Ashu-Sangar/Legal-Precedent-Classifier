The law is not changed by the act of 26th March 1864, giving jurisdiction to township auditors to settle the accounts of the receipts and expenditure of township bounty funds arising from the assumed collection of taxes for that purpose. The provision is that such accounts shall be audited in <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>like manner as other county, township, city, borough or school district accounts are audited. The appeal in this case is from the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh county, on an appeal from the settlement of the auditors of Hanover township, of a bounty fund account, and as there is no authority for such an appeal to this court, it must be quashed.</p>
