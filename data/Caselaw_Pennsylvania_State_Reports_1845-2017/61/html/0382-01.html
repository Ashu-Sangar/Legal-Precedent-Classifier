    <p id="b384-8" data-blocks='[["BL_384.6",384,[281,974,1167,818]]]'>2. If this had been a deed of conveyance executed and acknowledged by the defendants, as this article of agreement was, there can be no doubt that it would have passed the title of Sarah Hunter and her husband to the premises contained in it. The objection to the contracts of married women for the sale of the real estate has been, that they were not executed according to the provisions of the statute. In some cases they were merely verbal, in others that the husband was not a party, in others that there was no separate acknowledgment of the wife. Here all the forms and requisites of the statute were complied with, and the only objection is that it was only a contract to convey and not a conveyance of the land. In Glidden <em>v. </em>Strupler, 2 P. F. Smith 400, my Brother Agnew has put the whole question in a single sentence : “ A married woman has no capacity to contract for the sale of her real estate, or to convey it, except in the precise statutory mode conferring the power.” The converse of this is the law — a married woman has capacity to contract for the sale of her real estate, and to convey it in the precise statutory method conferring the power.</p>
