        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, March 27th 1869, by\nRead, J.\nThis is an action of debt on a bond for $300, dated 7th December 1864, given by the borough of Susquehanna Depot to John Barry. Under the call of the President of the United States for 50.0,000 men, the quota of Susquehanna Depot was filled by a draft, which was duly executed, and every man in the borough liable to military service was mustered in either in person or by a representative. After this was entirely completed, the borough council on the 7th November 1864, passed the following resolution.\n\u201c Whereas, under the late call of the President of the United States, the borough of Susquehanna Depot, did not, as a corporation, furnish any means to fill the quota of said borough.\n\u201c Therefore, be it resolved, that, to all those who were liable to be drafted to fill said quota, and did before said draft furnish an acceptable representative and get him accredited on said quota \u2014or who was drafted and then furnished a substitute \u2014 or who went'into the United States service himself \u2014 should be entitled to receive $300; provided that all employees of the Erie Railway Company who by virtue of an offer made by the said company, to give $100, and have substitutes furnished them, shall not be entitled to receive the same.\u201d\nUnder this resolution, which is recited in it at length, this bond was given, dated 7th December 1864, and the question is, had the borough council any authority to pass such a resolution and to give this bond. There was clearly no legal obligation upon the borough to pay $300, or to give a bond for that sum to a drafted man, nor was there any such moral obligation as will support the bond in suit. All the men were actually in the service of the United States, the quota of the borough was filled, and it was relieved entirely from the draft. There had been no previous contract relation of any kind either by meetings of the people or otherwise. The language of my brother Agnew in Washington County v. Berwick, 6 P. F. Smith 474, is peculiarly apposite. Speaking of Weister v. Hade, 2 P. F. Smith 474, he says \u201c In the latter case, where the doctrine of an imperfect, or as it is termed, a moral obligation was resorted to, in aid of the legal duty imposed, the money was advanced at the instance of public meetings of the people, and upon the assurance of the passage of a law to refund it, which was obtained and accepted and acted upon by the public authorities. The public faith was fully and clearly plighted, and the people were relieved from the draft by the payment of the money advanced. Nothing was needed, but the legal authority to enforce the obligation, and this the legislature gave.\u201d\nHere the borough council had clearly no authority to pass this resolution, and of course none whatever either to pay the money or to give the bond for its payment.\nJudgment reversed.",

    "head_matter": "Borough of Susquehanna Depot versus Barry.\n1. A borough council resolved: That all who were liable to be drafted to fill a designated quota, \u201c and did before said draft, furnish an acceptable representative, and get him accredited on said quota, or, who was drafted, and then furnished a substitute, or went into the United States service themselves, shall be entitled to receive \u00a7300,\u201d &c. Held, that a bond issued under this resolution was without authority, and a recovery could not be had on it.\n2. There was no legal or moral obligation on the borough to pay a drafted man.\nMarch 11th 1869.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Bead, Agnew and Williams, JJ. Sharswood, J., at Nisi Prius.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Susquehanna county: No. 299, to January Term 1869.\nIn the court below John Barry to the use of J. M. Donley, brought an action of debt against the borough of Susquehanna Depot. The writ was issued August 6th 1867.\nThe suit was founded on the following bond :\u2014\n\u201c No 28. Know all men by these presents, That the corporate authority of the borough of Susquehanna Depot, in the county of Susquehanna, acknowledge to be indebted to John Barry, or bearer, in the sum of three hundred dollars, lawful money of the United States, to be paid to the said John Barry, or bearer, at the office of the treasurer of the borough of Susquehanna Depot, in five equal annual instalments \u2014 the first instalment to be paid on May 1st 1865; the second, May 1st 1866; the third, May 1st 1867; the fourth, May 1st 1868 ; the fifth, May 1st 1869 \u2014 together with the interest thereon, at the rate of six per cent, per annum, to be paid on tbe presentation of tbe annexed interest warrant and coupons.\n\u201c The above obligation being issued in pursuance of a resolution of the borough council passed November 7th 1864, and being for a remuneration to persons who have enlisted, furnished representatives or substitutes, to' fill the quota of said borough, under the call of the President of the United States, July 18th 1864, for 500,000 men.\n[l. S.]\nIn witness whereof, the said Town Council have caused this bond to be signed by the chairman of the board and attested by the secretary, and to be affixed thereto the borough seal this seventh day of December, A. D. 1864.\nAttest: ' J. P. Martin, President.\nE. W. Smith, Secretary.\u201d\n' Attached to the bond were coupons, \u201c being interest due on bond No. 28, issued by said borough for bounty to volunteers.\u201d\nThe plaintiff on the trial offered the bond in evidence; it was objected to by the defendant because no authority had been shown for issuing it. The court admitted it, and sealed a bill of exceptions.\nThe plaintiff then rested.\nThe defendant gave in evidence the following proceedings of the borough council :\nResolution of November 7th 1864, viz.:\n\u201c Whereas, Under the late call of the President of the United States, the borough of Susquehanna Depot did not, as a corporation, furnish any means to fill the quota of said borough. Therefore, be it resolved, that, to all those who were liable to be drafted, to fill said quota, and did, before said draft, furnish an acceptable representative, and get him accredited on said quota, or who was drafted, and then furnished a substitute, or went into the United States service themselves, shall be entitled to receive $300, provided that all employees of the Erie Railroad Company, who, by virtue of an offer made by the said company, to give $100, and have substitutes furnished them, shall not be entitled to receive the same.\u201d\nThe defendant gave further evidence by Beach Helme, the draft commissioner, that the draft under the call of July 1864, took place in September of that year, and that this was the last draft in that year.\nThe court, (Streeter, P. J.), instructed the jury to find for the plaintiff, reserving the question whether he had shown a right to recover. The jury found for the plaintiff for $212.40. The court afterwards entered judgment on the verdict.\nThe defendant took out a writ of error, and assigned for error the admission of the bond in evidence, and entering judgment on the verdict.\nW. J. Turrell and L. P. Hinds, for plaintiff in error.\nThere was no agreement with the public authorities to pay the bounty before those referred to in the resolution and bond had entered into the service, and there was therefore no consideration for the bond or authority to issue it. There was no contract relation; this is essential: Meek v. Bayard, 3 P. F. Smith 217; Guilford Sch. Dist. v. Zumbro, 5 Id. 433; Gregg Tp. v. Jameson, Id. 474; Musser v. Ferguson Tp., Id. 478; Wash. Co. v. Berwick, 6 Id. 474. A municipal corporation is not estopped by the illegal acts of its officers. There is a difference between defective execution of authority and acting without authority: Fox v. N. Liberties, 3 W. & S. 105; Armstrong v. Allegheny Co., 1 Wright 287.
