        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, February 28th 1869, by\nAgnew, J.\nThe title of the appellant to the $3000, credited to her on her husband\u2019s books, cannot be supported as a debt. A contract by parol, which includes an unsealed writing, needs a consideration to support it: Kennedy\u2019s Ex\u2019rs. v. Ware, 1 Barr 450; Whitehill v. Wilson, 3 Penna. 413; Campbell\u2019s Estate, 7 Barr 100. Nor could it be supported as an ordinary gift between strangers, taking into connection with the books the explanatory proof of the facts. It would have no greater effect than an envelope enclosing securities for debt, endorsed \u201cFor Rebecca Gore,\u201d found among the papers of a decedent: Plumstead\u2019s Appeal, 4 S. & R. 545. Or a direction to burn certain notes in favor of a nephew, without delivering them: Campbell\u2019s Estate, 7 Barr 100. Or the endorsement of a single bill that it should be of no effect at the decease of the owner, unsustained by a consideration: Albert\u2019s Ex\u2019r. v. Zeigler\u2019s Ex\u2019r., 5 Casey 50; Raymond v. Middleton, Id. 534. Where the gift is not executed by delivery but the determining act remains in fieri, the law gives no force to the mere intention to do it. But in this case are not the facts sufficient to show an executed intention followed by a trust ? The transaction was between husband and wife, and therefore influenced by their peculiar relation, with no one now to contest it but mere volunteers, who stand equally affected by the act as the husband himself under whom they claim to take. The entry of May 9th 1864 was a credit in the cash book of the husband of $3000, cash received. The receipt thus entered is an acknowledgment of cash paid, as much as a receipt in form to Mrs. Crawford would be. It imports a past act, not a future promise. This made out a prim\u00e1 facie case, and so conscious of it were the opposite parties, that to escape its effect they called her as a witness. She stated that her husband had purchased a house and told her he would have the deed made to her, but she replied that she did not want the trouble of a house. Sometime afterward he came in and said to her \u2014 -\u201cI have added $3000 to your little money, and after awhile I am going to give you $3000 more.\u201d He did not hand her the money then or at any time. But we find the money credited as if actually received, carried into an account of moneys admitted to belong to her, mingled with it, interest credited upon it, finally consolidated in the account and interest added on the total sum. This is certainly ample evidence of an executed gift followed by an express trust in the form of an account for it and its accrued interest; remaining unrevoked or denied by the decedent up to the time of his death. It cannot be doubted then, that Crawford intended to fasten upon himself and his estate an admitted gift and to become a trustee of the fund. Who are they that say his admission and declared trust shall be avoided because there was no formal handing over and handing back of the money ? Mere volunteers \u2014 persons who are bound by his acts ? What greater right have they to impeach his solemn admission of the receipt, and the acknowledged trust exhibited by his book, than a voluntary assignee has to deny the act of his assignor ? In Rogers v. Fales, 5 Barr 158, it was held that a voluntary assignee does not represent creditors, and cannot question the conduct of his principal in permitting his wife to appropriate articles of ornament and furniture. Then it is clear that the burden of proof is thrown on these volunteers to lift the trust from the estate, and how do they propose to prove this ? Not by disproof of the full intention to give, or of the intention to treat the gift as executed, or the intention to hold as trustee of the fund \u2014 not by disproof of the entries on the books, or of a counter charge or a withdrawal of the credit, or indeed of anything to prove an alteration of the mind of the husband, but merely to prove there was no formal passing of the money between them.\nBut this was a useless ceremony between husband and wife where there is a clear executed intention to become the trustee of the fund for her benefit. In order to make such a formality effective, a witness must be called to see him hand the money to her and straightway receive it back. But of what greater efficacy would this be than the husband\u2019s own admission in his book and his express direction to his book-keeper ? The difference is clearly one of the merest form and not of substance. Lex non prcecipii inutilia; quia inutilis labor stultus. Of what possible use can it be to go through a mere ceremony where the evident intent is to assume immediate possession as a trustee ? I cannot see that the facts of this transaction have less force, when properly viewed, than those in Herr\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. & S. 494. There the subject of the gift was money unaccompanied with any declaration amounting to a trust. There money was kept in a lower or false bottom of a trunk to which the husband had access at all times, and. to which he often went without the presence of his wife. The money continued just as much within his actual dominion as if it had been kept by him in another place. There was no evidence of actual delivery or passing over of the money, as the gift was inferred from the declarations of the husband that the money was his wife\u2019s, his keeping it in the lower division of the trunk, apart from his other money, his adding to it from time to time and taking none away, and his wife\u2019s carrying the keys. There was no formal delivery, no counting of the money, no specific sum stated by him; indeed the sum was not known except as a probable or supposed amount, so that the case in fact rested directly on the declarations of the husband, and the setting aside that much money apart from his own; while his actual access and control over it, and the legal unity of person, made the possession as much his own as his wife\u2019s. On this point see Larkin v. Mullin, 13 Wright 34.\nHow in the case before us there was a most distinct setting apart to the wife of a specific sum, stated to his wife as actually done, or- \u201c added,\u201d as he expressed it, declared expressly to his book-keeper, its receipt solemnly acknowledged by written entry in his book, mingled with her undoubted funds in the account, and increased by accumulated interest on the total sum; the whole constituting an acknowledged gift and a superadded trust. Flowers\u2019s Case, Hoy 67, is also authority for dispensing with a mere formality where the intent of the party is clearly executed. Thus a nephew returned to his uncle 100 pounds in a bag which he had borrowed, and laid it on the table before him. The uncle said\u2014 \u201cI will not have it; take it, you, and carry it home with you.\u201d This was held to be a good gift by parol, and consequently a good payment of the debt. It is evidently founded on the maxim stated in Hoy, p. 91: \u201c The intent of the party shall be taken according to law.\u201d Without a payment of the debt the gift would be fruitless. Here the husband treated the money as passed between him and his wife, as the uncle did the bag of money, and as Herr did the money in the trunk, though in fact it had not formally passed; and he then declared a trust of it by entering it on his book to his wife\u2019s credit in an account of other moneys he had of hers. Thenceforth it became a trust, and must be so treated. It is this trust which these volunteers must disprove, and not the want of a mere formality dispensed with by the parties in its origin. Herein is the distinction overlooked by the learned auditor whose report the court confirmed. It is not the case of a promise, or a chose in action, but of an acknowledged receipt and a trust.\nIt is admitted that a bond or specialty given, which is but a chose in action, would be recoverable, a consideration being imported by the seal. And yet what is this but a difference in form, a merest shadow, a thing made by the flourish of a pen, where a consideration is often actually wanting ? Why, in such a clear case as this, shall n.ot the transaction follow the form of the instrument which denotes an act done, not a contract to do it ? The intention to be bound for the receipt and care of the money is not less evident than if the instrument were a bond. That a trust differs essentially from a contract, and will be enforced when the latter cannot, is established by authority: Jones v. Lock, Law Rep. 1 Ch. Ap. 25; Ex parte Pye, 18 Ves. 140; Vance v. Vance, 1 Beav. 605.\nWe are of opinion, therefore, that the court below erred in confirming the report of the auditor rejecting the claim of Mrs. Crawford to the sum of $3000, and its interest credited on the book of the decedent. The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court to this extent is reversed, and the record ordered to be remitted with instruction to allow to the appellant the said sum and interest, and to correct the distribution accordingly; and the costs are ordered to be paid out of the estate.",

    "head_matter": "Crawford\u2019s Appeal.\n1. A husband having money of his wife in his possession, purchased a house with his own funds and told her it was to be conveyed to her, she declined to have it. Shortly after he said, \u201cI have added $3000 to your money,\u201d but handed her no money. He directed his clerk to credit her in his books with the $3000 as cash received from her: and it was so done. He credited her regularly with the interest on that sum in connection with the other sums belonging to her till his death. Held, that this was an executed gift followed by an express trust for the wife and payable to her from his estate.\n2. The wife\u2019s claim for the $3000 could not be supported as a debt.\n3. A contract by parol (which includes an unsealed writing) needs a consideration to support it.\n4. When a gift is not executed by delivery, but the determining act remains in fieri, there is no force in the intention to do it.\n5. The effect of such transaction between husband and wife is different from what it would be between strangers, where there are none to contest it but volunteers, who stand equally affected by the act of the husband under whom they claim.\n6. A trust is essentially different from a contract, and will be enforced when a contract will not.\nFebruary 5th 1869.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Agnew Sharswood and Williams, JJ. Read, J., at Hisi Prius.\nAppeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia, in the Estate of Henry M. Crawford, deceased: No. 67, to January Term 1869.\nThe question in this case arose upon the distribution of the personal estate pf Henry M. Crawford, who died intestate without issue, leaving a widow Sarah Crawford and twenty-five nephews and nieces; there were no creditors, claimants on the fund. The personal estate for distribution amounted to $128,750. The distribution was referred to George M. Connaroe, Esq., as auditor.\nThe only disputed claim was that of Sarah Crawford, the widow, for $3000 principal and $702.39 interest, with which she was credited on the hooks of the decedent. These hooks showed an account with Mrs. Crawford commencing December 6th 1846, when she was credited by \u201c her share of the personal estate of Ephraim Hillman, deceased, $314.90,\u201d which was afterwards reduced by payments to her to $300, on this she was credited with interest from time to time, until in 1864 the balance in her favor was $638.75 On January 12th of that year there was a credit in her account, \u201cBy Cash ...... 100\u201d and on May 9th, \u201cBy Cash ..... 3000\u201d\nmaking 3738.75\nThis sum was'carried into the next year\u2019s account as a balance to her credit, and she was credited with interest on the aggregate sum. The last entry on this account in the decedent\u2019s day-book, was:\n\u201c 1866, Jan. 22d. Interest account Dr. to Sarah Crawford,\nFor 1 y\u2019rs interest on $3,936.10 to Jan\u2019y 1, 1866. 236.16.\u201d\nThe auditor reported:\u2014 * * That on May 9th 1864, Mrs. Sarah Crawford was credited (by the express direction of her husband, as testified by his bookkeeper) with the sum of three thousand dollars, as cash received from her. After that date interest, by his direction, was annually credited to her .on his books, on the amount appearing to her credit which embraced the $3000 now in dispute, and the moneys actually received in cash by Mr. Crawford from his wife, which have been already allowed by the auditor with interest.\n\u201c In the balance sheets made up for him annually by his bookkeeper, Mrs. Crawford appeared as a creditor.\n\u201c On behalf of certain of the distributees, Mrs. Crawford herself was called and examined as a witness, and her testimony disclosed the following facts: That Mr. Crawford, a few years since, on purchasing a house on Olive street, told his wife that he would have the deeds for it made out in her name. Mrs. Crawford replied that she did not want the trouble of a house. There was nothing then said about the house after that, and one day Mr. Crawford came in and said to his wife, \u201c I have added $3000 to your little money, and after awhile I am going to give you $3000 more.\u201d He did not hand her the money at the time, nor did- she at any time afterwards receive any portion of the principal or interest of the money standing to her credit in the account he kept with her. The entry of the $3000 on Mr. Crawford\u2019s books was never seen by his wife until after his death.\u201d\nThe auditor concludes his report:\u2014\n\u201c If this acknowledgment had been under seal, the effect might have been quite different. In the language of Holley v. Adams, before cited, the fact that this intended gift \u2018 existed in the nature of a claim against the estate determines the character of it\u2019 and the necessity of legal proof, and the auditor is compelled to treat it as a contract void for want of consideration. \u2019 The claim must therefore be disallowed.\u201d\nMrs. Crawford excepted to the report. The Orphans\u2019 Court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report. She appealed and assigned for error the confirmation of the report.\nJ. B. Townsend and Strong, for appellant.\nIn such cases regard must be had to the relation of the parties and the form of the transaction. An actual technical delivery is unnecessary: Flower\u2019s Case, Noy 67; Kreider v. Boyer, 10 Watts 59. The claim is for the return of money which the husband acknowledged in writing his wife had delivered to him to hold for her use. No action would lie during coverture: Ritter v. Ritter, 7 Casey 396. After the husband\u2019s death his administrators were bound to pay her: Kutz\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 90. A wife by agreement with her husband may acquire separate property without a trustee: McKennan v. Phillips, 6 Whart, 571; Duffy v. Ins. Co., 8 W. & S. 413. A trust for the wife is sustainable although the property comes from the husband and is retained by him, if sufficiently identified: Herr\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. & S. 494; Reade v. Livingston, 3 Johns. Ch. 490; Searing v. Searing, 9 Paige 284; Pinney v. Fellows, 15 Verm. 536; Barron v. Barron, 24 Id. 375; Lucas v. Lucas, 1 Atk. 270; Northey v. Northey, 2 Id. 77; Hill on Trustees 420, note 1.\nJ. B. Collahan, for appellees.\nIt is essential to a valid gift by parol that there should be an actual or symbolical delivery. The title does not pass unless possession, or the means of obtaining it, are conferred by the donor, and accepted by the donee: Cooper v. Burr, 45 Barb. 9; Pennington v. Gittings, 2 Gill & Johns. 208, 216; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 589-90; Wilson v. Carpenter, 17 Wisc. 512; Fenton v. Fenton, 48 Barb. 581; Hook v. Husted, 12 Johns. 189; Dole v. Lincoln, 31 Maine 422; Reed v.

The circumstances here do not create a trust: McLean v. Langland, 5 Ves. 78; Cord on Married Women, \u00a7 593. The agreement was without consideration: Wallingford v. Allen, 10 Peters 583; Cardell v. Rider, 35 Verm. 47; Mews v. Mews, 15 Beav. 529."
