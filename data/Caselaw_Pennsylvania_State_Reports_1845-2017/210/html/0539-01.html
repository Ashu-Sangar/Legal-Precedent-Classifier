It made simply such repairs as were necessary ■ to keep it in passable condition until the improvement could be made, and the testimony indicates that it was not kept in more than passable condition. It is perfectly plain that the city condemned this road for the very purpose of getting rid of the plank and acquiring the right to make an improve2nent that had become a necessity. Nothing can be plainer than that the city did not adopt the worn planking as a pavement for East street. ■</p>

Many of the exceptions filed to the report of the viewers are unsupported by any testimony in the case. The main controversy and the only one that need be noticed was whether the pavement put down by the city was a first pavement, with the cost of which the abutting properties might be charged. The city acquired a plank road which had fallen into bad condition, for the purpose of removing the plank and making a substantial and necessary improvement by widening, grading and paving the thoroughfare. The repairs made by the city were only such as were necessary to keep the planking safe for travel until the permanent improvement could be made. Mere maintenance of a highway by repairs is not a paving of it that will relieve the abutting property from the cost of subsequent improvements changing an ordinary road to a city street: Philadelphia v.
