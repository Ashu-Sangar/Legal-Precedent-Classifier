The dwelling houses of the appellants were appropriated under this resolution and by bill filed in this case they sought by injunction to restrain appellees from taking and condemning the same.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[278,788,1184,1327]]]'>The learned trial judge finds as a fact that the proposed tracks and improvements were in the judgment of the board of directors of that company necessary to increase the facilities for transportation over its railroad. He also found as a fact that they were so necessary. He further found that “ The Glenwood Railroad Company is a corporation of the state of Pennsylvania, created and organized under the provisions of an act of the general assembly of the said state entitled ‘An act to authorize the formation and regulation of railroad corporations ’ approved April 4, 1868, P. L. 62., and the several supplements thereto, and is possessed of all the franchises and powers conferred by said acts, and particularly by the act entitled ‘ An act to enable railroad, canal and slack water navigation companies to straighten, widen, deepen or otherwise improve their lines of railroad, canals and slack water navigation, and the bridges, aqueducts, piers and structures thereof,’ approved March 17, 1869, P. L. 12.” Thus the incorporation of that company, its organization, its franchises and powers to conduct business and to widen and improve under the act of March 17, 1869, are distinctly established. Owing to the exigency arising from increase in population and a consequent enlargement of business the act of 1869 was intended to remove from railroad companies when the necessity of enlargement or improvement arose, the restriction as to dwelling houses contained in the general railroad act of 1849.</p>

Yet the public demand for transportation facilities had to be met. Such were the facts that in 1869 prompted the passage of that act.

To give the act any other meaning, would, in view of the facts, defeat its main purpose. Any house owner could effectually put a stop to any attempt of the company to provide for the safety of persons and property or to furnish increased facilities for transportation.

The power of the board of directors to determine the necessity of widening and improving is lodged with it and its action is conclusive, unless fraud or bad faith be shown. As a lessee company operating a road ordinarily furnishes most of the cars and all that is necessary in the conduct of transportation, a lessor company may deem it necessary to widen its road and improve the leased property in order to meet the demands of the increased business passing over it. In fact the failure of a lessor company so to exercise its power in certain contingencies, might in some cases operate as destructive of important rights of a lessee in the operation of the leased property and thus render its lease almost valueless. In the present case the lessor company, finding that the widening and improvement of the property was necessary and was required for the transportation conducted by the lessees (the other appellees), determined by proper corporate action that the appropriation of the properties in question was necessary. Assuredly its power so to appropriate could not be questioned if done for itself and it certainly does not cease to exist because its exercise might operate to the benefit of its lessees, who could properly request that the power be so exercised by the lessor to meet the exigencies growing out of increased transportation.</p>
