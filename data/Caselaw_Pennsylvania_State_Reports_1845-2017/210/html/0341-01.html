    <p id="b368-9" data-blocks='[["BL_368.13",368,[291,1175,1183,1081]]]'>This was a scire facias sur mortgage, dated January 11, 1873, for the sum of $2,460 payable in five equal annual installments with interest. The first three installments were assigned by the mortgagee, Frances A. O’Hara, to Rebecca R. Phillips, and the executor of the latter subsequently assigned the same to Anna L. Caldwell, the principal beneficiary under her will and the use plaintiff in this case. The mortgagor, John Corr, is also dead and the writ issued against his administratrix, with notice to Harry E. Holman, terre-tenant, who had purchased the mortgaged premises at a sale under a municipal lien. The plaintiff claimed to recover the first three installments due respectively January 11, 1874, 1875 and 1876, with interest. The preecipe was filed and a sci. fa. issued in June, 1902, more than twenty-six years after the last of the three installments fell due. Upon the trial, the plaintiff, after showing that the unsatisfied mortgage was found among Mrs. Phillips’ papers after her death, endeavored to rebut the presumption of payment by calling four witnesses to testify to admissions and declarations made by the mortgagor during his lifetime, and within twenty years, before suit was begun on the mortgage.</p>

This refusal is assigned as error. <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>The only question presented by this appeal is as to the sufficiency of the testimony produced by the appellant to repel the legal presumption arising from lapse of time that this mortgage was paid. This court said in Reed v. Reed, <a href="/pa/46/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="46 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="420615" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0239-01">46 Pa. 239</a> : “ The presumption which the law raises after the lapse of twenty years that a bond or specialty has been paid is in its nature essentially different from the bar interposed by the statute of limitations to the recovery of a simple contract debt.

Runner’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/121/0649-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="121 Pa. 649" data-case-ids="561259" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0649-01">121 Pa. 649</a>, also presents a case where proof of the statements of the debtor to his sister, in the presence of a third person, that he would pay over to her one half the money, being her share on two notes, the notes not being produced, and no amount being mentioned, and that he had come to fix up the notes according to a previously expressed intention, was held to constitute clear, distinct and unequivocal recognition of the debt evidenced by the notes, sufficient to rebut the presumption of payment.</p>

The admissions here were made to one of the plaintiffs, who testified that twice within the preceding five years the defendant had approached him and endeavored to make an arrangement for the settlement of the claim.</p>

He also said that he had paid between $450 and $500 on the property. Subsequently he repeated the conversation and said that he was still being assessed for taxes on the property.</p>
    <p id="b370-6" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[270,1296,1186,870]]]'>Sophia Corr, a daughter of mortgagor, testified that about twelve years before the trial her father had pointed out the mortgaged premises to her and told her “ that he had bought it, but that he could not claim it, that there was a big mortgage against it, and he lost his position and could not pay for it.” He afterwards frequently spoke to her about the property and in 1900, the day before the sheriff’s sale, he went to the courthouse to look it up and in the evening told a Mr. Scott, who called to see him about it, that he was not going to buy it, “ that the mortgage was then over $2,000 and that he could not think of taking a hand in it.” He spoke to her at one time (about 1899) of going to the Phillips residence and talking to Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, both, “that he could not pay for the property. That was just at the time that he lost his position and that he would like them to take two of the lots off his hands, and let him pay the balance on the one. . . . He hadn’t paid anything on the mortgage.”</p>

That after 1882 he frequently spoke of the property and said the same <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>thing, that he could never redeem the mortgage and that they could sell his furniture for it, if they knew he owned it. In 1900 witness heard her father, about the time of the sheriff’s sale, tell Mr. Scott that there was over $2,000 in the mortgage, against the property and that he never could redeem it.</p>
    <p id="b371-4" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[174,642,1175,305]]]'>Mary Creighton testified that, eight or nine years before the trial, the mortgagor told her, referring to the Dearborn street lots, that “ he had bought that property but the mortgage was too great and he could never redeem it.
