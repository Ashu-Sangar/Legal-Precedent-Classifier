The latter presented to the director a claim against the city for damages growing out of the contract over and above the contract price. The director, after notice to the parties, sat as arbitrator and heard the claim. Before he made his award he was removed from office, and th'en declined to complete the arbitration by rendering a decision. A subsequent director, after notice to the parties, sat as arbitrator, but the contractors refused to attend or to submit to the decision which he rendered. Subsequently the contractors brought an action to recover the damages which they claimed. A verdict was rendered in their favor subject to the question of law reserved whether there was any evidence which entitled them to recover. Subsequently the court entered judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto. <em>Held </em>(1) that as the first director had unjustifiably refused to render his decision after his removal from office, the arbitration failed and the jurisdiction of the courts attached; (2)- that the measurement clause and the arbitration clause were not inconsistent with each other, inasmuch as the former applied merely to the measurement of the amount, of work performed while the latter applied to “any question of dispute” between the parties growing out of the contract; (3) that the final estimate of the director was not conclusive; (4) that the award made by the second director was irrelevant and inadshall be taken as the final the contractor, without the <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>missible in evidence; (5) that in reversing the judgment it was not proper under the circumstances to enter judgment on the verdict, but that a new trial should be directed.</p>

These persons or this tribunal become vested with as ample jurisdiction as the courts would have in determining disputes which may arise, if the contract has so provided. The certainty of the person or tribunal, however, is essential. Where a person is named, and he dies, resigns, or refuses to act, unless the contract has provided for the filling of his place, the provision becomes nugatory, and the jurisdiction of the court revests. Where a tribunal is named, that is, a person who, by virtue of a certain office is to decide the dispute, then the person who occupies the office which is named at the time the dispute arises becomes the judge under the contract, and takes jurisdiction of the case. This latter point appears to be squarely ruled in the case of North Lebanon R. R. Co. v.

On April 6,1901, director Wilson, after notice to the parties, satas arbitrator under the terms of the contract and heard the claims of the plaintiffs and defendant.

The first and controlling question for determination is the effect to be given to the reference' of the matters in dispute to director Wilson and his failure to make a decision thereon. The learned trial judge held moved before he made an adjudication arbitrator was terminated, and that ter amounted to nothing and made no change in the rights of the parties.” It is well settled in this state that parties to an executory contract may agree to submit their differences arising out of the contract to a person or tribunal named, whose decision or award shall be final, and that when they do so they cannot seek redress elsewhere until the arbiter agreed upon has been discharged, either by the rendition of an award or otherwise : Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Hocking, <a href="/pa/115/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="115 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="551795" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0407-01">115 Pa. 407</a>. It is conceded that the arbitration clause in the contract under consideration is valid, and required a reference of the dispute to the director of the department of public works as a condition precedent to the right to sue at law. It must also be admitted that had director Wilson made an adjudication before his removal it would have been binding on both parties. Did his removal from office by the city recorder after the dispute had been submitted to, and heard by, the director deprive him of the authority to complete his duties as arbitrator by making an award? We think not. The arbitration clause provides, as we have seen, that “ In case any question or dispute shall arise between the parties, .... said question shall be referred to the director of the department of public works of the city of Pittsburg, whose decision thereon shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all parties.” In referring their differences to director Wilson, it is conceded that the parties complied strictly with this provision of their contract. It designates the official to whom the differences between the parties shall be referred, and he is the individual who holds the official position of director of the department of. public works of the city when the adjudication is demanded: North Leba<a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>non Railroad Co. v.

Simpson, 7 Atlantic Repr. 161. When the dispute arises and the adjudication is called for, the official assumes the position of arbitrator, and his jurisdiction as an individual over the subject-matter of the dispute attaches. He is then the court of the parties whose jurisdiction is conferred by their written contract. The authority to hear and determine the differences between the parties has then vested in a particular individual, and thereafter is in the person and not in the official as such. He then holds two positions : one, director of the department of public works; the other, arbitrator to adjust the dispute between the city and the contractors. The duties of the two positions are separate and distinct, and are in no way interdependent upon each other. The contract invests him with the authority he has assumed, and thereafter neither party can revoke it or prevent him from exercising it, unless the party by so doing is permitted to annul the covenants of his agreement. Having been called upon by the parties to adjust their differences and having entered upon his duties as arbitrator, Wilson’s jurisdiction attached by express authority of the litigants, and he must perform these duties regardless of whether he continues to hold his official position with the city or not. The severance of his relations with the city as director, by resignation or removal, is the end of his authority as such, but it cannot affect his position as arbitrator, the duties of which he has then assumed, and which are those of the individual and not those of the director of the department of public works. The parties unquestionably might have provided by proper stipulations in tlieir agreement for the contingency that has arisen here, and that, upon, the director’s retirement from office, the unfinished part of his duties as arbitrator should be completed by his successor in the office of director, but no provision of that character appears in the contract and we cannot, by construction, insert it in the instrument. Here the dispute had not only been referred to director Wilson but the partios had submitted to him all their proofs, and he had fully heard them, and the only other act to be performed by him in the discharge of his duties as arbitrator was to announce his decision. In the language of Chief Justice Agnisw, in Paist v. Caldwell, <a href="/pa/75/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="75 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1036635" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0161-01">75 Pa. 161</a>, “Un<a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>der such circumstances, it was not in the power of the defendant at the last moment and after the referees had gone far into the case, suddenly to give a notice of revocation and avert a result; ” neither could the arbitrator, it may be added, by declining to make an award accomplish the same result, or clothe another director with the power and authority to hear and determine the dispute which had been referred to Wilson in conformity with the arbitration clause of the agreement.</p>

In this case there is no allegation that Wilson was removed for any cause connected with his duties as arbitrator. But the city charter authorizes the mayor at his pleasure to remove the director and it requires no stretch of the imagination to see how this power may be wielded so as to do great injustice to the other party to contracts of this character. The facts as stated above will disclose how frequent have been the changes in the individuals who have held the office of director of the department of public works in the city of Pittsburg. In less than three years four incumbents of that office have resigned or have been removed and their places filled by an appointment made by the mayor. Justice and fairness therefore require that unless the agreement between the city and its contractor expressly or by clear implication shows such to be the intention of the parties, the contract should not be construed so as to afford the mayor an opportunity to control the award provided for in the arbitration clause of the agreement by exercising his statutory authority of removal from office of the director of the department of public works.</p>

      <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>The learned trial judge was of opinion that North Lebanon Railroad Co. v. McGrann, <a href="/pa/33/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="33 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="988431" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0530-01">33 Pa. 530</a>, ruled this case in favor of the defendant. But in this we think lie is in error. In that case the agreement between the company and the contractor provided that the decision of the chief engineer should be final and conclusive in any dispute that might arise between the parties to the contract. After the completion of the road and one Worrell, who had been the chief engineer of the company during the progress of the work, had left the service of the company, a dispute arose as to the amount due the contractors. The latter, against the objection of the company, referred the dispute under the arbitration clause of the contract to Worrell who made an award in favor of the contractors. Suit having been brought on the award, this court hold that as the engineer had resigned before the adjudication was called for, he was without jurisdiction in the matter. The difference between that case and the one at bar is apparent. There the contract required the dispute to be referred to the chief engineer but at the time of the reference to Worrell he had severed his relations with the company and no longer held the position and hence was not “ competent by virtue of his office ” to act as arbitrator. Here, the contract provided that the differences should be referred to the director of the department of public works which position Wilson held when the dispute arose and was referred to him and he heard the parties. Nor do we agree that the opinion in the McGrann case sustains the position of the trial court in this case. It is there said that “ he alone could have awarded who was in office when the adjudication was called for.” The subsequent suggestion in the opinion of the court that the company had the right to have the claim determined by an arbitrator who at the time of deciding should stand in an official relation to it, when read in connection with the language of the opinion quoted above, makes it apparent, as suggested in the argument of counsel, that the learned justice who delivered the opinion regarded the hearing and decision by the arbitrator as practically contemporaneous acts.</p>

The learned trial judge placed an erroneous construction upon the measurement clause of the contract. His interpretation of the clause in question, as suggested in the argument, entirely eliminates the arbitration clause from the contract and renders it wholly ineffective and useless. We cannot presume that such was the intention of the parties and unless the language of the instrument forbids, we must hold both clauses to be operative. Under the measurement clause, it was the duty of the director to measure the work and upon that measurement to estimate, according to the contract price, the amount of compensation due the contractors for the work performed. This the director did from time to time during the progress of the work and the estimates were paid the contractors, except the last, which was made after the completion of the boulevard. The clause of the contract in question provides that “ the estimate and certificate of the director of the department of public works shall be final and conclusive evidence of the amount of work performed by the said contractor under and by virtue of this agreement, and shall be taken as a full measure of compensation to be received by the contractor, without the right of exception or appeal.” What is final and conclusive on the parties under this clause are the estimate made by the director from his measurements and his certificate as to'the “ amount of work performed ” and “ the compensation to be received ” therefor by the contractors according to the contract price. There is no “ right of exception or appeal ” by either party to or from the decision of the director on these matters. Both parties are concluded. But save as to these matters, the jurisdiction of the director under this clause does not extend to “ any question or dispute ” between the parties growing out of the contract. The arbitration clause, unless otherwise stipulated in other clauses of the contract, must be invoked for the adjustment of such questions by the director in his capacity as arbitrator. There is no conflict between the two clauses. They are entirely consistent with each other. The duty and authority of the director under each clause are clearly defined and the purpose of each is plainly disclosed. We therefore <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>think the trial judge erred in holding that “ the clause in regard to the final estimate of work done will .... prevent plaintiff from recovering in this case.” In submitting the disputes of the parties to director McOandless in 1902 under the arbitration clause, it is apparent that the city officials were then of the opinion that the measurement clause did not prevent the plaintiffs from submitting to an arbitrator for bis decision the disputes arising out of the claims which had been referred to director Wilson and for which this action was brought.</p>
    <p id="b305-3" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[149,836,1177,863]]]'>B. On the theory on which the case was tried in the court below, the award made by director McOandless, more than a year after this action was brought, was clearly irrelevant to the issue being tried and should not have been admitted as evidence. The learned judge having held on the trial of the cause that the court had jurisdiction, the award and its findings were not admissible in evidence for any purpose. And under our view of the legal effect of the reference proceedings before director Wilson, as expressed above, the McOandless award should have been excluded from the consideration of the jury. It was wholly immaterial whether an award had been made by him as director of the department of public works or what his findings were. The jurisdiction of the court having attached, the matters in dispute between the parties were to be adjudicated by a court and jury as though the arbitration clause of the contract had never had any existence.</p>

We, however, do not intend to assume the duties of the trial court and the jury and determine the law and the facts of the case. The judgment we are reviewing was entered upon the verdict as an entirety and not upon the findings of the jury on the separate items of the appellants’ claim. This is not the city’s appeal and the record discloses no alleged errors of which it can complain here. But aside from these considerations, we think the error committed by the court in admitting in evidence the McOandless award requires us to direct the case to be tried again. We are by no means satisfied that the admission of <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>this testimony was harmless error, notwithstanding the learned judge on the motion to strike out the testimony said he would “ limit the award to the extent merely that it shows that director McCandless sat as an arbitrator under the contract and made an award. ” What effect the award had on the jury is, of course, not known. But in connection with the offer, it appeared by the testimony of director McCandless that the appellants refused to appear before him and submit any testimony to him as arbitrator, thereby denying his authority to adjust the differences between them and the city. Admitting the award under these circumstances when offered by the city may have discredited the claim of the appellants with the jury; the claim was $384,000, while the verdict was about $134,000, or a little above one third of the appellants’ demand. The importance of the case to both parties seems to require another trial, unembarrassed by the legal question settled by this appeal.</p>

But it seems from the opinion of a bare majority of this court, a great municipality which of all corporations most needs the protection of the law to shield it from the litigation of un■founded claims, cannot by any possible contract avoid such result. I had earnestly hoped, from an observation extending over years in this court, that we had about reached a point where such contracts as the one before us would have been adjudged inviolable in the absence of fraud, accident or mistake in the making or procuring of it. But the judgment entered to-day forces me to the conclusion that I was mistaken. It throws wide open the door, which I had hoped was about to be effectually closed. The result is what is most to be deplored, not to the city alone for if that were all it would be the consequence of only a single judicial mistake, but it is to be deplored in its probable results to the hundreds of the three classes of cities in the state and the public at large.

The case went to trial before court and jury and plaintiffs got a <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>verdict for §184,427.64 subject to a question of law reserved, “ Whether there was any evidence which entitled the plaintiff to recover.” The court in opinion filed afterwards entered judgment for defendant. Director McCandless of the department of public works had all the plaintiffs’ claims for damages and extras under the arbitration clause in the agreement, which we have quoted, before him and had made an award of a comparatively small sum in their favor. From the evidence it was undisputed, that at the date of the execution of the contract E. M. Bigelow was director of public works who continued in office until June 11, 1900, when he was succeeded by George W. Wilson, who held office until June 11, 1901, when he was removed and E. M. Bigelow, his predecessor, was appointed. He held office until November 25,1901, when he was succeeded by J. G. McCandless, who held office until April 1,1903, when E. M. Bigelow, who still holds the office, was appointed. While Wilson was in office he heard the claim of the parties but made no decision, being removed from office for political reasons before reaching one. Director McCandless took the matter up, notified both parties to appear; plaintiffs denied his jurisdiction and refused to <em>appear; </em>he took up their proofs they had presented before director Wilson, and heard those of the city and awarded plaintiffs §34,120. The plaintiff's claimed at the trial in the court below that this award was not binding on them because Wilson, who had taken jurisdiction, had gone out of office and his duties did not devolve upon his successor.
