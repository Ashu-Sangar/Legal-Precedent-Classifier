Both these undertakings were promptly carried into execution.

A contract for the execution of the work, according to the specifications, with sureties for its faithful performance, having been prepared, the same was approved by one of the judges of the court of common pleas on September 26, 1903, and on the 29th of the same month the county commissioners awarded the contract for the work to the relators, and executed the contract in the form in which it had been approved by said judge.

The provision of the statute material to the inquiry is as follows: “ The county commissioners .... before making any contract for the erection of any new building or buildings, bridge or bridges, .... shall, by public advertisement, printed in not less than two weekly newspapers of the county, if so many be published therein, where the contract is to be awarded, for not less than four weeks, .... invite sealed proposals for the same accord<a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>ing to the specifications, which shall be written or printed in a book to be kept by the commissioners for that purpose, and kept open for the inspection of all persons for at least four weeks before the time appointed by said advertisement for the opening of said sealed proposals, and which, at the time fixed, shall be publicly opened and the contract awarded to the lowest bidder or bidders.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b59-4" data-blocks='[["BL_59.4",59,[147,738,1177,770]]]'>The specifications for the work in question had been of record in the office of the commissioners for a period considerably longer than four weeks. The commissioners determined to fix the time for the opening of the sealed proposals for July 9, 1903, at one o’clock p. M. The invitation for sealed proposals was first published in daily newspapers, beginning more than four weeks prior to the time fixed for the opening of the bids; The statute requires the publication to be in weekly newspapers,' a term which has a well-recognized meaning, that is, a newspaper published once in each week. A publication in a daily paper was not in accordance with the requirements of the statute, and such publication must be eliminated from the consideration of this question in its legal sense, however material it might be if the good faith of the officers representing thé county had been called in question. .</p>

The notice was in due form and the invitation was for sealed proposals until one o’clock p. M., Thursday, July 9,1903, at which time the bids were publicly opened in accordance with the terms of the notice. The only question is whether this publication in the weekly papers was in accordance with the provisions of the statute.</p>

The purpose of this statute is to secure competitive bidding, upon equal terms, under conditions which give to all bidders full and accurate information as to the character of the work to be performed. The means used to accomplish the end are the two require<a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>ments, <em>(a) </em>That the specifications shall be a matter of public record “ for at least four weeks ” before the opening of the bids; (5) That the commissioners shall “ by public advertisement, printed in not less than two weekly newspapers of the county, .... for not less than four weeks, invite sealed proposals for the same, according to the specifications.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b60-5" data-blocks='[["BL_60.4",60,[280,674,1186,819]]]'>The requirement in each case involves the element of time. The specifications must be of record “ at least four weeks; ” the invitation to bid on the specifications must be “ printed in not less than two weekly newspapers .... for not less than four weeks.” The invitation must refer to the specifications, in this there evidently was a purpose. An invitation to bid without a reference to the specifications as to the work to be done, would be a useless and absurd thing. The things required are intended to contribute to the same end, and in order to be effective they must be done at the same time. The record of the specifications could not accomplish the purpose of the statute if the attention of bidders was not called to the undertaking; the advertisement for bids would amount to nothing if it did not, as required by the statute, refer to the record of the specifications. The expression “not less than four weeks” is the exact equivalent of “ at least four weeks.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b60-6" data-blocks='[["BL_60.5",60,[277,1501,1185,821]]]'>When the legislature enacted that the invitation to bid should be printed, in weekly newspapers for not less than four weeks, and in the same connection required that the specifications upon which the bids were to be submitted should be of record at least four weeks, the. legislative intention manifestly was that these periods of time should be concurrent. The four weeks during which the advertisement must be published, are the same four weeks during which the specifications must be of record; to fix one is to determine the other. The requirement as to the specifications is that they must be of record and open to the inspection of all persons for at least four weeks before the time appointed for the opening of the proposals. This requirement would not be met by having the specifications of record for months before if they were permitted to be withdrawn from the record during any part of the last four weeks immediately prior to the opening of the bids.</p>

The requirement as to the specifications is not that they shall be of record for a certain number of days in the week, they must be of record every day of the four weeks; that is, full twenty-eight days immediately prior to the opening of the bids. This determines the four weeks during which the public advertisement of the invitation to bidders must be printed in the weekly newspapers. A weekly newspaper, regularly issued, must necessarily be printed four times, that is it must have four publications within those four weeks. The commissioners have a discretion to advertise for a longer period, but no antecedent advertisement could excuse the failure to advertise weekly during the last four weeks immediately prior to the day upon which the bids are opened.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b61-4" data-blocks='[["BL_61.4",61,[133,1111,1182,1014]]]'>The relation of the things required to be done by this statute to each other, the manifest intention that the publication shall be during the same period that the specifications are on file, and the clearly defined purpose that the latter period must be the four weeks ending with the day before the proposals are opened, lead us to the conclusion that the period during which the advertisement required by this statute must be printed in two weekly newspapers, for four weeks, is the last twenty-eight days prior to the opening of the bids. Computing backward from July 9, 1903, it appears, that, under the undisputed facts of this case, the advertisement was regularly published in two weekly newspapers during each week of said period. This answered the requirements of the statute. The invitation to bidders must be published weekly, four times, in two weekly newspapers, but the first publication is not required to be twenty-eight days before the opening of the bids. The period during which the specifications are required to be of record must determine the days upon which the weeks ai’e to be considered as beginning and ending, for the purposes of this statute.</p>

Wunch it might be enough to say that it has been overruled as having overlooked the limited scope of the act there in question, and the saving clause of another to which it was in effect only a supplement: Com. ex rel. v. Couch, <a href="/pa/209/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="209 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="936107" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0354-01">209 Pa. 354</a>. The decision, however, was founded on the same principle as Com. ex rel. v. Macferron, but an improvident expression in the brief per curiam opinion has led appellant to give the case much too wide a scope. “ Since the adoption of the present constitution,” said Justice Williams, “ the legislature has sought to bring about uniformity in the administration of the affairs of counties and townships as well as those of cities and boroughs. The constitution requires this, and we have felt constrained to interpret statutes relating to these subjects in the light of the constitutional requirements.” This was an inadvertent slip in expression. The constitution makes no requirement of uniformity, and the courts have neither desire nor authority to bring about such a result <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>except in obedience to a statutory expression of the legislative intent. What the constitution does require as to legislation upon the affairs of counties, municipalities, etc., under sec. 7 of article 3, is that it shall not be local or special, but general. Uniformity is not in itself a requirement, but one of the tests, judicially established, of the question whether an act is local, special or general, and it is nothing more : Stegmaier v. Jones, <a href="/pa/203/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="203 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="994741" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0047-01">203 Pa. 47</a>.</p>
    <p id="b64-5" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[292,787,1187,301]]]'>What these cases decide and are authority for, is that as the legislative intent in the classification of municipalities is apparent, to make a uniform system and framework of government, public officers, powers and duties in each class, the presumption is that as to such matters, local acts must give way to the general act of classification, wherever they conflict.</p>
    <p id="b64-6" data-blocks='[["BL_64.5",64,[288,1096,1190,1274]]]'>This modification of the rule, however, must not be pushed too far, but confined to the subjects to which the legislative intent clearly applies. The constitution itself does not compel uniformity by the repeal of local laws, even in the article prohibiting local legislation. It was held in Evans v. Phillipi <a href="/pa/117/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="117 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="555822" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0226-01">117 Pa. 226</a>, that “ the constitution in its prohibitions of special legislation is prospective only, and does not effect a repeal of local statutes with inconsistent provisions in force at the time of its adoption; nor was its intent and meaning that all future legislation should be conditional on the repeal of such local laws.” Even in Com. ex rel. v. Macferron, which perhaps goes farthest in that direction, the decision is carefully limited and it is held that classification of cities is for the purpose of regulating “ the exercise of certain corporate powers, and the number, character, powers and duties of certain corporate officers ” and that the legislative intent is equally plain “ to leave each city in the full enjoyment of all its powers, rights and privileges not superseded by the uniform scheme or plan of municipal government provided for the class into which such city may come. As was held in Com. ex rel. v. Wyman, <a href="/pa/137/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="137 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="821459" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0508-01">137 Pa. 508</a> the transition of. a city from one class to another works such change in its government as the law makes necessary to adjust it to the class into which it goes. In other respects it works no change, but the city brings all its municipal belongings with it into the new class.”</p>

    <p id="b65-11" data-blocks='[["BL_65.10",65,[142,1673,1181,612]]]'>Regarding the acts of 1870 and 1895 in the light of these rules it is clear that the former is not repealed unless there is evidence in the language of the latter that such was the intent. The act of 1870 is a local act, and could not now be passed in view of the prohibitions in section 7 of article 3. But the constitution did not repeal it, nor did it command the legislature to do so. The act of 1895 was not passed to carry out any constitutional mandate, and its effect therefore must be limited by the rule as to local and general acts, unless its language and purpose indicate an intent to establish a uniformity on the subject of its provisions that shall be compulsory even upon local and special acts.</p>

The scope of the two acts is not the same nor do either the titles or the language of the two indicate that the <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>legislature had the same subject in contemplation. The title of the act of 1870 relates to contracts by county commissioners and the act is primarily a limitation on the commissioners’ power. Prior to its passage, and in counties to which it did not apply, the commissioners being duly authorized by two grand juries and the quarter sessions under the act of 1884 to build a courthouse or county building, made the contract at their own discretion as to size, style, cost, etc., without- reference to the approval of any other official: Mahon v. Luzerne Co., <a href="/pa/197/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="197 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="918687" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0001-01">197 Pa. 1</a>, 18. But by the provisions of the act of 1870, before .making any contract for the erection of new buildings, or bridges, or for alteration or addition thereto, the commissioners' are required to take certain proceedings, among which is obtaining the approval of one of the judges of the common pleas.' It is a carefully drawn act covering the subject with much particularity and detail. There may have been a reason why the commissioners in the counties named should be deprived of some of the powers exercised by commissioners in other counties. Whatever the reasons may have been, we must assume that special and local conditions required this special and local change in the law, and there is nothing to show that the legislature regarded these conditions as having ceased in those counties or having newly arisen in the rest of the state.</p>
    <p id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[265,1547,1190,615]]]'>The act of 1895, on the other hand, is a single section of eleven lines, in general terms, with little detail, and of narrower scope. Its provisions are confined to “ the erection of a court house, -jail or other county building.” The building of bridges and of alterations or additions to county buildings, is left under the act of 1870 or under the general powers of commissioners in other counties to which that act does not extend. The subjects of the two acts, therefore, though closely related, are not identical, and it does not seem reasonable to suppose that the legislature regarded them as the same’and meant the later act to repeal part of the earlier one, leaving so important a portion of the subject admittedly untouched.</p>
