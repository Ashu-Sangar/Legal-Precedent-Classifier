It was located about eleven feet distant from the line of the street in question and was eleven feet in length and nearly eight feet in width and was sunk into the ground about twelve inches. The kettle annexed to it was used to melt tar and grease which ran into it and when cold this material was cut into pieces and used in the mill of appellant. Its top was a few inches above the surface of the ground surrounding it and was not protected. The kettle was near the line of the street and the vat beyond it making its distance from the street as above stated.</p>
    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.8",355,[171,1609,1175,715]]]'>Appellant’s negligence it was contended by appellees arose from placing a dangerous and unprotected vat in such close proximity to the street, that their son fell into it and met with the accident which resulted in his death. The determination of such negligence depends upon the resolution of the questions whether the vat as constructed, filled with boiling materials and unprotected, with but three or four inches above the level of the surface of the ground surrounding it and located in close proximity to the street made it dangerous, and whether the space between it and the street was such that a child would be likely to stroll there and become exposed to peril. These questions were for the jury and were properly left to it by the learned trial judge, and the jury by its verdict resolved them against the appellant.</p>

Unlike an ordinary private alley, this passage was often open, and therefore liable to the incursions of children and even grown persons, from thoughtlessness, accident or curiosity. Now the inclined way which did the injury was a dangerous trap. It was a heavy platform weighing ' 800 or 900 pounds, attached by hinges within eighteen or twenty inches of the wall, and when lowered it fell across the cartway. When not lowered it stood upright against the wall, leaning so little beyond the center of gravity that a jar or a slight pull would cause it to fall forward. It fell in this instance, caught four children beneath it, one had his neck broken, another his hands mashed and two escaped under the cavity. It was held up by no hook or other fastening, but merely rested by its own slight weight beyond the equipoise, ready therefore to catch children, like mice, beneath a dead fall. When wagons passed it was often held up by hand, and a witness saw it fall against the wheels. <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>Now can it be righteously said that the owner of such a dangerous trap, held by no fastening, so liable to drop, so near a public thoroughfare, so often open and exposed to the entries of persons on business, by accident or from curiosity, owes no duty to those who will be probably there ? ”</p>

In that case the child entered the defendant’s premises without even an implied permission, and through a gate which had been but casually left open, nevertheless we said that, as tho company maintained so dangerous a trap in a place near to a highway where children were wont to congregate for their own amusement the jury must determine, in view of all the circumstances, whether it was bound to provide against a contingency such as that which happened.”</p>

The distinction between that case and this is marked and obvious. There the accident happened in a private passage or cartway adjoining a factory, where several kinds of business were carried on in different stories, and was caused by a heavy platform employed as an inclined plane to move heavy articles <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>into and out of the building. When used it was lowered so as to cover jbhe pavement of the cartway. When not in use it was raised on hinges that connected one side of it within eighteen inches 'of the wall, was not fastened at the upper side and was so nearly at equipoise that slight force was required to draw it down. The cartway opened from a public street, where people were constantly passing and children were often at play. There was a gate at the street end, and this was frequently left open. It was so left at the time of the accident, when four children intruded into the cartway, and their thoughtless tampering with the platform resulted in drawing it down upon themselves, and in producing injury to the child of the plaintiff’s from which he died. This court affirmed a verdict and judgment for damages in common pleas. No cause was ever more justly decided.” Again it is said : “ The children were trespassers; certainly, but they were children and the defendants were bound to have regard to the reckless and thoughtless tastes and traits of childhood.”</p>

The mother of the child testified that she never allowed her children upon the street, but that upon the day of the accident she told them to go into the yard' around which was a fence. That there was a gate in it through which people came to get water and she cautioned the children not to go into the street. The test of negligence under such circumstances is stated in the opinion of Mr. Justice Mestrezat in Del Rossi v. Cooney, <a href="/pa/208/0233-02" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="208 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="998057,998140" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0233-02,/pa/208/0233-01">208 Pa. 233</a>:</p>

The care thus required, however, is <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>only such as persons of reasonable prudence of the same class and with the same means, ordinarily exercise and deem adequate to protect their children from danger. ”</p>

    <p id="b359-8" data-blocks='[["BL_359.8",359,[168,853,1178,1492]]]'>On the facts of this case I would reach a different conclusion from that of the court below and the majority here. But the dangerous construction here was not far from the public street and appears to have been easily accessible from it. The case is therefore a close one and the submission of it to the jury might be sustained on its facts without great stretch of principle. But I most earnestly dissent from the effort to recognize the case of Hydraulic Works Co. v. Orr, <a href="/pa/83/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="83 Pa. 332" data-case-ids="1050757" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0332-01">83 Pa. 332</a>. The opinion of the majority refers to it as having “ become like a shuttlecock in battledore to be pitched up and down.” The reason is not far to seek. The case was a departure from settled principles, was wrongly decided, and has never commanded the general approval of professional opinion either at the bar or on the bench. In the very next subsequent case that arose in this court, Gramlich v. Wurst, <a href="/pa/86/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="86 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1056589" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0074-01">86 Pa. 74</a>, it was practically overruled, for though Justice Woodward makes an effort to distinguish the cases, yet the distinction is merely in the details of fact and not in principle, and when he says that “ no cause was ever more justly decided ” he does not say more correctly or more legally decided, and his dictum is manifestly based on humane sentiment rather than on settled law. The two cases are absolutely irreconcilable in principle, and Gramlich v. Wurst, restored the ancient and established law. What little -was left of authority in Hydraulic Works Co. v. Orr, was practically ended by Gillespie v. McGowan, <a href="/pa/100/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="100 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="498410" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0144-01">100 Pa. 144</a>, though there again the mistake was made of setting up an unsubstantial distinction, instead of overruling the case absolutely. The same view was again taken in Horstick v. Dunkle, <a href="/pa/145/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="145 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="825889" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0220-01">145 Pa. 220</a>.</p>

Abernethy, <a href="/pa/112/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="112 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="546567" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0437-01">112 Pa. 437</a>, and since then the <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>case has, as the majority say, been pitched up and down like a shuttlecock. And it will so continue, for the decision is wrong and the ghost of error will not be laid. The settled-common-law rule, followed in Gramlich v. Wurst, that a landowner is not liable for injury to a trespasser from a ditch or an open quarry or other obstruction on his own land unless it is so near the public highway that a traveler lawfully using the highway may accidentally or without intended trespass fall into it, is the only safe and permanent guide. The fact that the person injured is a child is immaterial because under the circumstances there was no negligence of the defendant.</p>
