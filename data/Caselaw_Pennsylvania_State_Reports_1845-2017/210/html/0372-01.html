In the return to the alternative writ of mandamus awarded (actual issuance of which was formally waived by the defendant), all material facts are admitted, and the respondent contends that the act of April 14, 1903, is unconstitutional so far as it attempts to increase the salaries of all judges in commission at the date of its approval; that it is his duty as state treasurer to prevent unlawful disbursements of public money to any person or persons; and the right of the attorney general to appear as relator is denied, and it is contended therein that the commonwealth is not a proper plaintiff.</p>

L. 345, relating to mandamus, sections 3 and 4, provides that “ the writ of mandamus may issue upon the application of any person beneficially interested,” and that “ when the writ is sought to procure the enforcement of a public duty the proceedings shall be prosecuted in the name of the Commonwealth on the relation of the Attorney General.” Upon the objections raised as to the right of the attorney general to appear as relator, and as to whether the commonwealth is a proper plaintiff, it is necessary to consider whether the writ in this case is to compel the enforcement of what is meant by public duty and defined as such under the law. If every act of the state treasurer which he lawfully does in his capacity as a public officer is to be considered as a performance of a public duty, then the performance of every act which he refused or neglected to do would come within the meaning of the section of the act of assembly referred to, and the proceeding would be in the name of the commonwealth. It is obvious that such a test is too broad, because, while all citizens are, in a certain sense, as a part of the ethics of good government, interested in the proper discharge of every duty owed by a public officer to an individual merely as a private person, still the neglect of such a duty is in itself not a wrong to the public. It is the presence of a common wrong which arises from the neglect of a duty and which determines, among <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>other things, whether the duty is a public one. The fact that the common Wrong may also induce a private injury does not in any way invalidate the test nor make the wrong any the less a public one.</p>

The public at large is most essentially and materially interested in the maintenance of the judiciary as one of the necessary and independent divisions of the government; the constitution requires that they shall be paid by the state an adequate compensation, and the question is one of such public importance that the enforcement of the public duty to pay, under authority of law, the salaries of the judiciary, is one which should not depend upon the willingness of any individual judge, in his private capacity, to attempt to enforce his right as a matter of private benefit.</p>

The proper way, however, to attack a return is by motion to quash or demurrer. Here the answer constitutes the return in ordinary cases, and therefore the motion to strike out might be proper practice if it were a case where a motion to quash a return would be entertained; but bearing in mind that the motion to quash is only granted where a return is frivolous and clearly bad, the motion to strike out must be treated as a demurrer to the answer, and on demurrer the whole question of law, including that of the goodness of the writ itself, is considered.</p>

The court in a per curiam opinion said: “ The act referred to requires him to receive and record these papers; his duties were purely ministerial, and the court below properly awarded the peremptory mandamus.

It is within the power and the duty of the legislature, and of the legislature alone, to determine, in the first instance, what is adequate compensation, and after this determination has been reached, then it is the right of the judges to receive what is fixed. It cannot, with any show of practical reasoning, be argued that this word “ fixed ” means that when the legislature has once fixed salaries under the mandate, that their power is exhausted. Such a construction would make a dead thing out of the constitution, and would be entirely contrary to the latter-day spirit of constitutional construction. Mr. Justice Paxson, in Wheeler v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/77/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="77 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="436265" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0338-01">77 Pa. 338</a>, well expresses his thought when he says : “ We will not presume that the framers of that instrument (the constitution), or the people who ratified it, intended that the machinery of their state government should be so bolted and riveted down by the fundamental law as to be unable to move and perform its necessary functions.”</p>

There is no possible explanation that appeals to the reason of man except the common sense explanation that is conveyed by the words themselves, which have been judicially construed as before shown. But the objection has been made that when the legislature once fixed the salary, as to judges taking office under the salary as fixed, they were bound by the salary existing at the time of their election and taking of office, and that any change of salary that would bring about an increase could only lawfully apply to judges taking office after the approval of the act. Certainly this cannot be so on any general principle of law, for to so hold we would have to consider that a judge, in accepting a term with a definite salary attached to it at the time, entered into a contractual engagement with the state that he would serve out his term without an increase of salary.

In construing the constitution we must constantly keep in mind the fundamental distinctions which exist among the three great departments of the government—the legislative, the executive and the judicial. All parts of the constitution should be considered of equal authority and binding operation, and understood and construed so as not to conflict with one another, and it is inconceivable to think that the mandatory provision as to the adequacy of judicial salaries, relating exclusively to that department of the government, the upholding of the independence of which has always been one of the greatest cares of the people, is to be rendered inoperative and made nugatory by a general provision, couched in the most general terms, located in another part of the constitution which deals with the restrictions and regulations of the legislative power.</p>

It is not essential to the question before the court to decide as to the right of the legislature to diminish the salary of a judge during the term for which he may have been elected, and we do not make any decision on that point at this time, but we state most emphatically that it is our belief that the legislature have no right to diminish the salary of a judge during the term for which he may have been elected, and that this protection to the judiciary is not in any sense dependent upon section 13 of article III of the present constitution of the state. The case of Com. v. Mann, <em><a href="/watts-serg/5/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 403" data-case-ids="477759" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0403-01">5 </a></em><a href="/watts-serg/5/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 403" data-case-ids="477759" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0403-01">W. &amp; S. 403</a>, establishes this point, to our mind, beyond a doubt. It is perfecty true that that case was decided under the old constitution of 1838, which contained in the judiciary section the words, “ an adequate compensation to be fixed by law, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office,” and that the phrase, “ shall not be diminished during their continuance in office,” was stricken from the present constitution and is not to be found therein, but, nevertheless, anyone who reads that case carefully will see that Judge Rogers did not found his decision exclusively upon that phrase in the old constitution, but founded it on fundamental constitutional principles underlying the entire structure of our constitutional government. We will cite the words of the judge: “If, by the remarks already made, I have succeeded in establishing the position that the complete independence of the judiciary is a fundamental principle of the Constitution, designed mainly for the protection of public and private rights, and that the construction put upon that clause of the Constitution aims a fatal blow at it, then may I not here safely rest the argument ?

      <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>In that case the relator, a judge, on going into office, was entitled to receive from the commonwealth a salary of $1,600 per annum. This salary was afterwards increased $400 per annum, and, subsequently, the legislature repealed the increase. The relator asked for the salary as increased, on the ground that the legislature had no right to reduce his salary during the term for which he had been elected. The answer made to this was that he went in at a fixed salary of $1,600 per annum, and that the legislature had not attempted to decrease that fixed salary, but that the extra $400 was a mere gratuity, and could be taken away by the legislature just as it was given. Let us see what Judge Roghgus said as to this. After tracing the historical development of the recognized right of the judiciary to a fixed and adequate compensation, reference is made on page 408 to the then constitution of Pennsylvania, and the opinion goes on to say: “ They have not ordered a permanent salary simply, but they have directed an adequate salary to be provided, thereby securing, as far as human laws could do, the independence of that invaluable and indispensable branch of government. If, then, these views • be correct, and that they are cannot be reasonably questioned, it follows that any constuction, come from what quarter it may, which tends to defeat or nullify this fundamental and vital principle of constitutional law, must be unsound. And now let us examine the grounds of the respondents’ return. A distinction is attempted between judges appointed after and before the act of July 19, 1839, the act by which the Legislature increased the salary of the relator. Whilst it is admitted that the former are entitled to receive their increased salary, it is denied that the latter are in the same situation. The propriety of the distinction I confess myself unable to perceive. The sum of the argument is, that because the Legislature thought proper, by way of gratuity, as it is called, to add to the salary of the relator, they have the right, notwithstanding the constitutional prohibition, to take it away. That the power that can create can likewise destroy. But this, it is obvious, is an unsound position, as it by no means follows that because, for reasons which will be hereafter stated, they thought it right and just to increase the compensation of the relator, they are at liberty to withdraw it under the pretext that, as it was a gratuity, they were not constrained from re<a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>suming their bounty when they deemed it expedient. But to test the correctness of the argument let us inquire what is the inevitable result of the position assumed by the respondent? If admitted in the extent claimed, and it is not susceptible of limitation, does it not lead to the entire frustration of the very object which the framers of the Constitution had in view, and which they have guarded with such sedulous care ? If it be correct that the power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over his will, what instrument better calculated to give the Legislature an undue and improper influence over the judicial department of the government than by an address in the manner proposed to their hopes as well as their fears. As, for example, take the case in hand. Here the Legislature have assumed the control of the relator so far as he could be influenced by the possession or loss of $400 a year. Cases may occur when, with the aid of the additional salary, it may be merely a decent support of himself and family. A power, therefore, to reduce it may, it is obvious, be equivalent to a power to deprive him of office altogether.”</p>

If they can pass a law reducing the salaries of judges, then they can pass a law <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>practically sweeping away the salaries entirely, and if they can practically sweep away the salaries—“ the power over a man’s subsistence amounting to a power over his will”—-they can crush and destroy the whole judicial department of the government. If this is possible, then the legislature by an act could destroy the government itself, for the judiciary is a co-ordinate branch of the government, without which the whole fabric would be bound to fall to pieces. Therefore, it is most plain that the judiciary do not need the alleged protection given by section 18 of article III to preserve them against diminishment of salary. Not only the mandate that the legislature shall keep judicial salaries up to an adequate standard, but the actual structure of our constitutional government is the protection given. The legislature is ordered by the people to keep salaries up to an adequate standard, and it is' for them, from time to time, to say in the first instance what is adequate. What they may concede to be adequate may be or become more than adequate, but that would not give the legislature power to reduce. That right we have no doubt does not rest with the legislature, but rather is a judicial question. The judiciary might voluntarily, if the needs of the government required it, surrender a portion of their fixed salaries, but no portion thereof could be wrested from them by the legislature. Therefore the word “diminish” in section 13 of article III is not necessary to be read into section 18 of article V of the constitution in order to maintain an independent judiciary.</p>

We cannot answer this argument by saying that members of the legislature are not state officers, for if we look at section 4 of article VI we will find that they are specially referred to as officers in the following words: “ All officers elected by the people, except governor, lieutenant governor, members of the general assembly,” etc. Therefore, for some reason, not necessary to be here considered, it was conceived by the framers of the constitution and by the people who adopted it, that, although section 13 refers to any public officer, it was not meant to cover members of the legislature, the article on the legislature covering the same matter itself.

It is thus clear that on January 2, 1904, there were no judges in office other than those who were in commission at the time of the passage of the act, so that either the said act must have been intended to operate in favor of the judges in commission at the time of its passage, or, for an interval, from and after January 1, 1904, it was entirely inoperative, in contradiction of its express terms.</p>

New and inexperienced judges would draw salaries considerably larger than old and experienced members of the judiciary. We would practically be face to face with a declaration by the legislature, as shown by the act of 1903, that the salaries paid to the older judges are inadequate and not up to the adequate standard required by the constitutional mandate; and this condition would be impossible of remedy, or, at least, it could not fade out until all of the present members of the Supreme Court, with their <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>long terms of service yet to come, had passed from the scene, by which time we can fairly believe, according to the well-known fluctuations of the value of money, salaries would again have to be readjusted, with the like condition of inequality repeated and covering another long period of years. This shows the apparent necessity for a uniform operation of any law fixing the salary of judges; and it seems almost impossible that we should presume that the people, when they adopted the constitution in 1873, ever understood or intended that the fundamental law of the state should have or be given a meaning which would bring about and make practically irremediable such an unjust and vicious state of affairs as would follow a different construction. It is much easier to believe that knowing the fact that the terms of the judges were fixed at periods a great deal longer than the terms of any other of the important public officers, to wit: from ten to twenty-one years, they intended and meant what they said in the constitution, that all laws relating to courts should be general and of uniform operation in this respect just as much as in all and every other respect.</p>

Why may not an adequate compensation be provided for a judge for a term of twenty-one years, or for a term of ten years, as well as for a term of two years intervening between two sessions of the legislature ? The adequate compensation must be fixed in advance and stated times ordained for its payment. It must be fixed by law. The adequacy’ or sufficiency of the compensation must be determined by the legislature. It must be a legislative judgment formed in advance of the services rendered, based upon all of the pertinent considerations. If the trend of adequate consideration is upward, more allowance will be made for a long term than a short one. An adequate compensation for a term of ten or twenty-one years would result in giving a judge something more than sufficient for the earlier years of his service, and something less then sufficient for the later years of his service, and still the adequacy of compensation for the entire term be preserved. In this view there is nothing anomalous in a new incumbent receiving more per <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>annum than an old incumbent. Both of them may be receiving an adequate compensation graded for a long term. An adequate compensation for service is the meeting point between the strife of the person who receives the service and the person who renders it. The person who receives the service is moved by the value to him of that which he gets, and the person who renders the service is moved by the time he has to work to produce that which he gives. Both presuppose tha,t the compensation must be sufficient to enable the producer to live ; otherwise the receiver could get nothing and the producer could give nothing. A compensation may be more than adequate or less than adequate. Adequate, according to the Century .Dictionary, is “ equal to requirement or occasion; commensurate; fully sufficient, suitable or fit.” The primary meaning of adequate is “ equal to,” with a secondary meaning of “ fully ” and may, therefore, be properly defined as “ fully equal to.” It is derived from the Latin verb “ adaequare,” which signifies “ to make equal to.” The verb is composed of the preposition ad, “ to,” and the adjective aequus, “ that extends or lies in a horizontal direction, plain, even, level, flat.” A compensation is adequate in the mind of the employer when it is fully equal to the value of the thing he gets, and in the mind of the employee when it is fully equal to the time and labor he gives.</p>

The obvious meaning of the section was the passage of a general bill to fix the compensation of the judiciary. The passage of separate bills relating to the judges of the supreme, common pleas and orphans’ courts respectively would not answer the condition. It is the judges as a class whoso compensation shall be fixed. An examination of the salary acts passed prior to that of 1903 will show that there was neither a literal nor substantial nor intended compliance with the mandate of the schedule. If the series of acts was intended as compliance with the schedulary mandate, it would be expected that they would have some apparent link. It is incredible that acts passed after intervals of seven (Act of June 8, 1881, P. L. 56, as to Supreme Court judges) and nine years (Act of June 4, 1883, P. L. 74, as to common pleas judges) without any probable connection should have been so intended. The suggestion of substantial compliance with the mandate by the passage of this series of acts, is conclusively met by this consideration, that it produces classification which is not only inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution but works injurious discrimination as between the classes into which the judges are divided. The provision that the salaries of the judges should be fixed at the next session of the legislature was for the purpose of adjusting their compensation according to a standard of which time in the interest of equality was of essence. The standard by which the salaries of the common pleas judges, with and without orphans’ court powers, was fixed in 1883 was not the same as that by which those of the separate orphans’ court judges was fixed in 1874, and the latter must lose the benefit of the increase during the term for which they were elected, whilst the objects of the latter act take presently. There is no warrant for this in the constitution. The obvious meaning of both the 13th section of article III of the constitution and the 17th section of the schedule was to deal with the judges as a single class. Their compensation according to the first should neither be increased, nor diminished during the term for which they should be elected, but this provision according to the second should not go into <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>operation until their compensation as a class should first be “ fixed and determined ” by necessary implication at a common time. There is nothing in the language used to justify an inference that the 13th section should go into operation on the installment plan—so much in 1874, so much in 1881 and so much in 1883. The single purpose of the sehedulary mandate was to adjust the salaries of the judiciary as a condition precedent to the operation of section 13 of the constitution. The act of 1903 is the first which shows compliance with the mandate of the schedule in -form and effect. It deals with the judiciary as a class on a common standard of time in the adjustment of compensation.</p>

Such environments manifestly do not indicate that the section has any relation to the judiciary or is in any manner incident to it, but on the contrary are evincive that it is intended to have no application whatever thereto. An attempt to read it as if actually a part of the judiciary article, demonstrates an incongruity so apparent as to constitute a complete negation of any applicability to the judiciary, but even if it should appear to contain an intention to restrict generally and if such general intent be in conflict with the subsequent particular one contained in the judiciary article, the latter or particular intent being the later expression of the will of the people would dominate. Moreover, in case of antagonism between the section in question and the judiciary article, resulting in a contest for supremacy, the article must prevail in such contest because it creates a co-ordinate branch <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>of government, and no mere limitation of legislative powers contained in another part of the constitution and relating to a different branch of government can be permitted to become a weapon to be used to rip up the very vitals of the co-ordinate branch so created and become destructive of that which is essential to its existence.</p>

A construction leading to such result would lack the essential elements that should prevail in constitutional construction and would be violative of the rule that a constitution is “ to be interpreted to carry out the great principles of government and not to defeat them.” The mandate of the judiciary article is that the judges during their constitutional terms of office shall receive at stated times adequate compensation for their services. The word “ adequate ” has a plain meaning and is clearly understood by people generally. Words used in the fundamental law are not to have a technical meaning, but are to be understood in the sense in which people generally understand them. The word in question is plain; it means fully equal to requirements or occasions, commensurate, and no resort to derivatives is required to determine its meaning. It does not mean average or graduation. When in appellant’s argument it is said, “ an adequate compensation for a term of ten or twenty-one years would result in giving a judge something more than sufficient for the earlier years of <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>his service and something less than sufficient for the latter years of his service and still the adequacy of his compensation for the entire term be preserved,” it is but an attempt to make “ adequate ” the equivalent of average and to indicate a feast or a famine. Again, in that argument when it is also said that “there is nothing anomalous in the fact that Judge A., in the tenth year of his incumbency is receiving a compensation which a legislature ten years ago deemed adequate and that such compensation is less than the compensation of Judge B., who is in the first year of his incumbency and whose compensation was deemed adequate by another legislature a year ago,” it is an effort to resolve adequacy of compensation into graduation. Thus the trail of that argument becomes so attenuated as to be almost lost in a wilderness of words.</p>

The constitution by this mandate thus clearly indicates an increase of the then, existing salaries if necessary to do so in order to make them adequate. Tentative and partial acts in this direction have from time to time been passed increasing different salaries, but there has been no substantial compliance with the requirements of the schedule until the present act, which is general in title and of a broad scope, manifestly intended to carry out the mandate. Those partial attempts not having operated to exhaust the power, its exercise by the present act is manifestly within the command contained in the schedule. By that act the legislature under the mandate to determine adequacy of compensation, has declared that the salaries there<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>in provided for are adequate for the judges of the different courts. There can be but one adequate compensation for each of the judges of the same court because no matter how much greater the experience or learning of one member of it may be than that of another, there can be no difference in the actual performance of the judicial functions. The judicial genius who brings the highest order of learning and ability to bear in such performance, stands upon the same level with the merest tyro of a judge, whose learning and ability in comparison may be as the shadow is to the substance. It is futile to contend that there may be different adequate compensations for different members of the same court.</p>
    <p id="b453-3" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[141,1002,1180,1392]]]'>It is contended that the words public officers used in the thirteenth section of article III, should be applied to judges as public officers and the power to increase the salaries of those in commission at the date of the act did not exist. The jurisdictional powers of judges, their judicial functions, their constitutional terms of office, their well-defined position in the co-ordinate branch of the government indicate a distinctive class of persons required to perform particular functions. They exercise the powers vested in courts, as such, and not in them as officers qua officers, with duties specifically designated as in case of public officers. The constitution declares that the judicial power of the commonwealth (that is the judicial sovereignty of the people) is vested in the Supreme Court and other courts, and the exercise of their functions, their decisions, and all that emanates from them, becomes judicial ; they are not public officers within the generic words used in the section in question. Those words are not used as applicable to all public officers. If it had been intended in the fundamental law to do so, doubtless exact words to accomplish that result would have been used, but when the constitution makes a distinctive provision prohibiting an increase of the compensation of certain public officers, such as members of the legislature, it is manifest that these words were not used in a general sense and by no construction can they be generically applicable to the judiciary. A comparison of the phraseology used in the section with the language of the article makes this apparent.</p>

But it is said that if the public officers referred to in the section are to be limited to those created by the legislature, the officers so designated would be few in number and the presumption is that the constitution would not be operative to effect a result so vain, but appellees have- furnished a list of public officers to whom it applies, with salaries ranging from $2,500 to $4,500 per annum and connected with some nineteen different departments of government. Surely the constitution does not do a vain thing by providing against the possibility of undue and improper extension of the terms and the increase of compensation of so numerous a class of public officers. Because such is the scope of the section and because it was a limitation of legislative power in that regard, it was placed in the heart of the article on legislation and its words indicate a restriction limited to a' definite class of public officers only and cannot by construction be coupled with the judiciary article so as to make them applicable to judges.</p>

It is hardly necessary to build bridges with which to cross streams that may never exist and it is scarcely wise to make possible fears a ground for judicial construction. If they should be, judicial construction might become emotional in character; judges of timid nature responding to their fears, might confine constitutional constructions within too narrow limits, and those possessing great courage,- might extend them to perilous ones. But the fears suggested seem more fanciful than real. The executive with its veto and other associated powers is quite able to protect itself against aggression from the legislative department. Even if open to attack, the judiciary with a high standard of official conduct need have no fears of successful assault. Encircled <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>by confidence and respect, tbe anathema of the people ever ready to protect it as the surest safeguard of rights and property, would fall with crushing effect upon aggressors, and breed a consternation that would repel attack.
