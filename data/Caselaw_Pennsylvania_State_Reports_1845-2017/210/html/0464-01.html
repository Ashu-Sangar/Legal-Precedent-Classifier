The Pressed Steel Car Company is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of New Jersey, in the year 1899. It succeeded to the business theretofore carried on by the Schoen Pressed Steel Company. The company is now, and has been since its incorporation, engaged in a very large way in the manufacture of steel cars, car parts, bolsters, trucks and other similar railway equipment. Almost all of the parts of its ears are made of pressed steel and are produced from plates pressed or formed by dies. The company is the pioneer company in the manufacture of pressed steel cars, and prior to January, 1902, was the only company engaged in such manufacture in a commercial way. Prior to the formation of the defendant company, the plaintiff had also made about 1,600 structural steel cars. Its product of pressed steel cars was about one 100,000.</p>

The principal parts of the cars produced by it are made of structural material which does not undergo the process of pressing, but these cars have some pressed steel parts.</p>

The manufacture of pressed steel cars and their parts requires great engineering and mechanical skill, and the construction of cars for use on the various railroads and the adaptation of them to the needs and wishes of the railroads require the constant designing of new cars and parts of cars, and the exercise of mechanical and engineering skill and ability, so as to meet the requirements of the various railroads. For this purpose the plaintiff company maintains an engineering department which is engaged in the designing of cars and the machinery for the manufacture of cars, and its expense in this respect alone is more than $100,000 per year.</p>

In connection with the designing and construction of these cars the company prepares drawings or tracings showing the various parts of the cars to be built and how the different railway specialties and appliances can be successfully applied to cars which it manufactures. Blue prints of these drawings are sent to the railroad companies proposing to purchase cars so as to enable them to ascertain whether or not the cars which it is proposed to build will meet their requirements, each order of cars being specially designed to meet the particular requirements of the railroad for which they are built. During the manufacture of the cars copies of these blue prints are frequently furnished to the railroad companies for the purpose of inspecting the cars to see that they are built in accordance with the drawings. And after the cars are built and delivered, or contemporaneously therewith, blue prints of the cars are furnished to the railroads so as to enable them either to order parts necessary for repairing the cars or to make the repairs on the cars themselves. It is common practice with the railroads to order from the plaintiff company and keep in stock with their storekeepers a large number of such parts of the <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>cars as will most likely be needed for repairs, and for this purpose it has been customary to, and it is necessary that they should, have these blue prints.</p>

The prints sent to the Central Railway of New Jersey were used by their car inspector, A. Christianson, in the inspection of the cars during the progress of manufacture, and; upon his, becoming an employee of the Standard Car Company, he delivered them to that company early in the year 1902. He never owned these prints and had no authority from the Central Railway, of New Jersey to so dispose of them. The Great Northern Railway prints were sent by that company to the Standard Company in June, 1902, under an agreement to return them.

An engineering and contracting concern negotiates for the erection of a furnace or large steel plant, sends to the proposed customer blue prints of drawings, which are the results of years of study and experience and have been produced at a large expense, and an offer is made to construct the plant at a certain price. The purchaser sends either the prints, or copies of them, to a competing contractor and solicits his bid, thus giving him the benefit of the skill, experience and pecuniary outlay of the other.

The chief engineer of the Pressed Steel Car Company promotes a company to enter into competition with his employer. Immediately upon the formation of the new concern, a large number of the employees, in various departments of the old, leave and enter the employment of the new. They bring with them, as is their undoubted right, the skill and experience gained while working for the pioneer company. This would enable the new company to avoid many of the expensive experiments and mistakes of the old, and these engineers and draftsmen, with their knowledge of the construction of the cars and of the method of manufacture, according to their own testimony, should have been able to measure the cars made by the company and to produce in a short time detailed and practical drawings from which the cars could be constructed. They did not do this, for the very obvious reason that blue prints of drawings were available and were accurate. It is idle to say that these drawings are of no value, or of little value. The railroads to whom the Pressed Steel Car <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>Company liad furnished ears sent the blue prints furnished to them to the new company, naturally welcoming the advent of competition likely to reduce prices, or some complaisant subordinate, or even head of a department, assists a new company to obtain the results of the experiments of the old in a shape, that, at a glance, conveys more information to an engineer, and particularly the engineer who made the drawings, than would the reading of a descriptive book or the examination and measurement of many cars. This may be “ good business, ” but the element of unfairness in the transaction forcibly strikes the mind.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b497-3" data-blocks='[["BL_497.4",497,[137,930,1179,1026]]]'>It is argued that these prints were obtained by the defendant company in the “ ordinary course of business ” and we are asked to make this a finding of fact. The expression is too indefinite for such use. In some instances, the railroads, having obtained from the Pressed Steel Car Company cars, which exactly, or with some modifications, suited their requirements as to size and character, gave to the Standard Company copies made by them, which would show their requirements. The Standard could then modify the construction from pressed steel to structural steel, or if the car furnished by the Pressed Steel Car Company was a structural steel car, the Standard Company knew the exact needs of the customer. Such a transaction is in the course of a business negotiation or contract, but to call it “ in the ordinary course of business ” would not necessarily justify it. <em>We </em>have here, generally speaking, one set of facts, where the defendant company moves to get an advantage over its rival and obtains its information from that rival’s actual or possible customers, and the other, where the customer makes the move for its own advantage and uses the information placed in its hands.</p>

This was a loan, a bailment and not a sale or gift of the articles. This case recognizes the principle frequently asserted by courts of equity, that there is a property in the design, in the idea, and in the mental conception, as well as in the piece of paper on which it is expressed. Says the court: “ If we add the fact that some of these documents are the original work of the plaintiff, of value as being predicated upon data possibly no longer accessible, a wrong is perpetrated which a chancellor ought not to hesitate in relieving.” There was here a breach of confidence, as well as a refusal to return bailed property. The effect of the decree requiring the delivery of the copies is that Remington, now returned to Pittsburg to resume his old occupation, is entitled not only to his plans, but that his competitor shall not have the permanent advantage of the information contained in those plans. The plots were loaned to McGowin for his information and assistance in promoting his business, yet he is denied the use of copies.</p>

The court said: “ It is quite clear that, independently of any question as to the right at law the court of chancery always had an original and independent jurisdiction to prevent what that court considered and treated as wrong, whether arising from the violation of an unquestionable right or from breach of contract or confidence. . . . Perhaps the real solution is that the confidence postulates an implied contract that where the court is satisfied of an existence of the confidential relations, then it at once infers or implies the contract arising from that confidential relation.” The abuse of the confidence, necessarily arising out of the circumstances, is the ground of the injunction.</p>

The principles underlying these cases have, however, a bearing’ upon the question of the other prints, viz: A breach of the confidence necessarily arising out of the relation between the parties, that relation raising an implied contract. Broadly stated, it is that a court of equity will not permit anyone to take an unfair advantage of a position in which he has been placed through any relation of confidence and trust, or, we think, through the necessities of, or as an incident to, a contract. A familiar example is that of an architect’s plans. The form of contract used generally throughout the United States provides that the plans belong to the architect, and shall be returned to him upon the completion of the building. In the absence of such a stipulation, should a contractor be allowed to use in the construction of other buildings plans and -specifications furnished him by an architect in connection with and as a necessary part of the builders’ contract with the owner by whom the architect was employed? Or, should he be permitted to turn them over to another architect for his use ? And, if the owner asks for-blue prints so that he may inspect his building during construction for his pleasure and information, or for the purpose of making some alterations and additions, would not his act in using them to obtain bids from other architects be considered by all right-minded people a breach of decency and honorable dealing ? Courts of equity do not enforce abstract principles of ethics, but this is something more. If the builders or the owners should be enjoined from using designs so obtained, equally so should the architect, who unfairly and improperly receives information, however properly obtained by another. We think this case is ruled by the same principles, unless the method of the publication and the circumstances of the case amount to an abandonment of the special rights of the plaintiff, unless there was an absolute, unrestricted gift of the prints, giving the railroad companies a title not only to the prints but to the design, so that-they had aright to use them, or to give them to others, for the purpose of constructing cars.</p>

A student of a system of bookkeeping who was permitted by the teacher to copy <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>notes of the lectures was not permitted to publish them. Such use was not in contemplation of the teacher. The publication of a book for private circulation is not an abandonment of the author’s rights. At common law, the author of a manuscript might obtain redress against one who had surreptitiously got possession of it. An inventor does not lose his rights unless he suffers his invention to go into public use without objection. It is a question of intent as to the extent of the license: Bartlette v. Crittenden, <a href="/f-cas/2/0981-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 McLean 300" data-case-ids="6131607" data-case-paths="/f-cas/2/0981-01">4 McLean, 300</a>. The exclusive right to one to make reproductions of a picture does not justify another to make and sell photographs: Oertel v. Wood, 40 Howard’s Prac. 10. So the exhibition of a blue print of machinery in a frame in the office of the purchaser, although done by permission of the manufacturer, a copy of whose drawing it is, certainly is not a general publication and an abandonment of exclusive rights in the drawing. The furnishing of a dozen such prints so that the employees of the purchaser may become thoroughly conversant with the construction and operation of the machinery, is a limited publication. When the Pressed Steel Car Company permitted its customers to have blue prints, it did not give them the right to a use which was not in the contemplation of both parties, and which would give an unfair advantage to a competitor.</p>

We are satisfied that the evidence fully justifies his findings of fact and we are equally well convinced that his conclusions of law on the facts are correct. The drawings or tracings of the parts of the cars and the blue prints, except the “ secondary prints,” were made by the appellee company to be used in connection with, and were necessary for, carrying on the business in which the company was engaged. The court finds as follows : “ In connection with the designing and construction of these cars the company prepares drawings or tracings showing the various parts of the cars to be built and how the different railway specialties and appliances can be successfully applied to cars which it manufactures. Blue prints of these drawings are sent to the railroad companies proposing to purchase cars so as to enable them to ascertain whether or not the cars which it is proposed to build will meet their requirements, each order of cars being especially designed to meet the particular requirements of the railroad for which they are built. During the manufacture of the cars copies of these blue prints are frequently furnished to the railroad companies for the purpose of inspecting the cars to see that they are built in accordance with the drawings. And after the cars are built and delivered, or contemporaneously therewith, blue prints of the cars are furnished to the railroads so as to enable them either to order parts necessary for repairing the cars or to make the repairs on the cars themselves. It is common practice with the railroads to order from the plaintiff company and keep in stock with their storekeepers a large number of such parts of the cars as will most likely be needed for repairs, <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>and for this purpose it has been customary to, and it is necessary that they should, have these blue prints.</p>
    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[266,483,1181,253]]]'>All of the blue prints so sent out by the plaintiff company were sent out only in connection with the carrying on of its business in the manner and for the purposes stated and receipts for them were generally required to be given by the persons by whom they were obtained.”</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[261,742,1187,1702]],["BL_505.1",505,[113,370,1177,146]]]'>The drawings and blue prints in controversy were, therefore, not sold or given to the railroad companies but were the property of the plaintiff and made by it for the purpose of carrying on its business and were sent out in connection with the business of the company. Part of these blue prints were sent to the three railroad companies in connection with orders for cars made by the plaintiff company for the railroads but as found by the court only “for their information and use, as a necessary part of the transaction, and also for their use in ordering repair parts.” The remainder of the prints were sent by the plaintiff to one W. H. Miner, draft rigging manufacturer, for his use in adapting and applying the rigging to cars made by the plaintiff company. Notwithstanding the fact that these prints were delivered by the plaintiff to the parties for the purpose stated in the finding of the court, they delivered them to the defendant, a rival company, which is now making use of them in carrying on a competing business. While there was no expressed restriction placed on the ownership of the prints or any expressed limitation as to the use to which they were to be put, it is clear, as observed by the trial court, that the purpose for which they were delivered by the plaintiff was understood by all parties. ' The facts of the case warrant no other conclusion. There is no evidence to sustain the contention that the delivery of the prints by the plaintiff to the railroad companies was absolute and unconditional. As suggested above, there was no expressed agreement on the subject, but the facts clearly support the finding of the trial court that the prints were sent in connection with the orders for cars for the information and use of the purchasers as a necessary part of the transaction, and also for their use in ordering repair parts. The blue prints therefore remained the property of the plaintiff after delivery to the railroad companies, whose use of them was restricted to the purpose for which they were delivered, and a chan<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>cellor will sustain a bill to enjoin the use of them for another purpose by the railroad company or the defendant company to which, without the plaintiff’s consent, they were delivered.</p>
    <p id="b505-3" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[104,525,1186,1598]]]'>We see no grounds whatever upon which the appellant can claim ownership in the prints or the right to use them in its business of manufacturing and selling steel cars and car parts in competition with the plaintiff. It is not pretended that the defendant company paid any consideration for them to the plaintiff or to the companies from which it received them. The right to hold them as against the plaintiff is based simply on the fact that the prints were delivered to the defendant company by the railroad companies so that they might obtain their cars and car parts from the defendant instead of the plaintiff and thus by the use of the plaintiff company’s own designs enable them to give their trade to its rival competitor. In other words, the prints which had been delivered to the railroad companies to enable them to purchase and use the cars and car parts manufactured by the plaintiff were delivered by the railroad companies to the defendant company so that the latter might manufacture and sell cars and car parts from designs and drawings which had been prepared by the plaintiff for exclusive use in its own business. This was clearly a violation, not only of the property rights of the plaintiff in the prints but also of the trust and confidence with which they were received by the railroad companies. This unauthorized act and breach of confidence resulted in great advantage to the appellant and loss to the appellee. The court finds that “ these prints, both originals and copies, arc of great value and use to the defendant company, and their possession by it is a damage to the interests of the plaintiff company. ” These facts will, on reason and authority, as shown by the learned trial judge, confer jurisdiction on a court of equity which will restrain the defendant company from making use of the prints in its business and give such other and adequate relief as the rights of the injured party may require.</p>
