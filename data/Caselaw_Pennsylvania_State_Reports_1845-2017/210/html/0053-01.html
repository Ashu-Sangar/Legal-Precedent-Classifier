    <p class="summary" id="b81-8" data-blocks='[["BL_81.9",81,[168,1592,1182,706]]]'>Time was of the essence of the unilateral agreement and had the Pennsylvania Mining Company not accepted the coal until after March 17, 1900, the defendants could have successfully claimed that the acceptance came too late—that the option to purchase only extended to March 17, 1900, and that time was of the essence of the contract. But the acceptance within the time named converted the unilateral agreement—the option—■ into an agreement inter partes—a binding agreement for the sale of real estate. And in this binding agreement thus consummated, there is no covenant that if the purchase money is not paid and deed of conveyance passed on March 17,1900, the contract of sale consummated by the written acceptance shall become null and void: Pennsylvania Mining Company v. Smith, <a href="/pa/207/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="207 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="933600" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0210-01">207 Pa. 210</a>.</p>

The only laches that the defendants are in a position to complain of is that they were not sued as soon as they might have been; but laches of two years in bringing a suit in equity is not a bar to the suit. A claim otherwise just does not become “ stale ” because the'plaintiff has not brought suit as soon by two years as he might have done. And as to the tender of the purchase price, the defendants are not in position to complain of laches on the part of the plaintiff, for their claim is that since March 17, 1900, the plaintiff had no right to tender the purchase money and demand a deed and they would not have made a deed if the purchase money had been tendered. After March 17, 1900, the defendants were not ready and waiting to make a deed when the purchase price would be paid; on the contrary, after that date they were adverse to the performance of the contract. Pomeroy, in his Equity Jurisprudence, Yol. Ill, sec. 1408, states the rule in these words : “ the party who desires to maintain an objection founded upon the other’s laches must show himself to have been ready, desirous, prompt and eager for performance.” The defendants’ claim is that the plaintiff failed “ to buy ” the coal on or before March 17, 1900, and that after that date no contract existed between the parties. If no contract existed between them and the plaintiff and they were acting on that claim, then they could not claim that after March 17,1900, they were always ready and willing to perform, but that the plaintiff was not, and therefore equity ought to now relieve them of performance on account of the plaintiff’s laches.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[259,1794,1186,612]],["BL_83.1",83,[136,368,1179,771]]]'>The argument pressed upon the court by counsel for the defendants, that the w'ords “ an option or privilege of buying said described coal ” found in the original article of agreement, meant the payment of the purchase price by the plaintiff and the delivery of a deed of conveyance by the defendant, is ingenious, but to our mind not convincing. In the first place such construction is not in harmony with other parts of the agreement. The plaintiff was “ to accept the right to purchase said coal within the time limited.” The time that the parties were to take in closing up the transaction after “ the right to purchase had been accepted ” is not mentioned in the agreement. Again, the word “ buy ” when applied to a real estate <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>transaction more often describes the passing of the equitable title from the vendor to the vendee than it does the exchange of the full purchase price and the deed of conveyance. Usually preliminary articles of agreement, are entered into that an examination of title and for liens and encumbrances may be made before the deed of conveyance is delivered and the purchase price paid. The vendor sells a farm and the vendee “ buys ” a farm when the article of agreement fixing the price, time of payment, time of execution of deed of conveyance and time possession is to be given, is executed. After that the vendee is the beneficial owner of the land. He has bought the farm. The “ buying ” is over and what comes afterwards, at least so far as the vendee is concerned, is the giving to the vendee that which shall be evidence of the title. In equity the title has already passed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b83-4" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[136,1149,1179,767]]]'>One reason that time in a contract for the sale of real estate is not in equity of the essence of the contract unless expressly made so by the parties, is because compensation for the delay in performance can be made in the final decree by allowing interest if the delay is in not paying the purchase price on the day named. In this case before us we are of the opinion that it is but equitable to require the plaintiff to pay interest on the contract price from March 17,1900. The defendants’ contention is not so unreasonable as to characterize their defense as trivial and vexatious and it was no doubt honestly made under the legal advice of reputable attorneys. This taken into consideration with the plaintiff’s delay of two years in bringing this suit, we are of opinion would make it inequitable to grant the plaintiff a decree of specific performance without requiring it to pay interest.</p>
