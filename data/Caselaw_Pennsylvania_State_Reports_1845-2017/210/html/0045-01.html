The mother says that she does not think that he is as bright as some of the boys she has <em>; </em>that it is hard to make him learn; that she doesn’t think he knows anything about care. On cross-examination she says that he can read and write, but don’t pick up and learn like other boys ; seems as though he couldn’t get along as fast as other boys; couldn’t keep up with his classes, but says she can’t tell in what way he isn’t as bright as the general run of boys. Aside from this it appears from the evidence of the boy that prior to the time of his injury he worked for a Mrs. Hunt in Oil City, and worked for a dairy company about a year and a half, delivering milk and butter to customers, collecting money, and getting 13.50 per week and boarding for his services. The mother further says that he went to work at Siverly when he was seven years old, and worked for about a year or a year and a half before he went to work for the dairy.</p>
