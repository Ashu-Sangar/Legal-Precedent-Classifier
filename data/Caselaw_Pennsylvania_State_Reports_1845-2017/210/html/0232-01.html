She had a bank account in which different members of decedent’s family had deposited money from time to time. As to the money in controversy defendant testified that the decedent had said at the time it was for her to keep. The decedent’s attorney also testified that decedent said that the money was the defendant’s, and that he desired to make provisions for her independently of his family. The attorney remonstrated with him <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>as to the amount of the gift. Plaintiff produced two witnesses one of whom testified that decedent had declared to defendant that he wanted to leave $25,000 with defendant for plaintiff at his death. The time when the statement was made was loft in doubt. The other witness, a stranger to decedent’s household, testified that decedent had declared to her that he had given defendant in her bank account $29,000 which she was to give to plaintiff. Two witnesses testified that at the time this alleged interview was held, the decedent was so ill that no strangers were allowed to see him. Other evidence tended to show that decedent had made some other provisions for plaintiff and that he had expressed regret that he had done so much for her. <em>Held, </em>that a verdict and judgment for defendant should be sustained.</p>

That testimony as far as I have noticed it—I think it is substantially correct, although it may lack the exact words—is first that of Annie Robinson that in December, 1897, the old gentleman was at her house in Beaver county, and that he said he would leave her enough to live on; did not want her to keep boarders any longer; provide for her and her children, and that he would leave it with somebody, and suggested that she send somebody to him, I believe, something of that kind.</p>

The squire then says that about February 1, 1898, he and his son went out to the old gentleman’s house, and that in Jane Powell’s presence, or at least while she was in the room—part of the time she was in the adjoining room with the door open—he said that he wanted to leave some money for Annie and the children so that she and the children will not want and said: “I want to leave it with you.” The squire said he would rather have it left with someone else. He called Jane in and said: “ I want to leave $20,000 or $25,000 for Annie after my death; don’t want Squire Robinson to know about it because he would not like it. I can trust Jane ; she is honest.” <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>That when they were leaving, at the door, the old gentlemen, in the presende of Jane, the son being there, said : “Now I will leave enough money with Jane so that Annie will not want.” The boy said that he had heard them talking about money and about Annie; that he could not hear all the conversation, but when they were leaving at the door the old gentleman said. “All right, Jimmie, I will leave enough with Jane that Annie will not come to want.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[287,788,1186,767]]]'>Those expressions “ I will leave enough money with Jane that Annie will not come to want,” would not establish a trust, because it might be that he was going to leave it with Jane and Jane would not take care of Annie, or something of that kind. It would not amount to a statement that he was going to leave this exact amount of money to be hereafter given to Annie, but the expression that he was going to leave $20,000 or $25,000 with Jane for Annie after his death or that it was to be givén to Annie after his death is more definite, except as to the amount; it does not quite fit the $29,000. It is for you to say whether this is satisfactory corroboration of Miss Rollins’ testimony. You will take into consideration all the circumstances, interest and bias of witnesses on both sides, and the fact that Miss Rollins was not called at the former trial, and the other matters in the case that have been discussed by counsel.</p>

So you have $28,000 given in his lifetime to charities and relatives; the homestead and $39,000 to Jane; by his will $23,000 to charities and by special legacies to relatives $19,500. Then if he had $100,000 cash coming into the hands of the executors, that would leave for his lawful heirs, who were to get the residue of the estate, $57,500. In all, under the will to relatives, including possibly the Mantle boy, $500 (I believe all the rest are relatives), $77,000. As he happened to die within thirty days after the execution of the will, the $23,000 went to relatives, but for the purpose for which I am directing your attention to these facts that is significant. Now these things are to be considered by you in determining the question whether he meant this money to go to Jane Powell or to Annie Robinson, the amount of his estate, what he was doing with it and what his relatives were given.</p>

Appellee had a bank account in her name in the First National Bank of Allegheny. On February 19, 1898, decedent closed his own account with that bank and deposited in the same, to the credit of the appellee, $19,364.37, and on the same day ho credited her account with $10,000, thus crediting appellee with the total sum of $29,364.37. The last sum of $10,000 he drew from the Farmers’ National Bank of Pittsburg. Appellee’s account was to bear interest at the rate of three per cent. Her account had been running for some time previous to these two deposits, and money had from time to time been deposited to her credit. The deposit of $29,364.37 to the credit of appellee, the delivery of the bank book and the unqualified declaration of decedent to appellee in the presence of Mr. Brown, his counsel, that the money was for her “ to keep,” clearly evidence an absolute gift to her. Appellant, however, sought to strike down this gift as such and so evidenced by the writing, and so to modify it as to establish in her favor a parol trust of the money so deposited. Thomas Robinson died April 4,1898. Appellant testified that in December, 1897, he told her that he intended to leave her something, and that about this time he paid the sum of $4,800 for her on account of an indebtedness which she had contracted; that she went to see him in March, 1898, and that he was so sick that she was unable to do so. Several of appellee’s witnesses testified that decedent had declared in an emphatic manner that he had done enough for appellant and would give her no more money. One of appellant’s witnesses testified that decedent said to appellee : “ I want to leave $25,000 with you here for Annie at my death, and I do not want Thomas or anyone else to know anything about it.” He is unable to fix the date of the interview, but thought it not later than February 1, <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>1898. It is somewhat significant that he took occasion subsequent to the death of decedent, at the instance of appellant for whom he was acting as a quasi legal adviser, to call upon appellee. That he did so, he said, after Squire Robinson had told him a lady in Allegheny had stated to him (Robinson), that appellee had a check for that amount for appellant. It is also significant that Squire Robinson, the husband of appellant, was the executor of the decedent’s estate for more than a year before his death and never mentioned or suggested a trust to his coexecutor. The appellee testifies positively that this witness was not at decedent’s house in the year 1898, but had been there a year previous. She denies expressly that any such convei'sation took place. With the distinctive denial of the appellee, coupled with a reasonable doubt as to the interview irx questioxx, axid its date, this testimony lacked substantial weight! But at xnost it would only ixidicate an intention to do something for appellant, who was not a relative by blood but the widow of his nephew, and if he once had such intentioxi the proofs were uncontro'verted that having givexi appellant $4,800 he repeatedly declared that he would give her no more, and manifestly changed his’xnind if he ever had any intention to give her more.</p>

She testified that she called upon decedent about the middle of March, 1898, while decedent was in bed sick, and he said to her: “ I give Jane Powell (appellee) here the homestead and xnoxiey to keep her as long as she lives. I have also given her in her baxik account $29,360, which she is to give Annie Robinsoxi upon my death.” She states that she gave axi account of this interview to appellant in Septexnbei’, 1898, yet she was not called by appellaxit as a witness when the case was before arbitrators and whexi it was on trial once before the present one and no reasonable explanation therefor is givexi by the appellant. Her action in this regard throws around the testimony of this witness an atmosphere of suspicion axid doubt. She testifies that she called upon decedent and remained with him about fifteen minutes and this was the only time she had ever called upon him. The evidence shows that at that time decedent was so ill that strangers were not admitted to see him. There is no <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>proof whatever corroborating her in regard to the visit in question, and appellee testifies that she was not at the house at that date or any other date and had never visited the house. That during the three weeks prior to decedent’s death appellee, decedent’s niece and a little girl were in constant attendance upon him. That during the last two or three weeks of his illness he was very ill and no strangers were permitted to see him. With the testimony of Miss Rollins uncorroborated as to the visit; with circumstances that point with suspicion as to its reliability; with the fact that at the time that it was alleged to have taken place decedent was in a condition of critical illness that permitted only near relatives to see him and with the clear and explicit denial by the appellee, it is plain that the proof of a parol trust was not clear, precise and indubitable. But even if doubt be raised by this testimony, it was absolutely dissipated by the testimony of Mr. Brown, the attorney of decedent. He testifies: “ He talked to me quite at length about her. He said that she had lived with him a great many years, worked hard, taken care of the home, looked after himself and brothers and he wanted to know that she would be provided for beyond any question, and in no sense dependent upon his relatives after ho was dead and gone. At the same interview he sent Jane Powell out to get the bank book and she came in with that bank book that was in her own name, as I recollect it, in that First National Bank of Allegheny, and the explanation of that was because I was remonstrating about the provision he had made for this girl, and he wanted to assure me that he had done far more than that for Jane Powell, and that bank book I recall distinctly had at least one, and I think two deposits of $10,000 each, and then on a date, which was probably in February of the same year, there was deposited the sum of $29,000 and odd dollars in cash, and when I saw the deposit I was literally amazed, and I undertook to try to persuade him that he was doing himself an injustice, that he might get well and might regret that, and that it ought to be undone, and he said no, that he wanted to be sure that she would be provided for, and it was then that he told me of the three gifts that he made to the nephews.” And again, when asked whether anything luid been said by decedent about his intending this money as a gift in trust for Annie Robinson, <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>he replied : “ I have said to you distinctly that he informed me that he had made this deposit for Jane Powell.” When asked whether there was anything said about making provisions for Annie Robinson, he said: “Never.” “ The only expression he ever gave was the one I gave you in 1896, when he said that was the end of his gifts to her,” and in response to the question whether decedent called witness’ attention to the deposit of $29,000 he said: “Yes, sir, he did that by way of justifying the gift that he was making to this Bowers girl, and to my knowledge he gave her $20,000.”</p>

The learned trial judge, therefore, cannot be convicted of error in charging as he did, and thus putting the burden of proof upon the appellant. It was also contended by the appellant that, owing to the relations of the appellant with the decedent, this being a gift inter vivos, the burden of proof was upon the appellee to show the fairness of the transaction. It may be said that where there are certain relations of confidence, accompanied by peculiar circumstances, a donee may be required to establish the fairness of the transaction, by which he or she is benefited: Miskey’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/107/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="107 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="8858996" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0611-01">107 Pa. 611</a>. But in the present case there was nothing in the relations that existed between the appellee and decedent to occasion any suspicion whatever, and there certainly were no circumstances whatever of a doubtful character connected with the gift in question. The decedent understood and knew exactly what he ivas doing and what he intended to do. Mr. Brown testified that decedent talked to him at length about appellee. He said that she had lived for a great many years <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>in the family, had worked hard, taken care of him and looked after himself and his brothers. That he wanted to know that she would be provided for and in no way be dependent upon his relations after he was gone. Appellee testified that she was treated as a member of the family; that she had had charge of the house for more than thirty years without any stipulated wages and that members of the family were in the habit of depositing money to her credit. The case is therefore simply one in which the decedent, a very old man, realizing that appellee had practically devoted her life to the service of himself and his family and recognizing the value of her services, desired to provide for her in her old age against Avant in the event of his death. It is futile to argue that there are any questionable circumstances connected with the gift or any suspicions surrounding it. If so it is clear that there cannot be the slightest warrant for the suggestion that the burden of proof was cast upon her to show the fairness or the propriety of the gift.</p>

Such Avas not the result in the present instance and clearly if the jury disbelieved Miss Rollins there was not the slightest foundation for appellant’s claim and if they disbelieved her but believed Mr. Brown, there was no evidence whatever to warrant the conclusion that a parol trust had been established.</p>
