    <p class="summary" id="b231-4" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[141,431,1178,978]]]'>[This case turns upon a question of fact, was there a contract made in April, 1902, between these two plaintiffs and the two defendants, that the defendants would get an option on this farm near Stewart Station, the plaintiffs getting a purchaser and that they would divide the profits.] [1] Any arrangement that may have been made between these plaintiffs and Mr. Tintsman would not entitle them to recover unless Mr. Miller was brought into the transaction. If Mr. Tintsman merely agreed with these men to divide his profits or his commissions, then there would be no recovery here, because there is no evidence that he was an agent for Mr. Miller, and no evidence that would authorize you to find that he could speak for Mr. Miller. So that the conversations between Mr. Tintsman and Mr. Welch and Mr. Pool are, so far as Mr. Miller is concerned, only important here as they may throw light on all the circumstances, together with the conversations that Mr. Pool testifies to having occurred on their way up to the farm, the conversation with Mr. Miller. Those tilings taken together may satisfy you that Mr. Miller had made some such contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[141,1416,1179,720]]]'>The contention of the plaintiffs is that it was a division of profits in the resale of this property. The contention of Mr. Tintsman is that he was to divide his profits, or as he says, his commissions, or whatever words he used. He said he used the word “ commissions ” and it is argued by the defendants that this is a reasonable explanation of the whole matter and that that is all there was in it. The defendants give you various circumstances, and taking the whole case they have argued that the probabilities are that that was all there was in it; and particularly the course of conduct of Mr. Miller; that he acted as a man would who had no arrangement with anybody except Mr. Tintsman and that that was to pay him a commission, and that whatever arrangement Mr. Tintsman might have made with other people was none of his business.</p>

It is necessary in order to make out a contract, that the people should agree, that their minds should meet on a common basis, and if Mr. Miller was talking about the profits the same as Mr. Pool was, that would be sufficient to make a contract; their minds would meet then on a common footing. But if such conversation did take place and Mr. Miller was talking about the division of commissions between Mr. Tintsman and these men, you will see that they would not have understood each other and their minds would not have met on a common basis.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[261,945,1192,1017]]]'>That is practically all there is in it. Mr. Tintsman says that is was about half of his profits, and these men say that it was about half of the whole profits made by all of them. The general surroundings of the case, all of the circumstances, the appearance and manner of the witnesses are entirely for you. It is not a question whether these men earned their commission or not; it is not a question whether they did more work than Mr. Miller and Mr. Tintsman. That has nothing to do with it. Itis a mere question of a bargain. Whether it turned out to be a good bargain or a bad bargain has nothing to do with it. Did these people agree as claimed by the plaintiffs ? If they did not, your verdict must be for the defendants, because the question of commissions is not in this case. If that was all there was in it these men have their remedy and can claim their commissions. They are claiming here on a different contract, so that you cannot say, “Well, they are entitled to at least $200,” because that would be for another case. So that your verdict will be either for the plaintiffs in the amounts which counsel will give you, whatever it is, with interest, or it would be a straight verdict for the defendants.</p>

Second, whether one of the appellants not having received one half of the profits, but only a small sum described as commissions, was liable. Third, whether the action was premature by reason of one of the appellants having received in payment a mortgage which had not matured.</p>
    <p id="b234-7" data-blocks='[["BL_234.8",234,[295,992,1188,925]]]'>The appellants entered into an agreement with the appellees by which the former agreed to get an option to buy a certain farm, and the latter to procure a purchaser for it, the profits of the transaction to be divided between them, viz : one half to appellants and one half to appellees. The option was obtained, the purchaser procured, the transaction consummated and profits to the amount of $5,700 realized. The appellees in this action sued for one half of these profits. The verdict established the contract and the amount of profits derived from it. Appellants contended that the transaction was one of partnership and that the proper remedy was by bill in equity for an accounting and not by an action of assumpsit. The contract was a joint one and for a joint single transaction. It was closed and the exact amount of the profits was ascertained. The reason for the settlement of a partnership account through the medium of a bill in equity does not, therefore, exist and it is manifest that as an accounting is unnecessary, the transaction being a single one, an action of assumpsit will lie.</p>

It cannot be pretended that there is any necessity for the intervention of auditors to state and settle and account when the whole matter consists merely of the purchase of a single tract of land, and the sale of it again; and the question to be answered is how much, if anything, has been gained by the purchase and resale, after deducting the expenses attending it ? This can be ascertained with as much facility and certainty by a jury as by auditors, and the verdict of the jury at once closes and puts an end to all further controversy. Where the transaction is of such a nature as to render the calling in of auditors altogether unnecessary the action of account render may be very well avoided; for the prosecution of such an action is not only attended with more than double the costs and expenses but more than double the delay of assumpsit.”</p>
