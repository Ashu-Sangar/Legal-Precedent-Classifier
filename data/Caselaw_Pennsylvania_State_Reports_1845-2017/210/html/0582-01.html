He further averred that the common school district of the city of Harrisburg was created by the general school law of the commonwealth, and the Act of Assembly of April 22, 1868, P.

The common school district of Harrisburg at the time the city accepted this act filed its certificate expressing its desire to retain the law governing it independent of this statute, as provided by the proviso just quoted. The district was governed by the general school law of 1854, and by the act of assembly of April 22, 1868, prior to May 27,1884, when by a resolution of the school board duly passed by virtue of the authority contained in the fourth proviso of section 41 of the act of May 23, 1874, sections 42 and 43 of that act were accepted. Section 42 provides that “ the city treasurer shall ex officio be school treasurer and before entering upon the duties of his office shall give bond to the school directors conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties in such amount as the board shall direct and with such sureties as shall by them be approved, and shall also before he enters upon his office take and subscribe an oath or affirmation of like nature as is hereinbefore prescribed for the city treasurer.” So that at the present time the school district of the city of Harrisburg is governed by the general school law of 1854, the act of April 22, 1868, and by sections 42 and 43 of the act of May 23, 1874, and it is by virtue of section 42 that the defendant claims to exercise the office of school treasurer.</p>

The act of 1874 provides a uniform and general system for the government of school districts of the third class, and it may well be said that when a school district exercises the option to accept one or more of its provisions and thus substitutes for its special or local features a provision of the general system, it to that extent conforms to the general system, and the legislation which authorizes the option thus tends to uniformity.</p>

Reynolds, <a href="/pa/137/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="137 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="821426" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0389-01">137 Pa. 389</a>, which is relied upon as supporting the view urged upon us by the commonwealth, the situation was quite different from the situation here. That case involved the validity of the act of May 23, 1889, relating to school districts in cities of the third class, and the act was declared to be void because it authorized existing cities of that class incorporated by special laws to accept its provisions without at the same time accepting those of the act of May 23, 1874, authorizing the classification. The act of 1889 created a system independent and complete in itself for the government of school districts of the class already fully provided for by the act of May 23, 1874. As was said by Clark, J., in that case, “ it (the act of 1889) contains provisions wholly different from those of the act of 1874; it not <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>only changes the provisions in the general act, but adds other and entirely new provisions relating to the affairs of the schools of the school districts.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b613-3" data-blocks='[["BL_613.4",613,[120,531,1178,1331]]]'>Thus, if the act of 1889 had been held to be valid, there would have been two general systems for the government of school districts of the same class, the one system differing from the other in many essential particulars, under either of which systems school districts of the same class were allowed to elect to come. This necessarily tended to diversity. The diversity was occasioned by the act of 1889, providing another and additional system of government for school districts of the class already provided for by the act of 1874. In the Scranton School District’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/118/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="118 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="556711" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0176-01">118 Pa. 176</a>, the act of 1875, which was under consideration there, was a supplement of the act of 1874, and it provided a system for the assessment and collection of taxes, the classification of real estate, for the meeting of councils, for representation in councils and the qualification of counoilmen, and other matters relating to municipal affairs. Most all these matters were provided for in the act of 1874. The fifth section of the act of 1875 declared that no city of the third class should become subject to the act unless accepted by it. This option, if the act had been valid, would have produced the result of cities of the same class operating under totally different systems respecting their municipal affairs. Such diversity was held to be fatal to the validity of the act. The diversity in these cases was due to the existence of two general independent systems of government for school districts of the same class in the one case and for cities of the same class in the other.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b613-4" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[120,1881,1176,355]]]'>But in the present case we have one general system provided by the act of 1874 for the government and regulation of school districts of the third class, and we are not prepared to say that the privilege given to school districts of this class gradually instead of at once to change their old local and special systems for the new is a breach of the rule respecting possible diversity.</p>

    <p id="b616-6" data-blocks='[["BL_616.7",616,[273,727,1188,1014]]]'>In Stegmaier v. Jones, <a href="/pa/203/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="203 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="994741" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0047-01">203 Pa. 47</a>, and again in Com. ex rel. Miller v. Brown, <a href="/pa/210/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="210 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="937788" data-case-paths="/pa/210/0029-01">210 Pa. 29</a>, attention was called to the fact that there is no constitutional requirement of uniformity in legislation as to matters included in section 7 of article III, of the constitution. That section prohibits local and special laws upon certain enumerated subjects and thereby requires that the legislation upon such subjects shall be general. Uniformity of provision or of result is not therefore in itself a requirement, but merely one of the tests judicially applied to determine the local, special or general character of the statute challenged. As said in Stegmaier v. Jones, <a href="/pa/203/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="203 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="994741" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0047-01">supra,</a> “a law may by classification or otherwise produce some diversity of result and yet be general, for where the classification is based on genuine distinctions, its expediency is for legislative determination.” And in the present case it is well pointed out by the learned judge below that while the acceptance of different portions of the act of 1874 by different districts may introduce greater divergencies between such districts than existed before, yet the general effect is to assimilate each to the standard of the act.</p>
    <p id="b616-7" data-blocks='[["BL_616.8",616,[273,1761,1186,251]]]'>The persistent course of argument in cases of this class seems to require a reiteration of the true standard of constitutionality as being generality as opposed to localism or specialism, and of the rule that uniformity is not a constitutional requirement but merely one of the tests of generality.</p>
    <p id="b616-8" data-blocks='[["BL_616.9",616,[274,2020,1183,136]]]'>Upon the constitutional question in the present case the judgment is affirmed on the opinion of the learned judge below.</p>
