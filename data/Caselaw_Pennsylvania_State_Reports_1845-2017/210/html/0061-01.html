    <p class="syllabus" id="b87-7" data-blocks='[["BL_87.7",87,[142,1092,1177,443]]]'>On the trial of an indictment for murder the commonwealth’s evidence showed that while the deceased was walking along the railroad track in pursuit of a friend who had jokingly taken his bottle from him, the prisoner came running across the field up to the track and almost instantly stabbed the deceased three times. When caught by some of the men who had run to the scene, the prisoner explained that the deceased had hit him the night before and he had cut him for it. The commonwealth also showed that there had been a dispute over a trivial matter the night before in which the deceased had hit the prisoner, and that the latter had on the next morning inquired for the deceased and made throats that he would “ fix him.”</p>
