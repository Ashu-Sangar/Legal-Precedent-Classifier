    <p class="summary" id="b98-10" data-blocks='[["BL_98.15",98,[279,1352,1190,505]]]'>Upon August 12, 1903, David Hunter filed a bill of equity against A. B. Baxter for the specific performance of a contract, for the sale and conveyance, by the former to the latter, of a lot of ground in the twentieth ward of the city of Pittsburg. The defendant in his answer admits the contract and declares his willingness to carry it out, but alleges by way of defense that plaintiff’s title is not a marketable one in fee simple, as called for by the contract—in this, that there is an outstanding title in Frederick Gaertner and Margie Gaertner, his wife.</p>

L. Sloan for use of David Hunter against William S. Robinson, with notice to N J. P. Yost, terre-tenant—being a foreclosure of the $22,000 purchase money mortgage given by William L. Robinson to W. L. Sloan, dated July 28, 1900, and recorded in the recorder’s office in mortgage book 1106, page 26; upon which judgment was obtained April 6, 1901, and subsequently thereon upon lev. fa. 66, May Term, 1901, property sold to David Hunter, to whom sheriff’s deed was executed and delivered.</p>

True, they were not parties to that foreclosure, but in the light of their allegation that said foreclosure was in bad faith and for the purpose of defrauding them, they must have had knowledge of the suit in time to intervene and defend— presumptively must have had knowledge of it, for they do not allege the contrary; (c) the charges of fraud, so far as affecting David Hunter, are not specific in form, are vague and indefinite, and wholly insufficient, aud the remedy upon the <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>charges of fraud against other persons who are not parties to the bill—as to said other parties—is not through the present bill.</p>
