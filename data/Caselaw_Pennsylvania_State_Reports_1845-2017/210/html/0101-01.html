His injuries it was claimed entirely disabled him from attending to any business. A witness shown to have a special knowledge of the plaintiff’s business and of the manner in which he conducted it and the time and attention given to it testified that his services were worth from 15,000 to $10,000 a year.

The defendant’s liability was conceded, and the contest at the trial was as to the extent and permanency of the plaintiff’s injuries and the damages resulting from the permanent loss of earning power. The only question now to be considered is that raised by the third specification of error. The court was asked to charge that no competent evidence of the loss of earning power had been produced by the plaintiff and that no allowance should be made therefor by the jury. This request was refused, but the jury was referred to what had been said on the subject in the general charge. Testimony as to earning power had been admitted without objection, and the sufficiency of the testimony was the only matter that could properly be raised by the point presented.</p>
