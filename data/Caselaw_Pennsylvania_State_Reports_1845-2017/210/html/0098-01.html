These gates were twenty-five feet apart. The first struck the top of.the buggy and the second was fully down when the horse reached it. The buggy was struck by a shifting engine on the second track almost immediately after the horse stopped. The time between the stopping of the horse and the collision was estimated by the plaintiff as a second or a second and a half; by one of the witnesses as a quarter of a minute, and by another witness the collision was said to have occurred immediately after the stopping. Seventy-four feet from the crossing the plaintiff was passed by a mail carrier in an open cutter. When this man was at the edge of the tracks and thirty or forty feet in advance of the plaintiff, the flagman gave a signal to come on. He went on and crossed in safety. The plaintiff was unable to say that the signal had been intended for him and only that it was given in his direction. At any point within twenty feet of the tracks the plaintiff had a clear view of them for 700 feet in the direction from which the engine came. The gates were being lowered as he drove on the crossing but he did not observe them until the horse was on the first track. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence inasmuch as he did not stop, look and listen and that 'a nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

These gates were twenty-five feet apart. The first struck the top of the buggy and the second was fully down when his horse reached it. The buggy was struck by a shifting engine on the second track almost immediately after the horse stopped. The time between the stopping of the horse and the collision was estimated by the plaintiff as a <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>second or a second and a half; by one of the witnesses as a quarter of a minute, and by another witness the collision was said to have occurred immediately after the stopping.

In support of the first it is argued that the rule that a traveler before crossing the tracks of a steam railroad must stop, look and listen for the approach of a train is not a fixed rule to be observed under all circumstance but only a reasonable requirement, the nohobservance of which, while prima facie evidence of negligence, may be explained and excused. That this proposition cannot be sustained under the decisions is clear. There is no break nor wavering in the line of cases extending back nearly forty years, which hold that the rule is inflexible and admits of no exceptions and that a failure to observe it is not mereljr evidence of negligence but is negligence per se. There has been no clearer statement of the rule than that made by the pi’esent Chief Justice in Aiken v. Penna. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/130/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="130 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="568967" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0380-01">130 Pa. 380</a> : “ It is not a rule of evidence but a rule of law, peremptory, absolute and unbending: and the jury can never be permitted to ignore it, to evade it, or to pare it away by distinctions and exceptions.

The direct and immediate cause of the plaintiff’s injury was his reckless disregard of a rule of common prudence and of law. From the first danger he never escaped and there was no intervening cause disconnected with it. Nor can it be said that he was lured into a position of peril and kept there by the gates. He got into danger through his negligence in assuming that the way was safe for him because a signal had been given when another driver was at the edge of the tracks, thirty or forty feet in advance. That he was shut in was not the fault of the flagman, who had no knowledge of his attempt to cross, but the inevitable result of his driving under the descending gates.</p>
