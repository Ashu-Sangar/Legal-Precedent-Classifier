That is the contention of the plaintiff, and that is, as I have stated, the negligence of which he complains, and if you find that to be the case he is entitled to recover. But if be merely, without signaling the car to stop, and while it was in motion, attempted to board it, and the accident occurred through that action on his part, he is not entitled to recover. But ordinarily the rule of law is that where a person attempts to board a car in motion, he is guilty of negligence in so doing. As it has been explained to you, if that motion had come down to such a slow rate of speed that.he was reasonably induced to believe it would either stop, or that it Avas at such a rate of speed that he could board it with entire safety, and, as he states himself in this case he did board it in safety, and the accident resulted from the violent starting of the car, then the company is liable.

    <p id="b291-6" data-blocks='[["BL_291.12",291,[136,886,1179,1443]]]'>We desire it to be distinctly understood that in Powelson, v. United Traction Co., <a href="/pa/204/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="204 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="927550" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0474-01">204 Pa. 474</a> ; Hunterson v.

West Chester, etc., Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/70/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="70 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="1028193" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0357-01">70 Pa. 357</a>, and Penna. Railroad Co. v. Peters, <a href="/pa/116/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="116 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="554376" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0206-01">116 Pa. 206</a>, and a very few others, which because of their peculiar facts are exceptional. From the whole evidence in this case, it did not necessarily and certainly follow that Armand Boulfrois, Jr., the injured person, was either negligent or not negligent. If the car had not stopped when he attempted to get on, and by that attempt he was injured, he was negligent and cannot recover ; if it either had, or had not stopped and he was safely on, then if the conductor, by suddenly and recklessly turning on the power gave the car a jerk which threw the boy off, it was the conductor’s negligence that caused the injury and he can recover. If the boy’s attempt to get on was not complete, if he was still engaged in the attempt, when the car was jerked, the inceptional act of negligence when he stepped from the ground onto a moving car, still continued and he cannot recover. If he was negligent in getting on, as from his own testimony he was, then when safely on before he had time to get seated, the conductor by suddenly turning on the power jerked him off, it was the conductor’s negligence which caused the injury and defendant is answerable.</p>

If it was complete then the <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>company’s negligence caused the accident, just as clearly as if some other passenger, on his feet looking for a seat, was thrown violently to the floor or thrown off by a sudden jerk of the car by a reckless conductor. The boy’s good luck in reaching the running board in safety did not condone the negligent act of getting on, if he was not yet safely on when thrown off. We have tried to make our meaning plain; if we have failed it is either because our obtuseness of perception or poverty of language fails to make plain to others what is plain to us. The learned counsel for appellee seems to have misapprehended our ruling in the Powelson and other cases cited, for in his argument he uses this language :</p>

    <p id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[288,1292,1183,188]]]'>That is not the law applicable to this evidence; as applicable to the facts here the law is correctly embodied in defendant’s third written prayer for instruction at the trial as follows :</p>

It was, in substance, a denial of the point, and in effect adopting as the law the argument of appellees’ counsel already quoted that the standard of duty, as to one who gets on or off a moving car shifts, not according to any fixed rule, but with the facts and circumstances. To this we say that as to one who gets on or off a moving car and is injured by so doing the standard does not shift; he is negligent per se. But if he escaped injury by that act of his own, yet subsequently, no matter how short the time, from his own first act, by the distinct act of negligence on the part of the conductor he was injured, he can recover. The evidence showed without question that plaintiff attempted to get on a moving car; can it be reasonably said, in view of all the testimony, that he was safely on when he was jerked off by the act of the conductor ?</p>
