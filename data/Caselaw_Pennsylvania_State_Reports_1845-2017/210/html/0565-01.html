So far as the court recalls the testimony, but we say the testimony is entirely for the jury, he was not instructed how to throw the belt off the pulley, except that Mr. Sweigert says Mr. Hepler held the step ladder for him and directed him where to go, and to pull the pulley towards him.

The accident occurred in appellants’ gristmill and in its second story, in which were located a buckwheat shucker and a cornmeal bolt, run by a power shaft. The former placed above the latter, was run by a pulley attached to the end of its shaft by a belt extending from that pulley, to another, on the power shaft. These belts started side by side from the power shaft, but diverging', the buckwheat shucker belt ran horizontal while the cornmeal bolt belt ran somewhat beneath the shucker belt. In throwing off this latter belt the accident resulting in the injury to appellee occurred. In describing how it occurred, he testified that he got upon a step ladder, taking a stick about three feet in length and with it threw the <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>belt off tbe line shaft. That at the time the other end of the belt also came off the pulley there, and it fell upon the underlying belt which ran the cornmeal bolt; this latter belt running with great rapidity caught the falling one, threw it back upon the power shafting and winding around the hand and arm of appellee drove them against the shafting and broke his arm. The throwing off the belt in the manner indicated and its falling upon an exposed and rapidly moving belt lying beneath, caused the accident and necessarily in determining the question of negligence on the part of the appellant, the initial question was whether the appliances furnished, were such as were in ordinary use in mills such as that of appellants.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[275,1009,1181,303]]]'>On the part of the appellee the proofs were that the appliances used ordinarily in such mills were shifters and guarded belts, and on the part of appellants that those used in this mill were such as were customary and ordinarily used. The question, therefore, was one of fact and for the jury to determine. The learned trial judge said:</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[273,1320,1184,457]]]'>“ So you have one set of witnesses who testify that in the ordinary mills of this character, the method of removing the belts from the pulleys is by the use of a stick.

If the danger of the work about the belts and machinery was not obvious, his inexperience thus shown, cast upon appellants the duty of giving him proper instructions. Such danger was not clearly obvious. It appears that one of his employers inquired why he had not thrown off the belt and he replied that he was going to get the head miller to come and see what was the matter with it and his employer’s reply was that be did not think anything was the matter with it. He also told him that in ease of difficulty to call upon the head miller who had charge of the general machinery and to do whatever he directed him to do. He sought the head miller and requested him to look at the buckwheat shucker belt and he directed him to throw it off. As the danger was not so obvious as to justify him in refusing to do the work in question, he was fully warranted in obeying the order, but in doing so he was entitled to proper instructions in view of the character of the appliances. His testimony shows that neither the member of the appellant firm who was in charge of the mill, or the head miller referred to gave him any instructions whatever and accordingly, standing upon a step ladder with a stick he threw the belt off and the result was the accident.</p>

Pittsburg Waste Company, <a href="/pa/204/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="204 Pa. 618" data-case-ids="927528" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0618-01">204 Pa. 618</a>.</p>

    <p id="b597-5" data-blocks='[["BL_597.6",597,[150,2235,483,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
