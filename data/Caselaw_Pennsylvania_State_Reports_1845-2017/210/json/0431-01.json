    "head_matter": "Warner\u2019s Estate.\nHusband and wife\u2014Antenuptial agreement.\nWhere the provision made for a wife, in an antenuptial agreement, is grossly disproportioned to the value of the husband\u2019s estate,, fraudulent concealment will be presumed, and the burden of proof will be thrown on him, or those claiming under him after his death, to show that full disclosure had been made to the wife of the value of his estate.\nArgued Oct. 31, 1904.\nAppeal, No. 190, Oct. T., 1904, by R. E. Warner and Lawrence Warner, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., June T., 1904, No. 155, dismissing exceptions to the account of Fidelity Title and Trust Company, administrator of E. S. Warner, deceased.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Dean, Fell, Bbown, Mestbezat, Potter and Thompson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication. See Warner\u2019s Estate, 207 Pa. 580.\nFrom the record it appeared that the decedent, E. S. Warner, and Mary Sands being in contemplation of marriage executed an agreement in writing on July 6, 1897, by which they relinquished all marital rights in each other\u2019s estate.\nOn the day of the wedding, August 11,1897, they signed the following paper:\n\u201c It is hereby understood and agreed by and between the parties to the foregoing contract that the estate and property now owned and possessed by the said E. S. Warner, consists of a house and lot situate at No. 16 Ninth street, Pittsburg, Pa., of the value of about $15,000 and. of a house and lot situate at No. 418 Penn avenue, Pittsburg, Pa., of the value of about $25,000 and of personal property consisting only of his household goods and furniture at his residence.\u201d\nWhen the balance shown by the account of the administrator came up before the orphans\u2019 court for distribution, the widow claimed one third thereof and the two sons of the decedent, the appellants, set up the antenuptial contract as a bar to her claim. The auditing judge awarded one third of the estate to the widow.\nExceptions filed by the sons were disnW\" ae following opinion by Hawkins, P. J.:\nThe cases which have sprung out of antenuptial' contracts may be appropriately divided into two classes : (1) those in which, notwithstanding the prospective wife\u2019s ignorance of the extent and value of the husband\u2019s estate, the contract was sustained because the court found that in the circumstances her provision was reasonable; and (2) those in which the contract was set aside because the husband\u2019s representative failed to show that a disproportionate provision was made with the wife\u2019s knowledge of the extent and value of his estate: Neely\u2019s Estate, 124 Pa. 406. The cases of Smith\u2019s App., 115 Pa. 319 and Ludwig\u2019s App., 101 Pa. 535 are examples of the first class; and Kline v. Kline, 57 Pa. 120; Bierer\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 265 of the second. The reason which underlies the second class, with which we are concerned here, is that the parties deal with each other, not like strangers at arms length, but with the openness and fairness which the confidential relation existing between them necessarily implies, and whose absence constitutes a fraud which vitiates the transaction. It is, therefore, well settled that where the provision made for the wife is grossly disproportioned to the value of the husband\u2019s estate, fraudulent concealment will be presumed and the burthen of proof thrown on him to show that full disclosure had been made. Tested by this principle, how stands the present case ? When this contract was before the Supreme Court in the contest over its validity which grew out of the grant of letters, Mr. Justice Bkown said that \u201c it was so harsh and unreasonable on its face as to raise the presumption \u201d that Dr. Warner \u201c designedly concealed \u201d from Miss Sands \u201c the value of his estate at the time it was executed.\u201d The presumption that the appellee was not informed of the value of his estate at that time becomes almost conclusive in the light of the testimony of his attorney who prepared the paper and witnessed its execution. Having subsequently, as he testified, examined the authorities and satisfied himself that trouble might arise from \u201c an allegation on the part of the widow that she did not have full information as to the amount of the estate of the intended husband at the time of execution of the paper,\u201d he deemed it prudent for the protection of his client to have added to it the paper which the parties signed on August 11, 1897, the day of the wedding. \u201c If this contract is to be sustained, it will only be after those claiming under the deceased husband have, by proper proof, overcome the presumption that there was concealment from the wife, amounting to fraud upon her, of the value and extent of his estate.\u201d The question now for decision is whether or not this burthen has been sustained ? Analysis of the evidence will show that it has not. Reliance for this purpose is placed upon additional testimony given by Dr. Warner\u2019s attorneys. Taking up this testimony it is important to notice in the first place that in the senior counsel\u2019s examination in chief in the contest for letters, he said nothing about Miss Sands having been informed of the \u201c value and extent \u201d of Dr. Warner\u2019s estate when the first paper was executed. On cross-examination, however, he \u201cthought\u201d she had been informed of its \u201c amount \u201d but not of its \u201c value.\u201d He did not attempt to state what had been said; if he had been positive as to this he would naturally have gone into particulars, for this was obviously vital; and the fact that he found it necessary to have the second paper signed with a view to prevent \u201c an allegation \u201d by the widow of lack of \u201c full information \u201d would seem to imply at least uncertainty in his mind at that time as to*the fact. If he could not give particulars then, the improbability of his being able to do so a year later affects his credibility. The value of his testimony is further impaired by the fact that while he states his son informed Miss Sands of the property Dr. Warner had, his son testified that he only mentioned two pieces of that property by way of illustration; and the inference is, did not undertake to give her full information.\nThis is the character of the evidence upon which Dr. Warner\u2019s sons rely to sustain their burden of proof. Standing by itself it is of doubtful value; and beside is met by positive denial on the part of Mrs. Warner\u2014oath against oath. But assuming that the facts are as stated, the evidence falls short of the measure of required proof. Without knowledge of the \u201cvalue \u201d of Dr. Warner\u2019s estate, which it is admitted was not given, Miss Sands could not make an intelligent decision. If she had lived in the same neighborhood, which she did not, knowledge of the value of his estate would not have been implied : Bierer\u2019s Est., 92 Pa. 265. She was not a woman of business experience. She was surrounded by Dr. Warner and his attorneys, and it does not seem to have even been suggested she should have advice of friends. \u201c To say she was bound, when the contract was proposed, to exercise her judgment; that she ought to have taken advantage of the opportunity that existed to obtain information; that if she did not do so it was her own fault, is to suggest what would be revolting to all the better feelings of woman\u2019s nature: \u201d Kline v. Kline, 57 Pa. 120. To have selfish* and interested motives at such a time cannot be imputed to her. She had a right to assume that her prospective husband would act justly with her. Hence his duty to be frank and unreserved in the disclosure of all the circumstances materially bearing on the contemplated agreement. The duty and responsibility of full disclosure were his ; the evidence fails to show that he made it; and the contract was, therefore, properly set aside upon the presumption of fraudulent concealment.\nThe exceptions must, therefore, be dismissed.\nError assigned was the decree of the court dismissing the exceptions.\nJD. E. Patterson, for appellants.\nJ. M. Stoner, with him R. T. M. Mc'Oready, for appellee.\nDecember 31, 1904:"
