Einstein and James B. Neale estate against the fund for distribution should be postponed in payment until the claim of the Farmers\u2019 National Bank is fully paid is not tenable, for the reason that the equities claimed or existing by reason of the statement made by J. R. Einstein, either on his behalf alone or on behalf of himself and J. B. Neale, amounts to a guaranty of payment on the part of said J. R. Einstein and J. B. Neale, cannot be worked out through the medium of a distribution of an assigned estate of a third party. Whether the statement made by J. R. Einstein on the deposit slip amounts to a personal guaranty or not, is not necessary for us to decide in this case. To introduce the personal liability of J. R. Einstein and J B. Neale estate, as guarantors or sureties by reason of the paper in question, to the B\u2019armers\u2019 National Bank, into the question of distribution of an assigned estate does not in our view seem to be authorized by any principle of law.\u201d\nThe other and subordinate questions do not require discussion, and the judgment is affirmed on that part of the opinion.",

J., specially presiding.\nFrom the record it appeared that the Kittanning Electric Light, Heat & Power Company owed the Farmers\u2019 National Bank of Kittanning $5,000 on a note. To secure a renewal of this note J. R. Einstein, a director of the company, at the instance of J. B. Neale, president of the company, wrote on a blank deposit slip the following note to the bank\u2019s cashier. \u201cMr. Doverspike, Dear Sir: We have borrowed no money\nfrom any outsider since your loan was negotiated, any indebtedness incurred since are open book acc. or loans made to the Co. by their stockholders. The banks will be preferred always should anything ever happen. ' (Signed) J. R. Einstein.\u201d\nThe Electric Light Company was indebted both to Einstein and Neale. The bank claimed a preference over the individual claims of Einstein and Neale. The court disallowed the preference.\nError assigned was the order of distribution.\nEloy Q. Jones, for appellant.\nII.
