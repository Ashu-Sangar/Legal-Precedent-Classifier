T., 1904, by plaintiff from decree of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co., June T., 1903, No. 56, dismissing bill in equity, in case of T. Brent Swearingen, Assignee of Cochran Fleming v. Theodore N. Barnsdall.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Dean, Fell, Brown, Potter and Thompson, JJ.\nAffirmed,\nBill in equity for discovery and for an accounting of profits from the operation of oil and gas wells. Before Brown, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that the court summarized the pleadings as follows:\nUpon March 6, 1903, T. Brent Swearingen, assignee of Cochran Fleming, filed a bill in equity against Theodore N. Barnsdall, alleging (a) ownership by plaintiff of half interest in the oil and gas rights in 375 acres in Wirt county, West Virginia; (/>) his rights to an accounting and payment of one half of the profits of oil and gas by the drilling operations of the defendant; (e) defendant\u2019s refusal to account; and praying relief, decreeing ownership, right to an accounting and payment. Defendant\u2019s answer, briefly stated, denies plaintiff\u2019s interest in the property, his right to an accounting and payment and in bar of the action avers (a) that defendant is an innocent \u2014and adverse\u2014holder of the property without actual or constructive notice of plaintiff\u2019s title; (1>~) that plaintiff\u2019s right is barred by the statute of limitation, and (c) that his remedy to settle the disputed question of title is not in equity, but at law by an action of ejectment.\nThe court found as a fact that the bill was filed by the plaintiff claiming to be the joint owner of the leasehold, but who was out of possession and had not established his title at law.\nThe court also found as a fact that the leasehold covered land situated in West Virginia.\nThe court\u2019s conclusions of law were, inter alia, as follows:\nFrisbee\u2019s appeal 88 Pa. 144, rules that a court of equity has no jurisdiction of a bill for an account of profits brought by one out of possession who claims to be a joint owner, against an alleged cotenant, until the question of title is first determined in an action at law.\nThe leasehold being wholly in West Virginia, all questions of title must bo decided according to the laws of that State.\nThe court dismissed the bill.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nW. TI. S. Thomson, with him Thomas M. Henry and Frank Thomson, for appellant.\n\u2022 Eugene Mackey, with him T. A. Brown, Cornelius T>. Scully and James W. Lee, for appellee.\nNovember 4, 1904:"
