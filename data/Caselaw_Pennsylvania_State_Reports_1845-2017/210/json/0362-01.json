The only question now before us is whether the jury had sufficient evidence to enable them to make the distinction. We are of opinion that they had. At least one witness testified that the flash of lightning and the fall of the side wall were simultaneous and another testified to the same thing as to the roof with the further fact that the materials fell outwards towards the wind. It was a fair inference that the damage came directly from the lightning and only a jury could draw it.\nJudgment affirmed.",
