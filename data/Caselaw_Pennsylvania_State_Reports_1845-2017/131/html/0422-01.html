The testimony for the plaintiff tended to prove that they arrived at East Liberty station just as the train was about to start, and too late to get tickets; while witnesses for the defendant testified that the plaintiff and his companions were at the station some minutes before the train left. The ticket office at East Liberty was kept open the usual length of time prior to the departure of that train, and afforded all persons who were at the station before it started an opportunity to procure tickets.</p>

The distance between the East Liberty and Union stations is four and one half miles, and the regular and uniform fare charged by the defendant between those points was fourteen cents, being at the rate of three cents a mile. The company, however, had a regulation requiring passengers without tickets to pay to the conductor, in addition to the regular fare of three cents per mile, the additional sum of ten cents. The amount so to be paid in excess of the regular fare was uniform in all cases, irrespective of the distance the passenger was traveling, and upon its payment the conductor was required to give to the passenger a memorandum or check, signed by the general passenger agent of the company, redeemable at ten cents on presentation at any ticket office of the company along its road. This memorandum is known as a “ duplex ticket,” the conductor being required to retain and forward to the auditor of passenger receipts a duplicate of each one issued. It is printed upon a form so arranged that the stations from and to which fare is collected can be indicated upon it by punch marks, and conductors are required to do this in all cases. Of this regulation, notice was given to the public by printed cards posted at the company’s ticket offices. Two such notices were posted on the station house at East Liberty at and for some time prior to the date when the plaintiff took this train. They read as follows:</p>

The conductor, actÍ2ig 021 that, demanded the ten cents additional fare, making twenty-four cents. There is no doubt that the railroad co2npany, both in its own interest and in the interest and C021-venience of the public in traveling, has a right to make some difference in the fare charged to a person who gets his ticket at the office and has it so that the evidence of payment of fare shall be easily taken by the conductor, or ticket collector, or whoever it may be, without inconvenience and without waste of time.

It seems that there is another part of the regulation, that when the conductor collects the extra fare from the passenger, he is required to give him a receipt or duplicate ticket, or something of the kind, which is said to entitle the passenger paying it, if he sees fit to go for it, to receive back the ten cents at the office of the company. Now we are unable to see, that giving that receipt converts this into anything else than the fare' demanded on the road, and we say to you, when the conductor demanded twenty-four cents from the plaintiff, as a condition precedent to his ride to Union station, it was a demand of twenty-four cents as fare; and if that was a larger fare than the law of the company, namely, its charter, authorized it to charge, then it was a demand of an illegal fare, and the regulation as to this particular case, and between these two stations, is illegal, and, therefore, unreasonable. If left to the court to form a conclusion, as to whether or not it was a reasonable discrimination between a ticket fare and the cash fare, I would say that ten cents is an unreasonable addition to make to the fare between these two points; but that is immaterial in this case, with the view we take of what this demand was; namely, a demand of the fare of twenty-four cents.....</p>

This regulation manifestly does not violate the constitution or laws of the United States, or the constitution and statutory law of Pennsylvania. The court below decided that it violated the provision in the defendant’s charter, that “ in the. transportation of passengers, no charge shall be made to exceed .....three and one half cents per mile for way passengers,” because in this instance the excess of ten cents collected from the passenger and afterwards refunded to him, when added to the regular fare made a sum greater than three and one half cents per mile for the distance traveled. In this decision the court confounded two distinct powers of the company; the power to make regulations, and the right to exact tolls or charges for the transportation of passengers. The “ charge,” the amount of which the charter limits, is the compensation the company is to receive for performing its duty as a carrier. Admittedly that was' in the present case fourteen cents, or three cents per mile. The regulation in question prescribed that an “ excess,” over and above the fare or compensation, should be paid. This requirement is in the nature of a penalty for the passenger’s failure to comply with the rule directing him to <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>provide himself with a ticket before entering the cars. As such, it must be uniform to be reasonable; the penalty cannot be graded on a mileage rate, but must be the same for every violation of the rule.</p>

If the destination of the passenger is one of the latter, he may have to travel miles to collect his ten cents back. Moreover, it is a well known fact that ticket offices outside of the large cities are open only for short periods prior to the departure of trains. There arc only certain places and hours when payment may be obtained, and the collection of the ten cents is more oppressive than its loss. In other words, the excess is lost to the passenger. It is said this is a penalty; but the power to impose penalties is found nowhere in the defendant’s charter or the laws of the state, and especially may it not do this summarily, without trial.</p>

With reference to the other passengers, and still more to the railroad company, the regulation is conducive to the rapid, orderly, and convenient dispatch of the conductor’s part in the collection of fares, and thus to leaving him free for the performance of his other duties in connection with the stops at stations, the entrance and exit of passengers, and the general supervision of the safety and comfort of those under his care.</p>

The language of the act is, “ In the transportation of passengers no charge shall be made to exceed.....three and one half cents per mile for way passengers.” As the distance from East Liberty station to the Union station in Pittsburgh is 4-g-miles, and the regular fare fourteen cents, it is admitted that the extra ten cents is in excess of the charter rate, if it is a “ charge for transportation ” within the meaning of the act. Should it be so regarded ? “ Charge ” is a word of very general and varied use. Webster gives it thirteen different meanings, none of which, however, expresses the exact sense in which it is used in this charter. The great dictionary of the Philological Society, now in course of publication, gives it twenty separate principal definitions, besides a nearly equal number of subordinate variations of meaning. Of these definitions, one (10 6) is, “ The price required or demanded for service rendered, or (less usually) for goods supplied; ” and this expresses accurately the sense of the word in the present case. The essence of the meaning is that it is something required, exacted, or taken from the traveler as compensation for the service rendered, and, of course, something taken permanently, — not taken temporarily, and returned. The purpose of the restriction in the charter is the regulation of the amount of fares, not of the mode of collection; the protection of the traveler from excessive demands, not interference with the time, place, or mode of payment. These are mere administrative details, which depend on varying circumstances, and are therefore left to the ordinary course of business management. We fail to see anything in the present regulation which can properly be treated as an excessive charge, within the prohibition of the charter.</p>

It is said not to be general, fair, and impartial, because it provides that as to passengers getting on the train at stations where there is no ticket office, etc., or on trains where, on account of the excessive rush of business, it is impossible to issue the refunding check, the collection of the excess shall be omitted. The objection overlooks the necessary qualifications to the validity of such a regulation. All the cases are agreed <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>that' the regulation would be unreasonable, and therefore void, unless the carrier should give the passenger a convenient place and opportunity to buy his ticket before entering the train, This part of the regulation merely puts in express words a necessary exception which the law would otherwise imply. So, as to the excessive rush of business. Reasonableness depends on circumstances. To collect the extra amount and issue return checks to as many passengers as the conductor could reach in time, and let all others go free entirely, would be much more unreasonable than to treat all alike and dispense with the regulation for the time being. Necessity modifies the application of all rules, and there is nothing unreasonable in requiring the conductor to exercise sufficient foresight to see whether he can perform the prescribed duty in the available time, and investing him with the discretion to omit it altogether, if, in his judgment, he cannot perform it fully.</p>
    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[263,1152,1172,440]]]'>No authorities precisely in point have been found upon either side. The cases cited by the defendant in error, from Kentucky and Ohio, are widely distinguishable, as they were cases of absolute charge beyond the charter limit, without any provision for return of the excess to the traveler. But on well-settled principles we are of opinion that the' regulation is reasonable in itself, and not in violation of the restriction in the act of incorporation. The defendant’s first point should therefore have been affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.5",460,[1023,1611,365,43]]]'>Judgment reversed.</p>
