In so far as he handled the funds of the bank he dealt with trust funds. Under the proofs in the case, Riddle used the trust funds of the bank in a speculation in oil, by which it was sought to raise or depreciate the market value of oil. This was ultra vires the power given to the bank in its charter, and ultra vires the power of Riddle as president, because without the knowledge and consent of the directors of the bank. Mc-Mullin and Beal both knew that Riddle was president, and that the bank was in the syndicate, and that the money of the bank was being used in oil deals. This was an unlawful use of the money, and as they assisted in such use and actually used the funds of the bank themselves, and assisted in extracting such funds for use in the oil deals, they are personally liable, the same as Riddle, for all the money so abstracted, and for all losses in the oil deal; and that Beal and McMullin were liable even if the bank were not a party to the syndicate, because it would still be an unlawful use of the trust funds of the bank.</p>

Riddle, however he may be regarded, and irrespective of his trust position, was engaged in an oil deal for the Penn Bank, the purpose of which deal was to raise and depress the market price of oil. The vast amount of oil dealt in, the manner in which it was handled, the fact that in reality the oil was bought on margin, and the other circumstances, show that it was a gambling speculation in oil. So far as the Penn Bank was concerned, both Beal and McMullin were with Riddle, principals. They actively co-operated with Riddle in the gamble for the bank, and as this was ultra vires the charter, and also ultra vires <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>the power of Riddle, all of the defendants are liable for the losses so sustained by the bank.</p>

The bank had no power to do this under its charter. There is no evidence that the board of directors, or any member thereof, except F. B. Laughlin, had knowledge of the fact that the funds of the bank were being so used. The fact that the oil accounts were kept in fictitious names, is evidence that Mr. Riddle not only knew that the transactions were illegal, but intended to conceal them from the knowledge of the directors and officers of the bank.

The testimony as to Beal shows, as he claims, that he kept the oil accounts, and that the most of his work was done in the bank building; and if there was nothing more than this in the case, there would not be sufficient to make him liable; but by his own testimony it appears that he knew that the Penn Bank’s money was being used in the deal, and that the money of the bank was used to margin the oil. It also appears by his own <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>testimony that he made a loan of $1,000,000 at 6 per cent to carry the oil.

Nearly all the correspondence relative to the deal, which was in cipher, was addressed to him. He was at the bank consulting with Mr. Riddle relative to the business of the syndicate nearly every day, and generally several times a day. He testifies that he knew the Penn Bank was in the syndicate from the very start, and that he bought and sold oil for- the bank, and that the bank put up margins. The testimony also shows his knowledge that the object was to affect the oil market by both advancing and depressing the price of oil and his participation in the consultations looking to that object.</p>

L. 972, under the name “The Safe Deposit and Trust Company,” with its place of business at Wheatland, Mercer county, “or such other locality as may be deemed most suitable.” In 1878 the place of business was fixed at Pittsburgh, and by proceedings in the Common Pleas of Allegheny county, the name was changed to “ The Penn Bank.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b401-7" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[186,1266,1167,249]]]'>2. The said bank from the time at which it began business at Pittsburgh in 1873 was engaged in a regular banking business of discount and deposit, and continued in that business until May 26, 1884, and during that time did a very large business, having at various times deposits exceeding $2,000,000.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b401-8" data-blocks='[["BL_401.7",401,[186,1522,1167,185]]]'>3. The said bank became insolvent, and on May 26, 1884, closed its doors, and on May 28, 1884, made a voluntary assignment to Henry Warner, the plaintiff, who accepted the trust.</p>

Riddle, one of the defendants, was cashier of said bank from the commencement of its business in Pittsburgh until 1882, and president from that date until the bank finally closed its doors on May 26,1884.

During the year 1883 the said Riddle withdrew, and allowed to be withdrawn, large sums of money belonging to the Penn Bank for the purpose of carrying on an oil deal. This action on the part of Mr. Riddle was an illegal use of the funds of the bank, and was unauthorized by the charter of the bank, <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>and without the knowledge of the board of directors or any member of the board, except F.

    <p class="summary" id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[258,548,1174,1206]]]'>6. The object of the deal was to advance the market price of oil from about 90 cents to $1.50 per barrel. There was purchased between the early part of 1883 and of July 18, 1883, about 5,000,000 barrels, and about 3,000,000 sold from time to time. The purchases were made for the primary object of the deal and also to sustain the market. The sales from time to time were made to prevent the market from advancing too rapidly, which it was supposed might defeat the primary object. When the purchases began, the market price was about 90 cents per barrel, and advanced with some fluctuations to $1.24 per barrel, when the market broke and all the oil then on hands and bought under the deal, being about 3,000,000 barrels, was sold at from 98 cents to $1.01 per barrel. No oil was actually received or delivered in the transactions, but certificates representing actual oil in the pipe lines were handled as a general thing. Certificates were purchased from brokers, a check of the bank given for the price, the certificates were then sent East, and ninety per cent borrowed on the certificates, and a margin of ten per cent kept up out of the bank’s funds. All the oil was margined in this or some similar manner. The bank’s funds were also used to pay brokerage, storage and interest. The brokerage was $1.25 per thousand barrels for buying and selling. The storage was 41f cents per day per thousand barrels.</p>

    <p id="b405-7" data-blocks='[["BL_405.7",405,[153,1116,1169,711]]]'>The specifications of error from one to six, inclusive, allege that the master erred in his findings of fact. Moreover, they are not properly assigned, being to the action of the master and not of the court, and might well be dismissed for that reason alone. All of the master’s findings, however, have been approved by the court below, and are entitled to the weight of the verdict of a jury. While there was conflicting evidence upon some of the questions of fact involved, and I am not sure, were the testimony before me as a master, that I would not have found one or two of the facts the other way, there was evidence sufficient to submit to a jury, and we are not prepared to say, at this stage of the proceeding, that the master erred in his findings. They are not so palpably erroneous as to justify us in setting them aside.</p>
    <p id="b405-8" data-blocks='[["BL_405.8",405,[151,1835,1169,557]],["BL_406.1",406,[296,344,1169,299]]]'>The seventh assignment gives us more difficulty. It goes to the jurisdiction. I doubt whether the jurisdiction can be sustained upon the ground that Riddle was a trustee. It is true he was the president of the Penn Bank, and there are expressions in the books which indicate that to some extent such officers are trustees of the corporation’s funds. But they are quasi trustees merely; not technical trustees, over which equity has jurisdiction. The term “ trust ” is a very comprehensive one. As was said by Chancellor Kent, in Kane v. Bloodgood, <a href="/johns-ch/7/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="7 Johns. Ch. 90" data-case-ids="1984174" data-case-paths="/johns-ch/7/0090-01">7 Johns.

Every person who receives money <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>to be paid to another, or to be applied to a particular purpose, is a trustee. The cases of hirer and letter to hire, borrower and lender, pawner and pawnee, principal and agent, are all cases of express trust,” etc. It has never been held, however, that these and. the like cases are such technical trusts as to bring them within our limited equity jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.4",406,[295,651,1171,706]]]'>While the case is extremely close, we think the jurisdiction can be sustained, upon the ground that the remedy at law is inadequate. That there is a remedy at law is not denied. That, however, is not alone sufficient to oust the jurisdiction of equity. There must not only be such remedy, but it must be an adequate one, and reasonably convenient. A glance at this case is sufficient to show that the remedy at law would be inconvenient, if not inadequate. It would be difficult to reach all of its ramifications upon a jury trial. There is such a mass of accounts and complications that it would be next to impossible for a jury to reach an intelligent result. While the case is on the very border line of the jurisdiction, we have come to the conclusion, after much reflection, that the remedy at law is inadequate.</p>
