It is <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>clear that there is no discharge from liability in express and unequivocal terms. If it is to be found in the paper, it must be as an inference from the general terms used, or as an incident to an agreement to live separate and apart. We see nothing in the covenants of the husband to indicate an intent to Secure exemption from future maintenance. It is true that he agrees “ to pay for her better support and maintenance,” $50 in hand, $100 in furniture, and $400 in stock (worthless in the end), but the inference that such words were intended to cover her support for all time, in the absence of express terms, would be, we take it, a strained view of its meaning. Does the covenant of the wife relieve the husband ? It does not appear to us to have that effect. The interpretation which might fairly be given to its meaning would be a release of his estate from the dower interest of the wife in property then held or to be acquired. That such is the unquestionable effect of the language cannot be denied, and we think that ought to be the extent of its application. We take the view, that if the husband is to secure discharge from the marital obligation to support and maintain his wife, otherwise than by a decree in divorce, the stipulation in the agreement for such result as a consequence of amicable separation ought to be made to appear, as the contract of the parties, in plain and unmistakable terms. To take away the right from the wife it ought to be justified by express words or by necessary implication, and in the writing we find neither of these essentials.</p>

But I would be inclined to <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>the opinion that the wife by her own act, where the public interests were not involved, might deprive herself of any resort to her husband for support as a personal right. If held to be capable of contracting, it may be contended reasonably that there ought to be no limit to its extent, in so far as it affects her individual rights and personal comfort. The opposite view, however, is taken in the case of Commonwealth v. Orth, 2 Pears. 446. In that case, a contract was entered into between the parties, with the interposition of a trustee of the wife, by which the husband bound himself to pay her a certain sum of money for past maintenance, and the sum of $12.50 per month so long as she should live, they agreeing to live separate. The wife, who at the time was in a state of health to maintain herself in part, became afterwards sickly, and commenced a proceeding in the Court of Quarter Sessions for maintenance under the act of April 13, 1867. The court say: “We are of opinion that by a fair construction of this act, it will apply to cases where husband and wife have separated by agreement as well as to those of desertion..... The court is then, under the second section of the act, bound to inquire into the neglect and ability of the husband, and order such sum as shall be thought necessary and proper for the comfortable support and maintenance of the wife..... It is a duty from which he cannot escape by a voluntary separation.” The syllabus of the case states the purport of the decision to be that, “ under the act of April 13, 1867, the court can make an order that a husband shall maintain his wife, wdien the parties have separated by agreement and the wife has no adequate means of support.”</p>

The judgment should be revdrsed for another reason, viz.: that the wife has released her husband from all claim upon him for support. The release contained in the deed is twofold. In the first place, she releases the defendant personally ; the plain meaning of which is that he is to be discharged from liability for support, and such undoubtedly was the intention of the parties. This position is strengthened by the subsequent language of the contract, for in the next clause <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>she renounces all claims upon the estate of her husband.

There is no finding, nor was there any evidence that she is unable to maintain herself. The case is simply one between these two parties, in which neither the public nor any third person has any interest. Therefore, independent of the fact that she has released him, the wife cannot complain that the husband has not performed the duties imposed upon him by the marriage contract, when she has abandoned him and her child, and continues to disregard all her marital duties. Mutuality is of the essence of the obligations created by the contract of marriage, just as in the case of any other contract.</p>

The ground upon which all such cases proceed is, that any separation without legal sentence, for causes by law approved, is contrary to the policy of the law; and if a party has once consented to it, he may change his wrongful consent, and do right, by revoking at his pleasure: Bishop on Mar. &amp; Div., § 806.</p>

    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[226,383,1181,1328]]]'>This is a proceeding under the act of April 18, 1867, P. L. 78, brought by Emma Richards against her husband, Thomas Richards, to obtain an order upon him for her maintenance and support. The complaint is that on September 20, 1887, the defendant, residing in Allegheny city, “did then and there, without any cause or provocation, desert and abandon ” his wife, and since that day “ has failed and refused to provide anything toward her support and maintenance.” At the trial in the Quarter Sessions the defendant offered in evidence a deed of voluntary separation dated March 11, 1886, by the terms of which the parties, “ in view of divers disputes and unhappy differences ” which had arisen between them, had consented and agreed to live separate and apart from each other during their natural lives, etc. The husband agreed to, and actually did, place in the hands of his wife, “towards her better support and maintenance,” the sum of $50 in cash, household goods to the amount of $100, and four shares of stock in the Co-operative Foundry of Beaver Falls, Pa., of the par value of $100 each. In consideration thereof the wife agreed to discharge the said Thomas Richards, his heirs and assigns, and his estate, from all claims, etc.; the husband to have the custody of their child, William Emmett, etc. The question as to the effect of these articles of separation is brought upon the record by a formal bill of exceptions, and, as no question is raised as to the disposition of the ease on a certiorari, we will consider it as the parties have, presented it.</p>

The validity of. such covenants, although exceptional in their status, has been established by repeated decisions of this court. Ordinarily these agreements, as in Dillinger’s App., <a href="/pa/35/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="35 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="990511" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0357-01">35 Pa. 357</a>, have been carried into effect through the medium of a trustee ; but the undoubted weight of authority is that there may be a valid agreement for the separation directly between husband and wife, without the intervention of a trustee, which the courts will sanction: Hutton v. Hutton, <a href="/pa/3/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="3 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="400537" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0100-01">3 Pa. 100</a>; Smith v.

In such cases the husband himself will be treated as a trustee for the specific purpose in view, and will be held accordingly. If the object of the agreement is actual and immediate, if the terms are reasonable, and it is actually carried into effect by both parties in good faith, it will be as binding upon the wife as upon her husband.</p>
    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[196,701,1179,1272]]]'>In the case at bar, we do not understand that there is any allegation of fraud or unfairness, or that the terms of the deed of separation were, in any respect, unreasonable. How, then, under such circumstances, can the husband, upon the complaint of the wife, be convicted of a crime in failing to do what he was under no legal obligation to do ? Can his wife, after having by a formal deed bound him to permit her to live separate and alone, and absolved him from her maintenance, immediately thereafter enter a criminal complaint, and procure his arrest and conviction, for doing what she had bound him both in law and in equity to do ? The proceedings are not under the act of 1836, but under the act of 1867; they are instituted by the wife, not by the children or by the overseers of the poor; and it is difficult to see how the wife, in such case, could at the same time hold her husband to perform the articles, and convict him of a crime for doing so. The absurdity of such a result is apparent. If the prosecution were in behalf of the children, or by the overseers of the poor, a question would bo presented which it is not necessary now to discuss. Certainly a husband, as between himself and his wife, cannot be said to have separated himself from her without reasonable cause, when she has by deed placed him under legal obligation “ not to visit her, or to enter any house where she may happen to be,” and “ to permit her to live separate from him,” and to carry on business on her own account as if she were a feme sole.</p>

If this be so, for much stronger reasons will the husband, under such circumstances, be relieved from a criminal prosecution, instituted by the wife herself, to obtain an order for her maintenance.</p>
