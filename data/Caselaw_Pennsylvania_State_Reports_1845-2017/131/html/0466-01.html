    <p class="summary" id="b493-6" data-blocks='[["BL_493.5",493,[203,727,1171,702]]]'>This is an action of trespass to recover damages from defendant, a gas company, for going upon the lot of plaintiff without any authority of law whatever. It is conceded that the company went on the lot without any authority of law, and dug a trench, and put in a large gas pipe; and for that the plaintiff is entitled to damages, because the law does not permit any company, nor any person, to go upon the property of another and injure it in any way, without being liable to pay damages. But a short time after this injury, for which the plaintiff must have some damages, was done, about October 81st, I believe, the defendant company took regular proceedings under the law, by filing an appropriation plot, and bond securing plaintiff any damages for injury to the lot that he might show thereafter.</p>

But it appears that afterwards, regular proceedings were had, and, from the date of the confirmation of that bond, the 81st of October, damages to the plaintiff would stop. You can give damages up to that date, but not after, because in that proceeding, when it comes to he heard, the plaintiff will get the difference in value of his lot before the pipe was put down and after, as affected by it. In other words, he will then get full damages for the injury to the value of his property. So, the plaintiff is entitled, without any question, to damages in the amount yon may think this trespass cost him up to the 31st of October. That much he must have under the law.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.4",494,[243,423,1179,1273]]]'>The rule of law ordinarily in trespass is to give only compensatory damages; that is, money to compensate what the damage really was; full damages. The learned counsel for defendant contends that this was nothing but an ordinary going upon a man’s land, cutting a ditch and putting a pipe down, without any intention to do any harm, or without doing any more than the ordinary damage; that there was no wantonness. He alleges there was some sort of a mistake. I do not see much evidence of it, but he contends there is nothing to make it a gross outrage. On the other hand, the learned counsel for plaintiff contends that the evidence shows maliciousness, grossness ; that the outrage was gross, and he puts it on this ground, and it is for you to judge; that plaintiff heard the company were going on his land, and went to inquire whether it was really true (because if it was true, he might have proceeded in court and stopped them till they gave the proper bond and took the proper proceeding) ; was informed that they were not going that way, and when he got away they went upon the land, and, as he says, took a short route and did this injury. He contends that was a malicious, positive outrage upon his rights, and you ought to punish them for it. If you find such was the case, that there was grossness, outrage, wilfulness, maliciousness, or aggravation, under the circumstances, you might add a reasonable amount to what you think he is entitled to, up to the 31st of October, by way of punishment.</p>

All after that will be tried in the other case, how much this pipe has damaged him, and cannot be tried in this, after October. For the injury done up to that time you must give compensation; and if you find there was grossness, outrage, maliciousness, wantonness, in the conduct of the company in going on this lot, you may add such sum by way of punitive damages as you think proper.] a</p>

Keil’s testimony, showing the deception practiced upon him, was not contradicted or denied. The trespass was reckless, wanton and wilful.

This the engineer in charge of the line testifies was done by the mistake of the workmen, and was not in accordance with the plan of the company. When the mistake was discovered, the gas company tendered a bond to Keil, which was subsequently approved by the court, and then instituted proceedings to secure the condemnation of the ground occupied by them, and an assessment of the damages sustained by the owner. Pending these proceedings, this action was brought in the month of November following the entry.</p>

The subsequent tender of a bond, and proceedings for the condemnation of the land, do not divest the right of action for the trespass, although they transfer the adjustment of the damages necessarily consequent upon the entry under the right of eminent domain from the common law action to the statutory proceeding. The right to sue, however, vested at the commission of the trespass: McClinton v. Railway Co., <a href="/pa/66/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="66 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="432480" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0404-01">66 Pa. 404</a>; and damages for the breach of the close, and for any deprivation of use, or other injury sustained prior to the tender of the bond, are recoverable in this action. But for the permanent injury by reason of the appropriation of part of Keil’s lot, and the ef<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>feet of such appropriation on the remainder, the damages are secured by the bond, and will be assessed in the proceeding instituted for that purpose, and now pending.</p>
    <p id="b498-5" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[256,477,1171,656]]]'>We have not been furnished with a copy of the plaintiff’s declaration in this ease, and we do not know for what items of injury he claimed a right to recover. The claim actually made on the trial, we can gather from the evidence upon which the jury were allowed to pass, and on which their verdict rests. From this it appears that no- allegation was made of the destruction of buildings, fences, trees, or herbage; on the contrary, the lot was unoccupied and uninclosed, without buildings or improvements, and was open to the public. There was therefore no proof of damage presented except that which resulted from the mere breach of the close, and that which was done by the actual appropriation. The evidence all related to the permanent injury done by the entry and appropriation.</p>
    <p id="b498-6" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[251,1140,1174,1062]]]'>The plaintiff made a formal offer on the trial to prove by witnesses “ what' was the market value of that lot before this was done, and what was its value with that pipe in, in the manner they put it in.” This was objected to as presenting to the jury the same injury, and the same measure of damages, which were to be considered and estimated in the pending proceeding for the assessment of damages for the entry .and appropriation by the gas company. The learned judge of the court below overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence. This was clearly wrong. The objection was well taken, and the evidence should have been excluded. The injury which it showed the plaintiff -to "have sustained was that to secure which the bond had been tendered him, and to assess the amount of which proceedings had been begun on the petition of the gas company. The value of the land taken, and the depreciation in the value of that which was left by rendering its occupancy unsafe, or in any other manner, are questions that must come up, and be determined, in the proceeding to assess the damages; and to permit the jury to pass upon them in this case, is to expose the defendant to the danger of having two judgments rendered against him for one cause of action.</p>
    <p id="b498-7" data-blocks='[["BL_498.6",498,[251,2210,1169,146]],["BL_499.1",499,[168,329,1179,1387]]]'>It is urged that this mistake was corrected by the learned judge in his charge to the jury, and ought therefore to be disregarded. He said, speaking of the pending proceeding to <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>assess damages done to tlie plaintiff:: “ He will then get full damages for the entire injury to the value of his property. So the plaintiff is entitled, without any question, to damages in the amount you may think this trespass cost him up to the 81st of October. That much he must have under the law.” This is a correct statement of the law; and if the incompetent evidence covered by the first assignment of error had not been before the jury, it would have been an adequate instruction. But the incompetent evidence was before them, and there was no other proof of injury except that resulting from the mere breach of an uninclosed close. It was not withdrawn from them, nor were they cautioned to leave it out of consideration in making up the damages. They were instructed simply to “ give the plaintiff compensation for the trespass upon his rights up to October 81st, whatever you think that is. All after that will be tried in the other case, how much this pipe has damaged him, and cannot be tried in this, after October. For the injury up to that time you must give compensation.” As there was no proof of other items of damage done, and no instruction turning the attention of the jury away from the incompetent testimony before them, the jurors would naturally understand that they were at liberty to consider it, and from it estimate the injury sustained by the plaintiff. Their attention should have been drawn to the trespass, and its immediate consequences, as distinguished from the injury resulting from the appropriation of a part of the plaintiff’s lot, and the consequent depreciation in value of the part not appropriated.</p>
    <p id="b499-5" data-blocks='[["BL_499.4",499,[167,1726,1178,663]],["BL_500.1",500,[250,324,1186,920]]]'>The instruction on the subject of exemplary damages was both indefinite and inadequate. The court presented this subject to the jury in this manner: “ The learned counsel for defendant contends that this was nothing but an ordinary going upon a man’s land, cutting a ditch, and putting a pipe down, without any intention to do any harm, or without doing more than ordinary damage; that there was no wantonness.” He then stated the position of the plaintiff thus: “ On the other hand, the learned counsel for plaintiff contends that the evidence shows maliciousness, grossness; that the outrage was gross; and he puts it on this ground, and it is for you to judge.” But jurors ought to dispose of questions submitted to them upon the evidence, and in accordance with certain general rules that <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>should govern them in its application. What evidence was there in this case to show malice on the part of this gas company or its officers ? Did a mistake of the laborers engaged in laying the pipe show malice on the part of their employer ? Was the gas company to be punished for the trespass of its employees, committed without its knowledge, and against its instructions, by imposing smart money on it ? The jury were left with no more definite information on this subject than they could gather from the direction, “it is for you to judge.” Unless there was evidence showing the purpose of this company to oppress or injure the plaintiff unnecessarily, or at the least showing culpable inattention and neglect in the conduct of its affairs, resulting in an unnecessary injury to the plaintiff, there was no reason for imposing exemplary damages. The ends of justice are fully met, under ordinary circumstances, when the employer makes full compensation for the trespass of his employee, without subjecting him to punishment for his employee’s malice or cruelty.</p>
