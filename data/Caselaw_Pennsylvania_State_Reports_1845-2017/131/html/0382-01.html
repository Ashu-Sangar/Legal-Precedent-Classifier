Walker, executor of tlie will of Mary Rogers, deceased, was called for audit. Neither the will of the decedent, nor the testimony taken at the audit was printed in the paper-books, but it was stated in the paper-book of the appellant that Mary Rogers died on December 8, 1886, leaving a will in which some bequests were made, but as to the balance for distribution in this proceeding she died intestate, unmarried and without issue, leaving to survive her no father or mother, brothers or sisters, uncles or aunts. She left surviving, however, first cousins, who were the children of deceased uncles and aunts, and second cousins, who were the grandchildren of deceased uncles and aunts.</p>

(2) That under that act they took per capita. (3) The act of 1855 did not by words, or implication, take that estate away, but merely directed that the shares of first coirsins should be taken per stirpes, leaving those of the remoter degrees to be <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>taken per capita.' (4) That Brenneman’s Appeal so far as it disinherits second' cousins, destroys the estates of second cousins, without words in the act of 1855 to authorize such destruction. (5) That the promotion into the class of collaterals of first cousins, as decided by Brenneman’s Appeal, so that as such superior class they take ahead of next of kin, and thus preferring first cousins to living uncles and aunts, who are nearer in blood, but take only as next of kin, is illogical, injurious and unnecessary.</p>

Under the common law rule, estates descended either lineally or collaterally. The appellants, in their argument, seek to introduce a new mode of descent. They desire us to infer that estates may descend lineally or collaterally, or to next of kin; the descent to next of kin is certainly a new invention, and is an ingenious attempt to evade the well settled rule regulating the law of descent. In the law regulating descents, next of kin was a term applied to persons standing in the same degree with respect to the ancestor, and means “ nearest of blood relatives.”</p>
