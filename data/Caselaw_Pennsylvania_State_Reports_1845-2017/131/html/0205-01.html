Smyth, <a href="/pa/54/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="54 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="1006287" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0245-01">54 Pa. 245</a>; Wells v.

Its only effect was to enlarge the life estate of Edward M. Yard, by conferring upon him the power to sell and convey, and to limit the inheritance to the heirs of Josephine O. Yard in the maternal line. The revocation, if well made, restores the estate to its former condition, leaving to Edward M. Yard his estate as tenant by curtesy, and to Josephine a fee-simple absolute. The deed tendered to defendant conveys these interests.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b231-6" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[198,1281,1174,146]]]'>It is argued that the power of revocation in the deed of May 8, 1874, is coupled with the duty to declare new uses, and is inoperative until such new uses shall have been duly declared.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b231-7" data-blocks='[["BL_231.7",231,[199,1435,1174,917]]]'>In the case of Grange v. Irving, cited in 1 Sugden on Powers, 440, in which the power was similar to that in the deed of May 8, 1874, it was held that these two powers, to revoke and declare new uses, were clearly two distinct powers, and though these powers of revoking and declaring new uses were both in one proviso, yet he who hath both the powers may use the one and not the other. It has even been doubted whether the two powers could be exercised in one deed; and, though in the case of Hoover v. Samaritan Society, <a href="/whart/4/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Whart. 445" data-case-ids="1834989" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0445-01">4 Wh. 445</a>, it was held that a new appointment might be made in the same instrument revoking the old, it was not upon the ground that they were dependent one upon the other, but because in construction of law the instrument is first a revocation and then a limitation of new uses. In their nature they are distinct and independent powers. A power to deciare new uses includes in itself a power to revoke, and therefore if it were intended to make the one dependent upon the other, it would not be necessary to specially designate the power to revoke.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b231-8" data-blocks='[["BL_231.8",231,[244,2360,1125,43]],["BL_232.1",232,[262,353,1184,404]]]'>But there can be no question but that the parties to the <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>deed in this case could have declared new uses for Edward M. Yard for life, and Josephine O. Yard in fee. This is the effect of a revocation without a new declaration. The parties before the execution of the deed of May 8, 1874, being possessed of the lands with those estates upon revocation of the uses therein declared, they would without more be in of their former estates : 2 Sugden on Powers, 30; the law would raise up this old use and vest it in them: 1 Sugden on Powers, 441.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b232-4" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[258,764,1186,559]]]'>The estates which they take upon revocation, by implication of law, being within the power of the new appointment, it must be presumed that without any special declaration they intended it should have that effect. There is no special mode for executing a power unless specially prescribed. A substantial execution of the power is all that is required. It was accordingly held in Coryell v. Dnnton, <a href="/pa/7/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="957903" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0530-01">7 Pa. 530</a>, where property was conveyed to a trustee for the separate use of Ann Dunton, with a further power that she might revoke, alter, change the uses and declare new ones, that “ a conveyance by her and her husband, though not referring to the power, passes the estates.”</p>

Yard, now Breese, subject to her father’s life estate as tenant by the curtesy, and their deed conveys a good title free from the trusts and limitations of the latter deed. Judgment must therefore be entered for the plaintiff upon the case stated.</p>
