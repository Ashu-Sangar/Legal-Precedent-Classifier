      <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>In Sperrow v. Wood, 5 Halst. 7, Ewing, C. J., cites with approbation Sergeant Williams’ note to Yeale v. Harmer, in which he says : “ Hence it seems to follow that, to an action <em>on an </em>award the <em>defendant </em>cannot plead collusion or other misconduct of the arbitrator in avoiding the award.” In Barlow v. Todd, 3 Johns. *368, Spencer, J., says : “ It is now well established that, at law, nothing dehors the award, invalidating it, can be pleaded or given in evidence to the jury. Chitty says: ‘ Partiality or improper conduct in the arbitrator cannot be pleaded at bar to an action on the bond conditioned for performance of an award: ’ 2 Chitty 477.” But, while this seems to be the case elsewhere, I am of the opinion that in this state such a rule would not be enforced, and that a plea of fraud and collusion between the arbitrator'and one of the parties, would be good in an action upon the awarcj to recover an amount claimed to be due under it. Such seems to be intimated by Mercur, C. J., in Hostetter v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20Pa.%20435" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="107 Pa. 435">107 Pa. 435</a>, where he says: “ The award, like a judgment, may undoubtedly be impeached for fraud, which avoids all judicial acts. Partiality and some improper conduct of the arbitrator in making the award will not impeach it, unless the party benefited thereby be implicated in that misconduct.”</p>

It seems that there is no difficulty in holding that, whatever may be the case, where an action is brought to enforce an award, so far as being allowed to set up an equitable defence is concerned, that equitable foundation should still be maintained where the purpose is to recover against a fraudulent award. To do complete justice, the only course is to sweep the award away. And here we find no difficulty as to authority.</p>

Fraud may be introduced, in Pennsylvania, as a defence to an action on an award, as the opinion of Stowe, P. J., in this case shows ; and the offers in Hostetter v. Pittsburgh, supra, were rejected, not because fraud would not be a defence, but because they did hot tend to show collusion between the city and the arbitrator. The offers in the case at bar are the same in kind and facts,, though less extensive, than those rejected in the other case. Their inadmissibility is'flatly ruled by the decision of this court in that case.</p>

Alter this decision, the mechanical engineer proceeded to make an award at the request of the city, and made the award referred to in the bill. The city then brought two suits upon the award against the sureties of Hartupee in bonds given to secure the performance of his contracts. These suits were transferred to Beaver county for trial. One of them was tried and judgment was rendered therein for the eity, which on writ of error was affirmed at October Term 1884: Hostetter v.

Andrew Hartupee, the appellant, contracted in the year 1872 with the city of Pittsburgh, to furnish two pumping engines for the city water works at a cost of $423,550, and to have the same completed and ready for service on or before November 15, 1873. A subsequent contract was made for two more engines at a cost of $375,000, to be completed on or before November 15, 1874. The engines were not finished within the time fixed; the city alleged that the materials used were defective, and not according to specifications. Finally, the city took possession of the engines, completed them, and refused to pay the price stipulated in the agreement. Hartupee then brought an action of assumpsit against the city to recover the stipulated price agreed upon, and was defeated upon two grounds; <em>(a) </em>that he had not complied with his contracts, and (b) that the matters at variance between them should have been submitted to the arbitrament of the mechanical engineer who had the control of the work on the part of the city. See Hartupee v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/97/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="97 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="444810" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0107-01">97 Pa. 107</a>. Subsequently, the case was submitted to the mechanical engineer, who made an award in favor of the city and against Hartupee. Thereupon the city brought suit on the award against David Hostetter, who was Hartupee’s surety for the faithful performance of his contract, and recovered a verdict against him of $375,000, to be released on the payment of $190,200. This case will be found reported as Hostetter v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/107/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="107 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="8858058" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0419-01">107 Pa. 419</a>. The present suit was a bill in equity filed by Hartupee against the city, the object of <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>which was, <em>(a) </em>to set aside the award, and (5) to recover the sum of $305,370.16, being the balance claimed by Hartupee as due him under the contracts, and for extra work and material, with costs of suit.</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[188,548,1175,147]]]'>The case was heard below by the learned president of Common Pleas No. 1, as examiner and master, under the following agreement of counsel:</p>
    <p id="b569-5" data-blocks='[["BL_569.5",569,[183,704,1181,550]]]'>“And now, December 26, 1888, the court having on the joint application of the plaintiff and defendants consented to sit as master and examiner in this case and hear the testimony of both sides, and the preliminary question involved, now defines said preliminary question to which the testimony shall be confined, as follows: Whether the award of Joseph L. Lowry, meehanical engineer, specified in the bill, and in favor of the city of Pittsburgh, was induced in the manner as charged in the bill, by fraud and collusion, between the said Joseph L. Lowry and the city of Pittsburgh, its agents or representatives?”</p>
    <p id="b569-6" data-blocks='[["BL_569.6",569,[180,1273,1183,662]]]'>It is manifest that the settlement of this preliminary question was a prerequisite to the plaintiff being beard upon the merits of his ease. The award of the mechanical engineer was a flat bar to his recovery so long as it was allowed to stand. But if the said award had been procured by fraud in which the city participated, the plaintiff had a right to have it set aside. This court so said in Hostetter v. Pittsburgh, supra, at page 435. The bill came on to be heard before the learned judge below, sitting as examiner and master, and after an exhaustive examination and consideration, the learned judge found and decreed that the allegations of fraud contained in said bill were not sustained. This is the question which now comes here upon this appeal.</p>

An extended discussion is not required as to either. The offers of evidence varied somewhat, but not essentially, from those made in Hostetter v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/citations/?q=107%20Pa.%20435" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="107 Pa. 435">107 Pa. 435</a>, where this court held that they did not tend to connect the city of Pittsburgh with any fraud in the procurement of the award. The offers here, if admitted and proved, would not have connected the <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>city with the alleged fraud. They are substantially, as before observed, the same as were made upon the trial in Beaver county, where they were rejected, not because fraud was not a defence, but because they did not offer to show collusion between the city of Pittsburgh and the referee. <em>We </em>have examined this case with care, and with an anxious desire to see that no injustice has been done to the plaintiff, but we fail to find any legal reason why we should disturb the decree of the court below.</p>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[511,803,923,96]]]'>The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>
