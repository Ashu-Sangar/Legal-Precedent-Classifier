E. M. Hukill, lessee, did not commence operations within one year from the date of the execution of the lease, nor did he pay to the lessor the sum of $5.50 a month; whereupon William P. Core, the lessor, declared the lease forfeited.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b325-9" data-blocks='[["BL_325.8",325,[194,1312,1175,960]]]'>The demurrer admits all the allegations contained in the bill. The defendant’s lease or license to bore for oil was made August 11,1885. Ho covenanted to give to the lessor, Core, one ninth of the oil produced; to begin operations within one year from the execution of the lease, or thereafter to pay Core, the lessor, 85.50 per month, until work should be commenced ; and a failure on the part of said second party, Hukill, to comply with either one or the other of the foregoing conditions, shall work an absolute forfeiture of this lease. The bill asserts, and the demurrer admits, that the defendant, the lessee, wholly failed to commence operations for said purpose within one year from and after the date of the execution of said lease, and wholly failed thereafter to pay to the said lessor the sum of $5.50 per month; that the said William P. Core thereafter declared the lease forfeited, and that on March 7, 1888, the said W. P. Core granted, demised and leased the said premises for the purpose of drilling for oil, etc., to O. B. Ryall, the assignor of plaintiffs. This being so, we are of the opinion that the first lease was forfeited.</p>

We have then a lease held by the complainants which entitles them to enter on this tract of land and bore for oil and gas. And the defendant is a trespasser boring for and obtaining oil.

    <p id="b327-8" data-blocks='[["BL_327.7",327,[208,1153,1167,1014]]]'>The learned judge below held that he had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of this controversy, notwithstanding it was real estate situated in West Yirginia, from the fact that the parties, plaintiffs and defendant, were residents of the county of Allegheny. He dismissed the bill, however, upon the ground that it was an ejectment bill, and that the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law, either by an action of ejectment in the courts of West Yirginia, or in an action at law for damages, and cited Stewart’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/78/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="78 Pa. 88" data-case-ids="1040375" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0088-01">78 Pa. 88</a>. We entirely agree with the conclusion of the learned judge, and are not disposed to criticise his reasons therefor, further than to say that, while it is true the residence of all the parties in the county of Allegheny gave the court jurisdiction over them, the fact of the subject-matter of the controversy being real estate situate in another state rendered the exercise of such jurisdiction of at least doubtful propriety. While the proceeding was in form a bill in equity, it was in substance a possessory action, involving the title to real estate. In such case a decree of this court could only affect the persons of the litigants; it could not control the title or possession of a tract of land in West Yirginia.</p>
