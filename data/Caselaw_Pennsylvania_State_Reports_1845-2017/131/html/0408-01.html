Oliver, then two years of age. In 1870, when the defendant company was preparing to construct its railroad and was engaged in procuring rights of way therefor, Martha Oliver, being in the occupancy of the land of which her husband died seised, executed an agreement stipulating, in consideration of benefits and one dollar, to grant to the defendant the right of way for said road through said land. In the fall of 1871, the defendant constructed its road, taking possession of and occupying for that pulpóse the strip of ground in controversy. Abdiel McClure, the duly appointed guardian of Robert A. Oliver, and duly qualified as such, was one of the promoters of the building of the railroad, and it was constructed through the Oliver property with his knowledge and without objection on his part. The defendant never gave any bond securing the payment of compensation to or for the use of Robert A. Oliver, for the appropriation of the right of way, and never made such payment; nor was any claim or demand therefor ever made by the guardian, or by any one else <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>on behalf of said minor. From the time of its construction until the trial, the defendant’s railroad was continuously maintained and operated upon the ground sought to be recovered in this action. Martha Oliver died December 31, 1872, and on October 19, 1882, Robert A. Oliver, who was still in his minority, died, leaving the plaintiffs, who are his cousins, as his next of kin and heirs.</p>

The plaintiffs, not having been the owners of the land at the time of the construction of the road, but having derived their estate by inheritance many years after its completion, are not entitled to recover in ejectment. In all the cases in which such ejectments have been sustained, the plaintiffs not only owned the land at the date of the tortious entry upon it by the defendant, but continued to own it at the date of bringing ejectment. From other decisions of this court, it is clear that the right to recover in such an action is personal to the owner at the date of the entry, and does not pass to the grantee or his heirs: McFadden v. Johnson, <a href="/pa/72/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="72 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="434710" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0335-01">72 Pa. 335</a>; Davis v.

The right to compensation, if any injuries were sustained, was complete in Robert A. Oliver in his lifetime, and passed on his death to his personal representatives.

If the persons who owned the land at the time of the location and construction of the railroad, assented to the defendant’s entry and occupation of the land, its possession was lawful and gave it an easement, leaving for adjustment with the landowners only the matter of damages, if any were sustained, the right to damages being vested in the landowners by such appropriation: Davis v. Railway Co., <a href="/pa/114/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="114 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="550046" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0308-01">114 Pa. 308</a>; Lawrence’s App., <a href="/pa/78/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="78 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1040372" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0365-01">78 Pa. 365</a>. If the defendant so acquired an easement, the plaintiffs cannot recover in ejectment. The evidence of assent and acquiescence by the landowners should therefore have been submitted to the jury. That evidence does not involve any question of the power of the guardian to grant an easement in his ward’s land; no such grant was requisite; but the guardian being the proper party to receive any damages, he was competent to give the assent to the entry under which the franchise of the company vested the easement in it.</p>

They enter in pursuance of a bargain with or leave given by the owner, and their title rests on their bargain or contract, and not on the statute. Or, they may enter without compliance with the law, or treaty with the owner, in which ease they acquire no title, but are trespassers, and liable to an action of trespass or ejectment, at the election of the owner. The owner may be unable to agree with the corporation as to the injury sustained by him, and the statutory proceeding may have to be proceeded with until a final adjudication can be had, but the corporation may enter meantime, and proceed with the construction of their improvements, and the owner cannot interfere. If, however, he treats with the corporation, and they enter under permission from him, he stands on the same ground when contracting with a corporation as when contracting with an individual.

While the owner has not parted with his title by his own conveyance, or had it divested by proceedings under the statute, he has parted with the possession under circumstances, and permitted expenditures upon and use of the property of such a character, as to make it inequitable for him to resume the possession, or to defeat the right of the corporation to proceed under the statute, and add to its lawful possession a lawful title, by virtue of compliance with its provisions.</p>

The effect of the permissive entry is thus made the same as if a formal contract had been entered into, by which the landowner had agreed to put the corporation into possession, and accept as compensation such sum as might be awarded to him by proceedings under the general law. This protects the corporation in the expenditures made in consequence of its lawful entry on the land, while it secures to the owner the full measure of compensation to which he is entitled, under the law, for the entry and appropriation by the corporation.</p>
    <p id="b439-5" data-blocks='[["BL_439.4",439,[192,1159,1170,918]]]'>In the case now before us, the railroad company entered under a formal release of the right of way by the widow, who was in actual possession and the holder of an estate for life in the land, and with the knowledge and acquiescence of the guardian of the plaintiff’s intestate. Its entry was in no sense a trespass, therefore, but was rightful, subject only to an ascertainment of the damages done to the remainder-man. These should be assessed as of the date of the entry. It is urged that the damages, when assessed, do not belong to the plaintiffs below, and that their action must fail for that reason, and the damages be awarded to the administrator of the intestate under whom they claim as heirs at law. But the damages were not assessed in the lifetime of the decedent, nor were any steps taken to that end. Nothing was done, therefore, that could divest his title, and substitute its value in money therefor. That title descended, consequently, to his heirs at law, who now stand in his stead, and are clothed with his rights. Davis v. Railway Co., <a href="/pa/114/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="114 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="550046" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0308-01">114 Pa. 308</a>, and kindred cases, are therefore not applicable.</p>
