    <p class="summary" id="b368-6" data-blocks='[["BL_368.5",368,[235,1113,1177,804]]]'>We are of opinion that under the will of Joseph Dilworth, deceased, Louisa M. Dilworth took a fee-simple in the lot of ground described in the case stated. The language of the will is: “I give to my beloved wife, Louisa, in lieu of dower, my present residence, with the lands and improvements, as the same may he found at the time of my death..... Also the whole of my household furniture, pictures, goods and wares, together with my carriages, wagons and other vehicles, and all horses, cattle and other live stock on hands, the same not to be appraised or placed in any inventory whatever, as is usually required by law.” The ninth section of the act of April 8, 1888, declares: “ All devises of real estate shall pass the whole estate of the testator in the premises devised, although there be no words of inheritance or of perpetuity, unless it appear by a devise over, or by words of limitation, or otherwise in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate.”</p>

We can discover no such intention. There is no devise over of the land, no words of limitation, nor anything else in the will showing an intent to give his 'wife less than all his interest in the land described. On the contrary, we think that the will indicates the intent of the testator that his wife should have the land absolutely; for, after giving her, in addition to the articles aforementioned, <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>absolutely, bis interest in the firm of Dilwortb Bros., also 825.000 of his loan account in said firm, and 100 shares of 81.000 each, in the firm of Porter, Dilworth &amp; Co., he directs that the shares of his two daughters, Lizzie and Lulu, shall be invested by the executors, and the interest only paid them, and at their death, to go to their children, after they arrive at the age of twenty-one years. He then closes his will with this item: “Should my beloved wife desire to quit my present residence, and deem it advisable to sell the same at any time in fee-simple, and invest the proceeds in securities .as may be jointly agreed upon with my executors, it is my wish to grant her the power to do the same; ” thus indicating his intention that she should enjoy the entire proceeds. But even if the language should throw some doubt upon the question, due effect should still bo given to the statute, by declaring that the whole of the estate of the testator passed: Shirey v.
