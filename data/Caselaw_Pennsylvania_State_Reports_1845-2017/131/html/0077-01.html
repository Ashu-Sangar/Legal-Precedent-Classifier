"While the question has never been decided, so far as I know in Pennsylvania, I am free to say that my own opinion is, and I instruct the jury so in this case that it may be brought before the Supreme Court, that the supervisors are bound to have reasonable footpaths, whether they are stone or brick, or boards or cinders, or what not; that they at least have the right to put reasonable footwalks and paths along the side of the roads for people to walk upon; that having done this, they are bound to keep them in reasonably safe condition and repair; so that they will not be traps for people.....Ido not pretend to say that they are bound to build sidewalks, but once they do build them, take that responsibility upon themselves, they are bound then to see that parties who ordinarily and properly use that means of getting along the street, instead of taking the road itself, as they have to do in most of the-country roads, are reasonably protected. That being the state of the law, that these parties had the right to build sidewalks,- we come to this act of assembly [the act of April 2, 1869, P. L. 625].</p>

[There is not a particle of evidence that this sidewalk was built under the provisions of this act of assembly.] 4 The evidence shows that these parties wanted this sidewalk; anybody familiar with the location could see the necessity for it. There is the Novelty Works on one side, and a steep road near the station at Idlewood, with this narrow passage way along the foot of the hill, between that and the run, and it is a very unsafe place to get along in most seasons of the year, mud up to the knees almost the entire length, as I understand it. The parties living there wanted to have the means to get to and from the station and out into the little town, I believe, that is built on the side of the hill, although there is no evidence of that. But at all events, whether so or not, these parties or some parties determined that they would have a sidewalk. They had the power under this act of assembly to say, either or any of them, we will put down this sidewalk ourselves, or we will hire somebody to do it, and we will make the supervisor allow us to that extent on our taxes, enough to pay for -it. And they notified the supervisor of that. He did not direct them to go on and build it, or say anything about it, and-let them do as they pleased; but Clinton, as I understand his testimony, thinking to save money for the township, undertook to build this and appropriate the general taxes to its payment, getting the taxes that might otherwise be appropriated for the payment of this sidewalk from those parties, for the general use of the township. He did not build the sidewalk for these particular individuals, but he built it as supervisor of the township.</p>

Now in this case, to make a long story short, we instruct you that the defendants had the right to build this sidewalk. There is no evidence to indicate that the sidewalk was built under this act of assembly, but that it was built under the general powers of the supervisors to construct sidewalks in the township. Havi ng built it in that way, it was the duty of the township, through the supervisor, to keep it in reasonable care and condition, so that persons might not be injured. Then the question is, was this kept in such care and condition, or was the fact that the board was allowed to get loose, under the circumstances, such an act of carelessness and negligence as ought to have been prevented, and would have been prevented by reasonable care on the part of the supervisor ? If it was not, your verdict should be for the defendants. If it was, you ought to find a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>

When there is a special law providing for the erection of board walks, such as that applicable to this township, the supervisors have no right to build any such 'walks and make the township liable for their repair and maintenance. At least, one supervisor cannot by himself, and without any consultation with his colleagues, bind the township in this manner, in the circumstances of this case: Somerset Tp. v. Parson, <a href="/pa/105/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="105 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="454242" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0360-01">105 Pa. 360</a>.</p>

When the supervisor was asked to build the board walk by the plaintiff and others, whose taxes were more than sufficient for that purpose, they made him their agent to build it.

There was not a scintilla of evidence that the board walk was built under the act of April 2, 1869, P. L. 625. That act must be followed strictly, and a walk constructed under it must be paid for out of the road taxes of the citizens who build it. In this case, the evidence is clear and positive that the supervisor constructed this board walk and paid for it out of the general road funds of the township, thus departing from the terms and conditions of the act. We submit that one supervisor had power to place and keep the township road in good condition for easy and convenient traveling, and that this included the construction of a board walk for the easy and convenient passage of those on foot. And there are cases where a county or township is bound, even though its agent exceed his power in a particular apparently within his authority: Cook v. Deerfield Tp., <a href="/pa/64/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="64 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="1021220" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0445-01">64 Pa. 445</a>; Commissioners v.

The testimony shows that this work and the expenditures therefor were approved by the proper authorities when he settled his accounts in March, 1882, which approval removed any doubt as to his authority. And the question here is, not whether the township would have been liable for work and materials furnished for it, but whether there is a liability for injuries caused by this defective board walk nearly two years after its construction and approval by the township authorities. But, even if we assume that the township had no right to construct and keep the walk in repair, then it became the duty of the supervisor upon its condition becoming defective and upon his receiving reasonable notice of that fact, to either repair or remove it altogether: § 6, act of June 13, 1836, P.

The proof is distinct and clear, that he constructed it while supervisor. That it was built carelessty and defectively, the proof is also clear and positive. If he exceeded his authority in its constriction, thereby relieving the township from liability, then he should either have repaired the defect, or have removed it from the roadway altogether.

L. 625. But that act does not impose any duty, either of construction or maintenance, on the township, as we distinctly held in the case above referred to. It is not necessary to repeat the reasoning of that decision. It is entirely satisfactory to us, and controls the present case.</p>

But we do not so consider it. The acts of Clinton, although he was a supervisor, cannot bind the township, unless within the scope of his authority to bind it. But the act of 1869 gave him no such authority, and he had none under any other law. As we said before: “The act does not empower the super•visors to make footwalks, or keep them in repair; it authorizes, not requires tax-payers to make footwalks; and, if they do make them, it is their duty to keep them in repair.” The ev<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>idenee simply shows that Clinton, at the solicitation of the plaintiff and others, citizens and tax-payers of the township, built the footwalk in question, and paid for it out of the tax money of the township. But this tax money, so far as it came from the citizens who were urging him to build the footwalk, might be withhold from the township by the tax-payers, and appropriated to this very purpose, under the act of 1869 ; and tlxis is precisely what they threatened to do, if Clintoix did not build the footwalk. In these circumstances, and under the impulse of this threat, Clinton did build the footwalk, and he was supervisor at the time. But it is too plain for argument that in doiixg so he was merely acting as the agent of those taxpayers ; aixd neither they xxor he could, by any actioix of theirs, impose upon the towrxship a liability to which the towixship was xxot subject by law. We are clearly of opinion that the defendant’s third point should have been affirmed, and a verdict directed in favor of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[150,1252,1165,492]]]'>There is xxo aspect of the testimony in which Clinton can be held liable individually for the accident to the plaintiff. He was not sxxbject to any duty of repair as an individual. That duty rested upon the persons who dii-ected him to build the footwalk. Wheix he built it, he complied with their demand upoxx him ; but he did not thereby become subject to a duty of keeping the footwalk ixx repair, either in his official character as supervisor or as an individual. He had no custody of the foot-walk, and had no more to do with its preservation thaix any other citizen.</p>
