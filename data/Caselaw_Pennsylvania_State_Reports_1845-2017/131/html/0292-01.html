On the south side of its main track, is a siding which gradually diverges therefrom. About 125 feet west from the point at which the siding leaves the main track, both tracks are crossed by a wheelbarrow way, which is planked and used in transporting metal between different departments of the iron works, and is also used as a passage way by large numbers of the workmen there em<a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>ployed, while going to and from their work and passing between different parts of the premises. At the time of the accident, a quantity of pig iron was piled on each side of the barrow way and between the siding and the main track. The opening between the piles at the barrow way was between eight and twelve feet wide. The pile occupying the triangle formed by the main track, the siding and the barrow way, was higher than a man’s head, and its northern edge was at a distance of about three feet from the southern rail of the main track. The distance between the siding and the main track at the crossing of the barrow way was 23.4 feet.</p>

On the morning of December 27, 1888, about seven o’clock, while on his way to his work, he was proceeding along the barrow way. When he came close to the siding he encountered a man wheeling metal, who called to him to “ look out.” The plaintiff then stepped aside to let him pass, and before starting again looked up and down the railroad track, but neither saw nor heard any train approaching. Crossing the siding, he proceeded between the piles of metal, and, without again stopping or looking along the track, attempted to cross the main track. Just as he had set one foot across the southern rail, he heard some one calling “ Look out! ” He stopped, but, before he could step back, a train of twelve to fifteen freight cars that were being backed along the main track, coming from the east, struck him, inflicting upon him severe injuries.</p>

Other witnesses for the plaintiff testified respecting the character of the <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>morning on which, the plaintiff was injured, one of them saying it was rather dark, and another stating that it was “ just beginning to turn the break of the day, just about seven o’clock,” and that there was light enough to see 50 or 100 feet. John M. Triplett, a witness for the plaintiff, testified on cross-examination, that a man standing in the space between the piles of metal, three feet away from the defendant’s main track, could by turning his head to the right see down that track, in the direction the train came from, at least 40 feet. Thomas Harrington testified that since the accident a man had been stationed at the crossing to warn persons of approaching trains.</p>

The plaintiff was negligent, in that, after leaving the siding, and when he reached the main track, over twenty-three feet from the siding, he did not stop, look and listen, although at that point his view must have been unobstructed by the metal pile, but stepped immediately upon the track where he was at once struck by the train. The proof of his negligence was entirely clear, and the judgment of compulsory nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

    <p id="b320-7" data-blocks='[["BL_320.7",320,[241,1264,1188,711]]]'>The reasons on which the motion for compulsory nonsuit was grounded are, first, because no negligence of defendant contributing to the accident was shown; and second, because it was shown that the plaintiff’s own negligence contributed to the injury. The judgment appears to have been entered, generally, on both grounds; but it is scarcely possible that the learned president of the Common Pleas intended to base it even partly on the first. The evidence, tending to prove that the injury complained of was caused by defendant’s negligence, was clearly sufficient to not only carry the case to the jury on that question, but also to warrant them in finding in favor of plaintiff. The time, place, and circumstances of the injury were all for the consideration of the jury on that as well as the question of plaintiff’s contributory negligence.</p>
    <p id="b320-8" data-blocks='[["BL_320.8",320,[237,1983,1182,402]],["BL_321.1",321,[197,364,1176,865]]]'>According to the evidence, the accident occurred early in the morning, while it was yet quite dark, at a regular crossing, planked and habitually used by many of the employees of the adjacent mill. The train by which plaintiff was knocked down and severely injured consisted of a dozen or more cars, which were being backed over the crossing at a considerable rate of speed. No warning of its approach was given by sounding a whistle, ringing a bell, or otherwise; nor was there any brake<a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>man or other person on the forward end of the train, or any light there, to give warning of its approach. It was also in evidence that on either side of the track, at the crossing, the view was obstructed by pig metal, which had been piled there by defendant. It further appeared that a recent snow-fall on the track tended to deaden the sound of the approaching train. These and other facts, which the evidence tended to prove, were amply sufficient to require the submission of the case to the jury on both questions. The plaintiff himself testified that, immediately before attempting to cross the track, he stopped, looked and listened, and, not seeing or hearing anything that indicated the approach of a train, he proceeded to cross the track, and was struck by the forward car as it was being backed over the crossing. It is evident, from his statement of the occurrence, that if there had been even a light on the rear end of the train it would have afforded him timely warning of its approach.</p>

In the first place, a motion for a compulsory nonsuit is in effect a demurrer to plaintiff’s evidence. It must therefore be accepted! as true, and every reasonable inference of fact which a jury might draw from it in plaintiff’s favor must be drawn by the court: Miller v. Bealer, <a href="/pa/100/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="100 Pa. 583" data-case-ids="498429" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0583-01">100 Pa. 583</a>; Hill v.

Again; what constitutes negligence in a given case, is generally a question for the jury. When the facts are admitted, or so clearly and conclusively proved as to admit of no reasonable doubt, it is the duty of the court to declare the law applicable to them; but, when material facts are disputed, or even in doubt, or inferences of fact are to be drawn from the testimony, it is the exclusive province of the jury to determine what the facts are, and apply them to the law as declared by the court. The line of demarcation, in that respect, between the duty of the court and that of the jury, should be carefully guarded. While, on the one hand, the court should never permit the jury to disregard or evade its instructions as to matters of law, it should be equally careful not to invade the province of the jury, and take upon itself the determination of facts about which there may be <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>any question: Penna.
