The act of April 2, 1872, P. L. 743, annexed said borough and certain other districts to the city of Pittsburgh and made them part thereof, extending to the districts so annexed the provisions of the act of May 10,1871, P. L. 718, relative to the payment of the indebtedness of municipalities admitted into said city. In pursuance of this legislation, the city, by ordinance of councils, assumed the municipal debt and liabilities of each of the boroughs embraced in said consolidation act of 1872. By § 13, act of March 20,1873, P. L. 325, it was provided that any contracts which had been entered into by any of the boroughs mentioned in said act of 1872, should be carried out by the city of Pittsburgh, and the cost of the improvements assessed and collected by and in the name of the city, in the manner prescribed in the laws for street improvements in the said respective boroughs.</p>

Thereupon the city of Pittsburgh issued in pursuance of this ordinance, under its corporate seal, seventy bonds aggregating $58,189.10, all payable in ten annual instalments, without interest, the date of payment in each year being the first day of October. Among these was the bond in suit which was issued to Woods &amp; Brown for $2,137.92, on October 1, 1873.

    <p class="summary" id="b331-9" data-blocks='[["BL_331.8",331,[149,1587,1177,856]]]'>The plaintiff claims that these obligations bear interest from their maturity, whether they were presented or not, and whether or not the city had money provided for payment; that it was their duty to seek the creditor and pay, and if they did not do so, the obligation bore interest. That was his theory of the case. On the other hand, counsel for defendant claim that they were not liable for interest, in any event, until presentation and refusal. Now these are the two propositions of law. I think they are both wrong, and I will so instruct you when I come to the!1 points. I may say here that the city is not liable for the payment of interest on these obligations before maturity, because the bond itself provides it shall be without interest. After maturity, the liability for interest depends upon two facts; first, a presentation and refusal; or, in the absence of that, it appearing in evidence (the burden being on the plaintiff), that they had not money sufficient to pay these bonds.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.3",332,[269,344,1180,816]]]'>
      <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>In the first place, there is no dispute between the parties as to the validity of this bond. It was issued by the city of Pittsburgh, admittedly under proper authority, and was a valid and binding obligation of the city of Pittsburgh. Under the act of assembly under which it was issued it was to be without interest up until the maturity of each instalment. I further say to you that after maturity these obligations would bear interest as each instalment fell due, if not paid. But it would not bear interest if the city of Pittsburgh had provided the means for payment, unless it was presented and payment refused. It is not alleged that it was presented until 1887 or 1888, and therefore the question, and the only question of fact in the case, is whether or not the city had-made provision for the payment of these bonds and had money in the treasury, and would have paid them, was ready to pay them if presented. That is the only question for you to determine.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[271,1169,1180,1220]],["BL_333.1",333,[176,358,1173,562]]]'>The evidence is, as I have said, that the two issues of these bonds amounted to $58,000; that the levy of taxes and the appropriation for their payment amounted in no year to $58,000. Therefore, prima facie, the city did not provide for the payment of all these bonds, and they were bound to provide for all of them. You may presume that if they made no provision for the payment of the whole of the bonds, that this one would not have been paid if it was presented; and therefore the city would be liable to pay interest on these‘bonds, if that is the fact. And there is no evidence of any provision having been made up to a certain period except this appropriation. The city would be liable to pay interest upon those several instalments as they came due, from the time they were due until provision had been made for their payment. If this was a single obligation and payable all at one time, and provision was not made for it at the time it fell due, then in order to relieve themselves of interest they would have to notify the party when they were ready to pay.....' But these bdnds were not payable all at one time; they were payable in instalments; and the final payment on the hond became due on October 1, 1888. Now, prior to 1880, as I say, the testimony would indicate that they were not prepared to pay these bonds..... [But if the city, before the final maturity of these bonds, had the money, then it was the duty of the plaintiff to present the <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>bond for payment. They were presentable every year; an instalment came due every year, and because one instalment was not paid, that would not excuse them for not making a demand for a second instalment. Therefore, up until the maturity of the bond, it was the duty of the holder of it to present it, in order to entitle him to interest. And if, before the final payment became due, the city had provided means for paying it, and had the money in the treasury, and kept it in the treasury all the time, from that time up until the final demand was made, then the interest would stop from the time they were prepared to pay it.] 9</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[177,923,1173,602]]]'>Now, then, I think (but that is a question of fact for you, of course), that prior to 1880 there is not sufficient evidence to justify you in finding that the city was prepared to pay these bonds as they came due. But Mr. Davis says that in 1880 a loan was made of $30,000, and put to the credit of this fund for the purpose of paying these bonds; and from that time on they had sufficient money at all times to pay all these obligations.....[If that is believed, then the city had provided in 1880 for the payment of these bonds, and a party failing to present them, would not be entitled to receive interest from that time on.] 9 He would be entitled to receive interest prior to that date.....</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b333-7" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[178,1542,1172,661]]]'>[Therefore, as I say, the simple question is this: Did the city of Pittsburgh provide the means for the payment of these bonds ? If she did, before the maturity of the bond, that is by the maturity of the last payment, then the interest would stop from that date, and you will fix the time when that provision was made. As I have said before, the evidence does not satisfy me that a provision was made before 1880. It is a question of fact, however, for you, and you will fix the time, and allow interest on the instalment from the time it came due, up until the time that you find that the city had provided for the payment of the bonds. That is all the interest the plaintiff is entitled to in this case, in my judgment. If 1 am wrong, I have put it on record plainly, so that it may be corrected.] 10</p>

Having the power to make their obligations payable where they please, it must be presumed, when they have not fixed a place of payment, that the omission is intentional and that they chose to make the debt payable to the creditor wherever he might be when it came due. In issuing bonds a municipal corporation is not exercising governmental powers, but its ordinary corporate powers, common to all corporations: Commonwealth v.

Even if the bond was payable at the city treasury, the court committed error in charging that interest on the instalments on which the city was in default would stop when it provided funds to meet them, if that was done before the last instalment matured, and that it was the duty of the holder to present it every year to entitle him to interest. Each instalment was a separate debt upon which an action would lie as it came due: Bush v.

As I have said before, the evidence does not satisfy me that a provision was made before 1880. It is a question of fact, however, for you, and you will fix the time, and allow interest on the instalment from the time it came due, up until the time that you find that the city had provided for the payment of the bonds. That is all the interest the plaintiff is entitled to, in my judgment.” This and other instructions of like tenor were assigned for error here.</p>

If this contention is well founded, the effect of it will be to work a revolution in the mode of transacting business with such municipalities. Singularly enough, the precise point does not appear to have been decided in this state; yet there are plenty of dicta scattered through our books, which plainly show the bent of the judicial mind. In the case of Luzerne Co. v. Day, <a href="/pa/23/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="23 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="973990" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0141-01">23 Pa. 141</a>, it was said by this court: “ When a legal claim is presented for payment, it is the duty of the commissioners to draw- their warrant for its payment. If this is refused, or if the order is not paid when demanded, a suit will lie against the county; but, until demand is made, neither the commissioners nor the county are in default, and without it a suit cannot be main<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>tained.” And in Allison v. Juniata Co., <a href="/pa/50/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="50 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="425136" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0351-01">50 Pa. 351</a>, it was beld that the holder of a county warrant or order cannot recover interest, even after demand and non-payment for want of funds.</p>
    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[226,501,1169,1119]]]'>It is true these cases were put partly upon the ground that such orders are neither bills, notes, checks, nor contracts, nor even a satisfaction of the original indebtedness. Had the action been upon such original indebtedness, as was said in Dyer v. Covington Tp., <a href="/pa/19/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="19 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="970693" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0200-01">19 Pa. 200</a>, the court could decide whether it was a case for the allowance of interest or not. In Emlen v. Navigation Co., <a href="/pa/47/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="47 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="485584" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0076-01">47 Pa. 76</a>, it was said by Justice Read, in discussing the general rule upon the allowance of interest: “ There are, however, exceptions to the general rule, as in the case of banks, who are the debtors of their depositors, and of trustees who have not failed in the discharge of their trusts. And we must undoubtedly add the cases in which the United States and the several states have been prepared to pay their loan-holders when their loans fell due, of which it is their practice to notify their creditors beforehand..... The result is that these debts are payable at a fixed period,.....at which time and place the loanh older is to present his evidence of debt and receive payment. Whether he does or not, interest stops from that moment.”- The point decided in that case was that the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Co. was not bound to seek its creditor in a foreign country, and make a tender, in order to stop interest.</p>

Reynolds, <a href="/ill/81/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="81 Ill. 529" data-case-ids="2671660" data-case-paths="/ill/81/0529-01">81 Ill. 529</a>; People v.

Dunlevy, <a href="/ill/91/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="91 Ill. 49" data-case-ids="2752515" data-case-paths="/ill/91/0049-01">91 Ill. 49</a>. It must be conceded that this is the rule applicable to the United States and to the several states. And the rule does not depend upon the fact alone that in such instances no suit would lie. It rests upon the broader ground of public policy and public convenience, and the further reason that, as to all municipal organizations or governments, the municipal treasury is the recognized place where all claims against it shall be paid. This rule has been recognized by common consent, by every person, and in every place. The reason of it applies with equal force to a city as to a state. The only <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>difference between them is that one can be sued; tbe other cannot. It would entail intolerable inconvenience if the rule were otherwise. The bonds of some municipal corporations are largely held in every state in the' Union, and in nearly every nation abroad. It is impossible, in many instances, for such corporations to know their creditors, or where they reside. To hold that they must find them and tender the amount of their debt, before interest could be stopped, would entail endless confusion, and do no practical good. Their obligations are as much payable at their treasury as if so “ nominated in the bond,” and it is so understood by all who deal with them.</p>
