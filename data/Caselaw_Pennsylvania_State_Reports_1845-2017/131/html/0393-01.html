The association admit that they bought a lot of which Robert McGrew died seised, and went into possession in 1869. It is admitted that Robert McGrew, deceased, had been dead twenty-six or twenty-seven years when the lot was sold. It is admitted that $500 was to be paid for the lot. Under the will of Robert McGrew, deceased, the lot before sold belonged to Maria McGrew as life-tenant and the plaintiffs as remaindermen, with a power in the executors to sell if they thought it most advantageous. It is admitted that the $500 was not paid at the time of sale. The plaintiffs say that under the will they were entitled to the lot, or the purchase money for which it was sold, at the death of Maria McGréw, and [the mortgage was admitted in evidence to show that the association recognized the justice and legality of this claim, and that at the time the sale was made they agreed to hold the $500 for them and pay it to them one year after Mrs. McGrew’s death. Taking then into consideration the admitted facts, that Maria McGrew had only a life-interest in the lot, and the plaintiffs had an interest in it as remaindermen when it was sold, and that the widow could have no greater interest in the proceeds of sale of the lot than she could have in the lot itself, and the further fact that the association executed an instrument of writing at the time of sale purporting to be a mortgage on the property conveyed and given to secure the purchase money, and that in that paper it is provided that the $500 shall be paid to the children of Robert McGrew, deceased, named in his will, of whom the plaintiffs are the survivors, and that only the interest was to be paid to Mrs. McGrew, and the fact that the sale was made twenty-seven years after the testator’s death and therefore presumably not for the purpose of paying any of the debts of the testator, and the fact that for twelve years after the conveyance was made to the association, its treasurer paid Mrs. McGrew interest on the $500, and that one of the plaintiffs made claim to the treasurer of the association to the $500 before it was paid to Mrs. McGrew in 1881, we are of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the amount of their claim, and that the payment of the $500 to Mrs. Maria McGrew, on December 17,1881, did not discharge the liability of the defendant association for the $500 purchase money for the lot conveyed to them by Maria McGrew and Minas Tindle <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>on April 7, 1869; and therefore your verdict, gentlemen of the jury, will be in favor of the plaintiffs for $500, with interest from September 2, 1884, the date at which it is admitted Mrs. McGrew died.] 4</p>

    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[184,398,1165,1259]]]'>In April, 1869, the executors of Robert McGrew sold a narrow lot of land in Monongahela City to the Nucleus Association for $500. They had ample power, under the will of their testator, to negotiate the sale, execute and deliver a deed, and receive and receipt for the purchase money. Instead of receiving the money and investing it, they took from the association what were called a bond and mortgage, providing for the payment of interest annually to the widow, Maria McGrew, who was one of the executors, so long as she should live, and for the payment of the principal, within one year after her death, to the heirs at law of Robert McGrew. The association paid the interest up to 1881, when the widow, then the surviving executrix of Robert McGrew, demanded the payment of the principal sum. She produced the. mortgage, without the bond. This had not been recorded, and its existence seems to have been unknown to the association. Upon its production the association had to determine its liability upon it, and, after taking advice, concluded that it was liable to the executors from whom they bought, but that the mortgage was not binding upon the association. They accordingly paid the principal to the surviving executrix, by whom the mortgage was satisfied and surrendered to the association. Maria McGrew died in 1884, and in 1887 this action was brought by the heirs at law of Robert McGrew to recover the $500 so paid to the surviving executrix.</p>

The charter provided that the property of the association should be purchased, held, managed, and sold by a board of five trustees. The mortgage was executed by the president and secretary, and not the trustees. It was not sealed with the corporate seal; and there was no resolution authorizing, ratifying, or in any manner recognizing, the making of this mortgage, to be found on the books of the association. It would seem quite clear, therefore, and the learned judge of the court below was of that opinion, that the paper called a mortgage was not the act and deed of the corporation, or binding upon it as such. If this be so, the association was liable to the executors, from whom it purchased. The attempt to secure the purchase money in a <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>given way having failed, the executors had the right to require its payment to them.
