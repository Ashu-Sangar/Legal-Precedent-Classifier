Nor does the assumption of an agreement to pay the old debt by the remaining or incoming partner, and giving indemnity therefor, preserve the lien.

Here such facts do not exist; on the contrary, the various creditors, not having given their consent to the transfer, had brought suit and recovered their debts from the former partners, and even as to the exclusive liability of the remaining members of the new firm for these debts, the facts are not entirely clear.</p>

However, some force should be given to the further provision in the articles of association, article 27: “ All stockholders are hereby individually hound to make good to all depositors the amount of their deposits.” This was an agreement more between the stockholders themselves than between the stockholders and the depositors. As to tbe latter, this provision was unnecessary; the law protected them. But as between the stockholders, it would seem that by the mere withdrawal of a solvent stockholder and the substitution, as may be the case, of an insolvent transferee without consent of all the other stockholders, this nidi vidual liability cannot be shaken off. It may be doubtful <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>whether even the consent of the directors, in the absence of express authority, could release such withdrawing stockholder from this liability, and this especially if the bank was insolvent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[245,490,1176,863]]]'>The transfer of stock seems to have been loosely conducted by the bank, and the testimony on this point is very unsatisfactory. That the transferer should not be indebted to the bank seems to have been the only care of the directors, and no attention was apparently paid to the fact whether the bank was solvent or insolvent when stock was transferred. An affirmative fact not proved is taken as not to exist: York County Bank’s App., supra. Hence, whether the bank was insolvent before September 11,1875, must be taken in the negative. But on said date the bank was found to be, and until its suspension remained, insolvent, and some of the outgoing partners, who now desire repayment for debts of the bank paid by them, withdrew after said date. Out of twenty-five, five belong to this class, whose joint contribution was $4,650 to the fund out of which these debts were paid. The interests, however, of all these parties are so intricately combined, that no severance of their rights can now be attempted.</p>

Because the claims 6 and 7 are, with one exception (the city of Pittsburgh claim), in judgment, and as such have been offered in proof against the fund, does not lend any strength to their claim to share in its distribution. The judgments are no liens upon the fund. They were not liens upon the land which produced the fund, nor were the defendants in those judgments owners of the land. The judgments merely serve the purpose of proving the exact amount the claimants were forced to pay as former partners of the - bank, and for which payments they want to be reimbursed.</p>

The payment of these claims constituted those paying them sureties, and as such they had rights for repayment against the remaining partners: Shamburg v. Abbott, <a href="/pa/112/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="112 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="546720" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0006-01">112 Pa. 6</a>. That case, based upon facts similar to the present, points out that such sureties may enforce their rights either by an independent action or by way of subrogation. The subrogation, by reason of the assignment to G. W. Guthrie, trustee, can only be of effect against the co-defendants in each judgment whose names are specifically given in the findings of the facts in each claim. These defendants are not the members of whom <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>the last firm or partnership was composed. And subrogation cannot be had against parties not defendants of record and who had no day in court. The other remedjq action of indebitatus assumpsit, was not brought, and this seems to the auditor the only remedy the sureties had. In Bullitt v. M. E. Church, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Pa.%20110" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="26 Pa. 110">26 Pa. 110</a>, it was held that the outgoing partner had a right to demand of the remaining partner the payment of the partnership debts, but that a suit on the contract was the only means of enforcing that obligation. But now, more than six years have elapsed since they became sureties, and their rights are barred by the statute of limitations. It follows, then, that these parties have neither a lien upon the fund, nor rights against the owners of the fund.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[205,1017,1168,658]]]'>5. The cases referred to in support of claims 6 and 7 are : Worrall’s App., <a href="/pa/41/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="41 Pa. 524" data-case-ids="480009" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0524-01">41 Pa. 524</a>; Datesman’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=77%20Pa.%20248" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="77 Pa. 248">77 Pa. 248</a>, and Schlaudecker’s App., 22 W. N. 37. The first two cases treat of rights as between lien creditors, and have therefore no application to the present contention, in which the parties have no lien whatever upon the fund. Schlaudecker’s Appeal is of still more remote application.

The capital was fixed at <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>$800,000, and divided into shares of $100 each. A purchaser of one or more of these shares became a member of the partnership, and was called a stockholder. The management of the bank was committed to a board of directors, a president, vice-president, and a treasurer or cashier. It was stipulated in the partnership articles that if any stockholder desired to sell his stock, he must first offer it to the board of directors at a stated price, and, if it was not taken by the board, he was at liberty to dispose of it to whom he pleased. By another provision in these articles, all stockholders were “individually bound to make good to all depositors the amount of their deposits.” When a member sold his stock, it was transferred to his vendee on a book called the “ Stock Ledger,” but the business-was conducted' as before. By this transfer the purchaser acquired the rights and incurred the liabilities of a partner. These, as affected by the partnership articles, will be presently considered. In August, 1878, the bank, being unable to meet its engagements, closed its doors ; and subsequently a bill was filed by one of the partners for a dissolution, an account, and a receiver. The parties to this bill were stockholders when the bank ceased to transact business. A receiver was appointed, and he now has in his hands a fund produced by a sale of the partnership property. The appellant contends that the claims he holds as trustee are-entitled to participate in this fund. It is admitted that these claims, with one exception, represent debts of the partnership as it existed prior to August 25, 1876, when the last transfer of stock was made. The members of the partnership who retired from it on or before that day concede their liability for debts contracted while they were stockholders, but allege that, as between them and the partnership which continued the business, they are sureties. The appellant is their trustee. He bought these claims at their request, and with their money. As their representative, he is on no higher ground than the creditors from whom he purchased. •</p>

In explanation .and vindication of this refusal, he said: “ The fund belongs exclusively to the parties to the present bill in equity, they being <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>the membership of the bank at its suspension. The bank, being but a partnership, changed upon each transfer of stock from an old to a new copartnership, and with such change of the rights of the various members, also the rights of creditors changed. Although, in appearance, the bank remained in all respects the same, yet in law their claims against the old firm .could not have been collected from the new. The incoming partner was as little bound for the payment of the old debt as the old creditors were bound to look to him for payment. Each successive firm was liable for the payment of its own debts, and the assets of each firm, while kept intact, belonged first to the creditors of such firm ; but, when these assets became the property of a succeeding firm, <em>its </em>creditors had the sole right thereto, and the old creditors had to look to the individuals who composed the old firm for payment.” In support of these conclusions, he cited and relied on Doner v.

He claims that under these partnership articles, and in view of the manner in which the business of the bank was conducted and its accounts were kept, the retirement of an old stockholder and the introduction of a new one did not work a dissolution of the company, but that it remained, and the incoming partner became liable for all its debts.</p>

He may become liable for them by his contract with the retiring partner, but the party who alleges such liability must prove the agreement which created it: Kountz v. Holthouse, <a href="/pa/85/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="85 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="440464" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0235-01">85 Pa. 235</a>. The purchase of stock in an unincorporated bank, and a continuance of the business, without any separation of past from future effects and liabilities or discrimination between past and future profits, will not render the purchaser liable for the antecedent debts of the bank. The payment by the bank, after he became a member of it, of interest on such debts, is insufficient to <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>charge him with an assumption of them: Shamburg v. Ruggies, <a href="/pa/83/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="83 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1050826" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0148-01">83 Pa. 148</a>. In such a bank the stockholders have the rights and responsibilities of, and in their relation to the public and each other are general partners: Shamburg v. Abbott, <a href="/pa/112/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="112 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="546720" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0006-01">112 Pa. 6</a>. If, therefore, the principles which govern ordinary partnerships do not apply in the present case, it is because of some provisions in the partnership articles which change the rights and liabilities of the partners, and deprive the retirement of an old partner, and the introduction of a new one, of the usual effect of such action. These articles allow a stockholder to sell his stock, if he is not indebted to the bank on indorsements or otherwise; require that the transfer of it shall be made on the books of the company, and that he shall first offer it to the board of directors, at a stated price. Article 27 is in the words following: “ All stockholders are hereby individually bound to make good to all depositors the amount of their deposits.” In this article, and the regulations and conditions affecting the sale of stock, the appellant claims there is an undertaking by the firm and incoming partners to pay the prior indebtedness of the firm, and to exonerate the retiring partners from it.</p>
    <p id="b528-4" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[239,1377,1171,551]]]'>We are unable to discover in the restrictions on the sale of stock any engagement by the incoming partner to become liable for the antecedent debts of the firm, and we cannot construe article 27 as imposing on him such a liability. If it had been the purpose of the partnership to attach such a result to a change of membership, it should have been clearly expressed. We think article 27 refers to deposits made with the firm of which the stockholder is a member, and that it has no application to deposits made with a preceding or subsequent firm. Thus read and understood, it is intelligible and in accord with well-established principles.</p>

They further averred that, by reason of the default of the defendants, they had been compelled to pay claims for deposits made while they were partners, and for deposits subsequently made by old customers who had not been notified of the sale of their interests. They prayed for an account, and a decree that the defendants reimburse them for the payments so made. Their bill was dismissed on the ground that their appropriate remedy was an action at law, on the agreement set forth in it. In delivering the opinion of this court, Mr. Justice Paxson said: “ The only question here is one of jurisdiction.....We have merely the case of a partner who has sold his interest in the firm, with an agreement that he shall be exonerated from all the firm debts, present and future, who has been compelled to pay certain debts of the firm, and who files a bill claiming to be reimbursed for such payment.” The appellant draws from this language, which is merely descriptive of the case presented in the plaintiffs’ bill, the erroneous inference that the partnership articles were construed by this court in accordance with his present contention. The only question raised and considered was, not whether the claim of the plaintiffs was correctly stated in their bill, but whether a court of equity had jurisdiction of it. Mr. Justice Stebrett’s reference in Shamburg v. Abbott, <a href="/pa/112/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="112 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="546720" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0006-01">112 Pa. 6</a>, to the partnership articles in Clarke’s Appeal, is not descriptive of an adjudication which interpreted those articles, but of the claim on which the question of jurisdiction was decided.</p>

The amount of this claim is $41,530.16. The city brought suit upon it in 1878, and included as defendants therein all who, at any time, held stock in the bank. This suit by agreement of the parties was sent to a referee, before whom it was pending at the time of the audit. The parties now represented hy the appellant bought the claim for $17,092.63. It is contended that the monthly balances in the account between the city and the bank, from June 1, 1876, to December 31, 1877, show that the claim is for deposits made by the city after August 25, 1876. The balance on the 1st of August, 1876, was $45,534.24, and on the 1st of September following, $204,196.72. It is not alleged that the September balance represented deposits made after August 25th, or that the August balance was paid before that day. It is a fair inference from these balances that the amount due the city on the day the last transfer of stock was made, was greater than the amount due on the 31st of December, 1877. ' The former was a debt of the old partnership, and it may well be doubted whether the old partners, who were bound for it, can successfully claim that the latter, which is the final balance in an account which was continuous from June 1, 1876, to December 31, 1877, is a liability of the new firm.

It cannot, while the suit is before the referee, pass upon the validity of the claim involved in it, because the parties have cast that duty on a tribunal of their own creation, and what the court may not, in this particular, do- directly, it cannot authorize its auditor to do. We think, therefore, that the auditor was right in refusing to take cognizance of this claim, and, as he was not asked to set aside any portion of the fund to await the decision of the referee, we need not consider his duty in such case.</p>
