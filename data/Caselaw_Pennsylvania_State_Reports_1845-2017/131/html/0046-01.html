The plaintiff, who was a widow and about sixty-four years of age, occupied the other end of the house as his tenant. The defendant’s wife died on June 15th, of that year. During her sickness the plaintiff assisted in waiting on her, and a door, which communicated between the plaintiff’s and defendant’s sides of the house, was kept unlocked, so that the defendant and his wife could get help whenever they wanted it. After Mrs. Dierstein’s death, this door remained unlocked, and the defendant frequently passed through it into the plaintiff's apartments, and paid friendly visits to her. Testimony for the plaintiff tended to show that on July 1,1887, the defendant commenced a courtship which culminated on July 15th in a contract between the plaintiff and defendant to marry. The plaintiff in her testimony stated that no time was fixed for the marriage ceremony ; that the defendant did not refuse to marry her, but simply locked the door communicating between their apartments, quit coming to see her and ceased to talk with her or have anything to do with her. She testified further on cross-examination, as follows:</p>

He began his attentions about <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>the first of July, coming to see her then frequently, and these attentions were continued for fifteen days; he then became engaged, according to her statement, on the fifteenth of July; the attentions and demonstrations continued for fifteen days longer, and then came to an end. The wife of the defendant had died on the fifteenth of the preceding month, June, so that it was very prompt work. People may make up their min ds rapidly, or take a longer time in such affairs; so that these things are only elements that enter into the case for your consideration in the determination of what was really done. The plaintiff says that on the fifteenth of July, 1887, Mr. Dierstein said he would marry her, promised to do it, and she said she was willing. That makes a contract; a proposition on one side and an acceptance on the other* and the law says that if such a contract is not kept, then comes in the question of damages. You have the affirmation of this contract on the one side and the denial of it on the other.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b74-5" data-blocks='[["BL_74.4",74,[257,1234,1180,1069]]]'>Now as to the defence: The defendant says he did not make any contract; that their relationship was only friendly; they were in the same house, and families often live in the same houses and under the same roof in different apartments, and that was their case, and that his wife had been sick; the plaintiff was his neighbor and that she had been kind to his wifethat the door between their apartments had been left open. With an unlocked door between families in the same house and sickness going on, it is not astonishing that that should be the case, and that there was this intimacy. You can account for this friendly intercourse on the part of the defendant.....After all I do not consider that it is a breach of promise of a very serious character. It was all done in a very short time. It was not a long courtship and a disappointment of a life that may occur where engagements are long postponed and then broken. If he made an engagement, he broke it promptly, but you could not find any damages against him if there was no contract. It must be- found to have been absolutely made between the parties, with the understanding that there was an engagement of marriage. If you find that to be the fact then comes the question of damages.</p>

[If he has money, and he has undertaken to get rid of it to avoid responsibility, then you ought not to allow that; you ought to let the lawyers hunt it up, if it is concealed in that way, and whether or not the defendant is old, he has taken upon himself that he has the capacity to perform the duties of a husband, because he has married since.] 7 Whether that was done for the purpose of getting a home on his part or not, is a matter for your consideration. I think all these cases can be trusted to twelve intelligent and capable men, under the evidence, to do what is right and proper in the matter.</p>

Ferring testified that he acted as the plaintiff’s attorney and counsel, and, taking the record as we find it, any communications made to him were privileged.

    <p id="b77-7" data-blocks='[["BL_77.7",77,[182,1332,1171,505]]]'>This suit was brought on September 2, 1887, and the plaintiff was then sixty-four and the defendant sixty-eight years old. She became a widow in 1885, and he a widower on June 15, 1887. According to her claim, he commenced courting her on the 1st of July, and on the 15th of that month promised to marry her. While the courtship, as described by her and her witnesses, was brief, it was unremitting and ardent; and in consequence of it the aged suitor became a defendant in a prosecution for the crime of fornication and in an action for breach of promise of marriage.</p>

The question is upon the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s narr. If that be sound, the plaintiff is, in general, entitled to judgment on his verdict: ” Aronson v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/70/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="70 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="1028220" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0068-01">70 Pa. 68</a>. “It is error to nonsuit a plaintiff who has presented a case sufficient to go to the jury, but it is not error to refuse a nonsuit; for, when the defendant has given his evidence, he has it still in his power to ask the court to instruct the jury <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>upon the insufficiency of the plaintiff’s evidence to maintain the action: ” Lehman v. Kellerman, <a href="/pa/65/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="65 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="430643" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0489-01">65 Pa. 489</a>.</p>
    <p id="b78-5" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[256,459,1175,134]]]'>The excerpts from the charge which constitute the sixth and seventh specifications are, when read in place, unobjectionable and free from error.</p>
    <p id="b78-6" data-blocks='[["BL_78.5",78,[254,612,1178,453]]]'>The offers to prove that this cause of action was included in a settlement by the parties of two cases before Alderman Stork were material, and should have been allowed. In one of these cases it was claimed by the plaintiff that the defendant had carnal knowledge of her on the 15th of July. It related to an act committed on the day it is alleged the promise of marriage was made. The propriety of joining in one settlement two causes of action of this nature, arising between the same parties on the same day, cannot be doubted.</p>
    <p id="b78-7" data-blocks='[["BL_78.6",78,[251,1073,1177,1219]]]'>Ferring and Stork were competent to testify to the terms of the settlement, and what was included in it. It was made in their presence, and they assisted in making it. It is difficult to see' what there was in the nature of a confidential communication about it. Ferring was a law student, employed by the plaintiff to advise and assist her in her suits against the defendant. But her communications to him while so employed are not privileged. A law student is, in this respect, on no higher plane than a blacksmith retained in a like service. In Barnes v. Harris, <a href="/mass/61/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="7 Cush. 576" data-case-ids="1967621" data-case-paths="/mass/61/0576-01">7 Cush. 576</a>, it was held that communications made while seeking legal advice in a consultation with a student at law in an attorney’s office, he not being the agent or clerk of the attorney for any purpose, are not protected. In 1 Greenl. Ev., note to § 239, the rule on this subject is stated thus: “ It seems indispensable to the existence of the privilege that the relation of counsel or attorney and client should exist, and that the communication be made in faith of the relation; and then the privilege of secrecy only extends to the parties to the relation, and their necessary agents and assistants. Hence the privilege does not attach if one is accidentally present, . . . or casually overhears the conversation, .... or if the person be not a member of the profession, although supposed to be so by the client; .... or if he was a mere scrivener, although of the legal profession.”</p>
