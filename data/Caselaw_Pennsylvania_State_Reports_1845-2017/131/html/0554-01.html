There were 4 pipe broken in course of delivery, not handling, which were valueless to us. We are also experiencing a great deal of difficulty in obtaining our money from the city, owing to the fact that 4 of the pipe in position have broken.

What was the contract ? This is the first question for you to take up, and is the first question for you to settle. You have nothing to do with any question of damages, until you have settled this question as to what the contract was. If you shall, upon an honest consideration of the testimony come to the conclusion that the contract was what the plaintiffs claim it to be, that it was a contract which bound them to deliver by water as long as it was practicable, as long as navigation was open, and that then they had the right to deliver by rail, and that they discharged their duty under such a contract, then that is an end of the case and your verdict should be for the plaintiffs for the full amount of their claim. [If on the other hand their contract was to deliver by water and water only, and then by their own fault, not by reason of something which they could not control, something which was impossible in its nature, failed to deliver in that way, and thereby the defendants suffered loss, then the defendants would have a right of set-off against the plaintiffs’ claim,] a for the amount of such loss which they suffered, for that loss or that damage which was naturally to be anticipated under the circumstances.</p>

That was a\proposition .on their part to furnish certain pipe, either delivered by rail or delivered by water as long as navigation was open, then after-wards by rail. It appears therefore that that thought or question of the possibility of water delivery was in the minds of the parties at the very inception of this transaction; and I mayday, here, that there is no question but that it was considered fiipm the outset between the parties as a matter of advantage to the defendants that the delivery should be by water.

They said that they wanted the delivery by water. Then Mr. Murphy testified that he said to them, we cannot agree to deliver by water; we cannot bind ourselves to deliver by water, because sometimes the river Schuylkill is closed by ice very early, — I think he put it as early as the first of November, — and we have got to make our preparations to cast these pipes; therefore we cannot safely or with propriety enter into a bargain of that kind; we will deliver by water just as long as navigation is open and afterwards by rail.

The plaintiffs, under their own version of the contract, were undoubtedly bound, not oidy to deliver by water, so long as nav7 igation should remain open, but to make reasonable speed with the deliveries. They were aware of the fact that the defendants had a contract with the city and of the fact that prompt deliveries of the pipe were needed; and Mr. Murphy said that they bound themselves to get to work, and to work promptly and industriously for the purpose of delivering them. If there was any needless, unnecessary or unreasonable delay on their part, whereby they were prevented from delivering these pipes by water, during the season before navigation closed, then they were guilty undoubtedly of a breach of the contract, for which the defendants could hold them responsible, to the extent that they suffered loss in consequence. These parties seem to have understood, and from the evidence found, about which there is no dispute, it seems to have been necessary for the plaintiffs to get in readiness to make this pipe, because the pipe was of a special size. They had to make their preparations to construct them, to get their patterns ready, and do everything necessary in order that the pipe might be made. Now they say they went to work with reasonable speed. That is what they claim. They say that they did cast the pipe, according to the model or specifications given to them by the city official, and cast about fifty of them, when they found, as Mr. Graham said substantially, that it was practically impossible to make them acccording to the model, that the head was too large for the body of the pipe, which in cooling would cool more quickly than the thicker heads, thereby making cracks, so that the pipes would not be serviceable, and that, therefore, they had to have new specifications. They also say that there was another ground of delay, arising from difficulties which occurred at the place where the pipe was laid, difficulties which, as described by one of the witnesses, occasioned the calling in of policemen to prevent interference of the prosecution of the <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>work. They claim that delayed them some time. [Of course if the delay was owing to circumstances beyond their control, which arose out of the nature of the case, by the pipes as originally provided for by the city officers being such that they could not construct, or that it was impossible for them to construct, and if there were other delays, such as have been referred to, arising in the prosecution of the work, so that the defendants were not ready to receive the pipes, then to that extent the plaintiffs would be excused for non-delivery of the pipes, just as long as those causes operated.] 3</p>

The defendants’ counsel succeeded in satisfying the court that the letter directing the plaintiffs to ship by the Reading railroad was to be treated as the action of a purchaser, who, through breach of contract on the seller’s part, found himself in a position where the only thing he could do was to accept pro tanto a partial performance of the contract. But such is not its nature. If the plaintiffs were bound to deliver on the canal bank, there was nothing in the fact that navigation had closed to prevent their doing so. The letter was a clear case of a voluntary substitution of one place of delivery for another. The plaintiffs were therefore entitled to have the entire counter claim of the defendants excluded from the consideration of the jury, and hence if there were any technical errors in any portion of the charge, such errors did the defendants no harm.</p>

It is entirely unnecessary to discuss abstractly the law as to what degree of impossibility will relieve a contracting party from performance of a contract he has made. The portions of the charge assigned for error did not relate to the question of excusing the plaintiffs from performance of any definite contract by reason of delays caused through imperfect specifications, but related to the question whether in the performance of their con<a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>tract, as they claimed it to be, they had exercised due diligence in view of the circumstances. The court ruled that even on the plaintiffs’ version of the contract, the claim of the defendants for damages might be maintained, if there was unreasonable delay on the part of thé plaintiffs. The plaintiffs therefore had the right to explain the cause of the unexpected delay by the evidence as to defects in the specifications, and it was proper to charge the jury that delay thus caused did not import a want of diligence on the part of the plaintiffs.</p>

The basis of the contract was the written offer of the plaintiffs under date of October 20th, and that proposed to deliver the pipe “ free on board Pennsylvania Railroad cars, at Manayunk, or free on board boat on canal, at Manayunk, in the event of navigation being open at time of shipment.” An acceptance of this offer, and an election to receive the pipe by water, would have created such a contract as the plaintiffs understood they had with the defendants. The delivery of the pipe was in conformity with the written offer, except that, at the request of the defendants, transportation by the Reading railroad was substituted for transportation by the Pennsylvania railroad. The specifications for the pipe were furnished by the city engineer, and, as it was of unusual size, it was known that considerable time would necessarily be consumed in the preparation of the flasks and fixtures required for its manufacture. It was known, also, that navigation in the Schuylkill river was sometimes closed by the 1st of November, and for this reason the plaintiff’s offer to deliver the pipe by water was upon the condition that navigation was open at the time of shipment. During the months of December, January, and February the defendants made no complaint of delays in the delivery of the pipe. They accepted it by rail, without an intimation to plaintiffs that they were entitled to a water delivery, or that the contract had been broken. When the plaintiffs’ bill for the price of the pipe was rendered, they promised to pay it, without suggestion of any claim for damages arising from a breach of contract. The senior member of <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>the defendant firm admits that he understood the contract to be as claimed by the plaintiffs. He says: “ I never saw any contract, except the alternative one by water or rail. I knew I had a contract. I knew it was an alternative contract.” He says, further, that neither his partner nor his father suggested to him that the delivery of the pipe was not according to the contract, until nearly three months after it w'as completed; and yet he was actively engaged in the superintendence of the work and in the removal of the pipe from the railroad cars to the canal, where it was used in the construction of the sewer. This brief recital of facts, which are either admitted or undisputed, presents some of the salient features of the case, and some of the obstacles opposed to the defendants’ claim that the contract was for the delivery of the pipe upon the canal bank, at Manayunk, before the close of navigation for the year 1885.</p>
    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[212,1130,1161,602]]]'>The first specification of error is without merit. The letter of November 12th was no part of the contract between the parties. It was written in response to a request of the defendants to know what progress was being made in the manufacture of the pipe, and when deliveries of it might be looked for. It was based on information received by the plaintiffs from the men in charge of the work at their foundry, and it expressed their expectations in the matter to which it referred. These expectations were disappointed, and delay was occasioned by the discovery of defects in the specifications furnished by the city engineer which made new specifications necessary. It was proper to show this in explanation of the delay.</p>
    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[211,1741,1162,654]]]'>A single sentence from the charge constitutes the second specification of error. While it is possible that a nice criticism might discover technical inaccuracy in it, standing by itself and applied to a contract in which time is made material by the agreement of the parties, when we consider it in connection with the whole charge and the evidence in the case, .we are not convinced that it is substantial or reversible error. If the defendants desired specific instructions on the point which they now seek to raise by this specification, they should have asked for them, and, as they did not, they cannot now successfully complain of an omission to state the nature and cause of the impossibility which will excuse a failure to perform a contract within the time stipulated.</p>

They are founded upon portions of the charge which refer to the delay caused by the defective specifications, and by the failure of the defendants to promptly unload the pipe at Manayunk. These excerpts appear in that part of the charge in which the duty of the plaintiffs, under their own version of the contract, is considered. When read in their proper connection, they are plainly applicable and limited to that contract, and have no reference to a contract for water delivery only. Thus applied, they correctly define the rights and duties of the parties, and are unobjectionable. A careful review of this record has satisfied us that there is no substantial error in it, and therefore</p>
