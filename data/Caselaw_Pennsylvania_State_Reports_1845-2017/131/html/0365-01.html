On October 22, 1887, the return day of said rule, Mrs. Mary Singer filed her petition, setting forth that she was the owner of farm land in Sterrett township, included within the limits of the proposed borough, and that for reasons averred her said land should not of right he included therein; praying that the boundaries of the proposed borough should be modified and changed so as to exclude her land therefrom. A rule was granted on said <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>petition which on December 2, 1887, was discharged, without opinion, and the same day the decree of incorporation was recorded.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b390-7" data-blocks='[["BL_390.6",390,[245,1159,1183,455]]]'>It is clear to my mind that § 1, act of April 1, 1868, P. L. 200, giving the court power to exclude farm lands from the boundaries of boroughs was intended to apply only to cases of pending applications present or future, and not to boroughs actually incorporated. The act of June 11, 1879, P. L. 150, which is a supplement to the act of 1851, gives power to change the limits of any borough incorporated under the act of 1851, and is strong indication of the legislative intent under such act. If this is so, it is now too late to relieve the petitioner.</p>

It is true, the town or village is not deemed an “ incorporated borough ” until the decree of the court is recorded in the recorder’s office; but when it is so recorded it seems to be only “ subject to such modifications as might be thereafter made by the legislature: ” § 3, act of April 1, 1834, P. L. 163. The petition of Mrs. Singer for the exclusion of her lands was filed October 22, 1887, and rule to show cause why it should not be granted allowed the same day, but there was no stay of proceeding and the decree of the court incorporating the borough might properly have been recorded immediately. But this was not done; the rule was discharged by the court on December 2d, and on the same day it was duly recorded. After this was done it was too late for the court to recall its action. The borough was incorporated to all <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>intents and purposes under the law “ subject only to such modifications as might thereafter be made by the legislature,” the only act which bears upon the matter now before us being the act of June 11, 1879, P. L. 150, which requires the concurrence of the grand jury, in changing the limits of a borough. Of course I must be understood as speaking of the case in hand, and not of one where there might be fraud or want of jurisdiction in the court making the decree.</p>
