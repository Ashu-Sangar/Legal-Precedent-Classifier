Upon the question thus raised, the master made the following ruling:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.5",345,[206,1118,1167,594]]]'>The competency of James Marshall, Jr., depends on whethel his interest is adverse to the right of Thompson Bell. The stock in controversy in this case was part of the residuary estate of his father, James Marshall, deceased, and by the will of his father, James Marshall, Jr., was entitled to one fourth of said residuary estate. Therefore, he is undoubtedly interested in the estate of his father, James Marshall, and if that estate wins in this case, the amount to be distributed to his devisees, of whom James Marshall, Jr., is one, will be increased. But that is not the test. It is his relation to the estate of Thompson Bell that settles his competency or incompetency to testify in this case.</p>

In other words, to exclude his testimony his interest must be to see Thompson Bell lose his case. Now if Thompson Bell loses, although the estate of James Marshall is increased thereby, yet James Marshall, Jr., becomes personally liable to Thompson Bell’s estate for the whole of the $20,000 note given in evidence and which is the cause of the controversy in this case. He gave the note and received the money on it and unless Thompson Bell’s estate can hold James Marshall’s estate for the amount of it, his estate can hold James Marshall, Jr., personally. True, if Thompson Bell wins, James Marshall, Jr., becomes personally liable to his father’s estate for <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>a misappropriation of its assets, but he is in the other event liable for the whole of the amount in controversy; and hence his interest cannot be to see Thompson Bell lose; that is, his interest is not adverse to that of Thompson Bell.</p>

Bell alleges that he loaned the money for the purposes of the estate of J ames Marshall, deceased, while the Marshall executors allege -that the money was borrowed for the firm of James Marshall &amp; Co. That all the money borrowed was actually used for the purposes of the firm, is undoubted..... On the question of the knowledge of such use by Thompson Bell at the time the loan was made, the only testimony we have is that of James Marshall, Jr..... From this testimony the master has found as a fact that Thompson Bell, at the time he made the loan of $20,000, and took as security the stock in controversy, knew that the money loaned was to be used for the purposes of the firm of James Marshall &amp; Co. But aside from and outside of the testimony of James Marshall, Jr., if he is not a competent witness in this case, there is ample evidence to show that Thompson Bell knew of the improper use of the proceeds of the $20,000 note. His books produced in evidence, show that the money was by <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>him loaned to James Marshall &amp; Co. .... The testimony of Oliver Wylie is to the effect, that he is familiar with the notes discounted for James Marshall &amp; Co. by Thompson Bell, from 1876 to 1883, and in every case, no matter how the notes were drawn up, if James Marshall &amp; Co. received the money on them, they were indorsed in red ink, “ James Marshall <em>&amp; </em>Co.” The note in suit is so indorsed, and this is persuasive as to the knowledge of Thompson Bell as to the use to be made of the money loaned on this note.....</p>

The evidence of complainant shows only that he loaned to James Marshall, Jr., the $20,000 but shows no use for which it was loaned.

    <p id="b352-11" data-blocks='[["BL_352.10",352,[234,1098,1178,758]]]'>1. Under § 5, act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, James Marshall, Jr., was plainly incompetent to testify. The master and court below seemed to think that if his interest was not adverse to that of Bell, the deceased party to the contract in action, he was competent. But Marshall was the surviving party to the contract, as well as a party upon the record, and the statute is express that such surviving party shall not be competent. It is plain, however, that his interest was adverse to that of the decedent. He was interested as a legatee in the estate of James Marshall, deceased. Whether, as the master suggests, he would become liable to Bell’s estate, if the latter’s claim should be defeated, would depend upon the nature of the testimony of the witness; and the objection to his competency had to be made and decided when he was called, and not in the light of what he might subsequently choose to testify.</p>

Nor was the answer of James Marshall, Jr., available as evidence to establish the defence. The provisions of the act of 1887, disqualifying a surviving party as against the estate of a deceased party to a contract, are applicable as well in equity as at law. Such surviving party cannot be permitted to defeat the case of the deceased party by his own testimony, whether he be called as a witness, or his testimony be offered in the form of an answer. The public policy of the act is applicable in either event. Moreover, the answer of James Marshall, Jr., is not, as respects the vital question in the case, re<a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>sponsive to the bill; it is by way of confession and avoidance and itself needs to be sustained by evidence aliunde: 1 Daniell’s Oh. Pr., 850. Besides, it is manifestly evasive and insufficient, in that it does not aver anything that can be met by evidence; it ought to have averred that Bell was informed what the money was borrowed for, or had notice thereof by reason of certain facts.</p>

Marshall always believed the estate was in the firm, and kept the books of both the estate and the firm on that hypothesis; and if he did tell Bell the money was for the use of the firm, he likewise told him the estate was interested. To whom would Bell go except to the executor for information ? Was he obliged to call in a, lawyer and examine the will and partnership articles to ascertain whether the executor’s construction of them was right ? Either a sale or pledge of the stock by the executor, for money paid to him in good faith, would give Bell a good title : Trolton v.

All the necessary parties were before the court; the executors, James himself, as well in his capacity of executor as legatee, and the complainants, representing a party from whom James had borrowed on the strength of liis pledge of stock. All the debts of the decedent had been long discharged. James, as all admit, would have made a valid sale of this stock. He could have sold and assigned his interest in his father’s estate. The stock pledged by him to Bell was but a small part of his share of that estate, and it was pledged before his insolvency. In any view of the facts and the law, we submit that the court below had power to make a final decree declaring that the plaintiffs had the legal and equitable ownership of this stock.</p>

We submit, however, that he was so subsequently, also, and that his testimony taken before the master was admissible. At the time he testified, he had been dismissed from his position as executor and trustee and was no longer an indispensable party, and, in consequence of the releases given him, his interest was wholly adverse to the estate. Before these releases were given, his interest was in equilibrio, he being liable for illegally using or attempting to use the stock, whichever way the case should go, and he was therefore competent: Gulding v. Gulding, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20Pa.%20414" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="97 Pa. 414">97 Pa. 414</a>. His testimony fully disposes of the plaintiff’s case. The surrounding circumstances also tend to show Bell’s knowledge as to the character of the loan. The position that the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree as to James Marshall, Jr.’s, share of the stock, was advanced and denied in First N. Bank’s App., 19 W. N. 312. The decree here appealed from did the utmost for the plaintiffs that the court could do.</p>

The master finds the pivotal fact in the case as follows: “ From this testimony the master has found as a fact that Thompson Bell, at the time he made the loan of $20,000, and took as security the stock in controversy, knew that the money loaned was to be used for the purposes of James Marshall &amp; Co.” It needs neither argument nor authority to show, that if Mr. Bell knew when he loaned this money that it was for the use of the firm of which James Marshall, Jr., was a member, he had no right to receive and hold the assets of an estate of which the said James Marshall, Jr., was an executor as collateral security for such loan. He knew that it was a misapplication of trust funds ; that it was a pledge of securities belonging to the estate for the personal debt or liability of the executor’s firm.</p>

We are of opinion that under the authority of Duffield v. Hue, decided at the last term, in the western district, and not yet reported [<a href="/pa/129/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="129 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="568084" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0094-01">129 Pa. 94</a>], James Marshall, Jr., was an incompetent witness, under the act of 1887. If this were all, we would be compelled to reverse this case. It is not all, however. In his answer to the bill, James Marshall, Jr., distinctly avers that the money was borrowed for the use of the firm of James Marshall &amp; Co., and that the plaintiff knew such to be the fact. The other executors make substantially the same averment in their answer. If, then, this averment is responsive to the bill, the answer must stand, for the reason that it was not overthrown by plaintiff’s proofs. In such case, it matters not that Marshall was an incompetent witness, and his testimony improperly received. The effect of his answer remains the same, and,. until it is overcome by the quantity of proof essential in such cases by equity practice, the fact must be assumed to be as set forth in the answer. This brings us at once to the question, was the answer responsive ?</p>

On the contrary, it admits the contract as set forth in plaintiff’s bill, and denies a matter outside of the contract itself.

He there adopts the rule laid down by Chief Justice Parker, in Bellows v. Stone, <a href="/nh/48/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="48 N.H. 475" data-case-ids="1050268" data-case-paths="/nh/48/0475-01">48 N. H. 475</a>, as follows: “If the whole subject matter of the statement or allegation in the answer might have been left out, then the allegation in the answer upon that subject is in no sense responsive to the bill; the bill requiring no statement upon that point. But, if the omission of some statement upon that subject would furnish just ground of exception to the answer, then the statement to the extent to which it is required, and whatever its character, whether affirmative or negative, is but a response to the requisition of. the plaintiff.” In Allen v. Mower, <a href="/vt/17/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="17 Vt. 61" data-case-ids="8544302" data-case-paths="/vt/17/0061-01">17 Vt. 61</a>, it was said: “It is readily perceived that everything in the answer responsive to the bill, as to the creation of the original liability charged, must be taken together, <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>as part and parcel of one entire transaction.” In Pusey v.

To avoid this, the defendant should state how it existed, and wherein it had no existence.” This meets the case in hand precisely. The defendants did not deny the contract. They admit having borrowed plaintiff’s money to the amount averred in the bill, but they say it was not borrowed for the use of the Marshall estate, but for the firm of James Marshall &amp; Co., and that the plaintiff knew it.
