The act declared that these streets, lanes and alleys should be common highways forever.

    <p id="b82-10" data-blocks='[["BL_82.9",82,[249,1062,1176,506]]]'>1. The existence of Federal lane as a public highway was sufficiently established, as the court below charged, in answer to our first point. Hence the defendants were guilty of maintaining a nuisance, notwithstanding the absence of evidence that the street had ever been used at the point where they obstructed it, for the reason that the public had a right to use it as laid out by the state. The court was wrong in charging that the essence of a nuisance, in such a case, is the interference with the travel of the public : Wood on Nuisances, §§ 250, 297; Commonwealth v. Rush, <a href="/pa/14/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="405963" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0186-01">14 Pa. 186</a>.</p>

But a highway laid out as this one was, needs no such acceptance. If a purchaser of an adjoining lot can escape an indictment by fencing in the highway early enough to prevent the public from ever using it, as was done in this case, he would benefit by his own wrong. The nonuser does not affect the question of nuisance in the case of such a highway: Commonwealth v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/27/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="27 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="979639" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0339-01">27 Pa, 339</a>.

The fact that the act of 1787 declares that the streets, lanes and alleys of the tract should be common highways forever, does not change the rule. In laying out this plan and selling lots therein, the commonwealth acted as a proprietor, not as a sovereign: Commonwealth v. Rush, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Pa.%20188" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="14 Pa. 188">14 Pa. 188</a>. The contention of the commonwealth would result in the same mischiefs as in the case of streets laid out by private owners, as these streets are laid on straight lines, regardless of the topography of the ground. The answer to the verbal request of the commonwealth cannot be complained of. An acceptance may be of a part of a highway: Wood on Nuisances, § 247; Angell on Highways, § 157.</p>

The only question of fact for the jury is that referred to in the first specification of error, viz., whether the defendants, by the building and fence described in the indictment, occupied or obstructed any part of Federal lane as established and laid out by the commonwealth, and as to that the weight of the evidence appears to be decidedly against the defendants.</p>

Neither its character as a public highway, nor the right of the public at all times to use it as such, could be lost by non-user: Wood on Nuisances, § 308. At common law, any act or obstruction which unnecessarily incommodes the lawful use of a highway by the public is a nuisance. Thus, it is a nuisance at common law to dig a ditch or make a hedge, or erect a gate or fence, across it, or a building on it: Ang. &amp; D. on Highways, § 223; Kelly v.
