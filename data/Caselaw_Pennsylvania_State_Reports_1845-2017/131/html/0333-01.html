    <p class="summary" id="b360-6" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[277,767,1171,706]]]'>There is a strong implication in the will of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, that he intended an absolute conversion of his estate into personalty. It is given to his executors upon an active trust to be divided into five equal shares and “ distributed ” by them amongst his children and grandchildren. The share given to his grandchildren is to be again subdivided and “ distributed” amongst them. The word “distribute” ordinarily applies to personal estate, and that it was intended to be used in that sense is strengthened by the consideration that the executors were invested with the legal title and a power of sale with a view to make division and distribution. The division into-fiye shares, and the subdivision of one of these' into five, could only have been made conrveisently of personalty, and it is reasonable to infer contemplated conversion.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b360-7" data-blocks='[["BL_360.6",360,[277,1482,1172,655]]]'>■ It was argued that the power oi sale'gi.-en the executors was discretionary and only operated .is <em>% </em>conversion from the daté of its exercise. But thisrpower is plainly discretionary only as to the time of its exercise. ' The executors were empowered, “ when in their judgment they should find it prudent or for the best interests of the legatees and devisees.” The discretion was legal and its exercise could have been compelled :• Erisman v. Poor Directors, <a href="/pa/47/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="47 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="485569" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0509-01">47 Pa. 509</a>. When a discretionary power becomes imperative, it must be regarded as a trust; for, unless it is executed the legatees cannot be paid, and the will is thereby defeated. If there was an equitable conversion, it is conceded that this fund must be awarded to the executors of the will of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b360-8" data-blocks='[["BL_360.7",360,[276,2145,1172,300]],["BL_361.1",361,[183,353,1170,867]]]'>But assuming that conversion under the will of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, did not take place until the date of the exercise of the power of sale, the will of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased, presents an insuperable obstacle to the claim of Mr. Reed. The manifest intention there was to give certain specified legatees an interest, as distinguished from a lien, in his in<a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>dividual property. He expressly “ sets apart or designates ” that property as a “ fund, or estate, out of which ” their “ payment in full ” should be made. It is not given to F. B. Laughlin individually, subject to the payment of the legacies: his beneficial interest is expressly limited to the “excess” after “payment in full” of these legacies: Craighead v. Given, 10 S. &amp; R. 351; Smith’s App., <a href="/pa/103/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="103 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="449145" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0559-01">103 Pa. 559</a>; Page v. Leaping-well, 18 Yes. 463. The will made it his duty, as executor, to pay them, and with that view invested him with discretionary power of sale of his realty included in the “ fund or estate ” “ set apart or designated ” for the purpose of payment. When this discretionary power became imperative, as it is conceded it did here, it became a trust, for unless executed the legatees could not be paid: Lindley’s App., supra. If the sale had not become necessary, F. B. Laughlin, being beneficially entitled to the “excess” need not have exercised the discretionary power. The testator could have had no other purposed</p>

It is now, when the time for distribution has arrived, in fact personal estate. It has only now become an available asset of the estate of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased. So far as appears, it may be required for the payment of his debts, if such there be. In any event, upon the settlement of that estate, all parties interested, whether creditors or legatees, will have their day in court, and can raise the same questions as have been raised here. The fund here for distribution is, in fact, now part of the estate of Alexander Laughlin, Sr., deceased, and will be payable as part <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>of the assets of Alexander Laughlin, Jr., deceased.
