      <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>On June 25, 1889, argument having been heard on petition and answer and the will exhibited, the following opinion was filed, Hawkins, P. J.:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[182,495,1174,456]]]'>The court is of opinion that, (1) The pecuniary legacies given to H. N. Pruss and the first-born child of Wilhelmine Nieman are vested and therefore subject to the lien of collateral inheritance tax; and (2) As Mrs. Nieman has the power to appropriate the balance of the estate to her own use during life, the amount, if any, collateral inheritance tax to which the state shall be entitled, cannot be ascertained until the widow’s death. The reasons which have led to this conclusion will be briefly stated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b373-6" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[185,960,1174,969]]]'>1. The legacies are completely cut off from the rest of the estate; the bequest is direct, and there is no gift, expressed or implied, of an interest in the subject, to any other than these legatees; and certainly Mrs. Nieman can justly claim no residuary or contingent interest. She is given the estate upon express condition that “ she ” pay these legacies to the “ persons named” at a definite “time.” The direction, so far as she is concerned, is absolute and unqualified; she is given the balance of the estate after the payment of these legacies, and nothing more. The provision in the clause containing these legacies for contingencies “ hereafter ” is not answered by the fifth clause which follows. That clause gives Mrs. Nieman no additional interest in the estate; it is a general residuary clause, and it makes no reference to the pecuniary legacies. It simply directs a disposition by her of such estate as she should die seised. Suppose she should die before the contingency upon which these legacies are said to depend should happen, could she, in contemplation of law, be said to have died seised or possessed of them ? Surely not.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b373-7" data-blocks='[["BL_373.6",373,[186,1937,1173,455]],["BL_374.1",374,[279,333,1173,147]]]'>It was suggested at the argument that in case of doubtful construction the presumption must be in favor of testacy, and that consequently the fifth must be regarded as a general residuary clause. The answer to this is, that the meaning of a testator must be ascertained from the language which he has used, and that the language used here will not justify an inference of an intention to give the widow any interest in these legacies. The whole scope of the clause is limited to a direction how to dispose of the remainder of the estate which had <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>been previously given her. The word “hereafter” does not necessarily mean heremafter, but may refer to a contemplated codiciliary provision.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[270,489,1183,813]]]'>The fact that no provision for a gift over upon the contingencies mentioned was made in the will, and that the subject was manifestly in the testator’s mind when the codicil was executed, seem to indicate the latter sense. The purposes of testator had in the meantime undergone a change in respect of a gift over upon contingencies. The habit of sobriety in the legatee which before had been an intended basis of condition subsequent was made simply precatory. The testator must be assumed to have had his whole scheme of disposition in mind when he made his codicil. He attached no condition to these legacies, and there is no apparent reason why we should clog one and not the other. The first legacy to H. N. Pruss was expressly given for his education, and might all be used for that purpose. The legacy to the first-born child of W. Nieman must be sent to Germany, whence no return would likely be made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b374-6" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[266,1311,1180,700]]]'>2. Construing the whole will together, there is no apparent limitation upon the widow’s power to appropriate during life to her own use the estate given her. In the second clause, it is given to her “ to have and to hold the same as her own undisputed property; ” and in the first clause of the codicil she is expressly given “ full power and authority to apply such portion or portions of my (the) said estate, the principal as well as the increase thereof, to hqr own use during life,” and only the estate of which she shall die seised, and necessarily the balance, is given over. There is no limitation upon the use, nothing is said about support or maintenance : Lininger’s App., <a href="/pa/110/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="110 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="543698" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0398-01">110 Pa. 398</a>.
