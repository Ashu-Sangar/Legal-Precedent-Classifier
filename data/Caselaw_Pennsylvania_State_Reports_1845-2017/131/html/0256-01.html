But the rule in Shelley’s Case does not apply, unless both estates, for life and in remainder, are of the same quality, both legal or both equitable. Here the legal estate -under the trust deed, is in the trustee, and Isabella Hamilton had only an equitable life estate. So had the remaindermen; but under the statute of uses, it became an executed trust as to them, and they took the legal estate in remainder, if the first taker had only a life estate.</p>

Active trusts where important duties are confided to the trustee, such as renting and managing the estate, investing money, distributing the proceeds, etc., are not within the operation of the statute. Others, not strictly active but passive trusts, will be saved where, <em>(a) </em>it is necessary for the protection of a married woman; (5) for the protection of a spendthrift child; (e) to support contingent remainders; <em>(fl) </em>or to serve some other useful and lawful purpose. As the trustee had no duties to perform under this trust, it falls under the second class, passive trusts. The only ground for contending that it is saved from the operation of the statute is, that it was for the protection of a married woman.</p>

But even an active trust ceases when there is no longer any purpose to serve by keeping it alive. If the trust is simply for the benefit of a married woman, or one in contemplation of marriage, it falls when she becomes discovert, and is not revived by a subsequent marriage: Bush’s App., <a href="/pa/33/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="33 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="988433" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0085-01">33 Pa. 85</a>; Earp’s App., supra.

By bill she asked for reconveyance. It was held an executed trust and that she was entitled to reconveyance. The opinion of the court concludes : “ The trust being passive, and the trustees not being needed to protect any other interest, Mrs. Dodson being sui juris and competent to exercise any power which had been vested in the trustees, the ulterior trust not being intended to protect any special interests, but being exactly commensurate with her own power and estate as absolute owner, there is no proper or useful purpose to uphold the trust and it consequently fell when she became discovert.” This case was not strictly a passive trust, for there.were certain duties to be performed by the trustees. But it fell with discoverture.</p>

      <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>Trusts for the sole and separate use of married women have been sustained in order to effectuate the object of the trusts; that is, save the property from the control or debts of their husbands. When the husband dies, the trust falls because there is no longer any necessity for it. Our married woman’s act of 1848 secures to married women the entire control and management of their separate estate and protects it from the debts and liabilities of their husbands. It accomplished all that can be accomplished by a trust for that purpose. Hence, such a trust is no longer of any necessity or practical advantage, and should fall, or be considered an executed trust, as in cases of discoverture. The trust deed in this case was executed in 1867, nineteen years after the passage of the act of 1848. It is, as we have seen, solely for the benefit of Mrs. Isabella Hamilton, then a married woman. If the title had been made directly to her she would have taken the property entirely free from the control, debts and liabilities of her husband. The trustee was simply the depository of the legal title, with no duties whatever to perform. It was a dry, naked trust. Mrs. Hamilton was to receive the rents and issues, subject to taxes and expenses, during her natural life, and at her death, then the property to go to her heirs. As there was no useful purpose-to be served by the trust, it was executed by the statute of uses and fell still-born at its birth.</p>

The property went to the heirs of Mrs. Hamilton by virtue of the trustee’s deed itself. .Both estates, for life and in remainder, being legal, they merged, and Mrs. Hamilton took the feei, under the rule in Shelley’s Case. It follows that Mrs. Hamilton and her husband could convey the fee. They might have done that, perhaps, without a reconveyance by the trustee. But after such reconveyance, and deeds for the fee-simple duly executed by Mrs. Hamilton and her husband for the whole property, her children have no claim or interest in the property.</p>

    <p id="b287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[192,415,1176,867]]]'>1. The rule in Shelley’s Case is not applicable to the deed of settlement in evidence in this case, for two reasons. In the first case, the intention of the settler, gathered from the whole deed, shows that the word “ heirs, ” in the clause declaring the trust, was used not in a technical sense, but as descriptio personarum, designating the children of his wife Isabella, begotten by himself. Such an intention is as much the governing rule of construction in a deed as in a will: Phillips’s App., <a href="/pa/93/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="93 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="442194" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0045-01">93 Pa. 45</a>: Furthermore, the limitation of the remainder in this case shows the intention that the remaindermen should take as the stock of a new inheritance, and not as heirs of a life-tenant. The remainder was to vest in the heirs, in fee, share and share alike, being an instance of a distributive remainder with superadded words of limitation, which converts the word “heirs” into a word of purchase: Smith on Executory Interests, § 488. See also Husbands on Married Women, 255; Huss v. Stephens, <a href="/pa/51/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="51 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="999768" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0282-01">51 Pa. 282</a>; Rogers v.

    <p id="b287-6" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[196,1291,1177,807]]]'>2. The second reason is, that the life-estate of Isabella Hamilton was an equitable one, while the estate in remainder to her heirs was legal. In such case, there could be no union of the two estates; to effect this, both must be legal or both equitable: Little v. Wilcox, <a href="/pa/119/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="119 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="558084" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0439-01">119 Pa. 439</a>. When the intention is to create a trust for the separate use of a married woman, the legal estate will vest in the trustee, although he has no active duties to perform, and the statute will not execute it in the cestui que trust: Perry on Trusts, § 310, et seq.; Husbands on Married Women, §§ 280,281, 327; Lancaster v.

If they are right in their contention that the deed to James Hamilton created a valid separate use trust in favor of his mother, Isabella Hamilton, they are not entitled to the possession of the real estate in controversy, for the reason that the husband of Isabella Hamilton is still living, and entitled to his curtesy therein. Mrs. Hamilton having an equitable estate in fee, her husband would be entitled to his life-estate: Dubs v. Dubs, <a href="/pa/31/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="31 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="985090" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0149-01">31 Pa. 149</a>; Rank v.

The contention of the plaintiffs is that she <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>took only a life-estate; that the deed created a separate use trust in her favor, which must be supported for her protection. It is to be noticed that the language does not create a technical separate use trust, nor is there anything from which we can draw the inference that a separate use trust was intended by the grantors, or even contemplated by them. It must not be overlooked that the deed to James Hamilton was made by Mrs.. Isabella Hamilton and her husband, in trust for the said Isabella. Had there been a conveyance to her directly, instead of to a trustee, there can be no doubt that it would have passed the fee. The added words, “ share and share alike,” referring to the “ heirs,” would not have been sufficient to take it out of the rule: Physick’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=50%20Pa.%20186" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="50 Pa. 186">50 Pa. 186</a>; Ogden’s App., <a href="/pa/70/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="70 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1028239" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0501-01">70 Pa. 501</a>. Does the fact that a trust was interposed make any difference ? This depends upon the character of the trust. If it is a separate use trust, or one which it is necessary to preserve for any purpose, Mrs. Hamilton’s interest would be limited to a 'life-estate. As was said by our Brother Sterrett in Little v. Wilcox, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20Pa.%20448" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="119 Pa. 448">119 Pa. 448</a>: “ A trust is never executed by the statute when its preservation is necessary, either for the protection of a feme covert, spendthrift child, or to support a contingent remainder, or to serve some other useful and lawful purpose.” We see no such purpose to serve in this case. It is not, as before observed, a separate use trust in terms. It provides no protection or restriction which is not given by the act of 1848; and while separate use trusts may be created since the passage of that act, and may often be very useful td protect a woman from the importunities of her husband, or from her own weakness, we are not disposed to strain a point to create such trust by mere implication. The trustee in this case had no active duties to perform; it is a passive, dry trust, with no interest to guard, no rights to protect. In such case, the cestui que trust is entitled to a reconveyance of the legal title; equity will consider that done which ought to be done, and declare the legal title in Mrs. Hamilton. It then comes within the rule in Shelley’s Case, and the life-estate and remainder coalesce, the effect of which is to give the fee to Mrs. Hamilton. We need not pursue the subject further, in view of the careful and elaborate opinion of the learned judge below.</p>
