Now, that is a question of law submitted to the court as to the construction of the terms of an agreement. As a matter of law I say to you that the privilege conferred by the clause I have just recited does not warrant the making and using of new entries and railways for the mere purpose of running coal from other land. But it confers the privilege forever of making and using, in the running of coal from other lands, such entries and railways as have been made and used in taking out the coal in the tract granted. If, therefore, you find from the evidence that the entry and railway in question — that is, the things he has a right to use in connection with mining and running coal from other tracts —were not made and used in taking out the coal granted in the deed, the defendants cannot justify their act as lawful under the privilege conferred by the deed and the -agreement mentioned.] 1</p>

How? “ By the use of entries, drifts and courses for air and drainage and air holes, pit-mouths, places for the deposit of slack and slate, and right of way for railroads over surface at the crossing of ravines,” etc. That is what they had a right to do; to make railways, to make entries, to cross ravines. For what? For the purpose of taking out the black coal. And he also covenants and agrees that after they have done that, that anything reasonably and properly necessary in connection with mining the black coal under the tract, any reasonable and legal exercise of the privileges of the grant, could be done afterwards; but it does not authorize the construction of entries over and under the surface of the property, for the mere purpose of getting at other coal. I take it, that is not the meaning of the grant. It gave authority to the defendants to do what was necessary for the mining and taking away of the coal conveyed; and if you find that this entry and railroad were legally, properly and legitimately made for the purpose of mining the coal conveyed to the defendants, then they can be used by them for the running of other coal, because those are two things he can use under that privilege; and if you find the fact to be that they were made for the purpose of mining the coal granted by the deed from McClure, then the defendants have a right to use them and the plaintiff could not recover. That, then, is the question to be determined in order that you shall apply the law. It either relieves the defendants from liability or makes them responsible for the trespass, accordingly as you find the fact to be in reference to the object and purpose for which the entry was constructed.</p>

McClure was the owner of a farm containing 244| acres, and, by contract made on June 80, 1859, sold all the coal under said farm to Farrow, Gumbert and Huey, reserving the red coal at the outcrop and six acres of the black coal for the support of the farm buildings and for domestic purposes. With the coal, he conveyed, in express terms, all the rights and privileges of mining, with the right to make drifts, air-holes, and pit-mouths for ventilation and drainage, and the “ right of way for railroads over the surface at the crossing of ravines; ” also, the privilege of “ forever hereafter running their coal from other lands through-the entries and railways made and used in taking out the coal above granted.” The outcrop of the coal on the McClure farm, when mining began, was on the face of the ridge fronting the Monongahela river. The seam or vein of coal extended back from the river, under the broken upland, through other tracts in the rear of the McClure farm, one of these being the Pierce tract, the coal under which is also owned by the appellants. The line between the McClure and the Pierce tracts runs along and near the bottom of a deep ravine, — so deep that it cuts through the vein of coal, leaving the outcrop on each side some fifteen feet above the bottom of the ravine. Having substantially exhausted the coal under the McClure, the appellants made an opening through the outcrop to the surface, built a road over the surface across the ravine to the outcrop on the Pierce, and commenced to mine their coal under the Pierce, and to run it “ through the entries and railways made and used in taking out the coal ” from the McClure, to the means of shipment on the river side of the ridge. The opening from the entry under the McClure through the outcrop to the surface, and the road across the ravine to the outcrop on the Pierce, constitute the trespass complained of.</p>

If we turn to the agreement of June 80, 1859, it is very clear that both McClure and his vendees knew that the vein of coal that extended through his own land continued beyond it through other lands lying behind his own and that must be reached by means of the entries and railroads to be made in taking the coal out of liis lands. It is a reasonable presumption that they knew that the line between his land and the tract immediately behind it was in a ravine deep enough to cut through the coal, and that it could be transported through the entries under his land only after connecting such entries with the coal on the other side of the ravine by means of a surface road crossing from outcrop to outcrop. With such knowledge of the actual situation on the ground, McClure expressly granted the right of way over ravines, and the privilege of “forever hereafter running other coal from other lands through the entries and railways made and used in taking out the coal hereinabove granted.”</p>

The ravine was between the McClure and the Pierce tracts, and there could not be continuous mining under the McClure up to the line of the Pierce. The grant is therefore inoperative, according to the construction that prevailed at the trial, because the process of mining under the McClure did not carry the entries and railways up to the line of the Pierce. But the grant is of the right of “ running other coal from other lands through the entries and railways made and used in taking out the coal hereinabove granted.” The “ other coal from otherlands ” must first be brought to the entries and railways under the McClure, and then it may be transported over them. It can only be brought to them by means of a connection through the outcrop and over the ravine. This was a fact known at the time the contract was made, and therefore within the contemplation of the parties when the grant was <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>incorporated into it. It is tb'e duty of tbe court to give snob a construction to tbis grant as shall give it effect. To do this, we must hold that tbe right to bring the coal from other land to the entries and railways under the McClure is necessarily incident to the right to transport it over them, and that in opening a way from the side entry to the surface, and over the ravine to the Pierce, the appellants were not trespassers, but were in the exercise of a clear legal right, under the terms of the grant. This is conclusive of the case as now presented. There is no proof of the conversion by the appellant of any part of the red coal; and the discussion of the appellee’s interest therein, as a tenant for life of the surface, becomes unnecessary.</p>
