Up to the time of his death, which occurred very suddenly, George Merkel was extensively and actively engaged in business, principally in the manufacture of charcoal pig iron. He was the owner of two furnaces, one situated in Greenwich township, the other in Albany township, Berks county, Pa., and at the time of his death the furnace in Greenwich township was in blast. He was the owner of a number of tracts of woodland, of a farm and grist mill, and an iron-ore mine which had been leased to a firm' of which he was for some time a member.</p>

This amount was exclusive of a mortgage of $60,000, covering part of his real estate, and dower resting upon various portions, and the sum of $22,600 retained by the purchaser of the Moselem ore-bank to pay a claim of the firm of Bushong &amp; Brother, subject, however, to an adjudication by the court.

Under the testimony, it appears that there was stock enough on hand at Merkel’s death to run the furnace for between two and three months, which would have completed the blast at the usual time of the year. A blast was generally begun in May, and continued for a period of about nine months. The furnace was blown out by the administrators in April or May after Merkel’s death, and it was considered to have been a heavy blast that year.</p>

If at the close of the blast the personal property had been put up for sale and had brought less than the appraised value thereof, the administrators would properly be entitled to a credit on their account for the deficiency, in case they had charged themselves with the appraisement. But preparations were made for another blast and the furnace was again started, and though it appears but a single blast was made, the administrators only stopped making iron in February, 1876. Then came a sale of personal property in February, 1875, and final sales of personal property, March 11,12 and 13,1875, more than two years after Merkel’s death. During this time the property was in use and was kept in repair. But a deficiency of $7,316.37, or decrease below the appraised value, arose from the sales held. Under the law, as the auditor views it, he is compelled to surcharge the administrators with this amount. The duties of an administrator áre plainly prescribed, and it would need the consent of all the heirs and all the creditors to equitably relieve him or them from pecuniary responsibility, in case of a depreciation in the value of the estate or any part of it used in the carrying on of the business.</p>

The matter may, however, not be important, in view of the fact that the property was not sold, the administrators announcing that it would not be sold for loss than $125,000. It is certainly the fact, however, that a valid bid of $90,000 was made.

L. 76. Any sale so made by an administrator requires the court’s approval. Any one concerned may object to its approval. If the objection is deemed valid, the sale is set aside. Thus it is clear, that if the administrators delayed unwarrantably the sale of the land, because they hoped to obtain a better prico, or for any other cause, the creditors who are now complaining could have ended the delay by resorting to the court. If they deemed the prices inadequate, they had their day in court to seek to set aside the sale and bring about others.

The distinction between a case of that kind and that of a sale made by an administrator, with the approval of the court, is evident. I think that both fairness to all concerned, and an observance of the rules governing sales of real estate by administrators, under orders of court, require that any one interested who is dissatisfied with the price shall present his objection in the proceeding to sell, not to the account. He ought to except to the sale before its absolute confirmation, or apply to open the decree of confirmation. A resale, not a surcharge, is the remedy.</p>

That damage resulting from the administrators’ negligence, the injurious effects of several times offering to sell without authority to do so, the delay in selling and the using of the real estate for the benefit of parties other than the creditors, after it was apparent that the land would have to be sold to pay debts, make the refusal of commissions a duty.® For, as is said in the case of Stehman’s Appeal, already referred to, commissions are given “ as the reward of a faithful execution of the trust confided,” not for occasioning “reckless confusion and procrastinating delay.”'</p>

The royalty being thus applied to pay a debt of the administrators, instead of to the debt of the estate to Bushong &amp; Co., as it should have been, the creditors of George Merkel suffered a loss for which his administrators are liable, and as they denied this liability, it is not easy to see why they should not be charged with interest thereon.</p>

The loss on the sale of the ore tract was evidently not due to an error of judgment on the part of the administrators, but to the fact that they were intent on carrying out their contract with the heirs, subordinating the interest of the creditors to that of the decedent’s family. They were bound under the act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 76, to appfy to the court for an order of sale, as soon as the insufficiency of the personal estate to pay debts appeared: Scott on Intest. Law, 2d ed., 588. The power given to creditors, by § 36 of the same act, to compel such an application, seems to be confined to judgment creditors, and the remedy is therefore neither prompt nor practical as to those not having judgments.

Others may be found in the delay to sell real estate long after the experiment of making iron had resulted disastrously; in permitting large accumulations of interest on debts; in failing to sell much of the real estate, which thereby escaped all liability for the decedent’s debts; and in the general and utter disregard of the interests of the creditors. General expressions like those in Fross’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="105 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="454229" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0258-01">105 Pa. 258</a>, and Price’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=81%20Pa.%20273" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="81 Pa. 273">81 Pa. 273</a>, on which the accountants rely as to this point, when considered apart from the facts of the cases, are the cheapest kind of authority.</p>

The refusal .to surcharge with the value of the ore is based upon the plain principle that an administrator is not chargeable with rents of real estate, even though they be collected by him as administrator: McCoy v. Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%20222" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="2 R. 222">2 R. 222</a>; Adams v.

In contending that this principle cannot apply because the lease stipulated that the ore should be furnished to the lessor, “ his executors, administrators or assigns,” our friends would not only abrogate “ principles of law based on <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>feudal reasons,” but also several modem statutes providing that land, with all that it implies, shall descend to the heir unless the owner manifest a different wish by the formal execution of a will or deed.</p>

One would suppose, from the second assignment in the appeal of the creditors, that the accountants had received credit for the cost of mining ore, or had paid it out of funds of the estate. Such is not the case. It was paid by the administrators acting on behalf of the heirs. The substance of the complaint on this subject is, that it was paid in part by the appropriation of royalties arising under the lease, and thereby the application of the royalties to the debt due Bushong &amp; Bro. Was prevented. But as the royalties went with the reversion to the heirs, the administrators had nothing to with them: Haslage v. Krugh, <a href="/pa/25/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="25 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="975864" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0097-01">25 Pa. 97</a>. Nor did the assignment of the royalties to Bushong &amp; Bro. by the decedent, make them any the less a part of the inheritance. That the lessees had a right to retain the royalties and apply them as they did, was adjudicated by this court in 1882, in the case referred to by the auditor and court below. The administrators were powerless to compel their application to the Bushong debt.</p>

It is conceded that the item of $2,000, for the decedent’s interest in the firm of Merkel &amp; Kaufman, was improperly in the inventory, and that the accountants were properly allowed a credit for it. But in calculating how much was lost on the sale of the personalty, the attorney of the accountants made the odd mistake of deducting the $2,000 twice, thus coming to the conclusion that the ' loss was only $7,316.37, whereas in fact it was $9,316.37. The mistake was one against the accountants, as it caused the amount for which they ask credit in their account to be $2,000 less than the actual loss. But as the credit was entirely disallowed, the mistake injured no one, and the attorneys of the creditors are in a curious state of confusion in thinking that because of it we should be charged with $2,000, in addition to the disallowance of the credit asked for.</p>

It is clear that it was caused by the general depreciation in all values, a thing which the adminis<a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>trators could not foresee. .They acted with good faith, in accordance with the light they had at the time. The creditors assented to their course, either expressly or tacitly. The work in operation at the furnace was continued, in obedience to the advice of an approved legal counselor, just as the intestate left it. In view of these facts, the accountants ought to be dealt with liberally by the court: Bosio’s Est., 2 Ash. 437. The court ought to have allowed also the accountants compensation, as it is absolutely certain that they were guilty of no fraud or .unfairness: Eross’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="105 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="454229" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0258-01">105 Pa. 258</a>; Price’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=81%20Pa.%20273" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="81 Pa. 273">81 Pa. 273</a>, The cases of Swartswalter’s Acct., <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.%2077" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="4 W. 77">4 W. 77</a>; Stehman’s App., <a href="/pa/5/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="5 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="953498" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0413-01">5 Pa. 413</a>, and Clauser’s Est., <a href="/pa/84/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="84 Pa. 51" data-case-ids="1053588" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0051-01">84 Pa. 51</a>, were instances of dishonest conduct.</p>

The creditors got the benefit of the payments, for if they had not been made, .the amount collectible out of the land on the mortgage would have been just so much greater, and the real estate fund would have been decreased by that amount. Interest so paid is regarded as an advanced payment, and the administrators take the place of the mortgagee to that amount: Robb’s App., <a href="/pa/41/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="41 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="480023" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0045-01">41 Pa. 45</a>; Torr’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%20250" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="2 R. 250">2 R. 250</a>; McCurdy’s App., <a href="/watts-serg/5/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 397" data-case-ids="477989" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0397-01">5 W. &amp; S. 397</a>; Greiner’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20418" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="2 W. 418">2 W. 418</a>.

Whether the accountants refused offers because they thought them inadequate, or whether they failed to complete sales because of not having procured an order in time, in neither case are they liable unless their conduct caused the subsequent depreciation.

The rents and profits accruing from them after the death of the owner belong to the heir, and the administrator is not authorized to receive them. The Orphans’ Court may, on his application, order a sale of the lands for the payment of debts, if the personal estate is insufficient for that purpose. But his powers and duties with reference to them are limited to an application for an order of sale, and to the proper execution of that order when it is obtained.</p>
    <p id="b635-8" data-blocks='[["BL_635.8",635,[196,1223,1169,403]]]'>The rights of the lessor under the lease to Bushong &amp; Co., as well as the lands covered by it, descended to his heirs, and the. transfer to Bushong &amp; Co. of the rents accruing under the lease imposed no duty on the administrators in relation to them. They could not prevent the lessees from paying the rent to the heirs of the lessor with the consent of his assigns. It follows that they cannot be surcharged with the amounts so paid, nor the sums paid by the heirs to the lessees for mining the ore.</p>
    <p id="b635-9" data-blocks='[["BL_635.9",635,[197,1634,1170,647]]]'>The creditors’ third specification is destitute of merit. The administrators claimed a credit of $9,316.37 for loss on sale of personal property, but it was not allowed. They received a credit of $2,000, on the ground that the decedent’s interest in the stock of goods in the store of Merkel &amp; Kaufman was appraised at that sum, when in fact the stock was exhausted in the payment of the firm debts. This was just, and it seems that it was so considered by the creditors, because they did not except to it in the court below, and they do not complain of it here. It has no connection with the claim for decrease on sale of personal property, and, as the administrators were not allowed any credit on account of such decrease, its amount is immaterial.</p>

The personal estate was the primary fund for the payment of all the debts of the decedent, and it was the duty of the administrators to use it for that purpose. The lands covered by the mortgage were sold, under' an order of the Orphans’ Court, for $30,000 more than was required to satisfy the debt secured by it. It was well said by the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court, in disposing of this question, that “ the payment of the interest was a proper disbursement, not detrimental to the general creditors, and upon no theory can credit for it be refused.”</p>

It was the duty of the administrators to convert the personal property within a year after the letters were granted to them. If they had made a fair public sale of it within that period, their liability would have been measured by its proceeds. But they commenced their administration of the estate in the belief that it was solvent, and that the personal property would be taken by the family at the appraisal. They allowed this property to be used for two years in the prosecution of a business with which as administrators they had no lawful concern. In consequence of this use, .and a general decline in market values, it sold for $7,316.37 less than it was worth when it came into their possession. This loss must fall upon the administrators, because it resulted from their neglect of a plain duty.</p>

They have accounted for every dollar of the trust funds received by them; they have been surcharged with the loss on sale of personal property, and with all expenditures not sanctioned by the law; and they must lose the amount they have paid to creditors in excess of the dividend the estate will yield, although payment was made by them in the belief that the estate was solvent. When they entered upon the duties of their office they adopted a course which was recommended by competent counsel, and which was then approved by many, if not all, of the creditors, and by sagacious and conservative business men.
