But the law relating to marriage and the rights of married women makes the questions of difficulty in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b51-5" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[218,516,1177,1025]]]'>Prior to the act of 1848, commonly known as the Married Woman’s Act, upon marriage all the personal property of a married woman became the property of the husband, absolutely, and her real estate became his for his life. He had the right to control and manage it,'to receive the rents and profits of it, and he had the right to her earnings. She had no right even to go into business and make money for her own use. That was all changed by the act of 1848, which secures to married women all property owned by them at the time of marriage, or which may be acquired after marriage except from her husband, and in some cases it may be acquired from the husband and secured to her. [I take it that the act of 1848, and if there were any question about it, the act of 1887, secures to a married woman the absolute use and control of her property, even as against her husband,] 4 and certainly against every person else. The creditors of the husband cannot touch it. The difficulty arises in the fact that by the law a man and wife are considered one person; and, therefore, as a rule, no action can be maintained by a wife against the husband, or by a husband against the wife.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b51-6" data-blocks='[["BL_51.5",51,[217,1547,1175,404]]]'>In 1856 an act of assembly was passed which authorized a married woman who had been deserted by her husband to bring suits in her own name. Prior to that, she could not bring a suit even against a stranger in her own name ; it was necessary to join her husband with her, because they were regarded in law as one person. In no case was she authorized to bring a suit at common law against her husband, for the reason that she would be suing herself, in contemplation of law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b51-7" data-blocks='[["BL_51.6",51,[219,1957,1171,456]],["BL_52.1",52,[239,352,1170,709]]]'>But before the act of 1856, and even before the act of 1848, a wife was not deprived entirely of the protection of the courts, and it was held that she could in equity protect her rights even against her husband. In Pennsylvania, until 1886, our courts had no equity powers, and therefore she was almost deprived of any remedy. But our courts, prior to the passage of that act conferring equity powers upon them, had adopted equitable principles, and there were certain actions that were specially called equitable actions, and among them was the ac<a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>tion of ejectment. There are numerous instances in which a party may bring an action of ejectment where at common law it could not be done. ' For instance, we have a very familiar case in that of specific performance, and even though the act conferring equity powers authorizes courts by bill to specifically enforce contracts, it is nevertheless still done by action of ejectment, because it is a substitute for a bill in equity; [and I therefore conclude that though this was a common law form of action, it might be treated as and substituted for a bill in equity, for the purpose of enforcing the rights of the plaintiff in this case; and I have so treated it in the trial thus far, and instruct you, therefore, that the plaintiff has a right to recover, provided she has made out a case in other respects entitling her to a verdict.] 2</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b52-5" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[239,1070,1170,237]]]'>We then come to the question as to her rights. As I remarked before, her title is undisputed, and if there be nothing in the marriage relation which prevents her from recovering, she is entitled to your verdict against her husband, and we must then look at that relation to see how it affects this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b52-6" data-blocks='[["BL_52.5",52,[238,1324,1174,1064]],["BL_53.1",53,[204,351,1169,709]]]'>Although the acts of 1848 and 1887 secure to a married woman her property, the use, enjoyment and the control of it to a large extent, she cannot sell it without the consent of her husband, he joining with her. But those acts of assembly were not intended, even as to the property rights of the husband and wife, to create an absolute divorce, and they have some joint interest in the property which is owned by the wife. Though the husband and wife each have control of their own estates, there is necessarily growing out of the marriage relation some community of interest in their property. Therefore, she has a right to say to her husband, “ I have this property and we will make our home upon it; ” and if they do, she would have no claim for rent unless there was a bargain made for it. She could not sue him for his occupancy of it, and as I held in a suit between these same parties, she could not sue him for trespass upon it, in a common law form of action. But if they mutually agree, and here is where I think you will find the real point of the cáse, to go and make their home upon the property of the wife, and do make their home upon that property, she has no right arbitrarily and without cause to remove from the property and bring suit against him to recover it, be<a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>cause the action being equitable she must do equity, and, therefore, the courts will not enable her to do what is unjust and wrong, and if she comes into court in that way she is not entitled to recover. Then the question for you to determine is, did these people make an arrangement to go upon that property and occupy it for their home, and did they do so ? Because, until the arrangement is perfected, I do not think that the right of the husband to occupy is perfect. But if ho went on that property in pursuance of the arrangement with his wife for the purpose of making a home, she assenting to it, and he took possession of the property with that purpose and under that arrangement, then she cannot, without cause, disavow or annul the arrangement and bring an action of ejectment to recover the property.</p>

For some reason they never did live together after they got the house ready for occupancy. They were there, as I understand, two or three days ; but, if I remember the testimony properly, they were there cleaning the house and putting it in order. If I am mistaken about that you will know. For some reason, afterwards she did not go, but she rented the property or made a lease of it to Mr. Vandevort for the year 1887. There is some testimony that her personal property was all removed from the premises, and Mr. Neely, I believe, says that was done with Mr. McKendry’s consent; that he said, “let her take it.” There is some evidence that he took away what he had put there, a stove and some other things. He went back in the fall, got the key from Mr. Neely, to whom it had been delivered by Mrs. McKendry, and got into the property, but there was no actual occupancy of it until April or May, 1887; and when he did go into actual, permanent occupancy of it he brought with him a family, Mr. Fessler’s and Mr. McCloskey, who was living with them, and put them in the place. [It is a question you will consider, whether that possession was in pursuance of this arrangement made with his wife, or whether it was inconsistent with that arrangement. If it was in pursuance of that arrangement, she <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>would not be entitled to recover. But if it was inconsistent with that arrangement, and it is for you to say whether or not the bringing of a family into a three-roomed house is inconsistent with his possession in pursuance of that arrangement, she would be entitled to recover. He must not only have taken possession, but he must retain it in pursuance of that agreement.] 3' The facts have all been commented on at length by counsel, and they are fresh in your minds. I do not need to say further than this, except to direct your attention to the point that he must have entered into and retained possession in pursuance of and consistently with agreement.</p>

It may be urged, however, that the defendant had no right to make his home on the plaintiff’s lands; that while she is not bound to furnish a home for herself, her husband and family, it is the duty of a husband to furnish a home for his wife. This may be true; but if the wife is willing to subject her property to that servitude, surely it is a matter of arrangement between the two with which no court can interfere : Cole v.

The court below erroneously rejected evidence tending to show that the plaintiff had committed adultery with one Jerome Prosser. The offer was made, not upon the ground that adultery or fornication in itself would be a defence in the ejectment, but for the purpose of showing, in connection with other evidence, a desertion by her of her husband. Of course, she could herself have been indicted and convicted criminally for this of-fence, but when a woman leaves the home and embraces of her husband for four months, refusing to return to him, and lives with another man as though married to him, could there be any <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>doubt as to the competency of that testimony as tending to show a wilful and malicious desertion? Tbe husband still clings to the hope that for the future welfare of his offspring, his possession of this property may cause a return of this unworthy woman. If there were nothing else in this case, this should go very far to induce a reversal of this judgment.</p>

It was brought against John Fessler and William McKendry, the persons then in possession of her land. We urge that the action can be maintained as a substitute for a chancery proceeding to protect the plaintiff’s estate from the inequitable and unjust interference of her husband, and to wrest the possession of that estate from his grasp, a possession obtained by a trick and a fraud, and maintained by force against the plaintiff and her agents. Further; under the facts in evidence, the action can be maintained under § 3, act of April 11, 1856, P. L. 315: “ Whensoever, any husband shall have deserted or separated himself from his wife, or neglected or refused to support her, or she shall have been divorced from his bed and board, it shall be lawful for her to protect her reputation by an action for slander or libel; and she shall have the right, by action, to recover her separate earnings or property. Provided, That if her husband be the defendant, the action shall bo in the name of a next friend.” The statements of the law by the court below, covered by tbe second, third and fourth assignments of error, seem to ns to be self-evident propositions which need no discussion; and the Beaver county record offered in evidence was inadmissible against the plaintiff, as she was not a party thereto.</p>

It was an action of ejectment brought in the court below to recover the possession of certain real estate, admittedly the separate property of the wife. It is clear she could not sustain such suit at common <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>law. Can she do so by force of any act of assembly? We throw out of the case the act approved June 3,1887, P. L. 332, relating to husband and wife, for the reason that this suit was commenced before its passage. The rights of the parties must be measured by the law as it stood on the day when the writ issued.</p>
    <p id="b58-5" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[242,651,1172,1000]]]'>Without going into tedious detail in regard to the- legislation affecting the property rights of married women, the sixth section of the act of April 11,1848, P. L. 536, secures to them the full use and enjoyment of their property of every description, whether real, personal, or mixed, as fully after marriage as before. It is not liable for her husband’s debts, nor can he mortgage or encumber it. There are various other provisions in subsequent acts of assembly relating to the separate earnings of the wife, her right to be declared a feme sole trader, etc., which it is not necessary to refer to in detail. Then comes the act of April 11, 1856, P. L. 315, the third section of which provides that, “ Whensoever any husband shall have deserted or separated himself from his wife, or neglected or refused to support her, or she shall have been divorced from his bed and board, it shall be lawful for her to protect her reputation by an action for slander or libel; and she shall also have the right, by action, to recover her separate earnings or property: provided that, if her husband be the defendant, the action shall be in the name of a next friend.” The plaintiff contends that her suit can be sustained under this last act.</p>

It may very well be that a common law action could not be maintained against him for that purpose. The act having given the right, there must be a remedy to enforce it; otherwise it wmuld fail of its purpose, in part, 'at least. If a husband were to deprive his wife of the use and enjoyment of her separate estate, it would be an act contrary to law, and prejudicial to her interests, and we have no doubt a court of equity could interfere to restrain such action. Many nice questions may arise as to what would constitute an interference by the husband with the separate property of the wife. If they are living together on her property, her right to pject him <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>therefrom arbitrarily may well be questioned. The home of the husband is the home of the wife, and the home .of the wife must necessarily be the home of the husband, if he chooses to avail himself of it; otherwise all unity of person between them would be destroyed, which we do not think was intended by the act of 1848. But if the husband desert his wife, we do not think he can take possession of her real estate and hold it as against herself or her tenants. Upon the trial of the cause below, the learned judge submitted to the jury the question whether this husband and wife took possession of the property in dispute under an agreement or arrangement between them that they were to make it their home, and instructed them that, if the possession was taken in pursuance of such an arrangement, the plaintiff could not recover. This clearly appears from that portion of the charge embraced in the third specification. “It is a question,” said the learned judge, “you will consider, whether that possession was in pursuance of this arrangement made with his wife, or whether it was inconsistent with that arrangement. If it was in pursuance of that arrangement, she would not be entitled to recover; but if it was inconsistent with that arrangement, and it is for you to say whether or not the bringing of a family into a three-roomed house is inconsistent with his possession in pursuance of that arrangement, she would be entitled to recover. He must not only have taken possession, but he must retain it in pursuance of that agreement.” We fail to discover error in this instruction. The whole matter of the unhappy difficulties between these parties, and the facts which led up to the occupation of the premises, were before the jury, and they have found that the possession of the husband was inconsistent with the alleged agreement. With this fact found against them, the only point left the defendants is the question whether the action of ejectment can be maintained.</p>

As before observed, it is an act contrary to law, and prejudicial to the interests of the wife, for a husband to deprive her of the possession and enjoyment of her separate estate, and, as there is no remedy at law provided for such <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>case, we have no doubt that the jurisdiction of equity would attach under the act of 1836, conferring equity powers upon the courts. The action of ejectment is often a substitute for a bill in equity, and we have in our practice what is known as an equitable ejectment. It is used constantly to enforce specific performance of contracts for the sale of real estate, and in some other instances. It is a convenient and plastic remedy, and more speedy than a bill in equity. The learned judge below treated this suit throughout as an equitable ejectment, and, while it is not so technically, we see no objection to regarding it as substantially such a proceeding. If it were necessary to frame a new writ to meet the exigencies of this case, we have ample power to do so, under the third section of the act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 785. It is not needed that we should frame a new writ, where we have one already in existence which will accomplish all that is needed. Regarding this action as a substitute for a bill in equity, we are of opinion that it can be sustained.</p>
