On May 27, 1887, the plaintiff by letter notified the defendant that the machinery was finished and ready for operation. Owing to a lack of coal caused by a strike, a trial could not be had until July 18,1887, when the first experiments were made. On August 1st, Mr. Stutz started the machinery, and averred <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>that it worked perfectly. The officers of the company, however, claimed that it did not work satisfactorily, and on September 28,1887, notified the plaintiff that “ unless you proceed to put the machinery into satisfactory working condition, we now give you notice that we will endeavor to have the difficulties remedied by others at your expense.” The machinery was not made to work satisfactorily to the defendant, and payment of the final instalment being refused, this suit was brought for its recovery.</p>

The reason of this is, that when a person makes a contract in writing that his work shall be satisfactory to the person for whom the work is done, it must be satisfactory to that person, who is the sole judge of that, unless he acts in bad faith. It makes no difference whether his reasons would be satisfactory to you or to me ; it is a bargain in writing, and hence, I say, your verdict should be for the defendant unless the plaintiff establishes one of two propositions.

He must establish to your satisfaction that the defendant company continued the further use of the machinery erected by the plaintiff after the expiration of thirty days after they commenced its operation for the purpose of trial. The agreement contains the clause that, the defendant shall have thirty days to try it. The “ thirty days ” does not, as contended in the argument on the motion for a nonsuit by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, date from the time the machinery was delivered, but from the time the defendant began to operate it for the purpose of trial. This clause is to be construed reasonably. The true intent of it is that the defendant company are to have a thirty day period in which to try it. If they had a fair trial for a period of thirty days, and chose afterwards to <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>keep it, — I do not mean to “ keep it ” in the absolute sense of the term, because they had it on their ground, had their own building for it, and had already paid over six thousand dollars for it; I do not mean that they should have returned it, — but if, after having thirty days’ trial of it, they chose to continue to use it, then they are bound to pay this second instalment subject to such deductions as I shall instruct you upon. If this is established to your satisfaction, and you will judge of it from the weight of the evidence which seems to me to .tend that way, it will relieve the case of the difficulties mentioned in connection with the contract as to the machinery being satisfactory ; because I apprehend that the law is and will be, until it is otherwise decided by the Supreme Court, that when a party, under a clause of this kind, takes machinery upon trial, and after the trial continues to use it, he must pay what it is worth, with whatever deductions you would allow for necessary expenses incurred in connection with it.

It did not return it, however, but continued to use it, and on September 28, 1887, gave the plaintiff notice that, “ unless you proceed to put the machinery into satisfactory working condition, we now give you- notice that we will endeavor to have the difficulties remedied by others at your expense.” This was an election to retain the machinery, and the defendant was liable to pay for it, less a proper deduction from the price, to enable defendant to put it in a satisfactory working order. The court below so instructed the jury, and the latter appear to have deducted a considerable sum from the contract price. Whether the jury erred in the amount, we do not know, nor is it our province to inquire; but we are satisfied the instructions of tlie learned judge below were correct.</p>
