Mason filed her libel against her husband, John Mason, averring that the defendant had offered such indignities to the person of the petitioner as to render hex* condition intolerable and her life burdensome, and thereby forced her to withdraw from his house and family; praying for a divorce. A subpoena and an alias subpoena awarded tbereon were returned non est inventus, and service upon the defendant was made by publication. The court thereupon appointed <em>Mr. Joseph M.

Several other witnesses were called at this and subsequent bearings, whose testimony was substantially to the following effect:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b185-12" data-blocks='[["BL_185.12",185,[196,2318,1165,90]],["BL_186.1",186,[273,367,1180,1475]]]'>Shortly after their marriage the plaintiff and defendant resided for a few weeks with the parents of the former. <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>the remainder of the time they lived together as husband and wife, they were keeping house in various localities in the city of Pittsburgh and its vicinity. The defendant was addicted to drunkenness to such an extent that his occupation was very much interrupted thereby and very irregularly followed. He did not provide properly for his wife’s maintenance, and during a large part of the time she would have been entirely without food or decent clothing, had these not been supplied by her parents. The defendant was not regular -about staying at home, and would frequently be absent for a week at a time. With great frequency he would come home drunk, scold his wife and treat her rudely, and call her a whore and other vile names, in the presence of other people, charging her with going with other men and with having procured an abortion upon herself. He frequently made threats of violence against her, saying that he would shoot her, blow her brains out the first chance he had, cut out her bloody heart, or cut her throat with a razor. On one occasion, while scolding his wife in a fit of drunkenness, he pulled a razor out of his pocket and said he would cut her into mince-meat, when her father interfered and ordered him to put the razor away. On another occasion he became angry and pushed her off the porch of the house in which they were living. He often threatened to leave the plaintiff, and one day threw all the furniture and carpets out into the street and tried to sell them. In the evening of the same day he came home intoxicated, burst open the door of the house and raised a disturbance such that his wife sent for the police and had him arrested. The next day her father came and took her and her goods to his home.</p>

The proof shows no actual violence, though the witnesses testify to threats upon one or two occasions.

There must be such a course of conduct or continued treatment as renders the wife’s condition intolerable or life burdensome.

The evidence showed that her husband was in a state of almost constant intoxication, so gross as to be at times unfitted for labor. It showed that the little he did earn went in great part for drink, and that his wife was often left without the commonest necessaries of life, except as they were supplied by her father and his family. It showed that from their marriage, in February, 1886, to August, 1887, when her father took her back to his own home, her husband was ill-natured and unreasonable in his treatment of her; that'he was habitually finding fault with her and with all she did; that he called her a whore, charged her publicly with committing an abortion upon herself, and with running after other inen. It showed frequent threats of personal violence, such as the threat to kill her, to blow out her brains, to cut her heart out, to fix her, and other similar expressions. But it went still further, and showed actual violence attempted, and to some extent accomplished. On one occasion he drew a razor, and said he would cut her into mince-meat. Her father interfered, and compelled him to put the razor up. At another time, in a fit of anger, he shoved her off the porch of their dwelling. Finally, he pulled up the carpets, and threw them, together with their household furniture, into the street, and offered them for sale. Her father then came, and took his daughter and her household goods back to his own home.</p>

Bad temper alone is not a ground for divorce, nor is mere drunkenness, or indolence, or thriftlessness, or jealousy; but when to all these is added a course of the most abusive and humiliating treatment, public and repeated charges of the crimes of adultery and abortion, threats to shoot, to kill, to cut out her heart, to cut her into mince-meat, and the like, .accompanied by such unmistakable evidences of his purpose to carry his threats into execution as was offered by drawing a razor, by pushing her off the porch of the house, and by breaking up her home, and throwing its contents into the streets, it seems very clear to us that the condition of this wife was made intolerable, and her life burden<a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>some. To deprive her of food and other necessaries of life is an indignity to her person. To assault her with a razor, or inflict violence upon her is an indignity to her person. To put her inmortal terror by repeated threats to kill is as truly destructive to health as to administer poison. It may not be as speedy, but, if continued, it is certain destruction to both mind and body. It banishes peace and security and comfort from her home, and puts fear, a sense of constant peril, and a blighted domestic life in their place. The learned, judge of the court below held the rule too stiffly in this case.</p>
