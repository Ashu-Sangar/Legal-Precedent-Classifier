To this letter of his son, the testator himself added these words: “ I have carefully read this letter, and believe every statement therein to be strictly correct.” The joint commendation of the enterprise induced the claimant to invest the sum of $12,500 in the purchase of 250 shares of stock in the corporation. A certificate for the stock was sent to him by Mr. Martin, Jr., May 10, 1886.</p>

On June 18, 1886, he wrote from Texas to the testator, thus: .“ Referring to a conversation I had with your son Robert, about the two hundred and fifty shares I hold in the Martin Color &amp; Chemical Co., I enclose certificate of same, No. 16, for said two hundred and fifty shares, and I ask you to dispose of it and remit the proceeds to the Hanover National Bank, New York, for my credit.

It failed June 20, 1886, and eventually settled with creditors at ten or fifteen cents on the dollar; Mr. Robert Martin, as its treasurer, in July, 1886, sent $6,252 to the claimant, in part repayment of his purchase of stock. The certificate of stock belonging to claimant remained in the custody of the testator until his death. It was not alleged that the testator made any attempt to sell it; and it may be stated, as a fact, that, owing to the failure of the company, the value of the stock was greatly impaired before it reached the testator. Under the view which will be taken of the transaction, the latter circumstance is not material.</p>

The son suggested to his relative an investment which he believed was profitable, aud in which he had placed his own fortune; and the claimant acted on the suggestion with the single purpose of benefiting himself. Neither the son, by his letter advising the venture, nor the father, by his indorsement of that advice, assumed any duty towards the claimant; and the claimant in his turn could impose no duty upon the testator, by returning to him the certi<a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>ficate. The latter was not bound to receive it, and he was not bound to sell it. He was sought to be made a bailee, and he could have refused the bailment. But he did not refuse it. On the contrary, he accepted it in its length and breadth, and he even went further; he agreed so to dispose of the stock that no loss should accrue to the owner. That promise, if the claimant chose to rely on it, left him nothing to do; and the very fact that he did nothing shows that he relied upon it. He might have repudiated it and insisted upon the sale; but he waited, because, whether the stock was sold or not, he was to be at no loss; and of the propriety of a sale the testator had undertaken to be the sole judge.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[169,966,1171,855]]]'>It matters very little in what shape the promise was moulded; the only points which press being, whether it was an original undertaking by the promisor, and whether it was supported by a sufficient consideration. Its language was: “ I will see that Robert makes you whole;” But the writer knew that Robert was not obliged to make the claimant whole, and, unless he intended to deceive by means of a quibble, he meant to say, “ I will do what I admit Robert is not obliged to do.” That he meant to shoulder the absolute obligation himself is shown by the rest of his offer. The stock had been sent to him to be sold. He accepted it, but reserved the right to sell it, or hold it; and as an equivalent for that option, he bound himself to see that the claimant was made whole. Here was the consideration : the claimant was to give himself no uneasiness; that is, he was to abandon his request for an immediate sale, and accept in lieu the risks of an uncertain future and of a possible total loss.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b665-6" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[167,1838,1171,556]],["BL_666.1",666,[274,346,1178,609]]]'>The authorities which counsel for the claimant collected in a brief to which this hasty adjudication does scant justice, show that, whether the contract of the testator was one of suretyship, or was an original undertaking, it was equally binding. In M'ountstephen v. Lakeman, L. R. 7 Q. B. 200, the defendant agreed to see that plaintiff was paid by the board of which defendant was chairman, for work done by plaintiff, for which, as both parties knew, the board was not liable; and the promise was held to import a primary liability on the part of the defendant. In the present case, it was contended at the audit that the offer by the testator was at most a guaranty that if <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>Robert did not, the testator would, make the claimant whole, and hence that recourse to the son should have been first had and exhausted. But, as in the case of oral promises to pay the debt of another, the question dividing a guaranty from a suretyship is, does any liability in the original debtor remain, or, rather, has the new promisor become the actual debtor? Maulé v. Bucknell, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20Pa.%2089" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="50 Pa. 89">50 Pa. 89</a>. Here, if there was any liability in the son, it ceased to be recognized by the claimant when he sent the certificate to the testator, and rested upon the testator’s promise to settle. As the claim will be considered upon exceptions by the court in banc, the adjudication need not be prolonged. The claim is admitted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b666-5" data-blocks='[["BL_666.4",666,[272,1013,1177,250]]]'>Exceptions to this adjudication were filed by the executors of the decedent. The court after argument sustained the exceptions and dismissed the claim (Ashman, J., dissenting), Fekghson, J., filing an opinion, which after stating the'facts proceeded:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b666-6" data-blocks='[["BL_666.5",666,[269,1269,1179,608]]]'>It was admitted at the audit that there was no fraud in this transaction. The auditing judge has so found, and that finding has not been excepted to; so that the consideration of that element in this transaction is removed. The only other question to be considered is, whether there was any consideration for the contract of the decedent to make the claimant whole; for a promise for which there is no consideration cannot be enforced at law. As the alleged assumption by the decedent is not under seal, it is not necessary to consider whether it is an original undertaking or a mere guaranty. A consideration is necessary to support it in either case, and the burden of proving the consideration is upon him who seeks to recover.</p>

This inference is drawn from the words which the decedent used in his letter, “whether the stock is sold or not,” which would seem to imply that he could sell the stock. But, when we consider that this letter <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>was written on June 25th; that he had received the stock only the day before, and that the company had become hopelessly bankrupt on the 20th, it will be seen that the decedent had no option in the matter. There was no market for the stock. The claimant’s order to sell might be ever so peremptory, and the decedent’s efforts ever so great, but the stock could not be sold. It is at least for the claimant to show that a sale was then possible, and that the decedent made no effort to comply with his order. We are not to charge a decedent’s estate upon mere inferences; and, to find a consideration in this case, we must infer not only that the stock could have been sold, but, also, that the decedent withheld the sale for some purpose of his own, whereby he was benefited or the claimant injured, while all the facts of the case show the contrary.</p>

The claimant was then the owner of the stock, and had been for some time. He had previously bought and paid for it. The company was then bankrupt. Its stock was worthless. There was nothing that either of these parties could do, or refrain from doing, that would change the condition of affairs with reference to this stock. There was no loss or benefit moving either way. Where, then, was the consideration for this promise?</p>

If the writing be construed as the assumption of a primary liability, it was without legal consideration, and not enforceable either in law or in equity. It is not the law that a purely moral obligation is a sufficient consideration for a promise; it is only where there has onee existed a legal liability which can no longer be enforced because of the bar of a statute, or of some equivalent, that a moral obligation will support a promise: Hare on Contracts, 262; Stebbins v. Crawford Co., <a href="/citations/?q=92%20Pa.%20291" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="92 Pa. 291">92 Pa. 291</a>. The opinion of the court below very clearly shows that there was no legal consideration for any promise the letter may contain. As to the position that the decedent was bound to carry out the claimant’s instruction to sell, a sufficient answer is that the claimant has already received the price at which he authorized the sale.</p>

The office of the company was in Philadelphia, and its manufactory in Chester, Pa. About the 1st of June, 1886, he visited Philadelphia, and on inspection of the company’s property became dissatisfied with his investment, and signified to Robert Martin, a son of the decedent, his willingness to sell his stock at half its cost. On the 18th of June he wrote from Texas to the decedent as follows: “ Referring to a conversation I had with your son Robert’about the two hundred and fifty shares I hold in the Martin Color &amp; Chemical Company, I enclose a certificate of same, No. 16, for two hundred and fifty shares, and I ask you to dispose of it, and remit the proceeds to the Hanover National Bank, Now York, for my credit. Please dispose of it promptly, as I dread the fire risk. Doubtless your son Robert has fully explained to you my views in the matter.” This letter, containing the stock, was received by the decedent on the 24th of June, and the next day he acknowledged it, and added: “ Whether the stock is sold or not, <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>give yourself no uneasiness as to fire or otherwise. I will see that Robert makes you whole.” The company failed on the 20th of June, and the stock, when received by the decedent, was worthless. A settlement was subsequently effected by the company with its creditors at ten or fifteen cents on a dollar. About the 16th of July, Robert Martin deposited $6,252 in the Hanover National Bank, New York, to the credit of the appellant, being half the price paid for the stock, and the sum for which he had offered to sell it in June. The appellant now seeks to recover from the estate of the decedent the balance of the price he paid for the stock.</p>
    <p id="b674-5" data-blocks='[["BL_674.4",674,[261,915,1175,856]]]'>It is conceded that no liability was incurred by the decedent in connection with the appellant’s purchase of stock. The learned auditing judge says of this transaction, “that no contractual relation of any sort existed between the claimant and Robert Martin, the son; and all semblance of fraud was admit, ted on the argument to be out of the question. The son suggested to his relative an investment which he believed was profitable, and in which he had placed his own <em>fortune; </em>and the claimant acted on the suggestion with the single purpose of benefiting himself. Neither the son, by his letter advising the venture, nor'the father, by his indorsement of that advice, assumed any duty toward the claimant.” This is obviously a correct conclusion from the evidence in the case. There is no moral obliquity in the statement of an honest belief respecting a business enterprise, and no legal or moral obligation is created by it. It raises no duty which will constitute a sufficient consideration to support a promise.</p>

It is claimed that the words, “whether the stock is sold or not,” secured to the decedent an option to hold or sell the stock at his pleasure, and that this option constituted the consideration for the promise. But these words do not justify the inference that the decedent desired such an option, or to refrain from selling the stock when there should be a market for it. They are consistent with an immediate sale of the stock, and with an effort to comply with the request of the appellant respecting the sale of it. If the correspondence <a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>referred to created a contract relation between the parties to it, and bound the decedent to pay the appellant the price of the stock, or to see that Robert made him whole, a sale of the stock the next day, or an earnest effort to make a sale of it, would not have discharged the obligation. The promise on its face imports a guaranty, and within two weeks of its date Robert paid to the appellant one half the price of the stock, being the sum for which he had offered to sell it a month before. It is said, however, that the undertaking is original, because Robert was not bound to make the appellant whole. As we are of opinion that there is no consideration for the promise, and that the claim has neither legal nor equitable support, we need not discuss this question. Without further elaboration of the subject, we approve the decree of the Orphans’ Court, and the reasoning by which it is sustained.</p>
