But under the powers given in the act to boroughs, they have right to require property holders to keep the footwalks in front of their property in a safe condition for passing pedestrians. This is among the enumerated police powers of the borough. This footwalk was not in such condition ; it was “dangerous to the life and limbs of persons passing over it.” After notice and demand to repair it, and neglect or refusal so to do, the borough, in pursuance of express authority given in the act, constructed the footwalk, and now seeks to recover the amount, with the penalty also expressly authorized by the act.

The court below, however, holds that because the foot-walk which had previously been constructed along the defendant’s property was out of repair, the laying of a new footwalk and compelling the defendant to pay therefor was an exercise of the police power and not of the taxing power.

This is in no sense a tax ; it is a personal duty cast upon the lotowner, because of the benefit the construction and repair of a sidewalk is to him. The distinction between the roadway and the sidewalk, and the obligation of the lotowner respecting the latter, have been recognized and enforced in the earliest legislation on the subject and in numerous decisions: Greensburg Bor. v. Young, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20Pa.%20283" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="53 Pa. 283">53 Pa. 283</a>. This obligation is further recognized and enforced, in cases where the owner or lessee has been held liable for injuries arising from the want of repairs on sidewalks: Bears v.

Could the defendant claim exemption from liability for such injuries, under a clause in its charter exempting it from taxation ? These cases proceed upon the theory of a duty in the lot owner to keep the sidewalk in safe condition. Moreover, the sidewalk is regarded practically as a part of the house fronting on it: Prot.

L. 158, exempting charitable institutions from taxation, repeals the provisions of the borough act of 1851 respecting the laying of sidewalks in boroughs. There are no repealing clauses, nor is a repeal produced by necessary implication. The use of the terms “taxation” in the defendant’s charter, and “borough tax ” in the act of 1874, means that the defendant shall be exempt from such taxes as the borough is empowered to levy and collect. A tax is an impost for the support of government: Pray v. Northern Liberties, <a href="/pa/31/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="31 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="985095" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0069-01">31 Pa. 69</a>. No tax can be levied by the borough for the laying of sidewalks. The only way they can be laid is by the lotowners. The collection of the cost of them by the borough, when the lotowners refuse to lay them, is but incidental to the duty of the owners to construct them. An exemption from borough taxes cannot relieve from that duty.</p>

    <p id="b140-6" data-blocks='[["BL_140.7",140,[279,1719,1169,185]]]'>The fourth section of the charter of the defendant says: “All the estates and properties of the corporation hereby created, shall be free from taxation : ” Act 25th March, 1871, P. L. 452.</p>
    <p id="b140-7" data-blocks='[["BL_140.8",140,[276,1922,1172,449]],["BL_141.1",141,[169,361,1165,190]]]'>It appears from the case stated that the defendant owns certain real estate in the borough of Wilkinsburg; that the foot-walk adjoining said land on Coal street was in such a state of decay as to be dangerous; that the borough council, by resolution, directed the defendant to lay a new footwalk in front of its said property in accordance with the ordinances and general regulations of said borough, of which resolution the defendant had due notice ; that the defendant neglected and refused to construct said footwalk, whereupon the borough proceeded to <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>do so, and within the time required by law filed its claim against said property for the amount of work and material used in its construction, together with twenty per centum advance thereon.</p>
    <p id="b141-3" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[170,565,1165,965]]]'>It is conceded that this home is a charity, and that under the borough act of 1851 the burgess and council may require property owners to keep the footwalk or pavement in front of their property in good and safe condition for foot-passengers, and in default, after notice, the borough may cause it to be done, and collect the amount of expense, with twenty per centum penalty, from the owner. The precise question before us is, whether the defendant is exempt from this burden by reason of the clause in its charter above referred to. If the charge for laying this footwalk is a tax or a municipal assessment in the nature of a tax, we are of opinion the borough cannot recover. This principle was expressly ruled in Olive Cemetery Co. v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/93/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="93 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="442040" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0129-01">93 Pa. 129</a>. In that case the company was exempted by its charter “ from taxation except for state purposes.” A sewer was constructed on a street along the line of which were a number of burial lots, and an assessment was charged against said lots to defray, in part, the cost of the sewer. This was held by this court to be a species of local taxation, and within the exemption clause of the charter.</p>
    <p id="b141-4" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[172,1538,1163,861]],["BL_142.1",142,[271,362,1172,248]]]'>The defendant contends that this footwalk comes within the reason of the case cited, and that the charge for its construction is also a species of local taxation. We think there is a marked distinction between the two cases. In the case of borough foot-walks, the owners of property are required by law to keep their footways in repair, and if necessary, re-lay them. This is a duty imposed directly upon the property owner, and is in the nature of a police regulation. It is no more a tax, or a municipal assessment in the nature of a tax, than would be the imposition of any other duty by virtue of the police powers of the borough, with a penalty for its violation. This footway was a public nuisance, dangerous in its character; and the fact that the defendant is a charity, and exempt from taxation, does not authorize it to maintain a nuisance. It could be required to abate it precisely as in the case of any other corporation or individual. In the cemetery case, there was no police or other duty cast upon the company. It was not required to build the <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>sewer. It was constructed by the city under its power for that purpose, and the cost thereof charged to the property owners in pursuance of a recognized system of municipal assessments. Such assessments have been repeatedly held, to .be a species of taxation.</p>
    <p id="b142-5" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[271,618,1171,142]]]'>We regret, for the sake of this deserving charity, that we are unable to reach a different conclusion. The law is too plain, however, to admit of even a doubt.</p>
    <p id="b142-6" data-blocks='[["BL_142.5",142,[1033,770,364,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
