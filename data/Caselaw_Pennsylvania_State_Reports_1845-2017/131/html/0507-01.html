Christy, receiver of the Pittsburgh Savings Bank, as <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>shown by his account filed on July BO, 1887. The paper-books contained neither argument in support of the specifications oi error, nor any of the testimony presented to the court below, but it was stated that the facts found by the master in this proceeding were the same with those found by the auditor in the case preceding this, Christy v. Sill, ante, 492, with two exceptions : 1. There was no evidence that the parties contributing to the fund in the hands of G. W. Guthrie, trustee, had given public notice, by advertisement, of the sale and transfer of their shares in the bank; and 2. The master liquidated the claim of the city of Pittsburgh, and found as a fact that the same was a valid claim against said bank, and had been contracted after all the parties contributing to said fund had severed their connection therewith.</p>
