Devitt had the notes delivered up to him, and had given $400 iu oil in regard to that last note, and had given his other two notes for $800 each, making the balance of $1,600. Now, it is to be submitted to you, and that is the reason we are particular about it, it is to be submitted to you, whether that transaction was a payment of this $2,000 note by the giving up of the note on the part of Brown and Stanton to Devitt and the accepting of the other two notes of Devitt at different dates coming due at different times than the $2,000 note; one on April 7,1888, when the original note would become due on the 28 th of April, and the other running an entire year, that is until April 7, 1889. Now, was that new transaction a payment of this $2,000 note ? That has to be determined; because we say to you as a question of law that the mere giving of a note for an indebtedness does not pay the indebtedness, unless it is the intention of the parties that it should pay the indebtedness, or cancel it. Did they by that transaction; did Brown and Stanton, or did Devitt, between themselves, intend by the surrender of the $2,000 note and the accepting of the two $800 notes and the crediting of the $400 on the $2,000 note, did they intend that that should be a payment of that $2,000 note ?

They have a right to proceed upon these two notes and collect them. They are judgment notes and might be entered and an execution issued upon them.

Did these parties do all that they should have done, so far as Mr. Fletcher is concerned? They surrendered these notes, they went then to the pipe line company, and they transferred or delivered over to Devitt all the oil or all the right to the oil that they had reserved in their original contract. They were to have that oil run to their own credit. Mr. Fletcher had a right to see that on the pipe line books, and to expect that that oil would be run in the name of Brown and Stanton. He had a right to expect that it would be credited from time to time on the notes, but on the 14th of May when he got the wells, by that time there had been a transfer made on the books of the pipe line company, and the wells had been transferred and their product had been transferred over to Devitt. Now, then, Devitt comes to Fletcher with these notes surrendered to him; and with the transfer, and we do not know whether he did or did not, but it was transferred in the pipe line company; I don’t remember whether the evidence shows that he did or did not; the jury will remember; but on the 14th or before the 14th of May, 1888, this oil had been transferred in the pipe lines to Devitt, and Brown and Stanton had done that.

There is no proof of any agreement or intention that it should so operate. As Fletcher did not advance any money to Devitt for the lease, but took it for a pre-existing debt, he is not an innocent purchaser: Ashton’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=73%20Pa.%20162" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="73 Pa. 162">73 Pa. 162</a>; Kirkpatrick v.

He had notice, however, from the copy of the agreement on the back of which the assignment to him was written, to the terms and conditions of which that assignment was expressly made subject, that the title was to remain in the plaintiffs until all the purchase money was paid, and he had actual notice from Devitt that $1,600 of it remained unpaid. The change in the notes and in the running of the oil, therefore, would not and could not deceive him.</p>

In submitting to the jury, in the answer to the defendant’s third point, whether Brown and Stanton had made an absolute sale in October, 1887, of their entire interest in the lease, the court was in error. The agreement positively provided that no <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>title should pass until the entire purchase money was paid in full. Whether it was an absolute sale was not a question for the jury, but one which the court should have settled by refusing the point and instructing the jury in accordance with the language of the contract. From the papers and proofs in the case, the plaintiffs should have recovered a verdict, to be released upon the payment of the $800 due April 28, 1888, with its interest. That the jury did not render such a verdict is due, we believe, to the fact that the answers to the defendants’ points confused or misled them. They could easily be confused by the manner in which the points were answered.</p>

Under the agreement of April 28, 1817, the failure to pay the purchase money did not give Brown and Stanton the right of possession. The agreement gave them only the right to have the oil run to their credit, to be applied by them on the $2,000 note. The whole working interest in the lease having been transferred to Devitt in October, 1887, the plaintiffs, at the time the suit was brought, were entitled neither to the possession nor to the oil.</p>

The transaction of October 7, 1887, was a clear case of novation, and the plaintiffs, after the purchase money notes mentioned in the article of agreement had been paid and delivered up to the vendee, could not maintain ejectment to enforce the payment of other notes, given at a date subsequent to the article, in a different transaction, upon a new consideration, for a different amount, and running for a longer time. As in the case of a married woman’s purchase money note, the plaintiffs can enforce payment only if the purchase and the note constitute one and the same transaction: Christner v.

Fletcher found all the notes, upon payment of which the title was to pass under the article, in Devitt’s' possession. He also found that the oil which was to have been run to the plaintiffs’ credit till the notes were paid, was being run to Devitt’s credit. He was thus deceived by the plaintiffs’ conduct and led to take the lease and satisfy his indebtedness against Devitt. It is therefore inequitable to sustain this action against Fletcher.</p>

In this agreement the plaintiffs were the vendors, and defendant Devitt, under whom defendant Fletcher claims title, was the vendee. The purchase money was $5,000, payable in instalments, for which judgment notes of the vendee were given. The agreement provided that the title to the property should not pass to the vendee until the full amount of the purchase money was paid. It also contained a provision that the oil produced from the well on the premises should be run in the pipe lines to the credit of the vendors, and that the vendee should receive credit for it on the last instalment. On October 7,1887, it was ascertained by the'parties that the vendee was entitled to a credit of $400 for the oil so run, and, applying this on the last instalment, there was a balance of $1,600 of the purchase money unpaid. This balance, by the terms of the contract, was payable, on April 28, 1888. The vendee requested the vendors to extend payment of this balance one year, and it was finally agreed between them. that one half of it should be paid in six months, and the remainder in eighteen months. The $2,000 note, which had been given for the last instalment, was then surrendered, and two notes of the vendee of $800 each, payable according to the agreement of extension, were substituted for it. The vendors then gave to the vendee an order on the pipe line company to allow all the <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>oil to be run in bis name. By this arrangement tbe vendors relinquished their right to have the oil run in the pipe lines to their credit, and extended the payment of $800 one year. In all other respects the agreement remained in force as written. It is not claimed by either party to this transaction that there was any agreement by the vendors to accept the new notes as payment, or to release the leasehold from the lieu for purchase money.</p>
    <p id="b489-5" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[153,795,1174,1076]]]'>On May 14, 1888, Devitt assigned his interest in the land to Fletcher in payment of $1,250 which he then owed him, and subject to the terms of his written agreement with Brown and Stanton. It is contended that if Fletcher was induced to purchase the property by an honest belief, derived from the possession of the original notes by Devitt, and from the order given by Brown and Stahton on the pipe line company, that the purchase money was in fact paid, this suit cannot be maintained. It must be conceded, however, that if he knew the purchase money was not paid, his belief that the lien for it was destroyed by the substitution of the new notes, and the order on the pipe line company, would not avail him as a defence to the action. A party who has knowledge of the facts is affected with notice of their legal consequences, and his misapprehension of these affords him no protection. But Fletcher was a creditor of Devitt, and received the assignment of the contract on account of his claim. He stands upon no higher footing than his assignor. In the language of Chief Justice Gibson in Watson v. Willard, <a href="/pa/9/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="9 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="960791" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0089-01">9 Pa. 89</a>: “Nothing is payment to enlarge the equitable estate of a vendee for the benefit of his creditors, which is not equally payment to enlarge it for the benefit of himself.”</p>
    <p id="b489-6" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[151,1880,1174,506]]]'>The action of ejectment is an appropriate remedy by a vendor against a vendee, or his assignee, to enforce payment of the purchase money due on an executory agreement for the sale of land. It will lie where there is default in payment of the interest or an instalment of the principal. The vendor need not wait until the last instalment of the principal falls due before he brings his action, but may proceed on the first default. It follows from what has been said, that this action may be maintained to enforce payment of the purchase money due and payable at the time it was brought.</p>
    <p id="b489-7" data-blocks='[["BL_489.6",489,[195,2394,1125,44]],["BL_490.1",490,[275,384,1182,558]]]'>There was nothing on which to base a finding that any oil <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>was run to the credit of the vendors which was not applied on the purchase money by their agreement with their vendee on the 7th of October, 1887. The plaintiffs sold the leasehold to defendant Devitt on April 28, 1887, by the written agreement which was the basis of this action; and there is no evidence of any modification of it, except in the particulars hereinbefore mentioned. It is not claimed that anything passed between the parties to this agreement with reference to it, or the land embraced in it, after October 7, 1887. It was therefore error to allow the jury to find that the plaintiffs had sold their interest in the property subsequent to the date of the written contract.</p>
