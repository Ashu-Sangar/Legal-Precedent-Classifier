    <p class="summary" id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[191,614,1174,201]]]'>On October 27, 1889, Anna May Neely, by her next friend, filed a libel for divorce a vinculo matrimonii. Testimony taken before an examiner having been considered, the court, White, J., filed the following opinion and decree :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b577-6" data-blocks='[["BL_577.6",577,[190,822,1178,705]]]'>The divorce is asked for on the ground of desertion. The act of assembly says, “ wilful and malicious desertion and absence from the habitation of the other without a reasonable cause for two years.” The evidence does not establish such a case. It does not even raise a presumption that his going away with his sister was a “ wilful and malicious desertion.” The fair inference from the testimony is that he was taken away by his sister and brothers because he was sick. Nor does it appear that he has wilfully refused to support his family ; rather, that he is sickly and unable to do so. Sickness or inability to support the wife is no ground for divorce. The very meagre and indefinite character of the testimony confirms the view that it was not a “ wilful and malicious desertion .....without a reasonable cause.”</p>
