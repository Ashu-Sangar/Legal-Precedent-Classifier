    <p class="summary" id="b258-11" data-blocks='[["BL_258.7",258,[264,1577,1175,711]]]'>This action is brought by Holmes &amp; Sons against Briggs &amp; Drum for the recovery of a certain amount of money due upon a draft sent to them for collection. The action is not directly upon this check, but for the money which is alleged to be due from Briggs &amp; Drum upon a draft held at that time by Holmes &amp; Sons. There is no dispute as to the fact that this draft was drawn by some person upon Briggs &amp; Drum and sent to Holmes &amp; Sons, who held it and had a right to receive the money. Nor is there any dispute that Briggs &amp; Drum owed the money upon that draft. But they allege that it was paid, and that is the only question- in this case for your determination.' Was the draft paid ? If it was not, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the balance remaining unpaid upon that draft, of which you will have a statement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b258-12" data-blocks='[["BL_258.8",258,[299,2293,1138,96]],["BL_259.1",259,[167,358,1180,2102]]]'>not alleged that this draft was paid in any other way he delivery to Holmes &amp; Sons of the check which has <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>been shown to you. That cheek is what is called a cashier’s check, of the Penn Bank; and it is used as the equivalent of a certified check, the banks sometimes certifying the check, sometimes taking up the check and giving a cashier’s check instead of certifying; and it amounts to the same thing. It is an assumption, in other words, by the bank instead of the individual of the liability; but being the check of a third person, the presumption of law is that it is taken simply as a conditional payment, that is, if the check be paid, then the debt will be paid; if not, otherwise. This being the presumption in the case, when the plaintiffs rested, after having shown the fact that this draft was held by Holmes &amp; Sons, and Briggs &amp; Drum had been called upon for payment and had delivered to them this dishonored check and taken up the draft, there was nothing in the case to show payment under the law, the presumption being that that check was taken as conditional and not as absolute payment. [Therefore, the burden of proof was upon the defendant to show that that check was given by Briggs &amp; Drum and accepted by Holmes &amp; Sons as payment; and if so, then your verdict should be for defendants. That is the only question in this case, and that is a question of fact. It is a question of the intention of the parties. When this check was delivered over to Holmes &amp; Sons, did Briggs &amp; Drum intend to give it, and Holmes &amp; Sons to receive it, as payment of the indebtedness that they then owed? You have all the facts connected with the matter in evidence, and from them you must find that the weight of evidence is that it was accepted by Holmes &amp; Sons as payment, and that they did not intend further to look to Briggs &amp; Drum, but took this check of the Penn Bank in payment and satisfaction of their obligation.] 3 I do not propose to go over the testimony in this case. You have the testimony of Mr. Drum as to what occurred in relation to this matter when he presented a check to Holmes &amp; Sons in payment of a preceding draft. He states that after that it was their universal custom to pay all drafts at Holmes &amp; Sons with checks similar to this; that they were received by them, and there was never any question about them, because, the Penn Bank remaining good, he presumed they had all been paid, at least they had never heard anything more about them, but that they did, from that time on, receive these checks in this way, and delivered up the drafts which they held.</p>

The word “ absolute,” of course, was not used; but the word “payment” was used. That is not necessarily absolute or conditional, but it may be determined by you from the circumstances, whether it was intended to be absolute payment. If so, then as I say, your verdict should be for the defendants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[275,828,1184,1124]]]'>There is another fact in the case; that is, that after this check was dishonored by the Penn Bank, it was held for some time by Holmes <em>&amp; </em>Sons without any demand upon Briggs &amp; Drum for the payment of it. That is a fact which you have a right to consider in connection with the other circumstances in the case. That alone perhaps might not have much weight with you, but you will take it in connection with the testimony of Mr. Drum as to what was said and what was done after the conversation in relation to how these things should be paid. There is another fact that has been referred to; and that is, the presentation of this check to the assignee of the Penn Bank by Holmes &amp; Sons, and their receiving a dividend upon it. That is a fact that you will consider along with the others, but in my judgment it has very little bearing, because, as stated by counsel, if they went to Briggs &amp;■ Drum to have this matter settled, and it was not settled, and they still held possession of the check, it was their duty to the defendants, if they were going to hold them liable, to present it and get what they could out of it. I do not think there is much in that particular fact. However, that is all for you. But you must be satisfied from all the circumstances that this check was received by Holmes &amp; Sons as payment.</p>

The direction to pay with the cashier’s check came from Plolmes &amp; Sons.

It is contended that the learned judge erred in confining the jury to the consideration of the single question, “Was the cheek given and received as money ? ” and in charging that the burden of proving it was so received was on defendants. As to the burden of proof, he was clearly right. The question of fact, to which the attention of the jury was specially directed, was the only issue presented by the evidence. If there had been any testimony tending to show that defendants were in any way injured by the failure of plaintiffs to promptly give notice of nonpayment of the check, etc., it would have been error to have excluded it from the consideration of the jury; but there was none. The defendants were not parties to the check, either as drawers, payees, or indorsers. According to. the law merchant, they were not strictly entitled to notice of dishonor, and have no just reason to complain of delay in giving them notice, unless they were prepared to show that they had actually sustained loss or damage by the omission of plaintiffs to notify them : Benj. on Sales, <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>supra; Hunter v.

It is there said: “If paper be transferred, by delivery only, as security for a pre-existing debt, and it is dishonored while in the transferee’s hands, it affects in no way the debt it was intended to secure. The original liability remains wbat it was; and upon dishonor of the paper, it was not even necessary to give him notice thereof as an indorser. The authorities are somewhat confused on that point; but the rule of law is, undoubtedly, that tbe debtor is not entitled to any technical notice, but may show, in defence, any injury be has sustained by tbe actual laches of the creditor.”</p>
