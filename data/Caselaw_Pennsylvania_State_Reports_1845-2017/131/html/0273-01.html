This is simply the application of the principle that a judgment of any court having jurisdiction, is conclusive of the matters adjudicated, as between the parties and privies. But in order to make the judgment conclusive it must appear that the issues are the same, and involve substantially the same state of facts, and that the decision was upon the merits of the case. Such does not appear to be the case here. The bill filed is for the purpose of restraining the plaintiff at No. 680 June Term 1874, from proceeding to execute in this county a testatum fieri facias upon a judgment entered in Westmoreland county upon exemplification from this county, or any execution process upon the judgment in this county. The matter adjudicated by the court upon petition at No. 680 June Term 1874, which is claimed to be a bar, was an application to open the original judgment and permit the defendant to plead the discharge in bankruptcy. It is very clear that these are not the same issues. A state of facts might exist which would justify the restraining of execution, which would not authorize the opening of a judgment. It might be that the court would say, “ As there was no fraud, and the judgment was obtained after a legal trial, it cannot be opened,” and at the same time say, “if the execution were based upon a judgment within our control we would stay it without hesitation.” The court is therefore of opinion that the order of the court at No. 680 June Term 1874, discharging the rule to open the judgment in that ease, is not a bar to proceedings in equity to restrain execution for the same debt.</p>

The court below dismissed the bill, saying: “We decide that a bill to declare the judgment void, and restrain the execution of it, will not be entertained before the refusal or discharge of a rule to open the judgment.” This judgment was reversed, Justice Clark saying: “The court below, as a court of equity, of course has no power to interfere with the records of the Common Pleas as a court of law.....

We would probably restrain' proceedings until an opportunity was afforded for appropriate action in the proper court of that county. But under the circumstances of this case, we do not regard it as a breach of comity to proceed to a final determination of the matter. The original judgment is in this court, and the proceedings in Westmoreland county are ancillary to it, and for the purpose of enforcing its obligations. “ It is not. then a very judgment of the court to which it has been transferred, but a quasi judgment, and that too only for limited purposes: ” Brandt’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Pa.%20843" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="16 Pa. 843">16 Pa. 843</a>. It remains a judgment of the court in wMeh it was first entered. The act of assembly, therefore, gives no authority to transfer it from the court to wlfich it has been transferred, for the reason that it is not a judgment of that court: Mellon v. Guthrie, <a href="/pa/51/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="51 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="999767" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0116-01">51 Pa. 116</a>. A judgment that is transferred from one county to another, under the act of April 16, 1840, bears a very strong analogy to a testatum execution. It is transferred only to facilitate its enforcement, but with a right to all the writs of scire facias that may be needed for that purpose. The primary judgment is still the principal one: ” King v. Nimick, <a href="/pa/34/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="34 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="417958" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0297-01">34 Pa. 297</a>.

King, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Grant%20256" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="2 Grant 256">2 Gr. 256</a>. The logical conclusion from these cases is, that being transferred for purposes of execution only, a revival of the transferred judgment would merely continue the lien, and would not create a new judgment independent of the original.</p>

It is true that the courts of a county into which a testatum fieri facias is sent, have no power to directly interfere with its execution, but it is not so clear that where a party has <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>obtained judgment in one county, and voluntarily goes into another by such process, the courts of such county may not interfere in equity to prevent him from unjustly taking the property of a party resident there. But that is not this case. The defendant comes here to enforce payment of a judgment of the court which we are satisfied he has no right to demand, and it certainly should make no difference that he comes here by the way of Westmoreland county. The judgment being still the judgment of this court, we have the right to inquire into the process which emanates from it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[210,876,1167,1576]]]'>If, as we have held, the revived judgment in Westmoreland county is ancillary to the judgment in this county, the execution thereon must be also. The question may therefore arise as to the validity of such execution. If the transferred judgment cannot be transferred to another county, as held in Mellon v. Guthrie, <a href="/pa/51/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="51 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="999767" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0116-01">51 Pa. 116</a>, it is at least doubtful whether a testatum execution will lie upon such transferred judgment. The act of Juno 16,1886, § 76, P. L. 775, authorizes a testatum fieri facias where the defendant “ has no real or personal estate in the county where such judgment may be obtained.” If the transferred judgment is, not a judgment of the county to which it is transferred, as held in Mellon v. Guthrie, it would not come within the provision of the act of 1836. But if the act authorizes a writ of testatum fieri facias upon a transferred judgment, it surely cannot be allowed to come into the county in which the original judgment was obtained. To do so would produce great confusion. It is the duty of the prothonotary, upon receipt of such a writ, to enter the same of record, and thereupon it becomes a lien upon the real estate of the defendant. So there would be two liens for the same debt in the same court. Upon the expiration of one, the other might continue, and the lien of the original debt be continued for ten years without reviva]. But, further, the writ is then returned to the sheriff for execution. If an execution were issued upon the original judgment, the court in which it was entered would have control of it; but if transferred to another county and a testatum fieri facias returned, we would have the anomaly of a process in the hands of the sheriff of the county, for execution of a judgment of the court of the county over which the court had no control. Such could not have been intended by the legislature and ought not to be recognized by the courts.</p>

The certificate of discharge, by its express terms, affected no debts which were not in existence on October 18, 1873, when the petition for adjudication was filed, and which were provable against, the bankrupt’s estate. But the original judgment in this ease was recovered on June 6, 1874, several months after the petition for adjudication was filed, and, according to Wise’s App., <a href="/pa/99/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="99 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="446052" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0193-01">99 Pa. 193</a>, the original debt was merged in the judgment, and the certificate of discharge, subsequently granted, could not be set up as a defence to it.</p>

The act makes no distinction between the original and the transferred judgment, as to the form or kind of executions to be issued thereon, but makes them both alike in that respect, as well as in respect to lien and revival.

The judgment of revival in Westmoreland county was had on the return of two niliils, of which the defendant there (plaintiff here) had no actual notice. While such judgment is good if undisputed, it will always be relieved against when the defendant makes prompt application and shows a meritorious defence. Nor is the judgment of revival a new judgment. “ It is a common, plain, familiar principle, that a scire facias to revive a judgment, post annum et diem, is but a continuation of the original action, and the execution thereon is an execution on the former judgment: ” Irwin v.

Our position that a testatum fieri facias cannot issue, in the case of a transferred judgment, on any other than the original judgment, is sustained by reason and authority. The act of April 16, 1840, P.

This view is sustained by Brandt’s App., <a href="/pa/16/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="16 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="410136" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0343-01">16 Pa. 343</a>; Baker v.

A judgment transferred to another county is not the judgment of that court: Mellon v.

Nor is a testatum execution upon it within the definition by 1 T. &amp; H. Pr., 3d ed., 782: “A writ issued into another county than that in which the judgment is.” The object of the act of 1840 was to furnish a remedy “ in addition to the remedies now provided by law.” Such writ of testatum fieri facias is not an additional remedy.</p>

In 1873, and for some time prior thereto, Blackmore and Nelson were engaged in business as partners. They owed William C. Guffey for goods sold prior to October 18, 1873, and he obtained judgment in the Common Pleas of Allegheny county, No. 1, on an award of arbitrators, for $9,652.64. Judgment was entered on the award on June 6, 1874. On July 7, 1874, a copy of the record of the judgment so obtained was filed in Westmoreland county, under the provisions of the act of April 16, 1840, P. L. 410, and a writ of fieri facias issued thereon, under which a levy on personal property of Blackmore &amp; Nelson was made. But proceedings in involuntary bankruptcy had been begun against Blackmore &amp; Nelson, by their creditors, on October 18, 1873, and on August 23, 1874, the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania issued an injunction to the sheriff of Westmoreland, restraining all proceedings under the fieri <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>facias against the goods of Blackmore &amp; Nelson. They were adjudged bankrupts on October 29th following, and on February 12, 1879, William Nelson obtained his discharge as a bankrupt from all debts in existence on October 18, 1878, when proceedings in bankruptcy were begun. We see no reason to doubt that this discharge was operative upon Mr. Guffey’s judgment, and we conclude that he saw none, for it was allowed to sleep for thirteen years. In January, 1887, he caused a scire facias to issue in Westmoreland, and an alias scire facias was issued in February. Both were returned nihil habet, and a judgment was regularly obtained against Nelson on two returns of nihil for $12,444.94. On this judgment a writ of testatum fieri facias was issued to the sheriff of Allegheny county, upon which a levy was made on Nelson’s property in that county. Instead of going to Westmoreland county, and moving to set aside the writ and open the judgment by default, Nelson applied to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny county, No. 1, in which the judgment had been originally-obtained, to open the judgment entered upon the award of arbitrators in 1874. This was refused on June 14, 1887, and on the 20th of the same month this bill was filed. The case was heard on bill and answer, and while an injunction was refused as against the sheriff who held the writ, it was awarcled against Guffey, the plaintiff therein, and made perpetual. This decree is the error assigned.</p>

It has been accordingly held that the judgment entered in the county to which the record is transferred does not become a judgment, in the common interpretation of the word, of the county in which it is entered. It is record evidence of the existence of the judgment in the county where it was obtained : Brandt’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Pa.%20843" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="16 Pa. 843">16 Pa. 843</a>. The court to which it is transferred has no power over it, except for purposes of execution, and cannot inquire into its validity, or make any order affecting its operation: King v. Nimick, <a href="/pa/34/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="34 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="417958" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0297-01">34 Pa. 297</a>; nor can it be transferred, by means of a full copy of the record, to another county from that in which such derivative judgment has been entered: Mellon v. Guthrie, <a href="/pa/51/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="51 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="999767" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0116-01">51 Pa. 116</a>. The plaintiff cannot have two writs of fieri facias running at the same time. The remedy given by the act of 1840 is additional, but it is not concurrent. So long, therefore, as a writ of fieri facias is outstanding on the original judgment, the plaintiff is not entitled to issue a writ upon the transferred judgment. The court in which the judgment was entered loses none of its jurisdiction or power by the transfer, and, if the original judgment be set aside for any reason, the judgment entered in another county falls with it: Baker v. King, <a href="/grant/2/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="2 Grant 254" data-case-ids="227738" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0254-01">2 Gr. 254</a>; Brandt’s Appeal, supra. It is thus apparent that the proceeding in the county to which the record is transferred is ancillary and dependent. The original power of the court in which the judgment was entered is not restrained or modified in the slightest degree by the transfer, nor by any proceedings based upon the copy of record filed in another county. The transfer is for purposes of lien and execution only, and the judgment, when revived in the county to which It is transferred, does not rise above its source, or confer any other power than that which the filing of the copy of record conferred. For all purposes, except execution, the original judgment continues to be the measure of the plaintiff’s demand against the defendant, and the evidence of what has been passed upon by the court. All inquiries into its regularity or effect, and all applications for relief from its operations, must be made to the court that pronounced it. The derivative judgment is the basis of process in the county in which it is entered. The regularity and execution of such process must <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>be determined by the court that issues it, but its control extends no further than its own process.</p>
    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[275,452,1185,1022]]]'>We come now to inquire into the power of the courts of Westmoreland county to issue a testatum fieri facias upon the derivative judgment. The power to issue a testatum fieri facias is given by the act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 775. The section, so far as is material, is as follows: “Section 76. If the defendant in any judgment for the recovery of money shall have no real or personal estate in the county where such judgment may be obtained, it shall be lawful for the plaintiff, upon his own suggestion of that fact, verified by affidavit, without any previous writ* to have a testatum writ of fieri facias directed to the sheriff or coroner of any other county where the defendant may have real or personal estate, which shall be made returnable into the court from which it shall issue.” It is then made the duty of the sheriff to whom the testatum writ is directed to deliver it at once to the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas of his county, and the prothonotary is thereupon required to enter the same of record, and re-deliver it to the sheriff to be executed. The entry so made is to be a lien, for five years from the date of entry, on all the real estate of the defendant in the county.</p>
    <p id="b314-6" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[273,1481,1184,916]],["BL_315.1",315,[171,333,1167,966]]]'>Looking, now, at these several provisions, in their relation to each other, to the judgment on which the writ issues, and to the power of the court in which it was obtained to control it as the ends of justice may require, we are led to the conclusion that a testatum fieri facias should issue on the original, and not on the ancillary judgment. The plaintiff, if desirous to reach property of the defendant in another county than that in which his judgment is obtained, has an election whether to proceed by testatum fieri facias, or to transfer his judgment for purposes of execution by filing a copy of the record in such other county. He may take as many copies of his original judgment as he may need, and file them in as many different counties, but he cannot take a copy of record of one of the transferred judgments and make that the basis of a new transfer: Mellon v. Guthrie, <a href="/pa/51/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="51 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="999767" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0116-01">51 Pa. 116</a>; and for the same reasons he cannot transfer the lien of such ancillary judgment by a testatum fieri facias. If this could be done, the rule in Mellon v. Guthrie, <a href="/pa/51/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="51 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="999767" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0116-01">supra,</a> would not only be rendered useless, and the lien.of the ancillary <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>judgment be extended into the county to which the testatum is issued, but the court would have the control of its process in the county to which it goes, to the entire exclusion of the proper courts of that county. As the judgment on two nihils did not interfere in any manner with the complete control of the courts of Allegheny county over the judgment, it conferred no powers on the courts of Westmoreland which the filing of the copy of record did not give them. As the courts of that county could not send their process into Allegheny county for the collection of this judgment before the revival, they could not do so afterward. If they could, the result would be that the defendant would be deprived of the protection, and the courts of Allegheny county of the control over the judgment and its collection, which the law secures to them. The consequence of the application of these rules is that the issuing of the testatum fieri facias was unauthorized. It must be set aside by the court that issued it. That court has ample power in the premises, and its duty is so plain that we will not doubt its readiness to perform it on application.</p>
    <p id="b315-4" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[173,1307,1165,1063]],["BL_316.1",316,[272,335,1176,249]]]'>What, then, will be the situation? The original judgment remains in, and under the control of the courts of Allegheny county, as fully as at any time since it was obtained. The ancillary judgment, with the judgment of revival, remains in, and under the control of the courts of Westmoreland. If the courts of Allegheny hold that the judgment is paid by the discharge in bankruptcy, the courts of Westmoreland are bound by such holding. If satisfied that the judgment by default should be opened, the courts of Westmoreland should make the proper order, and permit the defendant to be heard upon any valid reason he has to allege why execution should not issue against him. There is thus a clear and an adequate remedy at law for the defendant’s protection, and he must resort to it. Upon the facts stated in the bill and answer, the proper course to pursue is obvious. It is not to enjoin the plaintiff against proceeding with his testatum, — a writ wholly unauthorized, — but to send the defendant in the writ to the court that incautiously issued it, to move that it be quashed. The courts of Allegheny county have power to stay the hand of their officer temporarily, to afford the defendant time to make his application in Westmoreland, and should not hesitate to <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>exercise it. Whether they might not treat it as a nullity, and stay proceedings upon it absolutely, it is not necessary now to determine. The orderly practice is to allow the court that issued the writ to correct its mistake by quashing it, as having been issued without authority.</p>
    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[273,590,1175,606]]]'>The effect of the discharge in bankruptcy is not before us in the view we have taken of the case. It was, however, considered by the court below, and has been discussed by counsel. We see no reason to doubt that the defendant’s demand is extinguished by operation of the proceedings in bankruptcy, as the question is now presented to us; but as our conclusions are against the plaintiff in this bill, so far as his right to an injunction on the facts presented by it is concerned, we cannot undertake to dispose of that question. We hold that the case presented is not one for equitable relief, but one in which the remedy at law is plain, adequate, and within easy reach, and to it the plaintiff is remitted.</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.5",316,[534,1203,912,94]]]'>The decree of the court below is reversed, and bill dismissed, at the costs of the appellee.</p>
