    <p class="summary" id="b384-10" data-blocks='[["BL_384.8",384,[247,1429,1177,705]]]'>The charge of $15 by the trustees’ counsel for preparing and having their bond approved, is excessive; ten dollars is liberal compensation for these services. The services rendered in the collection of N. Peterman’s percentage were unnecessary. She was one of the heirs, and the trustees could have protected themselves on the distribution of the fund. The charge of $15 for these services is therefore disallowed, as are also the charges of $10 for preparing quit-claim of Mary Booth, and $10 for procuring her consent to amendment. These services Avere rendered by counsel as attorney conducting the partition proceedings, and the charges were made in the bill filed by him, in his application for a rehearing in regard to the fixing of his fee, and were considered by the court upon that application, as being included in the fee allowed him.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[194,453,1175,551]]]'>The terms of sale as to N. Peterman and W. S. Barton, could have been changed upon motions without petitions, and $10 is ample compensation for all the services necessary, for which there is charged $45. Twenty-five dollars is charged for preparing petition and obtaining an order amending return as to West. Penn. R. Co.; $10 is sufficient compensation for these services. The settlements made between some of the heirs and the trustees, for which $35 is charged, was for the benefit of the heirs who had become purchasers, and they should pay for any legal services necessary. This charge cannot therefore be allowed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b385-6" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[192,1021,1177,1178]]]'>The duty of having Robert McGregor’s recognizance filed and approved, did not devolve upon the trustees, and the charge of $15 for these services cannot be allowed. The charges made for preparing the deeds are sufficiently large to include the services necessary to have them acknowledged, for which $15 is charged. This is not therefore allowed. One hundred dollars is charged for the services of counsel in attending four sales. It was not shown that there was any necessity for their attendance at these sales, and no allowance can be made for it. It would be necessary, however, for them to give general advice and instructions in regard to them, and $50 will be allowed for it. It is not part of counsel’s duties to procure purchasers, and the charge of $10 for these services cannot be allowed. Ten dollars are charged for services recording mortgages and in re deed West. Penn. R. Co., and $20 for services in connection with purchase of West. Penn. R. Co. Nothing should be allowed for depositing mortgages in the recorder’s office for record, and as to the West. Penn. R. Co., purchase, the trustees have not yet accounted for the purchase money. The evidence does not show satisfactorily the value of the services, and it may bo if iiecessary, they were made so by the trustee’s negligence. These charges are therefore disallowed now, without prejudice to a claim being made therefor hereafter.</p>
