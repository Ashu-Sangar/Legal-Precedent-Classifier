The judgment notes upon which these judgments were entered were signed by the firm name, and by the names of Hetzel and Garrison, two of the three partners. John N. McFall, the other partner, being owner of the real estate upon which the business of the firm had been conducted, claimed $1,000 out of the proceeds of sale, for one year’s rent of the premises occupied by the firm, the said premises being owned by him. The court, without opinion filed, refused to order said sum to be paid to him, upon his petition setting forth the facts, whereupon he took this appeal, assigning the refusal of the order as error.</p>
