Plaintiffs might have offered for a money consideration to permit the defendant company to take the dwelling itself, which offer not being accepted would clearly not estop them from claiming equitable relief by injunction. The offer was made ■ by way of compromise and was not accepted, and for that reason cannot work as an estoppel. No authority is shown, outside the letter itself, for Barton &amp; Barton to make the proposed sale. The authority of attorney to bind client by way of agreement or compromise is not inferred, but must be proven. See Isaacs v.

To accomplish this purpose, the courts have extended the plain wording of the statute, “ dwelling-house,” to comprise so much of the curtilage as is requisite to afford the owner reasonable enjoyment of the house as a residence. The test is, not Whether the owner can be compensated in damages, nor whether the house has been rendered uninhabitable by reason of the land appropriated. Only that portion, however, of the curtilage is exempted from appropriation which is necessary to the enjoyment of the house, not that which is simply desirable and convenient, dependent on the will of the owner: Damon’s App.. <a href="/pa/119/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="119 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="558096" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0287-01">119 Pa. 287</a>.</p>

      <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>The test as to how much of the curtilage is protected seems to be, does the proposed appropriation interfere with the ordinary, proper and reasonable enjoyment of the premises as a dwelling, considering its location and surroundings ? In determining this question, the court has said that it must depend on the circumstances attending each particular case. In Swift’s Appeal above cited, “ the land to be taken is one corner of the rear end of the lot; it is one hundred and fifty-five feet from the nearest portion of the house.” “ It does not interfere with the use or enjoyment of any adjacent buildings or ornamental structures of any kind, nor with any shrubbery or beautiful lawn.” “ It in no manner prevents access to the street, nor causes any substantial objection to the building as a dwelling-house.” In Damon’s Appeal, also cited, it appears “ that the ground taken is not within the same inclosure,” and the master found that the ground taken “ was not a part of the curtilage.” “ That the railroad at its nearest point was more than one hundred feet from the dwelling, and does not materially interfere with access thereto.” “ Moreover, no outbuilding was taken.” “ The taking of out-buildings has never, in this commonwealth, at least, been held a violation of the prohibitive words of the act of 1849, and we do not mean to intimate that it would or should be so held. But the fact that none are taken, etc., increases the difficulty of the appellant in his contention.”</p>

As to the size of the lot in Swift’s Appeal, the lot was a Philadelphia city lot, one hundred feet by two hundred and twenty-five feet. In Damon’s Appeal, the property comprised forty acres, and was occupied as a country residence. In the present case the lot is forty feet by ninety-six feet, situated in the borough of Reynoldton, opposite Mc-Keesport, in this county. In Swift’s Appeal, the distance from the house to the proposed right of way was one hundred and fifty-five feet. In Damon’s Appeal, the distance from the house to the right of way was over one hundred feet. In the present case it is thirty-six feet. In Swift’s Appeal, the amount appropriated was 288 square feet. In the present case, the lot being about one sixth in size to that in Swift’s Appeal, 640 square feet is appropriated. In both the above cited cases, the <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>outbuildings were not interfered with. In the present case the outbuildings, coal-house, cow-shed, chicken-house and privy were moved toward the house a considerable distance, considering the depth of the lot.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b466-5" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[242,557,1194,1474]]]'>It is possibly true that the amount of land taken and the removal and re-location of the buildings would not in itself interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the dwelling, so as to bring the case within the prohibitive portion of the act. In Other words, the master is of the opinion that if the lot were simply curtailed by the appropriation made, sufficient would still remain to accommodate the buildings located upon it. In both the cases cited above, the court seems to have laid considerable stress upon the fact that access to the dwelling was not interfered with. In the present case, access to the buildings and to the lot itself, by means of the alley in the rear, is prevented by the appropriation for the purpose intended; and while it is true that plaintiffs could use the buildings for the same purpose for which they were used prior to the location of the railroad, by approaching them from the street in front, across the open side lot, yet it would be at the substantial destruction of the lot itself, cutting up the lot, destroying the grass and flowers. It seems to the master that the plaintiffs have the same right to be protected in the use of the alley in the rear, as they would have to the street in front; that one is as necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the dwelling as the other, the alley being the every-day entrance for the supplies of the house, and the fact that the lot fronting on the alley having originally, in all probability, been decisive of its selection for the dwelling. The location of the railroad within such close proximity as thirty-six feet of plaintiffs’ house, must of necessity be a constant menace to plaintiffs’ personal safety, their family’s and their property, much more than a mere inconvenience.</p>

It might reduce the size of a grass-plot, or require the removal of a flower-bed; but these are not necessary to the enjoyment of a house as a dwelling. They are generally regarded as desirable adjuncts to a home, but their existence in attractive form, usually, if not always, depends on the will and effort of the owner or occupant of the premises. The law regards that which is essential to the enjoyment of a dwelling, and not that which is merely ornamental and pleasant in its surroundings. The location of a railroad across a lot on which the owner has his dwelling-house, or upon grounds which constitute part of a valuable country-seat, is not in violation of the statute: Swift’s App., Ill Pa. 516; Damon’s App., <a href="/pa/119/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="119 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="558096" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0287-01">119 Pa. 287</a>. In determining what is essential to the reasonable use and enjoyment of a dwelling-house, the sentiments and attachments of the owner, springing from his own or his ancestors’ long-continued possession of it, cannot be taken into <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>account. The question is a practical one, and in the decision of it regard must be had to that which is necessary, rather than to that which is desirable and convenient and depends alone on the will of the owner: Damon’s Appeal, supra. In the cases cited the location of the railroad was sustained, but in each there was a reference to the fact that access to the property was not affected or materially impaired by it. This was, however, merely descriptive of the situation in those cases, and it did not lay down a rule that wherever a location interfered in any degree with the access to the dwelling-house it was prohibited. The only approach to many valuable residences in the cities and boroughs of the commonwealth is from the street in front of them, and yet a railroad may be located upon such street, and excavations or embankments may be made in the construction of such road, and the sole remedy of the owners of the lots is a proceeding under the act of February 19,1849, to recover compensation for any damages they may sustain. In the present case, access to the appellees’ lot from the rear is interfered with to no greater extent than if the road was located exclusively upon the alley.</p>
