        "text": "Per Curt am:\n\u2022 It was held in Saylor v. Bushong, 100 Pa. 23, that the holder of a check cannot maintain an action thereon in his own name against the drawees, though they have sufficient funds of the drawer, if they refuse to accept it. . This is familar law. It is claimed, however, that the case in hand does not come within this rule, for the reason that the check or order in controversy was for the entire balance due McCartney by the Dollar Savings Bank, upon which it was drawn, and that said order was an equitable assignment of the fund. If we treat it as an equitable assignment, it is clear that Maginn could not sue thereon in his own name. But there is a more serious difficulty in the way. The act of May 10,1881, P. L. 17, provides \u201c that no person within this state shall be charged, as an acceptor on a bill of exchange, draft, or order drawn for the payment of money, exceeding twenty dollars, unless his acceptance shall be in writing, signed by himself, or his lawful agent.\u201d The paper upon which this suit is brought is a draft or order for the payment of money exceeding twenty dollars, and there is no evidence that the bank on which it was drawn accepted it in writing. The act is plain in its terms, and is a flat bar to a recovery in this action.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Issue.\nAt tbe trial on May 22,1889, before Collier, J., the plaintiff testified that on July 19, 1887, he received the cheek in suit from James McCartney, stating the circumstances, under which he received it, as follows: \u201cHe told me he had money in the Dollar Savings Bank; he hadn\u2019t enough to satisfy the full claim, and I told him I would take what was there and give him fair time for the balance. He said he thought he had in all about enough, and he went down to the Dollar Savings Bank, and the gentleman behind the counter that had charge of the books, he had his book there, whether M\u2019Cartney carried the book there or not I do not know, and he had the book and went all through, and he had $681 in ; when M\u2019Cartney made a note (check) and I retained M\u2019Cartney\u2019s note, only the bank said they had to have some one to guarantee he was the party had the money there.\u201d\nHe further testified that the check was one of the bank checks; was obtained in the bank building, and that one of the persons in the bank in charge of the books told him that the check would become payable in seven weeks.\nH. F. McGrady testified for the plaintiff that he presented the check on the day that it became due, and that payment was refused on the ground that McCartney had notified the bank not to pay the check.\nAt the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony in chief, the court on motion of the defendant entered judgment of nonsuit, with leave, etc. A rule to show cause why the judgment of non-suit should not be lifted was subsequently discharged, and judgment having been entered on the verdict, the plaintiff took this appeal, assigning for error the orders entering the judgment of nonsuit and discharging the rule to show cause why the judgment should not be lifted.\nMr. If.
