Alberts, the contractor who had built the house in 1946. The latter was charged with negligence in laying the line which supplied gas to the house, and the gas company was charged with negligence in failing properly to inspect the gas line. The jury returned verdicts in favor of both the husband and wife plaintiffs against both defendants. The defendants have appealed.</p>

The examination at the explosion site of 21 Virginia Drive revealed that the pipe carrying gas from the main line into the Hemrock house had broken at a point one foot from the foundation wall. The break in the pipe localized at the threading of the coupling which, inspection demonstrated, was severely corroded. It appeared that the gas, which escaped from this break, moved through earthen interstices to the house wall, and into the closed house where it accumulated in quantity, awaiting the moment of rampage when it could find ignition. The pilot flame in the gas refrigerator supplied this incendiary cooperation and, in consequence, 21 Virginia Drive was no longer a house but a shambles.</p>

The plaintiffs submitted a formidable case for negligence on the part of both the Peoples Natural Gas Company and the contractor, W. W. Alberts. The record relates the story of how the consumer’s gas line was laid in the ground in 1946 at the time the house was constructed. <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>Experts testifying for the plaintiff pointed out that there was gross negligence iii laying the gas line in what is known as detritus soil.</p>

Geologists tell us, however, that there are some layers of subterranean soil which far from being stationary and unmovable, show themselves to be as unsteady as layers of some oriental cheeses which are in constant ferment because of vermiculose inhabitants. Such seems to be the nature of detritus soil, which moves and creeps, as a restless sleeper. And it was in this kind of soil that the telltale pipe in this case was laid, the movement of the soil being accentuated by the fact that here it lay on a 15% slope.</p>

The plaintiffs maintained that it was negligence in itself to place the coupling so close to the house wall. A proper regard for safety would have dictated a straight, unbroken pipe through the house wall and out toward the curb box.</p>

In time the filled-earth below impacted and the gas line sagged under the weight of the earth above it, all leading to the fatal break. The plaintiff contended that all this was foreseeable and, because of this foreseeability, the gas company was li<a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>able for the disaster which ensued, since the gas company had inspected the gas line after it was put into place and before gas was turned into it.</p>

Also, it claims, the company was not required by law to examine the soil tunnelled by the pipe. This is a rather apathetic appraisement of the duties resting upon the carrier of a highly dangerous substance. It would be like saying that the keeper of a zoo has only the responsibility of seeing that the tiger is placed in a cage with bars, unconcerned with whether the bars are made of steel or papier maché. Until the tiger leaps at the bars, the paper stockade of course will surround the tiger, but that stockade will be wholly useless, once the savage animal stirs. The responsibility of a gas company is to see to it that the highly inflammable commodity it is selling is contained within a casing, formidable enough to withstand the pressure or violence to which it could foreseeably be subjected. An automobile tire <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>is tested on a rough and rocky road, not on a ballroom floor.</p>

Certainly the appellant could not argue that it had performed its duty of inspection, only so long as it was satisfied that the pipe was strong enough to carry gas during the period of inspection but, in all likelihood, would suffer rapid deterioration and eventual breakage later.</p>

There, the gas company’s employees replaced a portion of the consumer’s line after a leak had been discovered. No complaint was made as to the manner in which the repair was accomplished. Later, an explosion occurred in a part of the line which had not been replaced. The gas company argued, in the ensuing litigation, that it could not possibly be liable for the resulting damage because it had made all the usual tests for gas at or near the point of the union, after making the repair, and there was no reason to believe that the pipe was defective. This Court, in sustaining a verdict for the injured plaintiff, said: “Defendant was obligated to go further, in view of the knowledge acquired of the condition of the pipe and the <em>character of the ground </em>in which it was laid, and to ascertain whether the corrosion extended to the remaining portion of the line, before turning gas into it and advising plaintiff ‘it was all right.’ ” (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[202,1591,1153,531]]]'>Our Court said further: “It is conceded by defendant in its brief that it knew at the time the work was done <em>lof the filled ground, </em>and that the adjacent pipe then looked to be corroded and in bad condition, then it might be said that possible future leaks could reasonably have been foreseen by it, and failure to shut off the gas or do further work was negligent.’ Such facts are disclosed by the record before us, and the jury was justified in finding that defendant was negligent.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

The test must be made by persons competent in the field under scrutiny. To the man on the street stone is stone and dirt is dirt, but there are geologists and engineers who can read books in stone, volumes in terrain, and to whom every little thread on a coupling unwinds an entrancing story not intelligible to the person stranger to the scientific technical world. To a lay person a coupling is a coupling, but the man versed in all the mechanical theories of stress and strain, can tell by examining a coupling or pipe, together with an analysis of the enveloping land and other applicable circumstances, how long such a coupling or pipe may safely carry an explosive substance. Did the gas company inspectors conduct the tests which would enlighten them on possible danger?</p>

That case had to do with an enormous <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>landslide which, caused the destruction of numerous houses in Stowe Township and the trial court found that the earth’s movement was due to the defendants’ negligent removal of lateral support from the hillside. Our Court said in review: “The real issue was whether the causation was a landslide or a creep, which is the slow and imperceptible downhill movement of land responding, as it does on any hillside in the world, to the force of gravity: creep is not great enough to damage structures built on the land.”</p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[205,884,1148,317]]]'>The question in this case is not whether the defendant’s house suffered annihilation because of excavation done by the defendants.

There were other features of the pipe laying which, apart from the detritus environment, caused the tragic break in the pipe. Emerson Tenable, a chemist and chemical engineer, was asked: “leaving aside for a moment detritus and directing your attention to filled ground, if a pipe is laid on top of fill, is there any particular hazard in connection with that pipe?” He replied: “Yes. What happens in laying it on fill is a matter of settlement in which the settlement goes downward underneath the pipe and the weight of the soil above eventually presses down on the pipe. Q. Was this dangerous and hazardous condition of the installation something that could be observed upon reasonable inspection before the line was covered? A. Yes. This would be apparent to any inspection — any inspector looking at the pipe.”</p>

What is usually done is not always the criterion of what should be done. If life would depend only on the hit-or-miss status quo, there would never be any improvement. Where explosive compounds are in play, the measure of care arises with the degree of hazard involved. The law on this subject was laid down with magisterial finality in <em>MaecDougall v. Penna,.

The care to be exercised in a particular case must always be proportionate to the seriousness of the consequences which are reasonably to be anticipated as a result of the conduct in question. Reason does not have to wait on usage; the latter must wait on reason. . . In the case of Zartner v.

If five successive lighted matches thrown into a gasoline barrel did not ignite its contents (because of wind currents, extraneous elements, pure fortuity, plus that indefinable unpredictable element known as chance or luck) this still would not proclaim the match-thrower a reasonable and prudent person.

In fact, Albert Eisner, the plumber testified: “Yes, I said if I had laid the line in that particular way then I had did a very bad job.

I said it was a bad job.” Kisner was somewhat equivocal in his testimony as to whether he had installed the culpable coupling. He finally said he was not certain. It is the position of the defendant gas company that at the time the pipe was inspected and approved in 1946, it did not have a coupling one foot away from the foundation wall of the house. The plaintiff produced four or five neighbors who lived in the immediate vicinity of the plaintiff’s house from the time it was constructed. They testified that during the period intervening between the original installation and the time of the accident, the ground had not been dug up, the only way in which, of course, the coupling could have been installed if it was not there in the original installation.</p>

The trial court clearly defined to the jury the role of proximate cause in the case, and the transcript of the record abundantly supports the jury’s findings in this respect. It need only be added here that the plaintiffs’ evidence does not have to be such as to preclude any other possible explanation for the mishap. We pointed out in <em>Smith v. Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/397/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="397 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1286264" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0134-01">397 Pa. 134</a>, that where circumstantial evidence is the foundation of a verdict, the successful plaintiff is entitled to keep his verdict if the circumstances are such that the jury could have reasonably inferred the facts necessary to establish liability: “It is not necessary, under Pennsylvania law, that every fact or circumstance point unerringly to liability; it is enough <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>that there be sufficient facts for the jury to say reasonably that the preponderance favors liability. . . The facts are for the jury in any case whether based upon direct or circumstantial evidence where a reasonable conclusion can be arrived at which would place liability on the defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[204,670,1149,1236]]]'>Finally, the defendant gas company charges the plaintiffs with contributory negligence. This is like blaming someone on earth for the eclipse of the moon. The defendant argues that in the ten years the plaintiffs lived in their house, they never did anything to ascertain what effect the soil movement was having on their gas pipe. There is no rule which requires a householder to dig up the ground around his house periodically to make certain that his gas and water pipes are operating perfectly. The plaintiffs purchased this house three years after the pipes had been laid. Neither the husband, a poorly-educated laborer, nor the modest housewife, was a geologist, logician, mathematician or clairvoyant. They had no way of knowing what could happen, they had no reason to believe that the gas company to which they regularly paid their bills might have been negligent in inspecting the conduits which brought them fuel for cooking and for heat. Even so, the trial court in its charge, which covered all the issues with the amplitude of a circus tent, and with the precision of an archer’s arrow, instructed the jury that if they found the plaintiffs guilty of contributory negligence they could not recover.</p>

Alberts, it is enough to say that if the gas company can be held liable for failing to note negligent construction, the contractor is certainly responsible for causing that negligent construction. In any event, as stated by the lower court, “there was ample testimony from which the jury could have found that he [the contractor] participated in the laying of a defective line in a negligent <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>manner, that he failed to make a reasonable inspection of the finished line, and that he thus accepted a hazardous installation for use as a line to transport a highly dangerous substance.”</p>
