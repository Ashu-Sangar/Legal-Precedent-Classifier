Further, where the trial or plea proceedings record fails to affirmatively show that the accused was offered counsel and declined such assistance, the burden is upon the Commonwealth to show that such assistance was intelligently and understandingly waived: <em>Carnley v.

However, the court records disclose, that on the district attorney’s bills of indictment, Fair-man signed the following printed statement, “And now to wit: The second day of January, A.D. 1961, the defendant pleads guilty, waiving grand jury action and right to counsel.”</p>
    <p id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[128,1178,1154,753]]]'>At the habeas corpus hearing, Fairman testified, that on January 2, 1961, he was indigent; that at no time before or during the plea proceedings was he advised of his right to be represented by counsel, or did anyone offer to appoint counsel to assist him. The record discloses that the only testimony offered in refutation was that of the district attorney at the time the guilty pleas were entered. The district attorney testified that he did not remember the Fairman case specifically, but in every case it was his practice to advise an uncounseled defendant of Ms right to have an attorney, and if he were without means to secure such assistance, the court would appoint counsel to represent him.</p>

The signed written statement of the guilty plea, including a waiver of counsel and presentment to the grand jury, is not in itself sufficient to establish an <em>intelligent </em>and <em>understanding </em>waiver. See, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Ross v. Botula, </em><a href="/pa-super/206/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="206 Pa.

Nor are we persuaded that the testimony of the district attorney, considered with the signed printed waiver, is sufficient to meet the Commonwealth’s clear burden of proving that <em>this particular defendant </em>was fully apprised of his constitutional rights at this very critical stage in the prosecution.</p>
    <p id="b180-4" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[212,960,1151,803]]]'>We note that the trial judge who also presided in the habeas corpus action does state in the opinion filed in support of the dismissal of the action, that he distinctly remembers the district attorney advising Fair-man of his right to counsel at the time the plea was entered. Since the present action was instituted and heard in the court below prior to the effective date (March 1, 1966) of the Post Conviction Hearing Act (P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. §§1180-1 to 1180-14)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> that legislation does not control herein. Moreover, even if the statement of the trial judge were to be considered a “certificate” as contemplated by the Act of 1966, supra, it was not received nor offered as evidence at the hearing on the petition. Hence it may not be considered as part of the record of that hearing.</p>

The whole present problem could have been avoided if this procedure had been followed and an adequate record effected. See, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Fink v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/423/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="423 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="1903203" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0133-01">423 Pa. 133</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=222%20A.2d%20717" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="222 A.2d 717">222 A. 2d 717</a> (1966).</p>
