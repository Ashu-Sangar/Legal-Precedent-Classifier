Marucci, 7, and Florian Eperjesi, 10, were found dead in a refrigerator in the basement below the two-floor apartment occupied by two women, Mary and Wilma Eperjesi, in the village of Republic, Redstone Township, Fayette County. Florian was the grandson of Mary and the nephew of Wilma. Carl Marucci was Florian’s playmate.</p>

She was given a lie-detector test which produced answers which absolved her from any association with the fatal affair of the refrigerator. In view of what followed, it would seem that the lie-detector machine, technically called a polygraph, failed to measure up to the claims advanced for it by its sellers, proponents and champions. Wilma was released from custody and she returned to the normal routine of her living with Mary Eperjesi.</p>

Were those circumstances purely accidental or had some malevolent hand guided them?</p>

She sat down beside me and grabbed both of my hands and said 'Johnny, I want to tell you what happened.’ I just listened to her. She said she went to feed the peepies, saw the refrigerator door open, and slammed it shut. I said 'Why did you do it?’ She says 'I don’t know why -I done it.’ ”</p>

At this hearing, with several people present, including her brother and sister-in-law, State Trooper Tamallo asked Wilma if she was willing to speak and when she replied in the affirmative, the following ensued: “Q. Now, Wilma, before making this statement, I want to advise you that you are entitled to an attorney or any legal counsel to represent you before you make this statement. You understand what I mean? A. Yeah, I know. Q. Do you want an attorney or legal counsel? A. Yes. . . . Q. O.K. You will make a statement after we get you an attorney. A. Yes.”</p>

She replied that it was 6 <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>o’clock. Maggioncalda then told her that counsel was being appointed for her and that she didn’t have to talk if she didn’t desire to do so, but there were some questions he wanted to “clear up,” and, according to Maggioncalda, “she agreed to answer them.” At this questioning, according to Trooper Tomallo, who was with Maggioncalda, Wilma admitted that she knew the boys were in the refrigerator when she closed the door.</p>

The learned court, in nullifying that statement as evidence, said that when Wilma told Kaminsky she had closed the refrigerator door, it was his “duty and responsibility” to advise her “of her right to remain silent and her right to counsel.” There is nothing in the Federal or Pennsylvania decisions which require police, upon hearing a volunteered statement by anyone, to order the volunteer to cease talking.</p>

    <p id="b499-3" data-blocks='[["BL_499.4",499,[131,631,1152,698]]]'>The circumstances in this case do not reach the environs of a police station where, even there, the police are not compelled to plug their ears when conscience bursts into the doors and the conscience-bearer bares red hands of guilt. Confession No. 1 in this case occurred in a private home. The conversation which encompassed it was initiated by the volunteer, not by the policeman. The processes of the law had not reached the accusatory stage. Indeed, Wilma had already been excluded as a suspect because of the negative results of the lie-detector test. She had been released without bail. She was at home, as free as any other citizen in Republic.</p>
    <p id="b499-4" data-blocks='[["BL_499.5",499,[133,1343,1152,416]]]'>The police did not call at the Eperjesi home with any plan or thought of harassing Wilma. As already stated above, there was always the possibility that the refrigerator door had closed on the two young lads accidentally. The newspapers often carry stories on such anguishing events.

Kaminsky was not “continuing” an “examination.” He had not even begun an examination. It was Wilma who called Kaminsky into the room, and, without preliminaries, seized both his hands, and declared she wanted to tell him what had happened. Kaminsky <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>listened. What was he to do? Run out of the room? Was he to clamp his hands over Wilma’s mouth? He listened. He would have been a poor guardian of the peace and security of the community if, while conducting an investigation, he would refuse to listen to a person who was at the scene of the event he was investigating.</p>

But a confession that is freely given, in every possible sense of the word, is not to be discarded through a reading into appellate decisions what is not there. The Supreme Court of the United States specifically stated in the <em>Miranda </em>case, supra, that: “Confessions remain a proper element in law enforcement. Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.”</p>

Trial courts should not impede officers in the fulfillment of their sworn duties. To so impede them is to imperil the safety of society. A person who has already killed, robbed, or burglarized, may repeat his violence. Thus, it is imperative that the policeman question all persons in the immediate territorial and chronological area of <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>committed violence in order to take whatever precautions may be necessary to prevent a repetition of violence.</p>

    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[141,1056,1152,528]]]'>The Supreme Court of the United States pointed out in the <em>Miranda </em>case that its decision was “not intended to hamper the traditional function of police officers in investigating crime.” It explained specifically: “Generally on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the fact-finding process is not affected by our holding. It is an act of responsible citizenship for individuals to give whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement.”</p>

But Wilma could have known about the refrigerator incident without being criminally involved. She could have known how the fatal occurrence came about, without being a participant in it. To have told her at this moment that she did not have to speak, might well have caused her to believe, on the hypothesis that she was only a witness, that even as a witness she should not speak.</p>
    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[213,1175,1154,698]]]'>To require policemen to stop investigating just when they happen upon a clue, which may lead to solving a crime, and further protect society, would be like telling a deep sea diver to surface when he sees the first sign of the sunken ship he is seeking. To compel policemen not to listen to volunteered statements while investigating a homicide, is to put stoppers in their ears and require them to snap handcuffs on their own wrists. Police have the sworn duty not only to protect society from crime but also, by ascertaining how such heartrending accidents occur, to assist in preventing the closing of refrigerator doors and the spilling of scalding water on infants.</p>

It was in the discharge of this dedicated duty that Kaminsky was in the Eperjesi household. It was while investigating, and not accusing, that someone opened a window so that he might look out and see a verbal re-enactment of the shocking calamity which had overtaken the two young boys of the neighborhood, of which Kaminsky <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>formed a part. It so affected him, he testified, that he “got sort of sick when she told me she closed the door.” To say that Kaminsky should have closed the window, without looking, would he to order investigating policemen to wear blindfolds.</p>
    <p id="b503-3" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[133,622,1153,1074]]]'>The learned court below particularly found fault with Kaminsky because, after Wilma said she had closed the refrigerator door, he asked “Did you know the boys were in there?” If he had not asked that inevitable question he would have qualified for the booby prize of the year. On her own volition, on her own initiative, Wilma said she closed the door of the refrigerator. This wasn’t a routine closing of a door on milk, fruit, and butter. This was slamming a door of death on living tots. Did she know that her nephew Plorian, with his little comrade, was in there? The question asked itself. How could Kaminsky have avoided putting the question? The query was put, as much to free her from the odious imputation that she might have known the boys were there, as it might have drawn an answer which would implicate her. She could just as easily have answered No as Yes. And when she admitted she knew of the boys’ presence in their porcelain coffin, Kaminsky said he “got like butterflies in his stomach.”</p>

The defendant asked to obtain advice from his lawyer. This request was refused. His lawyer came to the police station and remained there two hours demanding to see his client, but he was not allowed to do so. More than that, when the defendant learned his lawyer was in the the police station, he renewed his requests to see him, and he was told that his lawyer didn’t want to talk to him. Some of the officers made assurances to the defendant to induce him to make an incriminating statement. The statement was “taken” by a lawyer of the homicide squad who framed his questions so as to lead the defendant into entrapping answers.

His role was that of a hearing ear and not a questioning tongue. He was the anvil on which Wilma struck with the hammer of her own uncoached, unpersuaded confession.

In each one of these cases the defendant was questioned by police officers in a police station or detective headquarters while “cut off from the outside world.” In each of the cases, the Supreme Court pointed out, “the defendant was thrust into an unfamiliar atmosphere and run through menacing police interrogation procedures.”</p>
    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[195,1495,1149,372]]]'>The opinion of the court, which covers 60 pages, is devoted entirely to the subject of custodial investigation which the Court defined: “By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.”</p>
    <p id="b506-6" data-blocks='[["BL_506.6",506,[191,1875,1151,373]]]'>The four cases all shared “salient features — incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere.” The opinion spoke of individuals “swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces,” which features were as absent in this case (in Statement No. 1), as force in a nursery.</p>

Kaminsky did not engage her in argument, he did not put to her any questions with the exception of the two already indicated and they were as inevitable as breathing. He could not have been less obtrusive if he Avere an inanimate dictaphone.</p>
    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[147,846,1151,756]]]'>Continuing to strike the chord that Kaminsky somehow took advantage of Wilma, the lower court referred to the case of <em>Gallegos v. </em>Colorado, <a href="/citations/?q=870%20U.S.%2049" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="870 U.S. 49">870 U.S. 49</a>, where the Supreme Court held inadmissible a confession made by a 14-year-old boy. The facts in the <em>Gallegos </em>case are also on the other side of the Grand Canyon. Gallegos was held practically incommunicado for five days, and then made a confession. During that time he was confined in Juvenile Hall where he saw “no laAvyer, parent, or other friendly adult.” His mother tried repeatedly but unsuccessfully to see him. The Supreme Court said that a 14-year-old boy “is unlikely to have any conception of what Avill confront him when he is made accessible only to the police.”</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[146,1614,1152,752]]]'>It Avill be observed here also, as in the <em>Escobedo </em>case, that the Supreme Court sought to prevent its decision from being used as authority for cases where the facts are different. The high Court said: “There is no guide to the decision of cases such as this, except the totality of circumstances that bear on the two factors we have mentioned. The youth of the petitioner, the long detention, the failure to send for his parents, the failure immediately to bring him before the judge of the Juvenile Court, the failure to see to it that he had the advice of a lawyer or a friend — all these combine to make us conclude that the formal confession on which this conviction may have rested was obtained in violation of due process.”</p>

      <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>Here there was no such failure. Wilma was in her own home. She was not denied opportunity to see anybody or talk to anybody. She had complete freedom of movement. So far as Wilma’s mental capacity is concerned, we refer to the lower court’s opinion in which appears this assertion: “On November 17, 1965, Dr. William O. Ryan, M.D., Superintendent of Somerset State Hospital, by written report to this court, stated that while the defendant’s intelligence level is borderline, at best, she is mentally and physically capable of speaking in her own behalf at this time.”</p>
    <p id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[189,956,1150,587]]]'>We are dealing here, not with a 14-year-old boy, but a 38-year-old woman. Obviously she is not of a high order of intelligence. Her school education ended with the third grade. However, a reading of her testimony, as it appears in the transcript of the tape recording, would indicate that Wilma was thoroughly capable of understanding the essential facts of life. Her speech was not rambling or unintelligent. She spoke with an awareness of the facts in the case. She knew the persons who were in her presence, and, in some instances, so indicated.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[184,1554,1153,804]]]'>At the hearing before the court, the Judge asked Frank Rose, who was present at the time Statement No. 2 was given, as to his appraisement of her “mental capabilities or capacity.” The exchange follows: “Q. The purpose of that question was simply to find out whether you know her sufficiently well to express an opinion as to whether she has the mental capacity to willingly and knowingly and understandingly waive her constitutional rights to remain silent and to have the assistance of counsel. A. Well, as far as I knew the woman, I mean I seen her and heard her talking to different people, and she sounded normal enough to me, and when she made this statement there she immediately said she made this statement, and she knew what she was doing.”</p>

    <p id="b509-3" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[128,462,1151,254]]]'>Statement No. 2 was properly suppressed because, while in the office of the justice of the peace, Wilma was subjected to questioning without having been informed by the questioners that she had the right to remain silent.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[127,737,1151,1086]]]'>Tightly applying the standards laid down by the Supreme Court, Statement No. B could qualify as admissible as evidence because the questioning policeman informed her she did not have to speak and, after receiving that advice, she “agreed to” answer the questions put to her. Nor did she ask to see a lawyer before speaking. However, in determining the admissibility of confessions or statements, the Judge should consider not only the legalistic criteria propounded by the appellate courts, but also the “totality of circumstances” referred to in the <em>Gallegos </em>case. In view of the fact that the court below was about to appoint attorneys to represent Wilma, when the police questioned Wilma in the Fayette County Jail, and in view of the interrogation which had already occurred in the office of the justice of the peace, we will, in the exercise of excessive caution in behalf of those called upon to answer to the law, rule that the “totality of circumstances” warranted the court below in suppressing Statement No. 3.</p>

I would not make the determination now made by the majority, but would remand this entire proceeding to the court below with instructions that an exhaustive mental examination of the defendant be undertaken. In my view, the representation by counsel of a defendant who lacks the mentality to communicate with him is an unconstitutional deprivation. Accordingly, I would want to know the defendant’s mental capacity before requiring her to stand trial for murder.</p>
