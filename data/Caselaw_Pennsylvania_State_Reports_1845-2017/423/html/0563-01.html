The case was tried before Judge Maurice W. Sporkin of the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County, sitting as chancellor,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> who held the original defendants “guilty of such negligence in recklessly mismanaging the business affairs of [Manganese], wasting its assets and causing its insolvency, as to be legally responsible for its loss and damage totalling $382,537.30. . . .” and directed that the defendants reimburse the court-appointed receiver of Manganese in that amount. Defendants filed exceptions to numerous findings of fact, conclusions of law and the decree of the chancellor. These exceptions were argued before a court en banc — consisting of the chancellor, Judges Ethan Allen Doty and Bernard J. Kelley — which sustained (with Judge Sporkin dissenting) defendants’ exceptions both to the chancellor’s conclusion of law that defendants were liable for the loss suffered by Manganese and to the decree nisi and decreed that Manganese’ complaint be dismissed. Manganese has appealed from this decree (No. 90 January Term, 1966), and Charles A. (Milan, Jr. has appealed from that portion of the decree dismissing the original defendants’ complaint against the additional defendant Selheimer (No. 96 January Term, 1966).</p>

Manganese’ capital structure consisted of authorized capital stock consisting of (a) 100,000 shares, Class A stock, having a par value of $2 per share and (b) 200,000 shares, Class B stock, having a par value of 20^ per share. Of the seven directors authorized, Class B stockholders were entitled to elect four persons as majority directors and Class A stockholders to elect three persons as minority directors. In Manganese’ articles of incorporation Pie, Gillan, Himfar and Kusner were designated as its first directors. On January 19, 1959 — Manganese’ first regular directors’ meeting — the directors authorized the purchase from Mangamex of all its assets — evaluated in the agreement at $91,500 — which consisted of the lease and <em>that portion </em>of the equipment of the Paterson plant which it had purchased six months previously from Eastern. The consideration for this purchase by Manganese was the transfer to Mangamex of <em>all </em>Manganese’ Class B stock — 200,000 shares — and an assumption of all Mangamex’s outstanding indebtedness <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>amounting to $10,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Subsequent to the completion of this sale and purchase, Mangamex distributed <em>all </em>the Class B stock of Manganese to its four stockholders, Himfar, Gillan, Kusner and Pie, each receiving 50,000 shares.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

This agreement provided for a commission to First Securities of $.45 per share sold as well as $.10 per share for expenses; Manganese was thus to receive $2.45 for every share of Class A stock sold. In order to show cash on hand in Manganese at its inception, the first 40,000 shares of Class A stock were issued to Pie, or his nominees, at their <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>par value of $1. per share. The public offering and sale of Class A stock by Manganese was accomplished <em>without first registering the issue with the Federal Securities Exchange Commission, </em>under a procedure made possible by virtue of an exemption provided by the federal “Securities Act of 1933”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Such exemption was available if the entire issue of stock would be sold only to Pennsylvania residents <em>and </em>if Manganese, incorporated in Pennsylvania, was <em>actually </em>“doing business” in Pennsylvania. The total net proceeds realized by Manganese from the sale of Class A stock was $412,914.50. The prospectus and the circulars which accompanied this Class A stock public offering, prepared by and at the direction of Manganese’ officers and directors, stated that Manganese proposed to erect and operate a plant in Pennsylvania wherein substantial operating activities would be centered and that Manganese had arranged for the purchase for $100,000 of an ideally located plant at Colwyn, Pa., which would enable Manganese to operate at advantageous freight rates and under other felicitous conditions.</p>

Up to the date of the decree in the court below the <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>amount of the salaries paid prior to the June, 1959, meeting was never paid back.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The Colwyn plant was far better suited and superior to the Paterson plant for the.commercial production contemplated by Manganese. The Paterson plant lacked a railroad siding, a proper storage area, and its equipment was “out of phase” or improperly arranged for profitable commercial production. Some of its inadequacies were known by defendants for Pie, in a letter to corporation counsel dated January 21, 1959, stated: “it is mandatory that we leave the plant in N. J. because it has no siding which creates a very expensive operation in the handling of the ore to and from the plant.” It is beyond explanation, why, in the face of such knowledge of the unsuitability of the Paterson plant for profitable production, the defendants continued to pour corporate money into and to utilize the Paterson plant. The testimony of defendants is to the effect that they had planned to use the Paterson plant as a “testing” or a “pilot” plant designed particularly for operations in a stage intermediate between research and full-scale production and that to accomplish this it would take the expenditure of approximately $30,000 to $40,000. However, by the time the Paterson plant finally was <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>■made ready for production in May 1959, over $158,000 had been expended for equipment and the productivity of that plant had been seriously handicapped by the .improper arrangement of the equipment purchased. The production at the Paterson plant never exceeded a “token” rate; as of August 31, 1959, the Paterson plant had sustained an operating loss of $104,000 while the total sales of Manganese’ products produced up to that date at that plant amounted to $2,000.</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[139,845,1158,1191]]]'>When the settlement of the Colwyn property finally took place in August 1959, only $55,000 of the $412,000 ■realized from the sale of Class A stock, <em>which in the ■public offering of such stock had been earmarked for the Colwyn </em>plant, remained and this amount was patently insufficient to establish the originally projected plant in Colwyn.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>
      <em>The Colwyn plant was never .utilized during its ownership by Manganese. </em>Moreover, even though defendants' were fully advised by corporate counsel of the necessity of establishing operations in Pennsylvania in accordance with the SEC .exemption, such advice was ignored. When Manganese -went into bankruptcy in October 1960 the receiver salvaged approximately $30,000 from the sale of the corporate assets. The record is clear beyond question that the failure of the defendants to utilize the Colwyn plant, where profitable • production was. possible, and ■the pouring of Manganese’ money into the Paterson plant, which defendants knew could not result in profitable production and which their actual experience in the Paterson plant made so evident, resulted in the "ultimate insolvency of Manganese.</p>

However, subsequent to the formation of Manganese, all purchases of additional “in place” equipment from Eastern were made through an intermediary or “middle man”, one Alan Savitt, a personal friend of one of defendants, Himfar. Moreover, two pieces of equipment, thus acquired, for which approximately §4,000 was paid neither appeared on Manganese’ inventories nor have they been accounted for. Satisfactory explanation for this conduct does not appear on this record. The chancellor found that the use of the intermediary to purchase the equipment created a “reasonable inference of wilful misconduct and a pattern of self-enrichment by the managing defendants, to the prejudice of Manganese and its stockholders, and militates against their good faith and fair-dealing.”</p>
