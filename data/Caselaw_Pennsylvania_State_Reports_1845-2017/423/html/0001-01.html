In 1958, appellant was indicted and charged with the offense of murder. Two attorneys were appointed to represent him and he was brought to trial in June of that year. At trial, appellant’s plea of guilty to the charge of murder generally was accepted by the court and a hearing held before a three judge panel for the purpose of determining the degree of guilt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant was found guilty of murder in the second degree and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years.

Appellant alleges that counsel never discussed the matter of pleading with him, never informed him of his right to insist upon trial by jury, never explained the nature of the charges against him, and never told him of the consequences of entering a <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>plea of guilty to murder. Unaware of his rights and unable to understand the import of the proceedings, appellant alleges that he was called upon to plead at his trial and, at the prompting of counsel, entered a plea of guilty. He further alleges that the court accepted his plea, proceeded to take testimony, found him guilty of murder in the second degree, and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years, without having inquired if he understood the nature and consequences of his plea. He thus contends that he was deprived of due process of law and is therefore entitled to the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. The Commonwealth’s answer to appellant’s petition denied these allegations, averring that appellant’s plea was voluntarily and intelligently made.</p>

Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More is not required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence.
