Bata, and registering the bearer shares of Dutch Bata Shoe Company. When it became apparent that these conditions were not going to be performed, Thomas J. Bata brought an action in equity seeking specific performance. Initially the action was removed to a federal district court, but was subsequently remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In his answer Jan A. Bata denied that the settlement agreement required him to co-operate in terminating the English suit and, under new matter, raised the affirmative defense that the settlement agreement was void because it was entered into as the result of duress, coercion, and the force of adverse judgments which were themselves fraudulently obtained in other jurisdictions. In addition, appellant filed a counterclaim in which he reaverred the allegation of fraud and prayed that the court, inter alia, adjudge him “to be legally and equitably entitled to the ownership of all of the shares of the ‘Bata Enterprises.’ ” The lower court granted appellee’s motion for judgment on the pleadings and this appeal was prosecuted on behalf of Jan A.

While appellant later, in a letter signed by his counsel and dated February 18, 1963, withdrew his consent to the termination, the validity of this withdrawal depends upon appellant’s principal claim that the. entire settlement agreement is unenforceable as induced by fraud, duress, and coercion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In the procedural posture of this case, however, we are confronted not with the merits, as such, but solely with the issue of whether the allegations were sufficiently pleaded to warrant a trial.</p>

P. 2352 as the duly appointed successor to his father, Jan A. Bata. Shortly after Jan A. Bata’s death, his counsel informed appellee and the court of this fact and specifically indicated that Jan T. desired to be substituted as a party and intended to take the necessary formal steps. Thereafter Jan T. with the approval of both the court and appellee participated as an active party in all aspects of the controversy. We are of the view that <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>by these actions Jan T. met the requirements of Pa. R. C. P. 2352(a) for voluntary substitution.</p>
