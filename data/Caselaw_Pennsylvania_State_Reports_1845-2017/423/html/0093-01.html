Further, Smith testified at trial and admitted participation in the robbery, but denied having a revolver or assaulting the deceased victim.

During this period Young, in the presence of Smith and Collins, orally stated that the three had joined in committing the robbery and that Smith had hit the victim, Hill. At this time Smith, “tightened his lips,” “lowered his head and shook his head from side to side.” Smith was then asked if he wished to ask Young any questions. He remained silent. Shortly thereafter, again with all three present, Collins orally stated that what Young said about the commission of the robbery was true, but that he did not see or know if Smith hit Hill. Following this Smith remained silent and did not indicate in any manner that the statement was untrue. The following morning Smith, Young and Collins were again questioned in the presence of each other.

Myers, </em>supra.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In charging the jury the trial judge said that his impression of the desci’iption given as to how Smith tightened his lips and shook his head (when first confronted with Young’s admissions and accusations) was one of consternation or surprise that his buddies had told on him. However, he immediately added that his impression was not binding on the jury and that if they concluded “that Smith said no, then you cannot consider that testimony, because Smith then made a denial.
