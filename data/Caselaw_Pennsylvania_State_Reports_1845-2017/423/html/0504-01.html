In 1957, the Pennsylvania Constitution was further amended by the addition of Art. 8, §19, which permitted civilian absentee voting where unavoidable absence or physical disability justified the privilege. In 1960, the legislature implemented this constitutional authorization by passing the Act of January 8, 1960, P.L. 2135, 25 P.S. §3149.1-3149.9 (Supp. 1960), entitled “An Act amending the Act of June 3, 1937,” i.e., the Pennsylvania Election Code, Act of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1333, as amended, 25 P.S. §2601.</p>

Section 24 thereof provided that in the event a challenge is entered to an absentee ballot, the board of elections is to mark the ballot envelope as “challenged” and then hold a hearing on the objections. The decision of the board of elections on any challenge is then made subject to review by the court of common pleas of the county involved.

This was so even though the Act of 1960 was silent as to the right of appeal from a court of common pleas in such proceedings. Also, no distinction was drawn as to whether the challenges involved irregularities in the ballot itself, irregularities in the form on the envelope required to be filled in by the elector, or objections to the qualification of the elector.</p>

Further, if broad review of an order of a common pleas court as to the qualifications of an elector on election day is proper, it would come under §1206 of the Act of 1937, supra, and not under any sections of the code involved here.

He argues that §1407 controls only where “canvassing or computation” of the returns is involved, and that where the qualifications of the elector are challenged, or where the validity of the ballot is questioned because of alleged irregularities appearing on the form of the enclosing envelope required to be filled in by the elector, that this does not involve “canvassing or computation.” To this we cannot subscribe.</p>

The opportunity to challenge and the procedure with re-, spect thereto have always been recognized as an integral part of the canvassing and the computation of election returns. The 1963 amendments amplified and improved the canvassing process. It did not render the right to challenge any less an integral part thereof. It must also be noted, that §24 provides for an appeal to the court of common pleas from the board of election’s decision, and does not change in the slightest the court’s power as it previously existed in such instances:</p>

The former embodies attacks on the validity of the ballot because of errors of dates, the absence of the attending physician’s signature, the failure to state the nature of the disability which prevents attendance at the polls, or similar errors of form on the application. Challenges directed to the <em>qualifications </em>of the elector include all those matters which could be raised in attacking the right of one appearing at the polls to cast his vote, such as age, citizenship, registration, residence, and the like,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> and, more specifically, the issue of whether the elector falls within the class of persons authorized by §20<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> to exercise the privilege of absentee balloting.

Act of August 13, 1963, P.L. 707, 25 P.S. §3146.2b (Supp. 1965). The obvious purpose of the requirement <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>is to provide the elector with an opportunity to take curative action, if possible, and thus to preserve his privilege of absentee balloting. To permit, as the majority does, a challenge to a ballot subsequent to the election, on the ground of some technical error of form on the application, when curative action on the part of the elector is no longer possible, is to unreasonably disenfranchise the voter. Since all matters of substance may be raised by a challenge to the qualifications of the elector, I do not believe that the Legislature intended that a voter be deprived of his significant interest in having his vote counted merely on the ground of some technical error of form on his application for an absentee ballot. Once the elector has relied upon the issuance of the ballot, as an approval of his application, I see no justification for depriving him of his right to have his ballot counted because of some irregularity of form.</p>
