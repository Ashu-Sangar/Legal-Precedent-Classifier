The ordinance was preceded by a petition to the borough purportedly signed by a majority of the freeholders of the tract to be annexed and requesting the annexation. On October 16, 1963, a certified copy of the ordinance was filed with the Court of Quarter Sessions of Somerset County and the county board of elections of that county. This filing stated that it was made pursuant to the provisions of The Borough Code, Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 519, §426, 53 P.S. §45426.</p>

The appellants raised several issues: (1) whether the petition to the borough was signed by a majority of the freeholders of the annexed territory, (2) whether the annexation was in the best interests of the township and the borough and (3) <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>whether the ordinance was wholly void since the procedure did not follow the requirements of the Act of July 20, 1953, P.

This was done, and the commissioners submitted a report of a rather inconclusive nature.</p>

In the present case, although certain after-the-fact actions were taken to provide a semblance of adherence to the Act of 1953, it is clear that the initial, crucial steps followed only the provisions of The Borough Code, supra, §§425, 426, 53 P.S. §§45425, 45426. Therefore, the issue of implied repeal of those provisions is squarely presented and must be decided.</p>
    <p id="b651-3" data-blocks='[["BL_651.4",651,[127,1228,1152,640]]]'>We agree with the Superior Court and with its analysis of the historical basis for allowing the simultaneous existence of separate and valid annexation procedures contained in different statutes.

Consequently, it is our decision that the Act of 1953 did not impliedly repeal the provisions of The Borough Code on annexation and that either statute may be followed in effectuating an annexation.</p>
    <p id="b651-4" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[129,1879,1151,477]],["BL_652.1",652,[204,353,1146,88]]]'>This determination, as well as the history behind it, also disposes of the contention of amicus curiae that the separate acts are in pari materia and, therefore, both must be followed. Each represents a separate and distinct procedure for annexing territory, and there is no basis for commingling their provisions. For this reason we also disapprove of the lower court’s attempt to incorporate the procedure of the Act of 1953 as such into this proceeding. There was no requirement that <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>commissioners be appointed; and, as it turned out, their consideration was of little value.</p>
    <p id="b652-3" data-blocks='[["BL_652.4",652,[198,462,1153,1076]]]'>Finally, we come to the nature of the appeal. Here, too, the Superior Court correctly decided the issue. The appeal is taken under §1010 of The Borough Code, 53 P.S. §46010, which makes the order of the court below “conclusive.” Therefore, appellate review is on narrow certiorari. This means that review may deal only with the question of jurisdiction, the regularity of the proceedings, excess in the exercise of power, if any, and constitutional questions. <em>Kaufman Construction Co. v. Holcomb, </em><a href="/pa/357/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="357 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="472102" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0514-01">357 Pa. 514</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20534" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="55 A.2d 534">55 A. 2d 534</a> (1947); <em>Keystone Raceway Corporation v.

In applying this rule, however, the Superior Court erred by reviewing the record to determine if there was evidence to support the findings of the court below. Such a review is proper only where the appeal arises on broad certiorari (as it does, for example, under the Act of 1953). Nevertheless, it found no basis for not sustaining the lower court and, confining our review to the issues of jurisdiction and regularity, neither do we.</p>

Certainly, there is no express repeal set forth in the 1953 statute and any finding of repeal must be based upon repeal by implication. I do not find any such implication of repeal particularly when, in ascertaining the legislative intent, we find that in 1966 the legislature reenacted, <em>without any significant change, </em>the pertinent provisions of The Borough Code of 1927, as amended (Act of February 1, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1656, 53 P.S. §§45426, 45427) and the 1966 statute did <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>not repeal the 1953 statute. Although I am extremely doubtful of the wisdom of such legislative manoeuvers, the fact is that the statute books now contain two separate statutes, passed at different sessions of the Legislature, each dealing with the same subject matter, i.e., the manner in which to annex to a borough a second class township or a portion thereof, which are in full force and effect.</p>

I fully agree with the statement in the brief of the amicus curiae: “The General Assembly is presumed to intend that <em>some </em>meaning be given to its acts. As both [the 1953 statute and The Borough Code] involve procedures where the petitioners and the borough are both seeking annexation, the legislature must have intended more by the Act of 1953 than to give those seeking annexation the choice of a more difficult way to bring it about. The legislature cannot be assumed to be so naive or stupid as to intend by the Act of 1953 to say nothing more to those seeking annexation than: ‘You have an easy way of getting what you want. We now give you an opportunity of choosing a way more difficult for you’. To state the proposition should be sufficient to reject it. The legislature is presumed not to intend a result which is absurd or unreasonable. . .”. (Emphasis supplied).</p>

The majority opinion states that, if The Borough Code is followed, appellate review is on narrow certiorari and limited simply to a determination whether the court below had jurisdiction, whether the proceedings were regular, whether there was an ex-cession of power exercised and whether any constitu<a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>tional right was offended. The majority opinion acknowledges that, if the 1953 statute is followed, then review is upon broad certiorari wherein the appellate court may inquire into the merits of the controversy.

Thus, suitors for annexation can effectively prevent an appellate court from inquiring. into the merits of an annexation, a result which I deem clearly not within the legislative intendment. With the increasing activity in the field of annexation, prompted in many instances by developers of housing installations seeking more favorable treatment for their ventures, the appellate courts should have the right to inquire into the merits of proposed annexation for the protection of the rights of the residents, both in the annexing and to-be-annexed territories. Annexation can, and most often does, entail increased burdens by way of taxation and increased governmental services on the annexing and to-be-annexed territories. That appellate review can be so restricted and limited simply at the election of those seeking annexation is to me unthinkable and contrary to the intendment of the legislature.</p>

However, since the legislature has seen fit to enact two stat<a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>utes dealing with the same subject and since <em>it is possible </em>to construe them as <em>one </em>law, I would follow the legislative mandate and construe these statutes, which are in pari materia, as one law.</p>
