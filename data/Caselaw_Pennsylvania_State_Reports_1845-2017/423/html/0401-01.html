To the contrary, tbat background suggests the thesis that the draftsmen of the Uniform Act, rejecting the view that undistributed earned surplus be equated with “income” for trust purposes, adopted the policy that nothing be deemed income which is not the result of a decision by management, freely arrived at, to distribute the “earnings” of the corporation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Thus, they sought to restate, by generalizing as to traditional corporate practices, those distributions which are presumptively the result of such a decision.

Beyond the depreciation in the value of the duPont holdings,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">21</a> extreme because of the magnitude of the distribution, the tax consequences would be particularly exacerbating. As a result of special legislation, the General Motors shares distributed are entitled to be treated by non-corporate shareholders as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Int. Rev. Code of 1954, §1111; see 5 CCH 1966 Stand. Fed. Tax Rep. ¶4699A4699E.15. However, such treatment requires that the basis of the duPont shares held by the stockholder be reduced by the market value of the General Motors shares received. Int. Rev. Code of 1954, §301 (c)(2); see 5 CCH 1966 Stand. Fed. Tax Rep. ¶4699E. Therefore, upon the sale of those securities, the sum received in excess of the new, reduced basis will be subject to capital gains taxation and the proceeds, allocable to principal, reduced accordingly. It is clear, therefore, that the corpus Avill be taxed, in part, on sums which have been diverted to the life tenant. In addition, in those cases in which the basis of the duPont hold<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>ings are exceeded by the value of the General Motors shares received, the trust, merely by reason of its receipt of the latter shares, even though allocated to income, will have incurred taxable capital gains. Int. Rev. Code of 1954, §301(c) (3) (A); see 5 CCH 1966 Stand. Fed. Tax Rep. fl4:699E.10. Thus, significant burdens will be incurred by the corpus were the General Motors shares not available to offset the tax consequences of the transaction.</p>

To others, those acquiring duPont prior to the acquisition of its General Motors holdings, those holdings may be viewed as deferred income, appreciated in value through duPont’s investment of previously earned surplus in General Motors. While the application of our common law rule of apportionment would make such matters, in part, dispositive, the enactment of the Principal and Income Act precludes reference to such considerations. The need for administrative convenience and the limitations of our former rule have led the Legislature to invoke rules of general application, which, by necessity, may not do perfect justice. Yet, on balance, we are of the view that the distribution of the General Motors shares to corpus will, in most instances, most equitably treat the successive interests in the trust. In this fashion, substantial losses to the sole detriment of remaindermen will be avoided; while income cestuis will continue to be the beneficiaries of the income produced and distributed by General Motors.</p>

    <p id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[152,397,1152,579]]]'>The legislature, when it passed the Act of July 3, 1947, P. L. 1283, 20 P.S. §3470.1 et seq., never contemplated a situation such as the one with which we are now confronted and made no provision for the application of the Act to this problem. Thus we should not apply the Act to this situation and be required, as the majority does, to make a choice between the provisions of §5(1) or §5(3), since neither of those sections nor any other section of the Act was within the contemplation of the legislature, applicable to the duPont situation.</p>
    <p id="b453-5" data-blocks='[["BL_453.6",453,[156,997,1150,535]]]'>Several states have been more realistic and with a greater degree of probity have by recent legislation expressly provided that a court forced distribution by a corporation of the shares of another corporation shall be deemed principal. Florida, Illinois, Maryland and Wisconsin had statutory enactments relating to the distribution of principal and income, but have recognized the uniqueness of this situation and the lack of their applicable statutory guides and provided the solution by additional statutory enactment.</p>
    <p id="b453-6" data-blocks='[["BL_453.7",453,[158,1544,1151,428]]]'>The Pennsylvania legislature did not so act; thus the situation presented by this problem has no statutory solution in Pennsylvania and any attempt to distinguish and apply various sections of our existing Principal and Income Act to provide a statutory solution to this situation is nothing more than tortuous rationalization. In fact, the majority’s determination made without guidelines may prove to be a dangerous precedent.</p>
    <p id="b453-7" data-blocks='[["BL_453.8",453,[160,1981,1150,258]]]'>Thus, I would disregard all of our existing statutory enactments and base my conclusion solely on the concept that a contrary determination would be most inequitable to the remaindermen of the trust and not within the settlor’s contemplation.</p>
