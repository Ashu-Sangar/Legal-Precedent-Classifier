By a complaint dated February 9, 1948, appellant was charged with having com<a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>mitted murder on February <em>7, </em>1948.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Counsel were appointed for appellant on February 11, 1948. A preliminary hearing was held on February 18, 1948. On March 8, 1948, an indictment was returned against appellant, he was arraigned, pleaded not guilty, and proceeded to trial by jury. Appellant was represented by counsel both at arraignment and at trial. On March 9, 1948, the jury found appellant guilty of murder in the first degree and he was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. Neither post-trial motions nor an appeal were filed on appellant’s behalf.</p>

Appellant’s contention that he was arrested without a warrant and without probable cause does not of itself afford him any ground for post-conviction relief. E.g., <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Light v.

The possibility that appellant was not represented by counsel during a preliminary hearing, at which he admittedly pleaded not guilty and about which he makes no other allegation, fails to suggest that the hearing was such a “critical stage” that representation by counsel was con<a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>stitutionally necessary.

Finally, in light of the above discussion, appellant’s argument that his indictment was invalidated by the alleged illegality of his arrest, preliminary hearing and the lack of counsel before trial is clearly groundless.</p>
