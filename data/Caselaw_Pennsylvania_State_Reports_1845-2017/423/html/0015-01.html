    <p id="b55-4" data-blocks='[["BL_55.4",55,[141,677,1153,1030]]]'>Parker instituted a trespass action against Mrs. Jones in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County and, after a trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Mrs. J ones and against Parker. On Parker’s motion, the court below granted a new trial upon three particular grounds: (1) that the trial court should have submitted to the jury the issue of wanton misconduct on Mrs. Jones’ part so that the jury could have considered whether Parker was entitled to recover, regardless of any contributory negligence on his part; (2) that the trial court should not have instructed the jury on the duty of a pedestrian crossing a highway between intersections since, under the instant factual situation, Parker was upon the highway a sufficient period of time for Mrs. Jones to have seen him;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (8) that additional instructions to the jury were given, in the presence of counsel but in the absence of the court reporter.

As a pedestrian about to cross this heavily trafficked highway, Parker was under a duty not only to look when he reached the medial strip but <em>to continue to looh </em>as he crossed the two eastbound lanes. Parker when he reached the medial strip looked to his right or toward the west — in the direction from which he could anticipate vehicular traffic — and, <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>at that point, saw two automobiles<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> “a block and a half away” and “figured [he] had a chance to get across”; Parker then stated that he “went on as fast as [he] could run; it may not have been so very fast, but [he ran] as hard as [he] could to get on the outline like that”. The testimony further reveals that Parker did not again look to the west until his “heel was on the white mark”, the southern edge of the highway: “Q. After you started to run from some point near the center, after you saw the two cars coming from your right, you have told us, have you not, that you never looked to your right again? A. Never looked until just about a half second before this here car hit me, when I made my jump. Q. And how close were you to the edge of the road then when you looked to your right again? A. My heel was on the white mark. ... Q. What I am asking you is, even though you did not see any other cars coming from your right, was the visibility such that you could see further on down the road behind the two cars that were coming toward you? A. I did not look, I tell you, I did not look. I never looked, not until I got across and put my, this right foot, the left foot I mean, on the white line; and then I looked and here was a car right up on me, and I made my jump and it got me in the right side. Q. When you stood there for that one-half second somewhere near the white line or the center line, you knew, did you not, that there were two lanes for cars coming from Wilmington towards Media, from your right to your left? A. That is right.” Thus, it is clear that Parker traversed approximately 24 feet of the highway without looking in the direction from which traffic would be anticipated or seeking to ascertain the position of the eastbound automobiles.</p>

This in itself convicted him of contributory negligence. It was a clear violation of his definite obligation, even if no approaching traffic were visible before he undertook to cross. But, it was even more incumbent upon him to continue to look as a reasonably prudent man interested in his own safety would do, in view of the fact that, before he started to cross, he saw the automobile of the defendant approaching .from a- comparatively short distance away. His own foolhardiness in blindly jay-walking across a busy street at least contributed to this unfortunate occurrence. This renders recovery impossible under a long line of Pennsylvania authorities.” See also: <em>Sweigert v.

Parker, after stopping at the medial strip and observing two eastbound. vehicles approaching, committed himself to crossing this; 24 feet of highway without continuing to look to the west to observe the position of these or any other eastbound vehicles. Having failed to maintain a proper lookout he was negligent and his negligence contributed to the happening of this accident.</p>

Prom such facts, it is argued that a reasonable person would have assumed Parker was in peril and confused and that it was his intent to cross the eastbound as well as the westbound lanes and that it was for the jury to determine whether Mrs. Jones’ conduct was wanton.

Therefore, the only relevant testimony <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> now pertinent is that of Mrs. Jones. Mrs. Jones stated she first saw Parker running in front of two westbound vehicles to the medial strip; that Parker “stopped for a minute” at the medial strip looking to the east and then took a step into the eastbound lanes; that she then applied her brakes and blew her horn and Parker started to run across the eastbound lanes; that her car was “virtually stopped” when Parker was hit by “the right front bumper”; that when she saw Parker step into the eastbound lanes her car was “five to six car lengths” from him; that she was 500 feet away when she first saw Parker but he was then in the westbound lanes; that when “[Parker] reached the center and stopped [she] thought he was going to stay there”; that she had about “two seconds” from the time when Parker stepped into the eastbound lanes to make up her mind what to do.</p>

The instant facts lead us to paraphrase that which we said in <em>Moss v. Reading Co., </em>supra: “The mere fact that this action [the application of the brakes by Mrs. Jones] was too late to avoid the accident can in ho way-detract from the fact that [Mrs. Jones] took reasonable care to avoid the accident the minute [she] realized that [Parker] was in a position of peril.” (at p. 603).
