He first described the various components of the spinal column. This is a cord surrounded by a fine, transparent membrane called the “arachnoid mater”. There is then an outer fibrous elastic membrane called “dura mater”. <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>Over this is a layer of fat, bony substance called the “laminae”. Protruding from the spinal column are small bones called “spinous processes”. On the day of the operation, the patient was placed face down on the operating table and anesthetized. An incision was made in the thoracic spinal area. After the incision was made through the dura and the arachnoid, the cord appeared small in the affected area. This observation formed the basis for part of the diagnosis, showing that a large number of cells had died and disappeared.</p>
    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.4",187,[132,896,1153,1448]],["BL_188.1",188,[202,339,1148,426]]]'>As indicated by the testimony of Dr. Grunnagle, it was necessary to see if there was anything in front of the dura involving the spinal cord. It was necessary to cut into the dura and the arachnoid and to sever points of attachment of the dentate ligaments in order that he be able to rotate the spinal cord itself, so that he could get a glimpse in front of the cord. There was no neoplasm, but a bulging disc was noted which was pushing the dura up against the cord. No effort was made to remove the disc, as such surgery was considered too dangerous to be attempted. Dentate ligament attachments (the continuous ligament on each side of the cord which are attached by small, triangular shaped attachments to the dura mater), in addition to those which had already been cut in order to rotate the cord, were then cut. These dentate ligaments hold the spinal cord in an upright position. The purpose of this Kahn technique is to relieve the pressure of the bulged disc on the front of the cord and the counter stress on the cortico-spinal track within the posterior cord, which counter pressure is exerted by the tough, nonelastic dentate ligament attachments holding the spinal cord against the pressure from the front. In performing this surgery, it was necessary to remove the laminae and the spinous processes in the area of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th thoracic vertebrae. The dura and the arachnoid were also incised. The doctor’s <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>notes at the conclusion of this surgery read as follows: “The posterior part of the cord appeared small, particularly right over the area of pathology. The dura was then closed with a continuous lock stitch of black silk. Hemostasic was then ascertained and the muscles, heavy fascia, subcutaneous layer and skin were approximated with interrupted black silk. Patient withstood the procedure well.”</p>
    <p id="b188-4" data-blocks='[["BL_188.4",188,[203,775,1150,686]]]'>Following the operation, Dr. Grunnagle carried out normal, follow-up procedures. Mr. Gray was discharged from the hospital on February 6, 1960. Dr. Grunnagle saw him several times thereafter in 1960 and February 14, 1961, was the last time he saw Mr. Gray as his patient. Mr. Gray has not been able to walk since this operation. On the occasion of his last visit, Dr. Grunnagle found that the paralysis was due to the disc. This was the fundamental cause of plaintiff-appellant’s disability. The doctor recommended that Mr. Gray be readmitted to the hospital for further surgery, which he felt should improve Mr. Gray’s condition.</p>
    <p id="b188-5" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[204,1481,1150,848]],["BL_189.1",189,[130,341,1152,318]]]'>Dr. Grunnagle stated he had no way of knowing what he would find until the operation was under way. Both the roentgenologist at Allegheny General Hospital and Dr. Blakley were under the impression preoperatively that a spinal cord tumor was probably present; however, Dr. Grunnagle was of the opinion that it was more likely the lesion was a disc, although he could not eliminate the possibility that it was a neoplasm without actual surgery. There was no test which could be performed, other than actual surgery, which would have revealed the exact nature of the problem in this case. The record reveals that Dr. Grunnagle had relied on Mr. Gray’s signed consent to an operation. This consent, signed on January 18, 1960, the date of his admission to the hospital, was offered in evidence at the trial. It should be noted that in <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>Ms testimony, Dr. Grunnagle stated that plaintiff-appellant’s condition was becoming progressively worse and would have continued to deteriorate without surgery, although he could not say what the ultimate result would have been had Mr. Gray not undergone surgery.</p>

During the period when our common law was being formulated and applied, even a major operation was performed in the home of the patient, and the patient ordinarily was conscious, so that the physician could consult him in respect to conditions which required or made advisable an extension of the operation. And even if the shock of the operation rendered the patient unconscious, immediate members of his family were usually available. Hence the courts formulated the rule that any extension of the operation by the Physician without the consent of the patient or someone authorized to speak for him constituted a battery or trespass upon the person of the patient for which the physician was liable in damages.</p>

More and more courts are beginning to realize that ordinarily a surgeon is employed to remedy conditions without any express limitation on his authority in respect thereto, and that in view of these conditions which make consent impractical, it is unreasonable to hold the physician to the exact operation— particularly when it is internal — that his preliminary examination indicated was necessary. We know that now complete diagnosis of an internal ailment is not effectuated until after the patient is under the influence of the anesthetic and the incision has been made.</p>

This relationship is essentially contractual in nature.11 (Footnote omitted) More often than not the contract is raised by implication from <em>the </em>dealings between the parties, and in a like manner the acts to be performed by the parties are impliedly defined. Thus, if a patient consults a surgeon for the purpose of removing a tumor from his arm, a contract is entered into which requires the surgeon to remove the tumor. Therefore, he must not digress from that contract and also remove the patient’s appendix. In short, the surgeon must operate in accordance with <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>the agreement made between the parties. Consent for the operation or treatment arises from the contract and is given only in connection with what the parties understood was to be done. Thus, in the illustration above, the patient did not consent to the performance of any operation other than the removal of the tumor, and if the surgeon removed the appendix as well, he would be liable in damages. It is noted that in such a case the patient might well rely on an action for breach of contract.12 (Footnote omitted) However, he may base his action on a tortious assult and battery and recover punitive damages which are not available in contract actions.”</p>

Do you have any recollection as to what advise [sic] you gave Mr. Gray relative to the potential risks? A. I don’t know exactly what I told him, no. I can’t remember that. I told him it was a serious operation. There are many risks involved, not only as to paralysis, but as to life. Q. But you don’t have any specific recollection of how much detail you went into when you explained this to him? A. No, I don’t. Q. Can you tell us when you told Mr. Gray as to these risks and hazards? A. Well, some time — either the 22nd, or the 23rd, or the 24th of January. Q. And you are basing your answer now, I take it, on the fact that you did not see or become aware of the myelographic finding until January 22nd of 1960, is that right? A. That’s right. Q. As I recall from the hospital record, it indicates that Mr. Gray was admitted on a Monday, January the 18th, is that true? A. Well, it’s January the 18th, yes. Q. So then, January the 22nd of 1960 would have been a Friday. A. Right. ... Q. You made your recommendation for surgery on January the 22nd? A. On the <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>chart I did. I may have spoken to the patient before this. I don’t recall. Q. But as far as the record is concerned, you made your recommendation for surgery on January the 22nd? A. That’s my note to Dr. Blakley, yes. It’s in the hospital record so that he can read it. Q. Surely. That is your written note to Dr. Blakely? A. That is correct. Q. So the point being, then, that the case had not yet been referred to you by Dr. Blakley as of January 22nd, had it? A. Oh, yes, it had been referred to me when he had asked me for consultation, but it had not been transferred to me. Q. Explain the difference. A. When a patient is referred, they are referred for consultation by a doctor to get another doctor’s opinion. When the ease is transferred, it is transferred from one service to the other doctor’s service. Q. So then, the case was not transferred to you for the purposes of your contemplated surgery until January the 24th of 1960, a Sunday? A. They usually transfer it either just before surgery or just after. I will check. Mr. Martin: We can save time. It was the 24th, if that is what you are trying to prove. Mr. Ctjbbon : I merely want to establish a point. By Mr. Ctjbbon : Q. That has been agreed to by your counsel. A. Yes, here it is (indicating). Q. Did you find it? A. The 24th. Q. Then would you have explained the risks and hazards of this proposed surgery to Mr. Gray during the day or the evening — or would you know? A. I wouldn’t know. Q. Perhaps, to refresh your recollection, let me respectfully direct your attention to this page which is in the nurses’ notes. It would be under the date of January 22nd, 1960. Right here (indicating). Now, Doctor, respectfully directing your attention to the nurses’ notes under date of January 22, 1960. This is the day that you made your recommendation or proposal for an exploratory surgery.

Would like to know what is going to be done. No specific complaints.’ Q. You say that as a matter of practice and routine you always advise patients, suck as Mr. Gray, as to the potential risks of surgery? A. Yes, I did. Q. Always, Doctor? A. Unless they are comatose or mentally incompetent. Q. Was Mr. Gray in possession of his mental faculties at the time he was in the hospital, and up to the time he was operated on? A. Yes, he was. Q. <em>He certainly was not in any state of a so-called medical emergency that his situation dictated and commanded immediate surgery, was it? A. Wo. Q.

The testimony of Dr. Grunnagle reveals that the operation was a serious one and it involved risks “not only as to paralysis but as to life”. Dr. Grunnagle also stated in regard to the exploratory laminectomy: “Q. Now, this laminectomy, the exploratory laminectomy, that you proposed, this is considered major surgery, is it not, Doctor? A. Yes, it is. Q. Certainly with major surgery, there are certain risks and hazards that go along as part and parcel of such a surgery? A. Yes. Q. In fact, in this surgery the surgical risks, or hazards, ran as high as 15 to 20% of Mr. Gray’s condition being worse after the surgery than before, did it not? A. With a protruded disc it does, yes, in the thoracic region. Q. This was basically your diagnosis at the <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>time, that you suggested the exploratory laminectomy, was it not? A. Yes, either disc or tumor. Q. So then, taking into consideration the seriousness and the risks and hazards that were involved with this type of proposed surgery, I take it that it was the accepted standard of medical care prevailing in this Pittsburgh area in 1960, January, to advise the client of these potential risks and hazards, was it not? A. We always tell our patient that there are risks in surgery of the spinal cord; that there are risks of paralysis and worsening of already existing paralysis. ... Q. The point is, then, that it was the accepted standard of medical care in the Pittsburgh area to so advise the patient, and specifically Mr. Gray, as to the potential risks and hazards regarding this surgery that you proposed? A. Yes. Q. Did you so advise Mr. Gray? A. Yes, I did. Q. What did you advise him relative thereto? A. I can’t recollect my exact words to him, or the exact conversation, but it is my policy to always let the patient know the risks involved in surgery. Now, how much we go into this depends somewhat on the patient and somewhat on the surgery; but I am sure we have told him that there was a possibility of worsening his paralysis. We always tell patients who we are operating on their spinal cord, and most patients that we are operating on the brain, we tell them this.”</p>

Mr. Gray’s testimony reveals that: “Q. Now, going back to the time prior to, or before your surgery, did you have any discussion of this potential surgery with Dr. Grunnagle? A. I did not. Q. Did he mention it to you at all? A. He did not. Q. Did he advise you that you were scheduled for surgery? A. I was under the impression that I was going to have a ‘exploratory operation’. He was going to try to arrive at a diagnosis. I thought I was going to have a ‘exploratory operation’. Q. Who advised you thusly? A. Dr. Renton advised me of that. Q. Had anyone ever explained to you the potential risk and hazards with surgery? A. No one did. ... Q. What day do you say that Dr. Grunnagle saw you before the operation? A. Dr. Grunnagle saw me Tuesday. I was admitted to the hospital on Monday. He saw me Tuesday after-, noon, and then he saw me again Thursday evening. I’d say it was after 5:30 — after 6:00 o’clock on Thursday evening. Q. That was after the second time that you had been down to the room where myelograms were taken, is that right? A. That was after the second time, after I had been returned to my room, yes, sir. Q. Did he discuss the Myelogram with you? A. No, sir, he did not. Q. What did he do? A. He just came in and he looked at the chart and said that he would see me later. Q. Are you telling us, sir, that when you went into that operating room on the 25th, you didn’t know that they were going to operate on your spine? A. When I went into that operating room, it’s the truth that I thought I was going to undergo an exploratory operation. Q. An exploratory where? In the foot? In your back? In where? A. Well, I was reasonably sure it was my back, but I didn’t get that from Dr. Grunnagle. Q. Who did you get it from? A. <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>I got that from Dr. Renton. I think that’s the gentleman’s name that visited me. Q. What else did you get from Dr. Renton? A. Dr. Renton told me the first Myelogram was inconclusive, and they were going to give another one the next day and that he would perform the Myelogram, the second Myelogram. Q. What did he tell you about the operation? A. He didn’t tell me anything about the operation. Q. At any time? A. Yes, sir. Q. Well, I don’t know whether you are saying ‘anything bout it’, or ‘at any time’, or ‘he didn’t’. A. I meant to say that he told me something about it at one time. Q. What did he tell you that time? A. On a Sunday evening after my unsuccessful attempt to get in touch with Dr. Grunnagle, Dr. Renton came to my room, and I was upset and shook up because I had been shaved, and I didn’t know what was going to happen to me. Dr. Renton told me not to worry about it, that it was exploratory ixl nature and that I would be home in six days.”</p>

Powell, Consent to Operative Procedures, supra, concerning an express consent: “There is little difficulty in regard to consent, if the patient, either on his own initiative or by solicitation at the instance of a physician or a nurse consents <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>either in writing or verbally to the undertaking of operative procedures in an attempt to remedy the pathological condition of which he complains. As indicated, express consent can be obtained either by having the patient sign a written statement or through the making of an oral agreement. In either case, since the agreement between the physician and his patient is contractual in nature, for there to be valid consent it must be clear that both parties understand the nature of the undertaking and what the possible as well as expected results might be. As will be more thoroughly discussed later, it will be no defense for a surgeon to prove that the patient had given his consent, if the consent was not given with a true understanding of the nature of the operation to be performed, the seriousness of it, the organs of the body involved, the disease or incapacity sought to be cured, and the possible results.” We believe that Mr. Powell was certainly correct, particularly in his statement that “it will be no defense for a surgeon to prove that the patient had given his consent, if the consent was not given with a true understanding of the nature of the operation to be performed. . .”.</p>

Testimony in the record shows that Dr. Grunnagle had not decided to operate until January 22, 1960, four days after the consent was signed by Mr. Gray.

To impose on a surgeon such a burdensome test is very unrealistic, very unfair, and very unjustifiable.</p>
