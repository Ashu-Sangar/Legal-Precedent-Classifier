Appellant attempts to appeal from the dismissal of preliminary objections, filed in her behalf and in behalf of the corporate defendant. The court below properly refused to entertain the corporate preliminary objections since there is no indication the appellant had any authority to file objections in its behalf. As to her own preliminary objections, no appeal is allowable from their dismissal. As stated by this court in <em>Wandzilak v. Huss, </em><a href="/pa/419/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="419 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1896878" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0541-01">419 Pa. 541</a>; “We <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>stated in Dozor Agency v.

    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[219,854,1148,417]]]'>In this case, the preliminary objections as to the appellant did not concern the question of jurisdiction, and as the court below made clear: “There is no question of jurisdiction of the subject matter and jurisdiction of the person was obtained by personal service. As to her, the case is now at issue on the basis of the complaint, the answer and new matter, and the reply to new matter.”</p>
    <p id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[215,1289,1151,696]]]'>This order was therefore not final within this court’s definition of the term as set forth in <em>Stadler v. Mt.

The court cannot assume such appellate jurisdiction even by consent of the parties: (citing cases). Nor is an order, judgment or decree final unless it terminates the litigation between the parties to the suit by precluding a party from further action in that court: (citing cases).”</p>

    <p id="b531-3" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[130,505,1151,754]]]'>As to the preliminary objections filed in behalf of the corporation, the lower court stated that it would not entertain them, and the majority have stated that the court’s action was proper. I know of no procedure which permits a court to refuse to entertain preliminary objections once they have been filed. The court must either sustain or dismiss them. It may not merely allow them to languish because it believes that it should not entertain them. I recognize that the refusal of the lower court to act does not constitute an appeal-able order. However, I would remind counsel that there are effective proceedings available to compel the lower court to reach a decision on the corporate preliminary objections.</p>
