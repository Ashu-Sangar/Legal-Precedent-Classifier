On the basis of the record before it — the complaint, the preliminary objections, the answers to interrogatories and the answers to the preliminary objections — the court below dismissed Briggs’ preliminary objections “without prejudice to the rights of [Briggs] to raise the question of jurisdiction at trial.” From that order Briggs has appealed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Frisch avers that, on May 25, 1959, as a pump attendant and operating engineer, he was working on a sewer construction project in Boothwyn, Delaware County; while so employed, he was working near a pump which exploded causing him personal injuries; that Briggs had manufactured the engine which was attached to the pump which exploded; that this engine had been “sold, leased, consigned, bailed and/or delivered to” either one or both of two named Philadelphia concerns which had, by either or both concerns, been “sold, leased, rented, bailed, consigned, supplied, serviced and/or delivered” to the general contractor on the sewer project by whom Frisch was employed; that Briggs knew or should have known the likelihood of persons in Frisch’s status being in the vicinity of the pump, that the pump was being used in a manner to be anticipated by Briggs and that the manner of injury could have been foreseen by Briggs. Specifically, Briggs was charged with negligence as follows: (1) of failure of care in making, testing and inspecting the engine; (2) failure to warn of latent defects; (3) failure to properly design engine; (4) failure to provide proper safety designs; (5) failure to continue to warn of latent defects; (6) failure to warn after engine was discovered to be defective; (7) failure to give adequate directions for use of engine; (8) failure to adhere to proper safety standards in the manufacture, inspection and testing of the engine; (9) that it made repairs without discovering defects; (10) failure to instruct <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>on operation of engine; (11) failure to select proper materials to construct engine.</p>

The record clearly shows that the engine was manufactured in Wisconsin and that the delivery of this product, as all other products of Briggs, was made f.o.b. some point in Wisconsin to either or both of two Pennsylvania business concerns. The court below stated: “Impliedly, if not specifically, it would appear from the pleadings that [Frisch’s] action arose from ‘acts or omissions’ of the corporation within the Commonwealth.” The burden was upon Frisch, as a prerequisite to the use of the “long arm” provisions of §1011B to secure <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction, to establish that the action which he instituted arose out of “acts or omissions” of Briggs within Pennsylvania; neither impliedly nor expressly has such been shown and Frisch has not sustained his burden.
