A hearing was held thereon by the court, which it was agreed would also serve the purpose of an independent hearing to determine the voluntariness of the statements, as required by <em>Jackson v. Den</em>no, <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">378 U.S. 368</a> (1964). Extensive testimony was heard. Later the court filed a comprehensive opinion detailing its factual findings, and conclusion that the statements of Schmidt were freely and voluntarily given under circumstances devoid of any violation of constitutional rights. The motion to suppress was, therefore, denied. Subsequently, the evidence of Schmidt’s statements to the police was admitted against him over objection at trial. The question of voluntari<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>ness was left to the jury to resolve under careful instructions of the trial court.</p>

It is also admitted that at the time Schmidt was without the assistance of counsel. However, other important facts as to the circumstances under which the statements were made and his treatment by the police during custody are in serious dispute. The Commonwealth’s testimony on this facet of the case may be summarized as follows:</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[206,1060,1155,641]]]'>Schmidt was questioned intermittently by various investigating officers each day from June 15th to June 19 th. No extensive periods of questioning occurred, and the interviews were conducted in a reasonable, if not friendly, manner, and without abuse, coercive or overbearing conduct. Before he was initially questioned, Schmidt was warned that he did not have to answer any questions and anything he said would be used against him in court. He was also informed that he had the right to be represented by an attorney of his own choice; to which he replied, he did not wish an attorney at that time.</p>
    <p id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[202,1713,1151,641]],["BL_475.1",475,[154,360,1150,535]]]'>■When first questioned, Schmidt admitted having committed five other burglaries in the north side section of Pittsburgh in recent months, but denied any participation in the Mannerchor burglary. He persisted in this denial until June 19th. About 8:45 p.m. o’clock on that date, he was taken into the presence of Baurle and Thornton, both of whom had previously given formal written statements to the police admitting their part in the Mannerchor burglary, and implicating Schmidt as a co-participant and the assailant of Meier. Upon request, they orally repeated these admissions and accusations in the presence of Schmidt, which <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>statements were recorded on tape. Schmidt was then asked if he had anything to say. He replied that, “it happened like Kenny says. I hit the guy.” Then, in answer to questions, he orally related the details of the crime, and his statements were likewise recorded on tape. At or near the end of this questioning he was advised that he didn’t have to make a statement, and unless he consented to the use of his taped statement, it would be destroyed and not used against him. He replied that he Avished the recording preserved.</p>
    <p id="b475-3" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[153,908,1151,480]]]'>Shortly thereafter he repeated in more complete fashion the occurrence involved. This statement was reduced to typewritten form and Avhen completed, the Avritiug Avas initialed on each page and signed at the end by Schmidt. Before this formal statement was taken, he was again warned of his right to remain silent and that anything he said Avould be used against him in court. At no time during the police custody or questioning did he request the assistance of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[152,1398,1150,256]]]'>During the police custody period from June 15 th to June 19th, no one asked to or visited Schmidt, except the pastor of a nearby Catholic church. This visit, in private, on the night of June 18th lasted about one hour.</p>
    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.6",475,[151,1672,1150,694]]]'>The evidence submitted by Schmidt conflicted in many Avays Avith that offered by the Commomvealth. In brief, it asserted in relevant part, that Schmidt was never advised of his right to the assistance of counsel during the police questioning; that such assistance Avas denied despite several requests for it; that he was constantly interrogated by the police during the entire custody period with only necessary interruptions consumed by sleeping and eating; that he was threatened and physically abused by several interrogating officers; and that his mother was denied the opportunity of seeing him during the custody period despite efforts to do so.</p>

    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[198,680,1155,1180]]]'>After a careful consideration of all of the testimony in the record concerning the circumstances under which the incriminating statements of Schmidt were obtained, it is our studied conclusion that the question of the voluntariness thereof was for the jury to decide. Hence, the court below did not err in admitting the evidence thereof at trial or in refusing to suppress it. The evidence offered by Schmidt, indicating the statements resulted from abusive and overbearing police conduct, did not in itself render the evidence inadmissible. In view of the Commonwealth’s testimony, which amply supported the conclusion that the statements were the free and voluntary act of Schmidt and obtained in the absence of physical and psychological coercive circumstances, it was for the jury to assess all of the testimony and determine the true facts. The verdict clearly indicates its findings. Moreover, two judges below who, in separate occasions, heard all of the testimony concerning the circumstances under which the statements were elicited arrived at the same conclusion, namely, that the statements were freely and voluntarily made. Our conclusion is to the same effect.</p>

His testimony to the contrary was rejected below as unworthy of belief. Additionally, it was established that before any questioning commenced he was warned <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>that he did not have to answer any questions. Also, that this warning, in words of like import, was repeated on two additional occasions during the questioning period. In this connection, it is significant to note that even Schmidt admitted in his own testimony that such a warning was given before he signed the typewritten statement, and that in the forepart thereof was included the following question and answer: “Q.: Before going any further I am now going to advise you of your constitutional rights in which you either have the right to give or refuse to give this statement which will be used either for you or against you at the time of your trial, which do you wish to do? A.

It is unquestionably true that “in a trial on a murder indictment the jury has the <em>exclusive </em>right to fix the degree of guilt and may not be deprived of this right, even though the only evidence in the case establishes that the killing was committed in the perpetration of a felony:” <em>Commonwealth v.

However, our reading of the charge in the instant case discloses no violation of this legal principle.

The only evidence that Schmidt waived his right to counsel is contained in the testimony of Detective Tercsak who stated that on the day of the defendant’s arrest he warned him of his constitutional right to remain silent and of his right to be represented by counsel. Significantly, while Detective Tercsak recorded on a “police action sheet” that he had informed the defendant of these rights, he did not record the fact that the defendant responded by saying that he did not want counsel at that time. If Tercsak’s purpose was to make a record of his action in case of a future challenge, as it evidently was, I find it inconceivable that he did not also record the denial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> Moreover, the interrogation took place prior to the decision in <em>Escobedo </em>and it was admitted by the police at the hearing that at the time of the instant interrogation they did not as a general rule inform suspects of their right to representation.

If it were clear that this, and not police pressures, were the precipitating force in eliciting the confession, it would be admissible. But it is impossible to determine at this date to what extent the incommunicado interrogation had taken its toll. If at the time of the confession Schmidt’s will was “overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired, the use of his confession offends due process. Rogers v.
