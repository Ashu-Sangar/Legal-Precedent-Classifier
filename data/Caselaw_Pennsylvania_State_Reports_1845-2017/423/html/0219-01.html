The powers exclusively given to the Commission were plenary in the field and included the power to determine what coal was required to adequately support the highway, what coal — unnecessary to the support of the highway— could be mined and the value of the coal to be left in place of which the owner of the coal or person ■entitled to remove such coal would be deprived.</p>

There, the property owner petitioned the court to appoint a board of viewers to assess damages for land and coal taken by the Commonwealth for the reconstruction and widening of a state highway; the Commonwealth filed preliminary objections on the ground that the exclusive jurisdiction to assess damages for coal required to be left in place to furnish support for the highway was vested in the Commission; the court sustained the Commonwealth’s objections and then directed the board of viewers to proceed to assess damages to the surface of the land and the Commission to be convened for the purpose of assessing damages for the coal required to be left in place. Both parties joined in convening the Commission and, prior to a meeting of the Commission, the parties stipulated as to the amount of coal required to be left in place leaving to the Commission’s determination the fixing of damages for such coal.
