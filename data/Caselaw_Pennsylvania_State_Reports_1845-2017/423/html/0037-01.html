One day Murray called Donald C. Haas, an employee of the Lanston firm, and asked him to obtain from Lanston some certain prints of a “perforating machine,” for which Murray would .pay Haas $25. Haas reported this conversation to his superiors and then the Lanston firm employed E. J. Charters Associates, private detectives, to entrap John Murray. The agency assigned four men to the job.</p>

The mechanical device having been tested and found to be in working order, one of the detective operatives, Harry J. Morris, called the defendant Murray in Adams County, and then, when the connection had been made, turned the call over to Haas who talked to Murray. Murray said to Haas that on the following day he would come to Haas’s home to pick up the “prints” and pay him $25. He did so, and was later arrested and charged with offering to bribe and bribing a corporate employe in violation of the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §667, 18 P.S. §4667.</p>

      <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>We have seen that the Act of 1957 specifically states that there may be no interception “without permission of the parties to such communication.”. Who were the parties to the communication in this case? Donald Haas and John Murray. It is obvious that detective Morris had the consent of Haas to intercept hi's communication with Murray, but it is equally transparent he did not have the consent of Murray, the defendant. According to the specific wording of the Act, the detective had to have the approval of both parties, not only one, before he could straddle the telephone wires. ‘</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.4",80,[209,1000,1150,533]]]'>The Superior Court, the court below, and the Commonwealth have cited several federal cases in assumed support of their position that the consent of Murray was- not necessary, but the federal cases on this point are not authoritative since the Congressional Act on communication interception differs vitally from the Pennsylvania statute. Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%201103" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="48 Stat. 1103">48 Stat. 1103</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7605" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="47 U.S.C. §605">47 U.S.C. §605</a>, declares, inter alia, that “no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication.”</p>

The lower court said: “The language of the statute is not clear as to whether consent of <em>both </em>parties' or only one party is essential to avoid the statute . . .' We are not satisfied that failure to obtain consent of both parties constitutes a violation of the statute.” The lower court apparently is hard to satisfy in reading simple and unadorned English. The statute specifies that there may be no interception “without permission of the <em>parties </em>to such communication.” Parties certainly means more than one. Moreover, the his<a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>tory of this legislation reinforces the inevitable conclusion that telephonic interloping is illegal unless the individuals at both ends of the conversation agree that what they say to one another may be made public. When the Pennsylvania Act passed the State Senate, the prohibition read: “No person shall intercept a communication by telephone or telegraph without permission of <em>one </em>of the parties.” (Senate Bill No. 97, Printer’s No. 21, 1957.) However, this restriction to the consent of only one party was decisively rejected in the House by a vote of 128 to 61. The bill was then amended to provide for the consent of all <em>parties </em>to the communication before the interception could be defended. (Legislative Journal, 1957, Yol. II, pp. 1679, 1729, 1730, 1804.)</p>
    <p id="b81-3" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[118,1178,1156,916]]]'>The Commonwealth contends that, regardless of the physical wire tapping in this case, which cannot be considered in any light other than a flagrant violation of the Act, the conviction of Murray is sustainable because the detective Morris testified to what he had heard on the extension telephone and not what was recorded by the wire tapping device. This argument overshoots the record. A written transcript was made of the telephone conversation recorded by the inter-' cepting device. Detective Morris read this transcript not once but three times. When he testified, was he testifying to what he heard on the telephone extension or what he had read in the transcript? If his testimony was predicated on what was contained in the transcript, that testimony would fall within the ban of the Act as certainly as would the transcript of the recording itself.</p>
    <p id="b81-4" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[122,2106,1151,252]],["BL_82.1",82,[205,354,1148,642]]]'>The lower court cited in support of the conviction the case of <em>Nardone v. U.

That case, instead of functioning as a pillar to support the conviction, operates as a wrecker’s ball to smash it loose from its foundations. The Court said in the <em>Nardone </em>
      <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>case that once it is shown that there has been an unlawful wire tapping, as was shown here, the accused has to be allowed the opportunity “to prove that a substantial portion of the case against him was a fruit of the poisonous tree.” That is all the <em>Tsfa/rdone </em>case established and, in fact, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction and sent the case back for retrial because Nardone had not been given the opportunity to show how much of the prosecution evidence was tainted. The Supreme Court very specifically referred to the wire tapping committed by government agents in that case as “illicit practices.”</p>

When he was asked whether, as he listened, he wrote down what he heard, he replied that he had not employed pencil and paper because it was not to be left to the memory to “remember on this date what was said.” The recording of the conversation was to be done in another way. “We had it taped.” This answer in itself could be enough to overturn the conviction because it demonstrates that the whole criminal prosecution, from its very tainted genesis, was to be based on the wire tapping and the recording taken from the wire tap.</p>

The investigations of all detectives, and particularly private detectives, are invari<a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>ably reduced to writing because they must make a report on wbat they have done to those who hired them. A report was made here and that report contained the whole transcript of the recording taken from the wire tap. Detective Morris testified: “Q. And it [the transcript of the wire taping] is contained in the report that you have rendered to your superior and your superior to the client that engaged you; is that correct? A. That is substantially correct. Q. Now, sir, you have a copy of that report with you? A. Yes, sir.

You worded it word for word, did you not? A. Yes, sir. I would say that. Q. And you read not only what you just testified as to what you recall, but other phases of this alleged conversation, did you not? A. Yes, sir . . . Q.

The Act specifies: “No person shall divulge or use the contents or purport of a communication intercepted in violation of this act.” Nor was the detective excused from his infraction of the law because this divulgence occurred in a courtroom and during a judicial proceeding. The statute specifically proclaims that: “The term ‘divulge’ includes divulgence to a fellow employe or official in government or private enterprise or <em>in a judicial, </em>administrative, legislative or other proceeding.”</p>

Both the lower court and the Superior Court stated in their respective opinions, and the Commonwealth equally contends, that there is nothing illegal about someone listening in on a telephone extension, without the consent of the parties conversing on that wire, and then divulging the contents of that conversation to others. This position demonstrates another misreading of- the Act. The Act declares in a no-nonsense fashion that “No person shall install or employ any device for over<a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>hearing, or recording communications passing through a telephone or telegraph line with intent to intercept a communication in violation of this act.”</p>

The business and professional man has a telephone extension so his secretary may answer the telephone and inform him when he is wanted. The well-to-do householder has a telephone extension so that, when he calls his family, more than one of his loved ones may revel in the warmth and cheeriness of his greetings, share in the joy of his gladsome tidings, or obtain the directions which the master conveys. But this does not say that, because a telephone extension has been installed in the business office or in the home, a stranger may listen in, or that a detective may snoop, or that a blackmailer may legally obtain the secrets which will enable him to ply his nefarious trade. The Commonwealth seems to be of the impression that because a telephone extension is more or less permanent and a wire tap is an ad hoc procedure, the former can be used illegitimately. If it entertains that idea, it cannot point to anything in the Act of 1957 which gives that notion substance, approbation or even encouragement.</p>

The <em>Rathbun </em>case cannot possibly be binding on the Pennsylvania courts because,, as has been said, the federal statute on the subject of wire tapping requires the consent of <em>only one </em>of the communicants in order to render evidence obtained from wire-tapping evidence admissible. The Pennsylvania statute demands the approval of <em>all parties </em>involved in the telephone, conversation. The very first paragraph in the <em>Rathbun </em>opinion reads: “This case concerns the issue of whether the contents of a communication overheard on a regularly used telephone extension <em>with the consent of one party </em>to the conversa<a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>tion are admissible in federal court.” Thus, the phrase “one party” is emphasized, bnt in the Pennsylvania statute, and we must repeat, we have the specific language: “No person shall intercept a communication by telephone or telegraph <em>without permission of the </em>Parties to such communication.” Parties obviously means all persons involved. Here the parties were Murray and Haas. Haas gave his consent but Murray did not.

The Supreme Court’s holding was based on a construction of the term interception which in the federal statute, like our own statute, is key to determining the range of conduct sought to be proscribed. In interpreting the Pennsylvania statute, we are of course bound in no way to accept the Supreme Court’s interpretation of interception in the federal statute, as much persuasive weight as we naturally accord that Court’s holding on the matter. Moreover, since our statute was adopted prior to the decision in <em>Ratftbun, </em>at a time when lower federal courts disagreed on whether the federal statute reached the <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>conduct in issue in the present case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> it is clearly impossible to infer from federal cases whether the Pennsylvania Legislature intended interception to encompass overhearing on an extension phone without the consent of one of the parties. I thus find it appropriate to examine and evaluate the considerations which underlie the decision in <em>Rathbun </em>as well as the other cases which have treated the question.</p>

A mere passing acquaintance with the daily newspaper suffices to substantiate the existence of a widely felt and insidious threat to individual privacy posed, not only by technological advances, but also by the evolution of contemporary social structures. A jealous regard for individual privacy is a judicial tradition of distinguished origin, buttressed in many areas by the imperative mandate of constitutional guarantees. Protection of individual privacy, however, appears frequently to reduce the methods available to law enforcement agencies in the detection and prosecution of crime. New would deny that in this country today concern with the growth of criminal activity is of the same order of magnitude as the concern with the erosion of individual privacy. And, as Judge Clark of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit pointed out in his excellent dissent in <em>United States v. Polakoff, </em><a href="/f2d/112/0888-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="112 F.2d 888" data-case-ids="1026770" data-case-paths="/f2d/112/0888-01">112 F. 2d 888</a>, 891-93 (2d Cir. 1940), the more broadly the legislative meaning of interception is interpreted, the more thoroughly insulated a means for criminal activity the telephone becomes. The majority in <em>Rathbun, </em>as well as most judges who reach the same result, also urge that to construe interception to include over<a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>hearing on an extension phone would be to impute to the Legislature the unlikely intention of proscribing as criminal the commonplace and innocuous convenience of having business associates and family members listen into a conversation without bothering to inform the caller.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

By so doing, no one denies the Legislature decided that the right of any caller to the privacy of his phone conversation was more important than the interest served by permitting police or anyone else to tap wires. The statutory language “shall install or employ any device for overhearing” to my mind admits of no sensible distinction between a wiretap and an extension phone. Thus unless we are compelled by the statutory use of the word interception itself, a compulsion which I find impossible to entertain, there is no reason for concluding, as the dissenting and other concurring opinion apparently does, that <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>while the Legislature clearly valued individual privacy more highly than the right to tap wires without permission, it nonetheless valued individual privacy less than the right to overhear conversations by an extension phone without permission. Indeed I am at a complete loss to imagine what purpose is served by a statute, which at the outset requires permission of more than one of the parties to “interception” of a telephone conversation, if by the simple expedient of resorting to listening in on an extension telephone, the needed permission of one of the parties is completely dispensed with. To so hold, would I believe, obliterate the practical effect which, as the majority opinion indicates, the Legislature had very distinctly in mind.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> Moreover, if overhearing by extension phone without consent of one party is not proscribed by the statute it seems obvious that such overhearing without consent of either party would not be proscribed. Thus, users of the telephone would be at the mercy of those who wish to pry into confidences intended by neither user to reach other ears. Such results I am extremely reluctant to believe the Legislature intended.</p>

It may well be sufficient to answer this difficulty by saying that the language of the statute taken as a whole and read with common sense leaves no doubt in my mind that the Legislature intended to prevent the conduct at issue in this case, while the case of the overhearing secretary or relative may be dealt with when and if it arises. In any event, however, I believe the difficulty could be overcome by construing the statutory term <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>“permission” to encompass both, expressed and implied permission. Thus when a call is made in circumstances where it would ordinarily be unreasonable to believe that one caller would have any objection to the overhearing of the conversation on an extension phone, I see no reason why that caller’s permission cannot be implied, and I seriously doubt whether substantial practical difficulty would result from such a rule.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> Admittedly, such a construction of the statutory term “permission” is not the most natural one, and I would not be inclined to adopt it in the normal course of statutory interpretation. But if absent such a construction of permission here, I would find myself forced to the Hobson’s choice of emasculating the practical effect of the statute or construing it to impose criminal liability for conduct which I find it hard to imagine the Legislature deemed even faintly undesirable, then that is the construction I would adopt. Finally, it reassures me no little amount that the solution of this problem suggested here is substantially along the lines followed by Judge Learned Hand in <em>Polalcoff.</em>

Appellant, urges that the <em>Keenan </em>case, which involved a prosecution for blackmail in Philadelphia County under the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §805, 18 P.S. §4805, of a defendant who telephoned a threat from another county to Philadelphia, is distinguishable because the blackmail statute penalizes “whoever sends or delivers or utters” a threat and because jurisdiction in <em>Keenan </em>must therefore have been conferred on the Philadelphia court solely by virtue of the fact that the threat was <em>delivered </em>in Philadelphia. To employ the verb “deliver” to describe the process by which a caller’s conduct effects the transmission of words to a listener in a telephone conversation involves, in my opinion, no less strain on common usage than to characterize the same process by the words “send” or “utter”. Thus, I find no reason to believe that jurisdiction in <em>Keenan </em>depended solely on the verb deliver. Moreover, I find nothing in the appellant’s citation of <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Sickler v. Yaukey, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/11/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="11 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 11" data-case-ids="1625502" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/11/0011-01">11 Pa.

L. 427, §6, 19 P.S. §23 was properly exercised by the Court of Quarter Sessions of Westmoreland County over a threat telephoned by the defendant from Allegheny County to a woman in Westmoreland County. The basis of this distinction, appellant urges, is that the state of mind of the recipient of the call in <em>Taut </em>was an element of the offense and hence the offense could be located in the county where the woman heard the threat, whereas in the instant case the offeree of the bribe’s state of mind is irrelevant to the offense. What appellant disregards, however, is that the offense of offering to bribe can hardly be made out absent perception by the offeree of the offer. Whether or not this perception is correctly characterized as a “state of mind”, is thus irrelevant. Appellant’s reliance on the language in <em>Commonwealth v. Friedman, </em><a href="/pa-super/193/0640-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="193 Pa. Super. 640" data-case-ids="750461" data-case-paths="/pa-super/193/0640-01">193 Pa.

In the <em>Friedman </em>case the issue of the trial court’s jurisdiction over the offense was neither raised nor discussed, and the language was used in such a way as to persuade me that the court did not intend by it a catalogue of all the elements of the offense of offering to bribe.</p>

This exact issue has not previously arisen in Pennsylvania, but was decided by the United State Supreme Court in <em>Rathbun v. United, States, </em><a href="/us/355/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="355 U.S. 107" data-case-ids="6162905" data-case-paths="/us/355/0107-01">355 U. S. 107</a> (1957). In that case, the accused was charged with transmitting a threatening interstate communication by telephone in violation of federal statutes. Police officers were permitted to testify that they had heard the accused make the threat in question when, with the consent of the person threatened, they listened to the incriminating telephone conversation over a regularly used telephone extension. Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act provides that no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication by telephone and divulge its existence or contents. The Supreme Court held that §605 was not violated because there was no interception as Congress intended that the word be used. Thus the Supreme Court of the United States has declared that the act of listening to a conversation over an extension telephone is not an interception, and it is irrelevant whether or not there was consent by one or both of the parties. “Each party to a telephone conversation takes the risk that the other party may have an extension telephone and may allow another to overhear the conversation. When such takes place there has been no violation of any privacy of which the parties may complain.” <a href="/citations/?q=355%20U.S.%20111" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="355 U.S. 111">355 U.

It will unreasonably hamper the police in their enforcement and investigatory techniques more than any other decision possibly could. As a result of the majority opinion the police will be forbidden, under penalty of law, to overhear a telephone request for ransom in a kidnapping case; and the obscene or <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>threatening telephone caller will be able to harass and terrify his defenseless victim, secure in the knowledge that neither the police nor the telephone operator may listen in for the purpose of obtaining evidence or tracing the call. That the United States Supreme Court recognized this reasoning is evidenced by the observation in <em>Rathbim </em>that: “The telephone extension is a widely used instrument of home and office, yet with nothing to evidence congressional intent, petitioner argues that Congress meant to place a severe restriction on its ordinary use by subscribers, denying them the right to allow a family member, an employee, a trusted friend, or even the police to listen to a conversation to which a subscriber is a party.

However, the court did allow the investigator to testify concerning the contents of the conversation which he had overheard on the extension despite the fact that he stated that on at least three occasions he had read a typewritten transcript of that conversation. The majority opinion contends that this is error because the witness was testifying from what he recalled the transcript said, not from what he recalled of the conversation itself. This is incorrect, for the witness stated that he did not use the transcript to re<a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>fresh, his recollection; rather, he testified that he was able to recall from memory alone those portions of the conversation which incriminated the defendant.
