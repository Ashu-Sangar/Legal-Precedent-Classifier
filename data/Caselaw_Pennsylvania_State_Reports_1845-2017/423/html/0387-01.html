On July 4, 1955, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Gerard McKenna, [McKenna], on a charge of reckless driving in Waverly, New York, on July 2, 1955. The chief of police of Waverly, accompanied by a Pennsylvania state police officer, went to Buffalo, New York, where McKenna was apprehended and returned to Waverly.

Prior to entering his plea for “a very short time” McKenna met with his counsel, a meeting which took place in the presence of certain prosecution officials, including the police, and Mc-<a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>Kenna’s mother. At the habeas corpus hearing, there was testimony that McKenna’s counsel then informed him that, if he had taken part in the crime and would enter a plea of not guilty, he would, by so doing, open himself to a charge of perjury in addition to the crime of which he was charged.</p>
    <p id="b429-3" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[140,685,1150,701]]]'>McKenna was sentenced to prison for a minimum term of 4 years and a maximum term of 20 years. The habeas corpus court stated: “In this case the sentence imposed was within the legal limits of a burglary sentence and to that extent the sentence was not illegal. But, the sentence of the court was for burglary and larceny and there is nothing in the record of the sentencing court or in this court allowing any inference other than that the defendant stole a safe and the $609 therein.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> After McKenna had served a portion of his sentence he was paroled. Later, he was returned to prison as a parole violator and he is presently serving the unexpired portion of his sentence.</p>

With this conclusion we disagree. The circumstances presented preclude the application of a rule that such irregularities could be waived by the entry of the guilty plea when represented by counsel.</p>

Admittedly, counsel had read only the indictment and did not examine the transcript or other records and it is evident he was unfamiliar with what transpired at the preliminary hearing. Moreover, McKenna knew that he had been charged only with burglary and did not know he was being charged with “stealing” the safe and money therein, the “dolly” and the chain. Consultation between McKenna and counsel consumed a “very short time” and took place in the presence of the prosecuting officials, including the police. The brevity and environment of such consultation certainly did not equate the type of consultation between lawyer and client contemplated by the law. By his own admission at the habeas corpus hearing, counsel told McKenna that, if he denied the crime and plead not guilty he might become liable for another crime and counsel advised McKenna “not to add perjury to the crime already committed”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> This advice added a co<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>ercive element which casts doubt on whether the entry of the plea was an exercise of McKenna’s free and untrammeled volition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b431-3" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[139,519,1150,636]]]'>Moreover, when McKenna was asked by counsel whether he had committed the “crime” it was only reasonable for him to conclude counsel meant the only crime with which he had been charged at the preliminary hearing, i.e., burglary, especially in the absence of any evidence he had read the indictment. By the same token, it is understandable that counsel, having read only the indictment charges and lacking any knowledge of what transpired previous to the preparation of the indictment, was talking about the charges in the indictment when he referred to the “crime”.</p>

    <p id="b431-5" data-blocks='[["BL_431.6",431,[139,1394,1151,646]]]'>Generally, a defendant, who, when represented by counsel, enters a plea of guilty cannot be heard to say later that he was ignorant of the charges in the indictment to which he plead guilty. However, it is the duty of a reviewing court to determine whether the decision of an accused to enter the plea of guilty was voluntarily, intelligently and understandingly made. Because of the serious consequences which are attendant on the entry of a plea of guilty, strict adherence must not be had to the rule that knowledge of counsel is imputable to the accused: <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

We have no way of assessing the extent to which McKenna’s admission of guilt of the larceny charges influenced the sentencing judge in determining the appropriate sentence; at the same time, we cannot find that such admission did not so influence the court that it acted to McKenna’s prejudice. See: <em>Townsend v. Burke, </em><a href="/us/334/0736-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="334 U.S. 736" data-case-ids="6159179" data-case-paths="/us/334/0736-01">334 U.S. 736</a>, 740 (1948).</p>

The refusal to issue the Great Writ under such circumstances would continue the imprisonment of a person for the commission of crimes, i.e. larceny of the safe and money, the “dolly” and the chain, which, concededly, he never committed. In such posture, niceties of the law and adherence to general rules must yield to the attainment of substantial justice.</p>

However, at the preliminary hearing, the charge being burglary, McKenna had no statutory right to be heard even had he so demanded, and therefore, the fact that an indictment containing this charge was drawn up against him cannot be viewed as prejudicial. Because the larceny counts must be dismissed, McKenna is now in the same position as he would have been had the facts at the time of the 1955 preliminary hearing been as he and his counsel evidently believed them to be.</p>
