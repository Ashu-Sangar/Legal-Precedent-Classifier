(Western) and Mac Coal Company (Mac), enterprises controlled by George N. Pennington, required performance bonds to comply with the provisions of the Bituminous Coal Open Pit Conservation Mining Act, 52 P.S. §1396.4 (g). Resolute posted the bonds and in return secured from Western, Mac, Pennington and his wife a written contract of indemnity designed to protect Resolute against loss. Dolores Hewitt, daughter of George N. Pennington, executed the contract as surety. The agreement contained, inter alia, the following provision: “That the company has become bound under the said bonds for the special benefit of the principal and the indemnitor and the special benefit and protection of the property of the principal and the indemnitor, their income and earnings. That the indemnitor is substantially and beneficially interested in obtaining the said suretyship. That the company looks <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>to and relies upon and shall at all times have the right to look to and rely upon, recover from, and follow the property which the principal and the indemnitor now have and which they hereafter may have and the income and earnings thereof for any sum or sums due or to become due the company under this agreement.” Also, a provision that in the event of default on the contract, entry of judgment and execution, the indemnitors would claim “no benefit of exemption . . . under and by virtue of any exemption law now in force or which may be hereafter passed.”</p>
    <p id="b513-3" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[105,961,1155,425]]]'>Resolute was later called upon to pay under the provisions of the bonds and sustained a loss, which they now seek to collect from the indemnitors. It confessed judgment against Mary H. Pennington and Dolores Hewitt on April 7, 1966, for the sum of $127,409.65 including $16,618 as attorney’s commission for collection. The confession of judgment was pursuant to a warrant of attorney contained in the contract.</p>

The leading case is <em>Provident Trust Company v. Rothman, </em><a href="/pa/321/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="321 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1165908" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0177-01">321 Pa. 177</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=183%20A.%20793" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="183 A. 793">183 A. 793</a> (1936). As stated therein, this statute was intended to protect the family of the insured, and their creditors may not attach proceeds due them under a life insurance contract, so long as such funds remain in the hands of the insurance company. See also, <em>Irving Bank v. Alexander, </em><a href="/pa/280/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="280 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="1084451" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0466-01">280 Pa. 466</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.%20634" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="124 A. 634">124 A. 634</a> (1924). This is so even if the proceeds are payable under an annuity plan, for which option the contract provides, and the proceeds of the policy are converted into an annuity certificate. And this rule applies with equal force whether the election to receive the proceeds through annuity payments is made by the insured during his lifetime, or by the beneficiary after the insured’s death: <em>Provident Trust Company v. Rothman, </em>supra.</p>

This, in our opinion, raises the crucial and dispositive question in this case, namely, whether the protection afforded by the Acts of 1923, supra, may be effectively waived by one whom the legislature intended to protect. We conclude not.</p>

To protect security so afforded, the legislature in clear language exempted such funds from invasion by creditors of the beneficiaries and from levy or attachment for the payment of their debts so long as the funds remain in the hands of the insurer. The legislation, undoubtedly, had in mind the common good and was based upon persuasive considerations of public policy. See, <em>Weil v.

It is urged that this constituted an effective assignment of all of their assets, including the insurance policy, and that the issue is controlled by <em>Lemley v.

        <em> </em>The argument that parties have a right to make their own contracts is not apposite where a matter of sufficient public policy is at stake.
