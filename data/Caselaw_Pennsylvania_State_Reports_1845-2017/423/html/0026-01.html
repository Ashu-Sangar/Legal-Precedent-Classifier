Moreover, even in the absence of the statutory phrasing of §351, we would be reluctant to sanction a <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>rule of procedure which would require that one seeking habeas corpus act through an intermediary in order to secure consideration of his grievance. In our view, such a requirement would deprive relator of the important personal right to petition for habeas corpus on his own behalf. The purpose of the writ would be dis-served were persons restrained of liberty precluded from seeking habeas corpus unless able to secure representation of counsel or the good offices of a guardian or next of friend.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Accordingly, §155(a) and (b) of the Rules of Court of Wayne County, by limiting the personal right to petition for habeas corpus, constitutes an impermissible restraint on that right and was beyond the court’s power to promulgate under the Act of June 21, 1937, P. L. 1982, 17 P.S. §61 et seq.</p>

As previously noted, relator’s 1949 sentence has expired and his continued detention in Farview arises by reason of his commitment pursuant to The Mental Health Act. Our examination of the. provisions of the Act which govern the disposition of persons detained thereunder whose commitment occurred while subject to a criminal sentence which has <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>since expired raises serious constitutional questions under the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Baxstrom v.

However, we are unwilling to consider those questions without the benefit of briefs and arguments by both parties to the present proceedings. Under the particular circumstances of this case, we are of the view that on remand, the habeas corpus court should appoint counsel to represent relator both for the presentation of the contentions advanced in his petition and any issue respecting his confinement which may have arisen by reason of the <em>Baxstrom </em>decision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
