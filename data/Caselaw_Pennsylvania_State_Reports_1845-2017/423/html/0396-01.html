Well, she staggered on across to the wall and fell on her left side, and Mrs. Bowers and I picked her np and she did quite a bit of screaming and complaining and she was hurt pretty bad. Q. Did your wife say anything to you as to why she stumbled or fell? A. She claimed she had caught her feet in the door. . . . Q. And then where did she end up? A. She was off balance and she left the door, staggering as though you wouldn’t catch your balance, often do, you’ve probably done it yourself, she was off balance a.nd she went over and her hand struck this wall on this candy company and she fell back, she was on the edge of the, right on what I’d say was about the edge of the cement. Q. Now, at any time there did you see her feet or any of her feet in the vicinity of the sill and particularly where it touches the concrete slab on the outside? A. It was too dark in there to see people’s feet, I would say, but I could tell when she started— . . . Q. All right, and when she first came out, was she erect at that time? A. She was erect, but staggering.” Mrs. Bower testified as follows: “Q. O.K. Now, you tell us exactly what you observed as she opened the door and went outside. A. As she went out the door and I followed, the first thing or the only thing that I recall was of her putting her hand out, sort of groping to get ahold of something, and the next thing, she was in a sprawling position. Now, that’s as near as I can tell you what happened; this thing happened so quickly that it’s hard to just remember every little detail, because you’re not expecting things like that.”</p>
