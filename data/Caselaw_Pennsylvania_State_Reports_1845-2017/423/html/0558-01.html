    <p id="b597-8" data-blocks='[["BL_597.10",597,[128,994,1151,371]]]'>On September 30, 1964, the appellant, Anthony Scoleri, was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree and punishment was fixed at death. A motion for a new trial was argued before the court en bane on May 24, 1965. It was dismissed July 26, 1965, and on the same day sentence was imposed as the jury directed. No appeal was entered from the judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b597-9" data-blocks='[["BL_597.11",597,[126,1377,1153,471]]]'>On October 15, 1965 (81 days after judgment of sentence), Scoleri instituted this action in habeas corpus contending that he was denied due process of law in connection with his right to appeal, particularly that he had been denied his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel for “the purpose of taking an appeal”. After hearing, the trial court dismissed the proceedings. An appeal from that order is now before us.</p>
    <p id="b597-10" data-blocks='[["BL_597.12",597,[127,1868,1152,205]],["BL_598.1",598,[188,348,1151,577]]]'>Throughout the trial, during argument of the post trial motion and also the sentence proceeding, Scoleri was represented by one John Rogers Carroll, Esq., of the Philadelphia bar, who is recognized as an experi<a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>enced and competent advocate. Carroll was retained by Seoleri’s sister, Margaret Sbraccia, who promised to pay a fee of $5000 which was to cover only his services at trial. Two thousand dollars of the agreed amount was paid; the balance was not. At the time of argument for a new trial below, Carroll said to Mrs. Sbraccia, “Look, you haven’t done what you promised to do, I am not going on with this thing.” After the imposition of sentence, because he had not received the balance of his fee, Carroll did nothing further on behalf of his client.</p>
    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[186,946,1151,475]]]'>Carroll did not inform the court of his intentions or request permission thereof to withdraw from the case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Neither did he ever inform Scoleri personally of his “withdrawal” or intention not to file an appeal. It further appears that he did not at any time discuss with Scoleri the prescribed time limit for filing an appeal, or in fact communicate with him or any member of his family in any manner following the day sentence was imposed.</p>

He also had the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in perfecting and prosecuting such an appeal: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Newsome v. Myers, </em>supra, and <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Cunningham v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/421/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="421 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="1900298" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0157-01">421 Pa. 157</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20811" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="218 A.2d 811">218 A. 2d 811</a> (1966). However, whether or not an appeal was to be filed and prosecuted was solely for Scoleri’s decision. It could be intentionally and knowingly abandoned. Further, his right to the assistance of counsel in the <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>filing and prosecuting of an appeal could be waived, if done so intelligently and understandingly: <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

But if he did not intentionally abandon his right to appeal, or if an intelligent and understanding waiver of his right to the assistance of counsel for this purpose were not effected, he cannot now be precluded from asserting these rights, even though the statutorily prescribed period for filing an appeal has run. See, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Cunningham v. Maroney, </em>supra.</p>

Scoleri was not without experience in this regard. He had twice previously been convicted of first degree murder for the same killing, and in each instance prosecuted appeals to this Court.

He also said he attached no significance to the fact that Carroll had not communicated with him after the imposition of sentence, because Carroll had also not contacted him between the trial and the argument for a new trial, a period of seven months. The trial court found this testimony incredible, and many facts in the record justify this conclusion. However, since this is a death case and there is a possibility that Scoleri did act in good faith and rely on Carroll to perfect an appeal on his behalf, we have concluded to permit an appeal to be now filed without prejudice as if it had been timely filed. This will preclude any possible denial of the right to appeal.</p>
