Sprangle was arrested for a traffic violation in York in April 1964 and a routine check revealed that he was wanted in Pittsburgh for the murder of Green. In September 1964 Sprangle was tried by a jury on an indictment charging the murder of Green and convicted of voluntary manslaughter. At trial Sprangle admitted shooting Green, but claimed <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>that he did so in self-defense. This is an appeal by Sprangle from the denial without hearing of a habeas corpus petition attacking his 1964 conviction.</p>

We have examined the notes of testimony at the trial and believe that, under the standards laid down in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. LaRue v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/417/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="417 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1894059" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0383-01">417 Pa. 383</a>, 386-89, <a href="/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20829" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="207 A.2d 829">207 A. 2d 829</a>, 831-32 (1965), when viewed as a whole, the conduct of Sprangle’s defense was competent.

We believe that these contentions are adequately dealt with in the following excerpts from Judge Sheely’s opinion:</p>

Prior to the ‘Split Verdict Act’ of December 1, 1959, P. L. 1621 (18 P.S. 4701), the Commonwealth, in its case in chief, was permitted to introduce evidence of the defendant’s criminal record for the purpose of showing the jury the manner of man he was to aid it in fixing the penalty in the event of a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree. Since the enactment of that statute evidence of his prior criminal record cannot be introduced in the Commonwealth’s case in chief for that purpose, but can be introduced only after a verdict of murder in the first degree is returned and the jury is charged with the duty of fixing the penalty: See Commonwealth ex rel. Marino v. Myers, <a href="/pa/419/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="419 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="1896846" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0448-01">419 Pa. 448</a>, 450 (1965).</blockquote>

Counsel therefore had a choice of several courses of action. They could not call the petitioner as a witness and his criminal record then could not be given to the jury. But then the jury would not have had the <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>benefit of his explanation of what occurred, and his explanation was most important. They could have had the defendant testify without reference to his criminal record and then the Commonwealth would have introduced it. Or they could frankly admit the record as they did in this case and argue to the jury the honesty and truthfulness of the defendant in admitting his past. The choice was a matter of trial strategy and we are satisfied that the experienced and able counsel representing the petitioner acted wisely. . . .”</blockquote>
    <p id="b632-4" data-blocks='[["BL_632.4",632,[207,883,1152,1281]]]'>In his petition Sprangle also complains of his counsel’s failure to introduce into evidence the prior criminal record of the prosecution’s most important witness. Sprangle alleges that this witness had been convicted of fraud, forgery and cashing bad checks. Whether or not defense counsel actually knew of this alleged record, we do not believe the particular circumstances of Sprangle’s trial justify the conclusion that his conviction was vitiated by reason of his counsel’s failure to introduce the witness’s prior record. The defense’s theory of self-defense substantially relied on the credibility of the defendant’s version of the events surrounding the admitted shooting by him. Defense counsel could quite properly have concluded that impeachment of the credibility of an important prosecution witness by means of a prior conviction might make the jurors look with greater suspicion on the defendant’s testimony since defendant liad a substantial prior record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Thus, under the circumstances, if defense counsel actually knew of the pro i&gt;eution witness’s alleged prior record, he might propr-; y have chosen to ignore it, and if defense counsel did not know of the alleged record, the failure to introduce it need not have seriously prejudiced the defendant.</p>

      <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>Sprangle also argues that the prosecutor employed impermissible tactics in securing the conviction and made statements not supported by testimony. The only specific instances of such tactics alleged in the petition in the court below were the prosecutor’s statement that the defendant was “victimizing” a Mrs. Mary Jolley and other women and the prosecutor’s statement that the defendant was charged with a gun violation at the time of his arrest in York. The alleged statement concerning Mrs. Jolley and other women appears nowhere in the notes of testimony, and, therefore, if made at all must have been contained in the prosecutor’s argument. While we entertain some doubt as to the propriety of the alleged statement as to the victimization of “other women,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> we do not believe that in the circumstances of this case, Sprangle was entitled to a hearing to determine the truth of this allegation. It must be remembered that we have concluded, from an examination of the whole record, that Sprangle received a generally competent defense. This fact, coupled with the absence of any objection or other action of counsel to remedy the alleged remark, must in normal circumstances be considered a waiver of defendant’s rights in the matter; and since, in our view, defense counsel’s failure to attempt to remedy this sup<a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>posed remark would not of itself be so extraordinary an error as to constitute incompetent representation in and of itself, we believe Sprangle must be bound by counsel’s tactics in this matter, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Fox v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/417/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="417 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="1893958" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0308-01">417 Pa. 308</a>, 312-13, <a href="/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20810" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="207 A.2d 810">207 A. 2d 810</a>, 812-13 (1965).</p>
    <p id="b634-4" data-blocks='[["BL_634.4",634,[198,672,1151,967]]]'>Sprangle’s attack on the prosecutor’s “statement” about the gun violation at the time of his arrest appears to arise out of the following colloquy occurring during the prosecution’s cross-examination of defendant: “Q. Now you said you didn’t have a gun because you didn’t have a chance to get one between June and December? A. That’s correct. Q. When you were arrested you had a gun? A. I had a gun? Q. Yes. A.

Sprangle stated that he had handled this money for Mrs. Jolley in order to keep it from falling into the hands of Mrs. Jolley’s daughter and the daughter’s boyfriend, Green. One of the prosecution’s theories throughout the case was that Sprangle had appropriated the funds to his own use. Thus we do not believe the alleged statement about victimizing Mrs. Jolley may be characterized as totally unsupported by the record. Rather it was an inference from facts, established on the record, which the prosecutor sought to have the jurors draw.</p>
