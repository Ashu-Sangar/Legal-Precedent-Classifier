Therefore, previous decisions of this Court to the contrary notwithstanding, it is now the law that the prosecution may not use, at trial, evidence that an accused stood mute or failed to deny incriminating accusations, or statements made in his presence.

Of course, this right may be intentionally abandoned and effectively waived under appropriate circumstances: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Robinson v. Myers, </em>supra.

Whether or not Shadd effectively waived his right to the assistance of counsel in prosecuting a motion for a new trial and an appeal is not ascertainable from the present record.</p>

Mr. Grassberger: Yes, Sir. The Court: I have before me a motion for a new trial. Mr. Grassberger: That motion has been withdrawn. The Court: Shadd, you understand what Counsel has said?

I am pleased that this rule will no longer infect criminal justice in our Commonwealth, but I am disappointed that this result has been obtained only under the compulsion of the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>Miranda v.

    <p id="b130-4" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[210,567,1148,481]]]'>Furthermore, in my view, the introduction of a tacit admission so taints the trial proceedings that it deprives the defendant of a fair trial as a matter of federal constitutional law.

The issue in <em>Fox </em>was the admissibility of a confession, alleged to be involuntary for the first time in a habeas corpus petition. Because Fox’s lawyer was an experienced trial counsel who, at the time of Fox’s trial, knew that an involuntary confession was inadmissible, we held that the failure to object to the admissibility of the confession constituted a waiver. Shadd’s counsel, on the other hand, had no reason to suspect that a tacit admission could be excluded nor could he be expected to have foreseen the holding of <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em><a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">supra;</a> hence there can be no waiver of any objection. See <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.

Ct. 1602</a>, 1639, n. 69 (1966). Since the holding of <em>Jackson </em>is retroactive, this case should be returned for a factual hearing, if as the majority intimates, but declines to decide, tacit admissions are included within the scope of that decision.</p>

      <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>The majority’s disposition is to remand this case for a <em>Douglas </em>hearing so that the court below may determine whether appellant effectively waived his right to appeal. I agree that the record is inadequate on this point. However, in my view Shadd is entitled to a new trial and there is no need to remand for a factual hearing of any sort. Since the majority does not agree with me, I concur in that part of the decision which grants Shadd a <em>Douglas </em>hearing.</p>
