    <p id="b62-4" data-blocks='[["BL_62.4",62,[198,552,1147,265]]]'>The lower Court dismissed the suit, holding that under §2-101 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, the President of City Council may <em>in his discretion </em>order the election at the next General Election or at the next Primary or the next Municipal Election.</p>

    <p id="b62-6" data-blocks='[["BL_62.6",62,[200,1152,1149,586]]]'>The pertinent language of §2-101 is as follows: “. . . Should a vacancy occur in the office of any councilman, the President of the Council <em>shall</em>

The President of Council <em>may </em>fix as the date of the special election, the date of the next primary, municipal or general election.”</p>

The councilmanic district involved here was vacated by the incumbent’s death on July 20, 1966. A General Election is scheduled for November 8, 1966, yet the President of City Council has failed to issue a writ of election, has failed to indicate when he will do so, and has advanced no justification for his inaction.</p>
