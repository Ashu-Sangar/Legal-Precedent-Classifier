On November 10, 1962, an application was filed with the zoning administrator of the Pittsburgh Department of City Planning, requesting an occupancy permit for a nursing home. The administrator denied the application because of insufficient side yard footage. On December 2, 1962, an appeal from the decision of the adminis<a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>trator was filed before the board of adjustment, which after hearing, granted a variance to the applicant on July 2, 1963.</p>

When the Board has authorized the issuance of Occupancy Permit for a Special Exception or granted a variance, (A) ... if the . . . Special exception or variance involves physical improvement and such physical improvement has not been substantially started within six (6) months after the date of said approval or authorization . . . the said approval or authorization shall be void unless . . . the Board . . . renews its approval or authorization.” On February 27, 1964, §3003-3A was amended by Ordinance No. 73 of 1964 by adding the words “or until” after the word “unless” so that the line reads “. . . the said approval or authorization shall be void unless or until . . . the Board . . . renews its approval of the authorization.” In addition, the amendment added the following language: “Council may renew its approval of a Conditional Use or the Board may renew its authorization for a Special Exception or a variance, by formal action, but without other procedures prerequisite to the original approval or authorization (including public hearings), with [in] one (1) year of said original approval or authorization. Such renewed approval or authorization shall have the same effect as the original and shall be void under the preceding conditions, unless renewed.”</p>

The applicant then requested a renewal which was granted on August 28, 1964. Because of an error in the first renewal, which error is not here important, a second renewal was granted on October 30, 1964 correcting the mistake.</p>

Since the amendatory ordinance contemplated a proceeding which would have revitalized <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>the variance, bnt is vagne as to the method by which a renewal should be accomplished, and since Ivy indulged in an activity apparently acquiesced in by the regulatory body as a means of protecting and reviving its variance, there is ample justification for our sustaining Ivy’s appeal. We believe that the reliance by Ivy upon the Superintendent’s letter, by which reliance Ivy obtained an honest renewal of its variance in good faith, coupled with its substantial expenditures in paying the balance of the purchase price and its binding commitment in engaging a contractor, is sufficient to estop the zoning authorities from revoking the renewed variance. 1 Law of Zoning, Metzenbaum 172-173 (2d Ed. 1955). Any other result would work undue hardship upon a zoning applicant who followed in good faith reliance the advice and procedures recommended by the municipal authorities to secure the protection and perpetuation of a validly obtained zoning variance. The zoning ordinance itself is ambiguous and uncertain in establishing a procedure whereby a variance may be renewed, and a confused applicant is justified indeed in accepting the advice of the zoning authorities with regard to implementing the ordinance.</p>
