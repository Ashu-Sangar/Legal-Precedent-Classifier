None of the cases above-cited or referred to at argument, except Baldwin and Strothman, involved the retroactive effect of such a release as to the consequences of the landlord’s prior negligence arising before the very inception of the landlord-tenant relationship ; only the future and continuing incidents of the status thereby created would normally and ostensibly be considered to have been contemplated, negotiated and agreed upon by the final lease contract. While the instant clause is not expressly restricted to matters arising during the lease term, as in the Baldwin and Strothman cases, nevertheless, we believe, as therein observed, that had the parties really intended the waiver to pertain to matters subsisting before the tenancy commenced, it would very simply have been with<a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>in their province so to state; in the absence of such expression, we will not presume that was their intention.” (at p. 503).</p>

Not only our case law but common sense dictates such requirement. When parties enter into a lease agreement they are contemplating a status which will be created in the future; their engagements undertaken are to be performed in the future, not the past. If a party seeking immunity from liability for negligent conduct intends exculpation for past as well as future negligent conduct it is his obligation to express in the agreement such intent in an unequivocal manner; absent a clear expression of intent, the clause of exculpation will not be so construed. It was the burden of the Association in this case to establish such intent and that burden has not been sustained. A construction of the exculpatory clause in this lease, in conformity with the standards enunciated in our case law, compels the conclusion that this clause was intended to operate prospectively, not retrospectively.</p>

The fact that the quoted language speaks only of damage and contains absolutely no reference to the factors causing the damage, to my mind, precludes us from <em>construing </em>these words not to apply to damage caused by negligence of the lessor antecedent to the signing of the lease. Were we here dealing with a contract of adhesion, it might well be that we should hold this exculpatory portion of the lease to be of no effect.
