Sentence was fixed at death. An appeal to this Court followed, and we affirmed the judgment, <a href="/pa/412/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="412 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1887207" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0184-01">412 Pa. 184</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.2d%20221" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="194 A.2d 221">194 A. 2d 221</a> (1963).

The court approved and followed the procedure requested. Later, it filed an able and comprehensive report with this Court detailing its findings as to the factual circumstances incident to the giving of the incriminating statements involved, and concluded that the evidence thereof was properly admitted at trial and the issue of voluntariness was for the jury to resolve. We have carefully studied this report in conjunction with the trial record. We approve and affirm the factual findings and the pertinent conclusion set forth therein. They are amply substantiated by the record. We are also persuaded that they are true and correct.</p>

Since the definitive ruling in <em>Johnson, </em>we have reconsidered <em>Negri </em>and resolved to accept <em>Johnson </em>as controlling. See, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Wilkes v.

It is our conclusion, after a careful consideration of all the facts, that the question of whether the statements were free and voluntary or coerced was for the jury to resolve, and that the requirements of <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em><a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">supra,</a> have been met by the independent determination of the trial court, after the verdict, that the above mentioned statements of the defendant were in fact free and voluntary.</p>

        <em> </em>The record does show, that before his statements were reduced to writing, Sent was warned that anything he said would be used against him in court. It also appears that early in the Questioning period one investigating officer did advise him that he need not answer any questions. While Sent testified that he requested the assistance of counsel on several occasions during the interrogation period, this was categorically denied by the police witnesses, and the trial court found his testimony in this regard too vague and indefinite to be credible. It also significantly pointed to the fact that his wife and mother who had ample opportunity to contact and secure the services of an attorney on his behalf never did so.</p>
