    <p id="b460-10" data-blocks='[["BL_460.11",460,[185,1114,1151,641]]]'>Litigation ensued involving the ownership of a series of bank accounts, and the dispute eventually came before this Court for review.

It was finally determined that the decedent’s estate and the widow were each entitled to one-half of the proceeds of these accounts, and since the widow had already withdrawn sums in excess of the amount to Avhich she was legally entitled, she was specifically directed to pay over to the executor of the estate a sum equal to the amount of that excess ($20,-241.48).</p>
    <p id="b460-11" data-blocks='[["BL_460.12",460,[182,1767,1151,582]]]'>Unfortunately, the litigation did not end there. Subsequently, the executor secured citations in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County against the widow to show cause why she should not comply Avith the previous court decrees and pay over to the estate the moneys due. The widow secured a citation against the executor to compel him to file an inventory and accounting of the estate. The niece and nephew, joined in by the executor, secured a citation to show cause why the Avidow’s election to take against the will should not be revoked.</p>

It postponed action on the citations against the widow seeking to compel payment of her indebtedness to the estate until the audit. Appeals were filed from the final decree.</p>
    <p id="b461-5" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[120,848,1152,473]]]'>In directing the executor to account without first obtaining payment of the moneys due the estate from the widow, the court below reasoned that since the funds owed were not needed to pay any existing claims against the estate, and the widow was clearly entitled to receive from the estate an amount greater than the sum she owed, that the whole matter could be resolved in an equitable and practical manner at the time of audit.</p>

The executor herein was, therefore, entitled to insist upon payment of the moneys due from the widow, which were an asset of the estate, and until such occurred could not present to the court a true account of his administration.
