Following the occurrence, Howell, 57 years of age and slow of gait as the result of a stroke, walked directly to his sister’s home about five blocks distant. When he arrived, his appearance was described “like he had been beat” and “crying.” Very shortly after his arrival, he told his sister that four unknown boys had assaulted and robbed him, and that one of the boys was wearing a patch over one eye.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Because he urinated in his clothes, it was insisted that he go to the upstairs bathroom and change into pajamas.

The principle is based upon the rationale that a spontaneous declaration of an individual who has recently suffered an overpowering emotional and shocking experience is likely to be truthful. See, 1 Henry, Penna. Evidence, §466 (1953). Such evidence is limited to declarations supporting the conclusion that the statements were spontaneous utterances of thought created by, or emanating from, the litigated act, and so near in time thereto as to exclude the possibility that they were the product of premeditation or design.

No definite time limit, or distance from the site of the crime, has been fixed by the courts in determining what spontaneous utterances are admissible as part of the res gestae.

Since the extent of the wound was not ascertainable from an exterior examination, an operation was deemed necessary and was performed. It disclosed a puncture of the abdominal cavity, measuring about one inch in length, and it also disclosed that the only interior damage therefrom was to the mesentery, a leaf of tissue attached to the intestines through which the blood vessels course and supply nourishment <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>to these organs. However, during the operation the whole gastrointestinal tract was manually handled and checked for wounds.</p>

Following the operation and after coming out of the anesthesia, the patient, Howell, was uncooperative, disorientated, resisted treatment, demonstrated delirium tremens, hallucinations, wouldn’t stay in bed and wandered into the hospital halls and the rooms of other patients. Out of precaution, he was then tied to the bed. However, he managed to pull out the tube three times and developed hiccups.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[210,1167,1149,529]]]'>On October 15th, the abdomen became markedly distended. This followed a period during which the patient had continued to be uncooperative and had again extracted the tube. However, the abdominal distention was described as “secondary to the operation, and. not secondary to pulling out the tube.” It was also stated that the operation itself “produced a temporary paralysis in the intestine which caused accumulation of the gas and fluids and it was necessary to remove the fluids to keep the man alive.”</p>
    <p id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.6",110,[211,1709,1147,152]],["BL_111.1",111,[114,342,1150,592]]]'>As a result of the above described complication, another longer “Cantor” tube was inserted.

Howell pulled out this tube on at least two occasions, the second of these instances occurred on October 18th, in the x-ray room, just as the process of inserting the tube was about completed. As a result, a gag reaction immediately followed, causing a large amount of gastric material in the stomach to be sucked into the lungs. A tracheotomy was hurriedly performed without material result. Howell expired about 1:30 p.m. o’clock on the same day from suffocation, resulting in heart stoppage due to lack of oxygen in the lungs.</p>

At this hearing, Cheeks made no effort to refute the testimony of the Commonwealth relating to this issue. The judge found the statements to be voluntary and ordered their admission in evidence. In his own personal testimony before the jury, Cheeks denied the truthfulness of the statements and stated that he made them because the police threatened that if he didn’t they would arrest his girl friend and her mother, and take an expected child (his girl friend was pregnant with Cheek’s child) away from them. No other explanation of why he made the statements was offered. Cheeks did not say that he was abused in any way, or that he asked for and was denied the assistance of counsel. The investigating police officer, charged with making the threat, categorically denied it. The issue of voluntariness was submitted and left to the jury under careful instructions of the trial court.</p>
