        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nEmanuel Weinberg, a Councilman representing the First Councilmanic District of Philadelphia, died July 20, 1966, leaving a vacancy in that office.\nThe District Attorney of Philadelphia and several residents and voters of the aforesaid First Council-manic District, brought an action of mandamus to compel the President of City Council to order an election to fill the vacancy at the next General Election on November 8, 1966.\nThe lower Court dismissed the suit, holding that under \u00a72-101 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, the President of City Council may in his discretion order the election at the next General Election or at the next Primary or the next Municipal Election.\nAppellants contend, on the other hand, that the President of City Council has a mandatory duty to order the election at the next General Election, or at the next Primary Election or the next Municipal Election, whichever event first occurs, provided it is not less than thirty days after the issuance of the writ.\nThe pertinent language of \u00a72-101 is as follows: \u201c. . . Should a vacancy occur in the office of any councilman, the President of the Council shall issue a writ of election to the board of elections having jurisdiction over elections in the City for a special election to fill the vacancy for the balance of the unexpired term, which election shall be held on a date specified in the writ, but not less than thirty days after its issuance. The President of Council may fix as the date of the special election, the date of the next primary, municipal or general election.\u201d\nIn other words, the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, in \u00a72-101, imposes upon the President of City Council a mandatory duty \u2014 not a discretionary duty \u2014 to issue a writ for a special election to \u201cbe held on a date specified in the writ but not less than thirty days after its issuance.\u201d However, the Charter, in the very next sentence, provides that \u201cThe President of Council may [not shall] fix as the date of the special election, the date of the next primary, municipal or general election.\u201d The word \u201cmay\u201d ordinarily confers discretionary power, and this is especially so when it is contrasted with the word \u201cshall\u201d in the preceding sentence of the very same paragraph.\nWe believe that the language, the meaning, and the intent of the Charter is to impose upon the President of City Council a mandatory duty to order a special election but gives him a discretion to fix the date of the special election at any one of the election dates hereinabove mentioned (provided the election is held not less than thirty days after the issuance of the writ).\nWe find no merit in any of the contentions of the appellants.\nOrder affirmed.\nItalics throughout, ours.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts:\nThe majority\u2019s construction of \u00a72-101 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter vests in the President of City Council unlimited discretion to deprive 190,000 citizens of direct representation in the municipal legislature for a period of as long as two years. Such a result is a patent violation of the fundamental notions of representative government the Charter was undoubtedly intended to embody and an abdication of this Court\u2019s responsibility of interpreting Pennsylvania\u2019s laws in conformity with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. If the majority\u2019s construction of the Charter were inescapably compelled by the statutory language, it would then be appropriate even if it rendered \u00a72-101 of the Charter unconstitutional as applied here. But the language of the Charter admits of other interpretations which do not raise constitutional objections. That being so, I have no doubt of the correctness of adopting one of those other interpretations.\nThat it is not unlikely that such discretion will in fact be exercised so as to deprive citizens of representation for unreasonably lengthy periods is demonstrated by the facts of this case. The councilmanic district involved here was vacated by the incumbent\u2019s death on July 20, 1966. A General Election is scheduled for November 8, 1966, yet the President of City Council has failed to issue a writ of election, has failed to indicate when he will do so, and has advanced no justification for his inaction.",
