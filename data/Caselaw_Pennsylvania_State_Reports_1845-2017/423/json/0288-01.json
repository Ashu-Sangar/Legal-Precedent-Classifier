        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Jones,\nThis is an appeal from the entry by the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County of a judgment of non-suit in a trespass action.\nOn December 28, 1962, Greenville Business Men\u2019s Association (Association) was the owner of a building known as Building 4 located in the Reynolds Development, Pymatuning Township, Mercer County. Section 4 of that building had been under lease for several years to McGinnis Brothers, Inc., manufacturers of outdoor street Christmas decorations.\nOn December 28, 1962, under a written lease, the Association leased on a month to month basis beginning January 1, 1963, Section 3 of its building \u2014 which adjoined Section 4 \u2014 to Blazon, Inc. (Blazon), for industrial uses, \u201cincluding warehousing packaging and shipping\u201d and, in accordance with the terms of the lease, Blazon entered into possession of Section 3.\nAn automatic fire sprinkler system ran through both Sections 3 and 4 of the building. On February 12, 1963, that portion of the sprinkler system located in Section 4 \u201cbecame activated without fire and caused flooding\u201d in Section 4 which \u201cresulted in water flooding under the door, into the building occupied by [Blazon], depositing about five (5) inches of water in said building\u201d and causing water damage to Blazon\u2019s merchandise stored therein.\nAs stated in the opinion of the court below the \u201csprinkler system failed when a joint broke due to the failure of [the Association] to prevent moisture from forming in the system and the pipes being at such a level that when [the Association] failed to supply heat to the building leased [Section 4], the joint broke and water which supplied the \u2018dry\u2019 water sprinkler system fell onto the floor of the adjoining section [Section 3]\u201d causing damage to Blazon\u2019s goods.\nFor several years prior to February 2, 1963 and on that date, Employers Liability Assurance Corporation, Ltd. (Employers), insured Blazon against loss or damage to Blazon\u2019s property caused by water. After Blazon\u2019s property had been damaged, Employers paid Blazon $14,852.20 for its damages and received an assignment from Blazon of any rights which Blazon had against the Association to recover for the damages incurred.\nBy complaint filed, Employers instituted a trespass action against the Association in the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County. The Association filed an answer to the complaint in which, after averring that the sprinkler system was under the control not only of the Association but also of all its tenants, including Blazon, it averred that Blazon, by execution of the lease, had released the Association from all liability to its property arising from any negligence of the Association. By way of reply, Blazon averred that the lease was not in effect when the damage occurred, that its possession was without benefit of the written lease and that the release contained in the written lease did not apply to* the damages suffered and, in the alternative, even if the written lease was in effect, the Association was still liable because it failed to disclose to Blazon a malfunction which had existed in its sprinkler system prior to the execution of the lease, a condition which it knew or should have known.\nThe matter came on for trial before a court and a jury and, at the conclusion of Employer\u2019s case, the court entered a compulsory nonsuit. Later, the court refused to remove the nonsuit and judgment was entered in favor of the Association and against Employers. The propriety of such action is presented on this appeal.\nResolution of the issue before us depends upon the applicability and construction of an exculpatory clause \u2014typewritten into the printed lease between .the parties \u2014 which provided: \u201c[The Association] shall not be responsible and [Blazon] agrees, for any damages occurring to the property of [Blazon].\u201d The Association contends \u2014 and the court below agreed \u2014 that this pro-' vision of the lease precluded any liability for negligent conduct by the Association to Blazon, or its assignee, Employers.\nThis clause purports to render the Association immune from liability for \u201cany damages occurring to the property of [Blazon].\u201d Generally speaking, an exculpatory clause is valid if: (a) \u201cit does not contravene any policy of the law, that is, if it is not a matter of interest to the public or State . . . .\u201d (Dilks v. Flohr Chevrolet, 411 Pa. 425, 434, 192 A. 2d 682 (1963) and authorities therein cited); (b) \u201cthe contract is between persons relating entirely to their own private affairs\u201d (Dilks v. Flohr Chevrolet, supra, page 433); (c) \u201ceach party is a free bargaining agent\u201d and the clause is not in effect \u201ca mere contract of adhesion, whereby [one party] simply adheres to a document which he is powerless to alter, having no alternative other than to reject the transaction entirely.\u201d (Galligan v. Arovitch, 421 Pa. 301, 304, 219 A. 2d 463 (1966)).\nAssuming, arguendo, that the instant exculpatory clause satisfies all three conditions and is valid, our case law requires that, even if valid, an exculpatory clause must meet certain standards. \u201cDespite the general validity of exculpatory provisions, certain standards have been established which must be met before an exculpatory provision will be interpreted and construed to relieve a person of liability for his own or his servants\u2019 acts of negligence.\u201d: Dilks v. Flohr Chevrolet, supra, p. 434.\nSuch standards are: (1) contracts providing for immunity from liability for negligence must be construed strictly since they are not favorites of the law (Galligan v. Arovitch, supra, p. 303; Crew v. Bradstreet Co., 134 Pa. 161,169,19 A. 500 (1890)); (2) such contracts \u201cmust spell out the intention of the parties with the greatest of particularity\u201d (Morton v. Ambridge Borough, 375 Pa. 630, 635, 101 A. 2d 661 (1954)) and show the intent to release from liability \u201cbeyond doubt express stipulation\u201d and \u201c[n]o inference from words of generaL import can establish it\u201d (Perry v. Payne, 217 Pa- 252, 262, 66 A. 553 (1907)); (3) such contracts must be construed with every intendment against the party who seeks the immunity from liability (Crew v. Bradstreet, supra, p. 169); (4) the burden to establish immunity from liability is upon the party who asserts such immunity (Dilks v. Flohr Chevrolet, supra, p. 436).\nEmployer\u2019s basic contention is that tbe exculpatory clause in this lease \u201cdoes not have tbe effect of exculpating [tbe Association] from liability . . ., principally because tbe condition wbicb it contends constitutes tbe negligence, viz., tbe failure to keep the water pipes at tbe proper level, or to keep tbe building heated so that tbe water in tbe low places in tbe pipes would not freeze, occurred prior to the entering into of the lease.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nIn Baldwin v. McEldowney, 324 Pa. 399, 404, 188 A. 154 (1936) and Strothman v. Houggy, 186 Pa. Superior Ct. 638, 142 A. 2d 769 (1958), the respective Courts held that tbe exculpatory clauses in the leases wbicb they were then construing bad no retrospective effect and did not relieve from liability for negligent conduct which took place prior to tbe execution of tbe lease. However, in both Baldwin and Strothman, tbe immunity from liability provided therein expressly referred to negligent conduct wbicb arose during the term of tbe several leases; for that reason neither Baldwin nor Strothman is directly apposite to tbe case at bar.\nSaewitz v. Levittown Shopping Center, Inc., 34 Pa. D. & C. 2d 499 (1963) presents a much more apposite situation. There, it was averred that the damage to Saewitz\u2019 goods had occurred by reason of tbe bursting of a water pipe and that tbe lessor bad failed to disclose tbe dangerous condition of this pipe of wbicb it bad knowledge in tbe period antedating the lease between the parties. The lessor relied upon an exculpatory clause in the lease. Judge Satterthwaite, in a well-considered opinion, stated: \u201cAccordingly, and on the assumption that plaintiffs have otherwise stated a case showing legal damage resulting from a defective condition of the premises known to and negligently undisclosed by the defendant at and prior to the execution of the lease, we are not convinced that the parties intended the waiver to be applicable to bar recovery thereon. None of the cases above-cited or referred to at argument, except Baldwin and Strothman, involved the retroactive effect of such a release as to the consequences of the landlord\u2019s prior negligence arising before the very inception of the landlord-tenant relationship ; only the future and continuing incidents of the status thereby created would normally and ostensibly be considered to have been contemplated, negotiated and agreed upon by the final lease contract. While the instant clause is not expressly restricted to matters arising during the lease term, as in the Baldwin and Strothman cases, nevertheless, we believe, as therein observed, that had the parties really intended the waiver to pertain to matters subsisting before the tenancy commenced, it would very simply have been within their province so to state; in the absence of such expression, we will not presume that was their intention.\u201d (at p. 503).\nIf a clause in a written agreement purporting to extend immunity from liability for negligent conduct is to embrace negligent conduct occurring before as well as after the execution of the agreement, the intent of the parties to that effect must be expressed with the utmost clarity and without any ambiguity. Not only our case law but common sense dictates such requirement. When parties enter into a lease agreement they are contemplating a status which will be created in the future; their engagements undertaken are to be performed in the future, not the past. If a party seeking immunity from liability for negligent conduct intends exculpation for past as well as future negligent conduct it is his obligation to express in the agreement such intent in an unequivocal manner; absent a clear expression of intent, the clause of exculpation will not be so construed. It was the burden of the Association in this case to establish such intent and that burden has not been sustained. A construction of the exculpatory clause in this lease, in conformity with the standards enunciated in our case law, compels the conclusion that this clause was intended to operate prospectively, not retrospectively.\nThe court below relied, in large measure, upon Bogutz v. Margolin, 392 Pa. 151, 154, 139 A. 2d 649 (1958). In Bogutz, a majority of this Court held that the tenant therein had expressly waived liability on the part of the landlord for negligence occurring in that portion of the premises whereon the accident occurred. In Bogutz, no question of liability under the exculpatory clause for negligence which occurred prior to the execution of the lease was raised or considered. Bogutz is presently inapposite.\nThe court below should not have entered a compulsory nonsuit.\nJudgment reversed. New trial granted.\nFrom the complaint (Paragraphs 8, 9 and 10).\nThe Association-Blazon lease was attached to and made a part of the complaint.\nIn Galligan v. Arovitch, supra, the one party was seeking a tenancy in an apartment house and the other party was the apartment house owner. The parties in this case bargained for a commercial lease where the relative bargaining position of the parties is much Stamper than in the factual situation presented in Galligan v. Arovitch.\nFrom the opinion of the court below. The record shows that thirteen months prior to the break in the pipe which caused the instant damage, a break of a similar type had occurred at exactly the same place and that this break had been repaired at that time by the Association. It is averred and argued that such prior incident brought knowledge, or reason for knowledge, to the Association of the malfunction of the sprinkler system at that location.\nThis clause provided: \u201cTenant agrees to be responsible for and to relieve and hereby relieves the Landlord from all liability by reason of any injury or damage to any person or property in the demised premises, whether belonging to the tenant or any other person, caused by any breakage or leakage in any part or portion of the demised premises, or any part or portion of the building of which the demised premises is a part, or from water, rain or snow, that may leak into, issue or flow from any part of the said premises, or of the building of which the demised premises is a part, from the drains, pipes or plumbing work of the same, or from any place whatsoever, whether such breakage, leakage, injury or damage be caused by or result from the negligence of Landlord, its servants or agents, or any other person or persons whatsoever.\u201d",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts:\nTypewritten onto the printed lease between the lessor and lessee in this case was the following language: \u201c[The lessor] shall not be responsible and [the lessee] agrees, for any damages occurring to the property of [lessee].\u201d I fail to understand how any construction, no matter how strict, can hold these clear words not to encompass any damage resulting to the lessee\u2019s property on the premises from the landlord\u2019s negligence. The fact that the quoted language speaks only of damage and contains absolutely no reference to the factors causing the damage, to my mind, precludes us from construing these words not to apply to damage caused by negligence of the lessor antecedent to the signing of the lease. Were we here dealing with a contract of adhesion, it might well be that we should hold this exculpatory portion of the lease to be of no effect. In that event, however, we would not be construing the provision, we would simply be holding it invalid.\nThat we are not confronted by a contract of adhesion is, I believe, amply supported by the opinion of the majority itself. Both lessor and lessee were business entities and the typwriting of the exculpatory provision appears to demonstrate that it was or should have been brought to the attention of the lessee and that hence, in contemplation of law, it was bargained for.\nFinally, I find no warrant in the majority\u2019s conclusion that parties to a lease containing an exculpatory clause of the type in question here would normally consider it to refer only to damage caused by negligence occurring after the signing of the lease. As far as I can tell, the only basis for such a conclusion as to this language is the mere speculation of the majority as to what was occurring in the parties\u2019 minds when the lease was signed. Such speculation, I submit, is not a sufficient foundation for establishing the legal intent of the parties. Therefore I see no reason for the majority\u2019s requirement of the insertion of language specifically referring to antecedent negligence of the lessor in order to give the exculpatory clause effect in this case.\nFor these reasons I dissent.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell joins in this dissenting opinion.\nA discussion of the difficulties encountered in construing leases of the type involved in this case may be found in 28 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 85 (1966).",
