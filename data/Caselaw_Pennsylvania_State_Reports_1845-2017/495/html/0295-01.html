    <p id="b329-7" data-blocks='[["BL_329.6",329,[177,561,1148,693]]]'>Appellant, Anthony Wallace, was indicted on charges of murder, aggravated assault and simple assault (2 counts each), possession of an instrument of crime, criminal conspiracy, prohibited offensive weapons and violation of the Uniform Firearms Act in connection with the shooting death of Jesse Chalmers in Philadelphia, in June of 1975. Following plea negotiations appellant pleaded guilty, on October 22, 1975, to charges of murder generally, on certification by the District Attorney that the degree of guilt rose no higher than murder of the third degree, and two counts of aggravated assault, for which he was sentenced to <em>llVz </em>to 25 years imprisonment. No post-verdict motions were filed, nor was an appeal taken.</p>
    <p id="b329-8" data-blocks='[["BL_329.7",329,[177,1273,1149,409]]]'>Appellant raises three theories to support his claim that his guilty plea was induced by his counsel’s ineffective assistance: (1) counsel’s misrepresentation to appellant that he would be eligible for parole after serving one-third of his minimum sentence; (2) counsel’s failure to conduct an independent investigation in preparation for trial and (3) counsel’s failure to petition the court for transfer to juvenile court.</p>

However, appellant’s guilty plea counsel testified unequivocally, “I didn’t tell him that.” The lower court opinion states, “We are convinced that defendant’s trial counsel testified in a straightforward and credible manner, and we find his testimony worthy of belief.” The hearing court, as trier of fact, resolved the issue of credibility in favor of guilty plea counsel, and in view of the competent evidence in <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>the record to support the court’s determination, that determination will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b330-6" data-blocks='[["BL_330.5",330,[246,600,1157,1047]]]'>Appellant did not raise the claim of counsel’s ineffectiveness for failing to conduct an independent investigation in his PCHA petition or amended petition, but raises it for the first time on this appeal. (The Commonwealth’s brief indicates appellant may have addressed this issue for the first time in his memorandum to the lower court after the evidentiary hearing. However, that brief is not included in the record before us). The Commonwealth argues, correctly, therefore, that the claim has been waived. Claims of ineffectiveness of prior counsel must be raised at the earliest stage in the proceedings at which counsel whose effectiveness is being challenged no longer represents the defendant. <em>Commonwealth v. Hubbard, </em><a href="/pa/472/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="472 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1727744" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0259-01">472 Pa. 259</a>, 277 n.6, <a href="/pa/472/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="472 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1727744" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0259-01">372 A.2d 687</a>, 695 n. 6 (1977). Section 5 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that a petition for relief under the Act must include all facts in support of the alleged error on which the petition is based. 19 P.S. § 1180-5(a)(1). This Court, will not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Commonwealth v.

Failure to conduct a more intensive investigation in the absence of any indication that such investigation would develop more than was already known is simply not ineffectiveness. <em>Commonwealth v. Ford, </em><a href="/pa/491/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="491 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1765626" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0586-01">491 Pa. 586</a>, 592, <a href="/pa/491/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="491 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="1765626" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0586-01">421 A.2d 1040</a>, 1043 (1980).</p>

      <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>As to appellant’s final claim that counsel was ineffective for not petitioning for transfer to juvenile court because appellant was 17 years old when he was arrested, appellant does not claim that the petition would probably have been successful, and thus, again, does not demonstrate how failure to do the act harmed him. In <em>Commonwealth v. Pettus, </em><a href="/pa/492/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="492 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1767206" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0558-01">492 Pa. 558</a>, 562, <a href="/pa/492/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="492 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1767206" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0558-01">424 A.2d 1332</a>, 1334 (1981), this Court held no juvenile has the right to such a transfer. Rather, the juvenile bears the burden of showing his or her need of and amenability to programs of rehabilitation, supervision and care provided by the juvenile court system. In <em>Pettus, </em>we specifically rejected any <em>per se </em>rule of ineffectiveness when counsel fails to petition for such transfers, and that decision is controlling.</p>
