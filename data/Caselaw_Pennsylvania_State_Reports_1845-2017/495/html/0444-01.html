Edward Deissler, the station attendant, told Lieutenant Quinn of the Fire Marshall’s Office that, shortly before the fire began, he had sold gasoline to a customer carrying a can. Deissler, who had several minutes to view the customer in the station’s artificial lighting, provided a general description of the customer.

The record establishes that each of Deissler’s identifications was the product of fair procedure. At both the pre-arrest photo display and the post-arrest line-up, Deissler viewed groups of several persons of similar appearance, including similar national origin and, at the line-up, similar height. Police made no effort to exert any form of suggestive pressure on the witness. Indeed, at the line-up, counsel for Deissler was permitted to alleviate perceived deficiencies in the arrange<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>ment of persons viewed. In these circumstances, the lack of inclusion at the line-up of the other person selected by Deissler at the pre-arrest photo display affected only the credibility of Deissler, and not the admissibility of his testimony.

On cross-examination, the defense sought to establish suggestiveness in the photographic identification on the theory that before Deissler’s pre-arrest view of the photos, appellant had been identified by Gilbert Perez, one of the residents of the Vargas home, as the person who had been involved in the argument with the victim’s brother, and who had vowed to return to the home and kill the brother. Appellant claims that the court unreasonably limited cross-examination of Paris, prejudicing his efforts to bring this information to the jury’s attention.</p>

Thus, contrary to appellant’s present assertion, his cross-examination was not limited. Hence no relief is warranted on this ground.</p>
    <p id="b486-7" data-blocks='[["BL_486.6",486,[253,1739,1154,434]]]'>Appellant’s seventh claim of trial error is a challenge to the ruling of the court permitting the Commonwealth to introduce a photograph of appellant taken after his arrest. The Commonwealth introduced tee photograph to establish appellant’s changed appearance, as evidence of consciousness of guilt. Appellant now contends that the court should have excised as prejudicial a police identification number appearing on the photograph.</p>

    <p id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[159,436,1149,525]]]'>In his eighth claim of trial error, appellant challenges the propriety of a court ruling permitting the Commonwealth to cross-examine one of its rebuttal witnesses, Andrew Goosby, who along with Alfred Jasper allegedly heard an unidentified fellow inmate admit exclusive responsibility for the present crimes. Appellant points to instances when Goosby stated that he could not remember anything about the admission of the unidentified inmate and contends that the cross-examination was not proper. See <em>Commonwealth v. Turner, </em><a href="/pa/389/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="389 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1274019" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0239-01">389 Pa. 239</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=133%20A.2d%20187" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="133 A.2d 187">133 A.2d 187</a> (1957).</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[158,993,1149,580]]]'>Appellant has overlooked important facts of record. The Commonwealth called Goosby to rebut the denials of Jasper and appellant on cross-examination that there had been any correspondence between Goosby and Jasper. Unexpectedly, Goosby also denied the existence of correspondence, despite his earlier testimony to the contrary at an in-camera hearing. In these circumstances, we are satisfied that the Commonwealth properly pled surprise, and that the court without error permitted the Commonwealth to cross-examine Goosby through his earlier testimony.

Dancer, </em><a href="/pa/452/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="452 Pa. 221" data-case-ids="574824" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0221-01">452 Pa. 221</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20364" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="305 A.2d 364">305 A.2d 364</a> (1973).</p>
    <p id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.6",487,[156,1624,1151,632]]]'>Appellant’s ninth and final claim of trial error challenges the court’s failure to declare a mistrial when in closing argument the prosecutor told the jury that the victim had “no future.” This claim has not been properly preserved for appellate review. At trial, defense counsel requested only a cautionary instruction directing the jury not to base the verdicts on any consideration of sympathy for the victim. No request for a mistrial was made, and the court granted the request for a cautionary instruction. There is, therefore, no basis for relief. See <em>Commonwealth v.

However, throughout the offer of proof relating to Detective Paris’s proposed testimony, appellant confined his objection to the issue of proper foundation for the evidence of beard growth. The objection, therefore, will not be considered. See II Henry on Pennsylvania Evidence § 724 at p. 151 (1953).</p>
