The Commonwealth Court correctly concluded that before the 1972 final average salary freeze and 1974 multiplier reduction, class members were entitled to a calculation of benefits based on the highest salaries they received during their years of service and the multipliers specified in the Code of 1959. When salary payments were periodically increased in accordance with the legislative judgment, benefits of class members under the retirement system established by the Code of 1959 also were to increase accordingly. The freeze of final average salaries effected in June of 1972 and the reduction of multipliers effected in 1974, disturbed class members’ package of benefits by failing to give recognition to actual salary increases. The previously established eligibility of class members precludes this alteration of the benefits package.</p>

Having served the Commonwealth for ten years, however, is not a <em>condition </em>to contractual obligation; that is already accomplished by making contributions. A threshold requirement of ten years service is a <em>condition </em>to be fulfilled before the employe has the option of separating from service while leaving the contribution intact and active. It is not determinative of whether he has a valid contract with the state or of what the terms of that contract are. This is determined by the retirement code in effect on the date service begins.</p>
