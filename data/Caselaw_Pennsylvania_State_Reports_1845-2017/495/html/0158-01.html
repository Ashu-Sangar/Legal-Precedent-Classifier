Appellants were convicted at a magistrate’s hearing on August 11,1976, and fined $25.00 each plus court costs. They appealed their convictions to the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County. Following a trial de novo without a jury, appellants were found guilty of defiant trespass and ordered to pay fines of $50.00 each plus court costs. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed without opinion, with Judge Hoffman noting his dissent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We granted allowance of appeal. In light of the affirmative defense provided by the trespass statute, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3503(c)(2), and Article I, sections 7 and 20, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, we conclude that these defiant trespass convictions cannot stand. Hence we reverse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The event at which appellants were arrested was a symposium planned and presented by the Board of Associates of Muhlenberg College, a civic group which regularly uses the college’s facilities to present a series of programs for the benefit of the community. The March 27, 1976, symposium was entitled “Citizens’ Crusade Against Crime.” It was held primarily in the Seegers Student Union Building of the college and featured F.B.I. Director Clarence Kelley, a public figure of national repute, as its principal speaker.</p>

When members of LEPOCO read of Director Kelley’s scheduled appearance, they decided to distribute leaflets to members of the public attending his speech. Through the leaflets, LEPOCO wished to protest the denial by Mr. Kelley, in a personally signed letter, of their request under the federal Freedom of Information Act, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 U.S.C. § 552">5 U.S.C. § 552</a>, for information maintained in F.B.I. files concerning LEPOCO and its members. Further, LEPOCO wished to point out to the public the incongruity of Director Kelley’s appearance at a crime prevention symposium in light of then-recent public revelations concerning criminal activities by the F.B.I. which were prominent in the news media. The symposium was the site <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>of Director Kelley’s first public appearance in the Allentown area.</p>

At that time they were stopped and informed that they would not be permitted to distribute leaflets on the campus grounds since they did not have a permit from the college to do so. The LEPOCO members then attempted to obtain a permit for the following day, but their request was summarily refused.</p>
    <p id="b196-6" data-blocks='[["BL_196.5",196,[271,1097,1155,466]]]'>Appellants and other members of LEPOCO arrived at the Muhlenberg campus on the morning of the symposium and twice attempted to distribute their leaflets to persons entering and leaving the symposium. Both times, at the request of college officials, members of the Allentown Police Department escorted the LEPOCO leafletters to a public sidewalk located approximately forty yards from the entrance to the main symposium building. No arrests were made on either occasion.</p>
    <p id="b196-7" data-blocks='[["BL_196.6",196,[270,1609,1156,531]]]'>Appellants attempted to distribute their leaflets a third time at the close of the symposium that afternoon. They stood about forty feet from the entrance to the student union building and quietly distributed their leaflets. They engaged in no disorderly conduct, carried no signs, used no loud or offensive language, and made no attempt to enter any of the college buildings. They blocked no building entrances and did not attempt to force their leaflets upon unwilling passersby. They received no complaints from any members of the public regarding their presence on campus.</p>

Appellants replied that they wished not to attend the symposium but merely to distribute their leaflets peacefully. Upon appellants’ refusal to leave the campus grounds until they had completed their leafletting, the Allentown police arrested the five appellants and removed them to police headquarters, where they were served with citations for the summary offense of defiant trespass and released on their own recognizance.</p>

However, the trial court’s conclusion rests on a faulty premise. On the day in question the campus was indeed “open to members of the public” within the meaning of § 3503(c)(2). Although privately supported, Muhlenberg College serves in many respect as a community center for Allentown, maintaining upon its campus a United States Post Office station, a public cafeteria, an information and sales booth for tickets to public events, and a federal book depository library, which is required “to be maintained so as to be accessible to the public.” <a href="/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201910" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="44 U.S.C. § 1910">44 U.S.C. § 1910</a>.

It was established at trial that other members of the public who, like appellants, did not choose to attend the symposium, were present without incident on the Muhlenberg campus on March 26, 1976. Moreover, according to the testimony of the college president, Muhlenberg had “no policy about off-campus visitors,” and “a lot of people walk[ed] the campus.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The only difference between appellants and the other members of the public on the college grounds on the day of the symposium was that appellants attempted to distribute leaflets relating to the symposium without having received permission to do so from the college. As stated earlier, appellants had sought a permit on the previous day but had <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>been refused.

In its brief on this appeal, the Commonwealth raises for the first time the contention that appellants are barred from asserting their constitutional and statutory defenses on appeal by their failure to raise these issues in post-verdict motions. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123. However, all the issues raised here by appellants were briefed and argued to the trial court after the completion of testimony on February 28, 1977, and prior to the court’s entry of a verdict of guilty on August 8, 1977. On August 15, 1977, within the ten-day period mandated by Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123(a), counsel for appellants wrote to the trial court to determine whether post-verdict motions were necessary. The court replied by letter that “little purpose would now be served by the filing of [post-verdict] motions, which have, in effect, already been briefed, argued and decided.” Record at 200a. Thus, on a record where the court has already “decided” the issue, the Commonwealth’s contention is clearly without merit. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Muhlenberg College is a private corporation and, as such and like all other private citizens of this Commonwealth, should have the right to invite whom it wishes onto its own property and to exclude any other <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>private persons from entering on that property. To carve out exceptions to this right and to engage in the majority’s “balancing” of constitutional interests vis-a-vis private citizens creates for property owners confusion and uncertainty in the law, and chills the exercise of property rights. The Lehigh-Pocono Committee of Concern (LEPCO) has the same rights as Muhlenberg College with respect to the use of their own property and also with respect to the use of public property, and those are the appropriate forums for the expression of LEPCO’s opinions, not on property belonging to another.</p>
