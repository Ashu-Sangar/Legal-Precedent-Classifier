Appellee also filed a counterclaim in which it alleged that appellant’s claimed failure to deliver materials and related defaults had caused appellee to expend $5,318.44, nearly $1,150 more than the amount of the judgment which appellant sought.

First, although the trial court had committed the task of advising counsel for appellee of the new trial date of January 19 to counsel for appellant, there was <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>nothing before the trial court on the 19th, when it authorized the <em>ex parte </em>trial, establishing that counsel for appellee was aware of the new trial date. Counsel for appellant advised the court that he had written to counsel for appellee on Friday, the 16th, but did not confirm receipt of the letter by counsel for appellee. As a result, the court permitted trial to proceed <em>ex parte </em>at a time when counsel for appellee was unaware that the matter would be considered.</p>

To the contrary, counsel for appellee requested a “date certain.” Thus it would appear that the immediate concern of counsel for appellee was to avoid any conflict with her commitment to appear in the Montgomery County proceedings on the originally scheduled trial date.</p>

Munter, </em>supra. In <em>Budget Laundry, </em>the defendants were represented by one member of a two-member law firm. When the case was ready for jury selection, the calendar judge was advised that counsel was then in trial before another judge of the same court and scheduled to appear thereafter in a federal district court. The court had been previously informed that only the one member of the firm could try the case. However, the court directed jury selection to commence in counsel’s absence. On the following day, when presentation of evidence was to begin, counsel for the defendants appeared, seeking a continuance. Counsel had completed the trial before another judge of the court of common pleas, and his appearance in federal district court was not expected to last beyond the expiration of the jury trial term, or to conflict with the <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>schedule of counsel for plaintiff. Nonetheless, the court directed an <em>ex parte </em>trial, which resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b467-4" data-blocks='[["BL_467.4",467,[195,480,1148,511]]]'>This Court recognized “the extreme problems created . . . by calendar congestion and the attendant delays in the disposition of litigation.

    <p id="b467-6" data-blocks='[["BL_467.6",467,[198,1343,1145,94]]]'>The Court went on to “approve of such arrangements and urge their continuance.” <a href="/pa/450/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="450 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="1947093" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0013-01">450 Pa. at 21</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=298%20A.2d%2055" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="298 A.2d 55">298 A.2d at 58</a>.</p>

As a sole practitioner, she was in the same position as counsel in <em>Budget Laundry, </em>whose partner was unfamiliar with the matter to be tried and unable to assume responsibility for the litigation.</p>
    <p id="b467-8" data-blocks='[["BL_467.8",467,[197,1994,1149,362]],["BL_468.1",468,[243,308,1156,204]]]'>Appellant emphasizes the failure of counsel for appellee to make herself aware of the originally-scheduled trial date of January 16, as advertised in the <em>Legal Intelligencer, </em>as weli as her failure to return the phone calls of counsel for appellant during the week preceding the January 16 trial date. This emphasis overlooks the fact that once counsel for appellee became aware of the January 16 trial date, she <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>made her conflict known both to counsel for appellant and to the court in sufficient time to permit the court to consider and act upon the request for relief.
