Part I of the Code, entitled “Restricted Activities”, prohibits certain activities which could present a conflict of interest with public employment. Part III, entitled “Criminal Charges”, contains procedures to be followed if persons subject to the Code are charged with criminal conduct. Part II of the Code requires certain executive branch officials and employees to file a “Statement of Financial Interest” disclosing five types of information: (1) in-state and out-of-state real property interests; (2) personal economic interests such as stocks and bonds; (3) interest in any business entity doing business with a government agency; (4) gifts in excess of $100 other than from family members; and (5) certain liabilities.

After meeting unsuccessfully with various Commonwealth officials to resolve the problem, on October 28 and November 3, 1980, the Union filed grievances with the Bureau of Labor Relations for the Commonwealth charging Governor Thornburgh with unilaterally altering the terms and conditions of employment without prior discussion or negotiation with Council 13 in violation of Article I, Section 1 and Article XXXVII, Section 6 of its collective bargaining agreement with the Commonwealth. On November 3, 1980, Council 13 filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, charging respondents with violating Sections 803 and 1201(a)(4), (5), and (9) of the PERA, 43 P.S. §§ 1101.803, 1101.1201(a).</p>

Generally, preliminary injunctions are preventive in nature and are designed to maintain the status quo until the rights of the parties are finally determined. There is, however, a distinction between mandatory injunctions, which command the performance of some positive act to preserve the status quo, and prohibitory injunctions, which enjoin the doing of an act that will change the status quo. This Court has engaged in greater scrutiny of mandatory injunctions and has often stated that they should be issued more sparingly than injunctions that are merely prohibitory.

A close reading of that section, entitled “Judicial Relief”, makes it clear that Section 1501 authorizes the PLRB to seek an injunction in connection with its right to seek court enforcement of its order following a determination that an unfair labor practice has occurred. The section requires the PLRB to file with the court a record of the proceedings upon which its order was entered. This requirement clearly indicates that a PLRB determination will precede its petition for injunctive relief. Furthermore, the court is given the power to enter a “decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the Order of the Board.” This provision also clearly implies that a determination will precede the PLRB’s right to invoke the court’s jurisdiction.</p>

While a mandatory injunction “requires a much stronger case” and should be issued “more sparingly” than a prohibitory injunction, all of the basic prerequisites recognized by the majority to be necessary for a preliminary injunction of any kind must be established before a prohibitory injunction properly may issue.

That integrity in government is not an appropriate subject for collective bargaining should be self-evident.</p>
