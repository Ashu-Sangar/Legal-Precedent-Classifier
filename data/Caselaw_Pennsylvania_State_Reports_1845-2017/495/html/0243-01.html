It is clear that in most cases, a parent’s receipt of news that his child has been killed in an accident will cause the parent severe emotional distress.

There is substantial injury in both cases.

It is equally foreseeable, %• example, that the killing of an individual will result in emotional trauma to the victim’s friends, relatives, or even business associates. If any of these persons — friends, relatives or business associates — are told of the death of the victim, any of them may experience emotional trauma, depending upon the nature of the person’s relationship to the victim. Nevertheless, the scope of liability for emotional distress caused by injuries to others must be limited, as a matter of public policy, to achieve a reasonably circumscribed ambit of liability. This case presents us with a parent-plaintiff and a child-victim. Whether liability for emotional distress could be extended to situations where the plaintiff is other than a parent is a question which we leave for a future case. Where the parent-child relationship is concerned, serious emotional distress to the parent from the child’s death is so likely to occur as to render it unjust to deny a cause of action.
