Piracci, Sr. (defendant), challenging the jurisdiction of the trial court, should have been sustained. Constitutional due process permits a court to exercise jurisdiction to decide a claim against a non-resident only where there exist “minimum contacts” among the defendant, the forum and the litigation such that it would be “fair play and substantial justice” to require the non-resident to defend in the forum. <em>Shaffer v.
