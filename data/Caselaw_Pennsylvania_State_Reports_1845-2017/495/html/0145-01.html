The first set consists of The Pennsylvania Tavern Association, Max A. McCombs, and Sandra Lee Keim. As its name suggests, the Tavern Association is an association of owners of taverns <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>(and restaurants) located in the Commonwealth licensed to sell liquor, wine and malt beverages at retail. Max McCombs is an owner of a restaurant who proceeded on his own behalf and “as a class action,” on behalf of retail licensees and clubs, “whether or not members of the Pennsylvania Tavern Association.” Sandra Lee Keim is “an adult individual residing in Wormleysburg, Cumberland County, ...” who proceeded on behalf of herself and, also “as a class action,” on behalf of “all other patrons and consumers of alcoholic or malt beverages . . . . ” This first set filed a joint complaint in equity challenging the Board resolution insofar as it reduced the retail licensees discount from 16%% to 12V2%. According to these complainants, the Board’s resolution was adopted in violation of the Open Meeting Law, Act of July 19, 1974, P.L. 486, § 1 et seq., 65 P.S. § 261 et seq. (Supp.1981), which requires meetings or hearings of agencies at which “formal action” is scheduled or taken to be open to the public. The complaint alleged that, as to the retail licensees, the difference in the rate of discount is, “in many cases, the difference between maintaining a going business and bankruptcy” and that, as to customers, the difference “would require an increase in the retail price of said beverages dispensed to the public.”</p>

Also included are twenty-eight persons, all of whom are adult residents of Pennsylvania and customers of the State liquor stores. This second set filed a petition for review objecting to the imposition of the handling charge of 81.25&lt;p on units sold. They complain that the Board’s resolution violated both the non-preference, non-discrimination clause of section 207 of the Liquor Code (see supra text), and the Commonwealth Documents Law, Act of July 81, 1968, P.L. 769, § 101 et seq., 45 P.S. § 1101 et seq.

On September 19, the Wine Institute filed a petition for review, also challenging the imposition of the 81.25$ handling charge. According to the Wine Institute, the Board’s new pricing system puts the Institute’s members at a competitive disadvantage because it “serves to substantially increase the price of lower cost items, such as table wines produced by [the Institute’s] members, and substantially decrease the price of higher cost items such as imported products and manufactured liquors.” Like the second set of complainants, the Wine Institute alleged violations of the Liquor Code and the Commonwealth Documents Law, as well as violations of procedural due process and the Open Meeting Law.</p>

Max McCombs, tavern owner and named plaintiff challenging the reduction of the retail licensee discount from 16%% to 12V^%, claimed that both the physical layout of his bar and the difficulties of pouring “shots” prevented him from switching to larger bottles. Edward Cloonan, State Store manager, president of the State Store Union, and named plaintiff challenging the imposition of the handling charge, sought to identify the effect of the pricing <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>plan on lower-priced items. Cloonan expressed the opinion that the system of pricing previously in effect “has produced a lot of money and is very profitable with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” Various liquor store managers testified that, for the three days the new pricing plan had been in effect, the store they manage experienced a drop in volume of 200 to 300 units. Henry Gage, “Eastern Counsel - or” for the Wine Institute, estimated that some 90% of the products sold by members of the Institute would be sold at a higher price under the new pricing plan. Gage predicted that the plan would cause a decline in the use of medium-to-lower priced wines.</p>

Bruggeman stated that the new pricing plan was “necessary for the efficient operation of the Board.” As to the change in licensee discounts, Bruggeman observed:</p>
    <blockquote id="Ah2" data-blocks='[["BL_185.5",185,[219,1276,1107,469]]]'>“The Board was very concerned about the impact on their licensees. The instruction that was given in developing the pricing policies was to minimize that impact. In fact, the policy adopted by the Board will permit licensees — without changing to larger sizes — simply if they buy the same mixes as they do during the fiscal year ’78, ’79, they should obtain those goods at about $300 thousand less in total than what they would have paid under the old pricing system.”</blockquote>

Under section 207(b) of the Liquor Code, the Board is fully empowered to “fix . . . wholesale . . . prices ...” and thus to change the licensee discount. As to the handling charge, we share the view of the Attorney General, whom the Board consulted on the legality of its retail pricing plan:</p>
    <blockquote id="b187-6" data-blocks='[["BL_187.6",187,[235,1629,1107,419]]]'>“Section 207(b) specifically gives the Board the authority to add ‘a service or handling charge’ to any merchandise ‘in the same comparable price bracket, regardless of class, brand or otherwise,’ if in the Board’s opinion it is ‘required for the efficient operation of the State Store System.’ A ‘fixed allocation cost,’ therefore, is permissible so long as it bears some relationship to the actual cost of handling the merchandise.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b188-3" data-blocks='[["BL_188.3",188,[238,302,1156,405]]]'>
      <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>Here, after careful and thorough study, including a comprehensive audit performed by an outside public accounting firm, the Board determined that the handling charges were required for the efficient operation of the system. Decisions to change discounts afforded certain customers are within the Board’s discretion to exercise sound business judgment, as are decisions that each unit of merchandise sold should bear its proportionate share of fixed and variable costs.</p>
    <p id="b188-4" data-blocks='[["BL_188.4",188,[237,724,1157,562]]]'>Nor is there merit to the argument that the Board violated the Documents Law. Pursuant to the broad mandate of section 207(b) of the Liquor Code, the Board must frequently decide whether to add or delete products from store shelves, change prices, and alter marketing strategies. These business-type decisions entrusted to the Board are a unique form of governmental activity which are not amenable to the normal public participation process, and not subject to the Documents Law. “Regulations” subject to the publication requirements of the Documents Law are defined only as:</p>
    <blockquote id="b188-5" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[280,1298,1114,251]]]'>“any rule or regulation, or order in the nature of a rule or regulation, promulgated by an agency under statutory authority in the administration of any statute administered by or relating to the agency, or prescribing the practice or procedure before such agency.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b188-6" data-blocks='[["BL_188.6",188,[238,1566,1156,198]]]'>§ 102(12), 45 P.S. § 1102(12). Absent a clear statutory mandate, we cannot perceive a legislative intent to treat these business-type decisions as “regulations” falling within the scope of the Documents Law.</p>
    <p id="b188-7" data-blocks='[["BL_188.7",188,[239,1781,1156,564]]]'>Cases of this Court and the Commonwealth Court adequately address and dispose of any claimed violation of the Open Meeting Law. Here, the “formal action” was properly taken by the Board at a meeting open to the public. See <em>Consumers Education and Protective Ass’n v. Nolan, </em><a href="/pa/470/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="470 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="1723801" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0372-01">470 Pa. 372</a>, 386, <a href="/pa/470/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="470 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="1723801" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0372-01">368 A.2d 675</a>, 683 (1977); <em>Judge v.

So too, we can perceive no violation of procedural due process, as nothing would indicate the requisite deprivation of a property interest. See, e. g., <em>Bell v.
