No post-verdict motions were filed and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. Appellant then filed a direct appeal to this Court, and we remanded for a determination of whether appellant had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to file post-verdict motions. <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court on remand allowed the filing of post-verdict motions. The motions were filed and considered and relief was denied. No direct appeal was taken. Appellant thereafter obtained new counsel and filed a petition under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his appeal rights had been denied. The trial court granted leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>but denied relief in all other respects. On appeal, we affirmed. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant again acquired new counsel and filed a new PCHA petition.

The trial court dismissed the petition without a hearing. Appellant appealed that dismissal and we remanded for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Commonwealth v.

Crawford, </em><a href="/pa/468/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="468 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="1719647" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0565-01">468 Pa. 565</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="364 A.2d 660" data-case-ids="1719647,1719655" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0565-01,/pa/468/0564-01">364 A.2d 660</a> (1976). In that case, the same witness whose testimony is in question here removed fingerprints from the scene of a homicide. On direct examination by the prosecutor, and over the objection of the defense, the witness testified that “[t]he foreign matter . . . had to be placed there during or about the time of the commission of the crime.” <em><a href="/pa/468/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="364 A.2d 660" data-case-ids="1719647,1719655" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0565-01,/pa/468/0564-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/468/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="468 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="1719647" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0565-01">468 Pa. at 571</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="364 A.2d 660" data-case-ids="1719647,1719655" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0565-01,/pa/468/0564-01">364 A.2d at 663-664</a>. The witness conceded that, based upon information received from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, there was, in fact, no scientific way to date fingerprints. Furthermore, the witness admitted that his field of expertise was limited to lifting and identifying prints. However, on redirect examination, he <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>again expressed his opinion that the fingerprints were made at or about the time of the killing. We awarded a new trial because the testimony on the age of the fingerprints exceeded the scope of the witness’ expertise.</p>
    <p id="b598-5" data-blocks='[["BL_598.4",598,[239,509,1156,628]]]'>The objectionable nature of this testimony does not render counsel ineffective. There are instances where it may be advantageous to allow the admission of technically objectionable testimony. <em>Commonwealth v. Witherspoon, </em><a href="/pa/481/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="481 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1747348" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0321-01">481 Pa. 321</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="481 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1747348" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0321-01">392 A.2d 1313</a> (1978). Counsel testified at the hearing that he questioned the age of the thumbprint in an attempt to establish that the print could have been made before the killing, thereby showing that its presence did not necessarily implicate appellant in the crime. The print’s age estimate made by the witness was not prejudicial because it could have been consistent with appellant’s testimony that he had been at the scene both before and after the killing.</p>
    <p id="b598-6" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[237,1156,1156,736]]]'>Appellant also claims that counsel was ineffective in not moving to suppress his alleged inculpatory statement. Appellant denied making the statement; he also alleged that the circumstances under which he was questioned by the police render any statement involuntary. In support of this claim he alleged: (1) that he was sick and intoxicated, thereby impairing his ability to respond to questions, (2) that police officers would not permit him to use toilet facilities until he confessed, (3) that the police refused his request for an attorney and continued to question him, and (4) that the written confession shown to him was inconsistent with everything he said orally and he refused to sign it. Appellant informed his attorney before trial of the above factors concerning the statement.</p>
    <p id="b598-7" data-blocks='[["BL_598.6",598,[236,1912,1155,415]],["BL_599.1",599,[202,306,1147,307]]]'>The attorney testified at the post-conviction hearing that he believed appellant and thus determined there was nothing to suppress. Counsel’s strategy at trial involved cross-examining the interrogating police officer and introducing appellant’s testimony that he did not make a statement, and that he was subjected to coercion by the police. At no time did counsel object to the officer’s testimony concerning the alleged statement, nor did he request that the court deter<a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>mine its admissibility beyond the presence of the jury. In fact, counsel never voiced any objection to the admission of the statements into evidence. Clearly, then, defense counsel knew of appellant’s version of the circumstances and believed that the alleged statement should be attacked; it is counsel’s method of attack that is at issue.</p>
    <p id="b599-5" data-blocks='[["BL_599.4",599,[204,640,1148,526]]]'>There is ordinarily little tactical reason for not filing a motion to suppress. <em>Commonwealth v.

We can perceive no reason for the failure to do so in the present case. Contrary to defense counsel’s belief, if the Commonwealth proposed to introduce testimony about an inculpatory statement purportedly made by appellant, there was indeed a statement to suppress. If counsel had successfully moved to suppress, the jury would not have known about the alleged statement and there would have been no need to convince the jury to discredit it.</p>
