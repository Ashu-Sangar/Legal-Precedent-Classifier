Adequate ventilation is necessary to avoid danger of explosion and for the safety of the miners. It therefore is necessary to sink a shaft from the surface several hundred feet down to the mine seam.</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[153,697,1151,553]]]'>Soft coal extractors employ men and own equipment that specialize in the removal of <em>soft </em>rocks. Typically, they do not employ men or possess equipment capable of "removing or extracting the hard rock lying between the surface and the bituminous coal seams. Therefore, these soft coal extractors call upon hard rock specialists, Johnson being one, to sink the bituminous coal mine air shaft for them according to their specifications. The soft coal extractors arrange for the surface earth at the mine shaft to be removed by others than Johnson, exposing the beginning of the hard rock.</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[154,1275,1150,665]]]'>Johnson begins its shaft sinking operations by drilling holes which are then filled with dynamite, detonation caps and other explosive supplies. After detonation, the men and specialized equipment are lowered into the shaft to remove the pieces of rock, rendered manageable by the detonation. This drilling, exploding and removal of rock is repeated until the shaft reaches its destination several hundred feet below the surface of the earth. Depending upon the stability of the rock, at approximately every 15 to 30 feet down, the drilling, exploding, removal operations cease so that the walls of the shaft can be shored up with a strong concrete lining, which is designed to prevent cave-ins and water seepage.</p>

The length of the slope is approximately 658 feet. The slope was driven in a similar drilling, blasting and extraction pattern. Johnson maintains and the Commonwealth Court unanimously agreed, that these operations are entitled to the so-called “mining exclusion”.</p>
    <p id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.4",292,[276,660,1155,249]]]'>The Commonwealth has maintained that these operations are not entitled to exclusion from sales and use tax and places great emphasis on the stipulated fact that Johnson’s only work was “ rock tunneling” to make air shafts and a slope and that Johnson did not extract coal.</p>
    <p id="b292-6" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[275,926,1159,866]]]'>That Johnson does not actually extract the coal, is not determinative. As stipulated by the parties, the equipment used in the actual extraction of bituminous coal does not alternatively serve in the removal of the hard rock which lies above and between soft coal seams. The soft coal operator is dependent upon the equipment capabilities of the hard rock extractor; the extraction operation is <em>inextricably intertwined </em>with ventilation of the coal seams and the attendant differences in extracting “hard” and “soft” coal requires specialization. There has evolved, therefore, a delineation in the bituminous industry, by which the business of removing the “hard” rock between the “soft” coal seams has fallen to a specialized operator. Anthracite or “hard” coal operators have the equipment capability to extract the rock between coal seams with the same equipment used for the “hard” coal extraction and need not contract out the hard rock work.</p>
    <p id="b292-7" data-blocks='[["BL_292.6",292,[273,1818,1156,556]],["BL_293.1",293,[168,292,1150,308]]]'>If mining equals extraction, as the Commonwealth argues, then in order to be consistent, the Commonwealth would have to deny the tax exclusion for equipment and materials used by a hard coal extractor in sinking its own shafts and slopes and allow the exclusion only for equipment used directly in extraction. However, the Commonwealth concedes that if the extractor performed the same work as that done by Johnson, then the exclusion from sales and use tax would be available for the equipment so used. We believe that it is not the identity of the party who performs the work but the nature of the work done that should control <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>the allowance or denial of the exclusion. This conclusion is consistent with the regulations published by the Department of Revenue at Title 61, Revenue, section 32.35 Mining, where the following criteria are set forth for determining whether the sale at retail and use of certain equipment or “property” is subject to sales and use tax:</p>
    <blockquote id="b293-4" data-blocks='[["BL_293.4",293,[210,614,1107,150]]]'>(1) <em>Direct use. </em>In determining whether property is directly used [in mining], consideration shall be given to the following factors:</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b293-7" data-blocks='[["BL_293.7",293,[211,1050,1108,362]]]'>(iii) The active causal relationship between the use of the property in question and the production of the mined product. The fact that particular property may be considered essential to the conduct of the business of mining because its use is required either by law or practical necessity does not, of itself, mean that the property is sued directly in mining operations.</blockquote>
    <p id="b293-8" data-blocks='[["BL_293.8",293,[169,1430,1150,467]]]'>Johnson is engaged in an activity that is both physically close to the production and close in time to the production process. There exists a distinct “active causal relationship” between the use of the property employed by Johnson and the production of the mined product. This factor is most persuasive. Without access to the underground seams of coal by the driving of slopes, there is no coal production. Without the ventilation of coal seams by the sinking of shafts, there is no safe workplace for the extraction of coal.</p>
