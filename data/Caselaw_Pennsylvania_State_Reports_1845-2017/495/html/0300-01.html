Cf. <em>Policino v.

Appellant’s second argument is that, even if the pleadings were proper, the defense of interspousal immunity should not apply where, as here, the marriage in effect at the time suit is instituted does not continue in effect throughout the litigation. Cf. <em>Turner v. Turner, </em><a href="/pa/487/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="487 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1759070" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0403-01">487 Pa. 403</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="487 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1759070" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0403-01">409 A.2d 412</a> (1979) (claim not barred where couple married at time of accident but divorced at time of suit).</p>
    <p id="b335-6" data-blocks='[["BL_335.5",335,[183,1551,1149,797]]]'>Adoption of either theory advanced by appellant would deny application of interspousal immunity as a defense in this action, but would leave unanswered the real question presented: whether interspousal immunity for personal injuries inflicted prior to or during marriage should continue as part of the common law of this Commonwealth. We reject the opportunity present on these facts to engraft exceptions onto an outmoded and unwarranted doctrine which denies a litigant, because of marital status and relationship, the opportunity to prove his or her claim in court. Instead, we conclude that a tortfeasor’s immunity from liability because of his marital relationship with the injured party cannot be sustained on the basis of law, logic or public policy. Hence we abrogate the judicially-created doctrine of interspousal immunity.</p>

A reading of these cases makes clear that interspousal immunity has survived as a doctrine in this Commonwealth only because this Court has erroneously interpreted the statutes relating to married women, 48 P.S. § 1-1 et seq.

This union in one person of the right-duty relation discharges the duty as a matter of substance, and there is besides the procedural difficulty that the husband would be both plaintiff and defendant. If the woman was the tortfeasor, the man’s right would be a chose in action against the woman, whose duty upon marriage would devolve upon the husband as a derivative duty, which would be discharged by union of the right and duty in the same person; and there is the same procedural difficulty. Where the act occurs during coverture, the matter is complicated by other factors.... the right and the duty to make compensation, if any can be said to exist, would be united eo <em>instante </em>in the same person, and no cause of action could arise; and even if it could be said to arise, there would be the procedural difficulty of the husband’s being both plaintiff and defendant.

Certainly it is “illogical to allow a wife to sue her husband’s employer for injuries for which he is vicariously responsible, and to deny her a right to sue her husband for injuries sustained in an automobile accident in order to collect from his insurer on a contractual responsibility.” Ford, <em>Interspousal Liability for Automobile Accidents In the Conflict of Laws; Law and Reason Versus the Restatement, </em><a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.%20Pitt.%20L.%20Rev.%20397" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="15 U.

Prior to this time, an action in equity was the only means by which to enforce the substantive right to own, use and enjoy property guaranteed by the Act of April 11, 1848, P.L. 536, § 6. See <em>Heckman v. Heckman, </em><a href="/pa/215/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="215 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="948355" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0203-01">215 Pa. 203</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.%20425" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="64 A. 425">64 A. 425</a> (1906). Equity jurisdiction, conferred upon the courts of this Commonwealth in 1836, recognized a wife’s action against her husband even before the act of 1848. See <em>McKendry v. McKendry, </em><a href="/pa/131/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="131 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="810257" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0024-01">131 Pa. 24</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.%201078" class="citation" data-index="159" data-cite="18 A. 1078">18 A. 1078</a> (1890). As to separate estate in equity, see McCurdy, <em>Property Torts Between Spouses and Use During Marriage of the Matrimonial Home Owned By the Other, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2%20Vill.%20L.%20Rev.%20447" class="citation" data-index="160" data-cite="2 Vill.

An additional justification that has been suggested, but long ago discarded, is that a spouse has an adequate alternative remedy in a criminal or divorce proceeding. This, of course, “obviously is untrue, since neither compensates for the damage done, or covers all the torts that may be committed [e. g., ordinary negligent injury].” Prosser, Law of Torts § 122 at 862-63 (4th ed. 1971).</p>

Still another means by which an injured spouse may recover indirectly from a tortfeasor-spouse is where the tortfeasor has died and an action is brought against his estate. See <em>Johnson v. Peoples First Nat’l Bank and Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/394/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="394 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1280937" data-case-paths="/pa/394/0116-01">394 Pa. 116</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.2d%20716" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="145 A.2d 716">145 A.2d 716</a> (1958).

Kalkosinski, </em><a href="/pa/321/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="163" data-cite="321 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1165873" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0438-01">321 Pa. 438</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.%20663" class="citation" data-index="164" data-cite="184 A. 663">184 A. 663</a> (1936) (parent of deceased wife permitted to bring wrongful death action against estate of deceased husband). The rationale given for permitting a widow or widower to maintain an action against the estate of her or his spouse is that, upon death, the marriage no longer exists and hence domestic harmony cannot be disturbed. Of course, this explanation overlooks the fact that a “family” is typically composed of more than just a husband and wife. In theory, tort claims by a spouse against a finite estate have no less potential for disrupting family harmony than direct actions brought during the spouse’s lifetime.</p>
