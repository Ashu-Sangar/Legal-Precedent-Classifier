In the present case, the record indicates that Kreider Dairy Farms, Inc., is a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in the business of operating a dairy herd, producing milk, processing milk, and selling the milk at two retail dairy stores. The corporation leases its land, buildings, equipment and livestock from Noah W. Kreider and Sons, a partnership.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.4",305,[183,682,1149,1441]]]'>If Kreider were to have acquired the land between the main parcel and the eighty acre tract, or a corridor linking the two parcels, presumably the Board would not have brought this action, for then Kreider would have been able to transport milk from his processing facility to the second store without “leaving” his farm under any definition of that term. To require the acquisition of the land between the two parcels, however, would be to exalt form over substance. If Kreider owned a legal interest in a corridor of land wide enough to accommodate a milk truck and connecting the eighty acre parcel with the main parcel, over which milk were transported to the second store, presumably Kreider would not be subjected to price regulation on the grounds that his milk never left the farm. The only variable between the present case and the hypothetical case would be ownership of a legal interest in the corridor of land. Kreider, under the hypothetical situation, would sell the same milk to the same customers in the same volume and would have the same impact on the retail marketing of milk that he now has. Nothing would be different except that Kreider would own a legal interest in more land than he now does. To base exemption from milk price regulation of family farming on the dubious requirement that the farm consist of contiguous parcels would be unjust in that it would require the dairy farmer to make useless acquisitions of land in order to avoid state regulation of milk prices on noncontiguous parcels of the same farm.</p>

That the milk is moved <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>from one part of this agricultural unit to another for short distances over public roads does not remove the producer from exemption under Section 402 because the essence of the transportation is that it occurs between parts of the same farm. As mentioned earlier, it is not unusual for farms to operate by utilizing one or more noncontiguous tracts of land. If the various noncontiguous tracts of land are operated as an agricultural unit, it is contrary to the-legislative purpose of the Milk Marketing Act, as articulated in <em>Batista, supra, </em>to hold that intra-farm transportation of milk between segments of the same farming operation disqualifies a farmer from the exemption of Section 402. The purpose of the Act is to exempt self-sufficient family farming operations from the pricing regulations of the Board, and that purpose must not be frustrated by a reading of the Act which fails to take into account the realities of land use in farming.</p>

One retailer had begun to charge prices below the minimum prices set for the area to “meet the competition.” Judge Craig granted preliminary relief.
