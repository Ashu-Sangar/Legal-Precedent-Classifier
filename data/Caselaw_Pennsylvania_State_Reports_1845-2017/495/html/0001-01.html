Staley, </em><a href="/pa/476/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="476 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1736898" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0171-01">476 Pa. 171</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="476 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1736898" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0171-01">381 A.2d 1280</a> (1978) we held that an employe who was required, as a condition of employment, to pay all of his business expenses, and who was not reimbursed separately for these expenses, was permitted to exclude from taxable income the amount he paid for legitimate business expenses. The rationale for this holding was that the Personal Income Tax Act, 72 P.S. 7301 <em>et seq., </em>provides for the imposition of tax on eight classes of income. The class of income involved in <em>Staley </em>was “compensation,” which is defined as payment “for services rendered.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Act specifies that compensation is <em>not </em>
      <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>“payments to reimburse actual expenses.” Since both employer and employe in <em>Staley </em>knew that the employe was to pay business expenses from his own funds, it was anticipated that the employe would use some of the salary, there a commission, to pay his expenses. To deny the exclusion of that part of the income used to pay for business expenses, we observed, would be to tax funds that were not paid for “services rendered,” but for reimbursement of actual expenses, and would violate the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Art. VIII, section 1, which provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b37-5" data-blocks='[["BL_37.7",37,[198,900,1109,200]]]'>All taxes shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws.</blockquote>
    <p id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.8",37,[156,1121,1151,461]]]'>The Commonwealth’s denial of Staley’s exclusion would result in non-uniformity because employes who were reimbursed by separate checks for business expenses would pay tax on those funds only that were designated as salary, but Staley, who might have earned an identical amount in salary and expended an identical amount for business expenses, would pay tax on total funds received (salary + expenses) merely because he received his money in one check rather than two.</p>
    <p id="b37-7" data-blocks='[["BL_37.9",37,[157,1611,1151,468]],["BL_38.1",38,[261,310,1161,945]]]'>The case at bar is analytically identical to <em>Staley. </em>Here an employe expended certain sums for business purposes which were not specifically and separately reimbursed by the employer. The Commonwealth does not assert that the amounts expended were unreasonable or that they were not for business purposes, but merely that these business expenses are not excludable from an employe’s income. It can hardly be said that Mr. Ritz’s employers did not contemplate that he would spend personal funds for the business <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>purposes claimed by Mr. Ritz as exclusions. In the case of Penn Central, the employer was party to the labor agreement which <em>required </em>Mr. Ritz to belong to the union <em>as a condition of continued employment. </em>This expense may be excluded from Mr. Ritz’s taxable income as an ordinary, actual, reasonable and necessary business expense. In the case of the National Transportation Union, it was stipulated that Mr. Ritz’s union position involved extensive paperwork and that Mr. Ritz performed this work himself, without the aid of clerical staff. It goes without saying that paperwork necessarily requires an appropriate work area. Since the Commonwealth does not assert that Mr. Ritz was provided a suitable area in which to perform this paperwork by his union-employer, and since the record establishes that Mr. Ritz performed this work in the den of his home, we conclude that the amount claimed as an exclusion for an office at home was also an ordinary, actual, reasonable and necessary business expense and must be allowed.</p>
    <p id="b38-5" data-blocks='[["BL_38.4",38,[260,1280,1156,255]]]'>To hold otherwise would be violative of the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Article VIII, section 1.

    <blockquote id="b38-6" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[299,1552,1116,626]]]'>Ordinary and necessary business expenses required to be paid or incurred by employes who are similar to independent contractors, such as life insurance salesmen, real estate salesmen, securities salesmen, and outside salesmen, in connection with the performance by them of services as employes. These expenses include office rental, office expenses, stationery, postage, entertainment, and the like. For the purposes of this subsection, the job title of a taxpayer will not necessarily be controlling. The Department, where necessary, will make a determination based upon all of the facts in determining taxpayers who are similar to independent contractors.</blockquote>

For taxation purposes, we cannot discern any fundamental difference between employes similar to independent contractors and employes who are not similar to independent contractors. Since the purpose of the Act is to tax income and not reimbursements of business expenses, it is difficult to see what difference it makes whether an employe is similar or dissimilar to an independent contractor in terms of whether he may exclude business expense from his taxable income. Yet § 101.6(8)(ii) of the Pennsylvania Code treats employes as if there were a difference between employes similar to independent contractors and other employes, and thus treats employes non-uniformly: the Code permits one type of employe to exclude his business expenses while denying business exclusions to all other employes. Such differential treatment of employes cannot be said to be uniform, and is barred by the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>

See, e. g., <em>Anastasi Bros. Corp. v.

In light of this entirely adequate and proper statutory basis for the majority’s holding, a ground upon which at least three members of <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>this Court agreed in <em>Staley, </em>there is no need for the majority to address the issue of the claimed violation of the uniformity clause. Moreover, the majority’s citation of <em>Staley </em>as controlling authority for its constitutional analysis ignores the fact that only one member of the Court in <em>Staley </em>reached the superfluous constitutional issue.</p>
