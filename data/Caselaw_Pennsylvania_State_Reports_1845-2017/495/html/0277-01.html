In short, appellant has been sentenced to a term of incarceration where he has been convicted neither by jury, judge, nor by his own admission of <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>guilt.

      <p id="b314-9" data-blocks='[["BL_314.8",314,[332,1240,1088,231]]]'>Mr. Heeman has been incarcerated in jail before, placed on parole and I guess he got out in August and since then he has been picked up several times for the same charge. The police have been very helpful because they know what his problem is. At this time he was picked up he was brought here at everyone’s request, including his own.</p>
      <p id="b314-10" data-blocks='[["BL_314.9",314,[332,1476,1089,114]]]'>Mr. Heeman was psychiatrically evaluated on April the 30th by Dr. Rick of the Mental Health Office and his impression was that he had personality disorder and addicted to alcoholism.</p>
      <p id="b314-11" data-blocks='[["BL_314.10",314,[331,1595,1089,230]]]'>At that time Mr. Heeman had asked for help. For some reason there was a mix-up in communication. He was put in jail. He never did get any help. The doctor suggested at the time that he be placed in one of two places here in Luzerne County. Although he did ask for it he just didn’t get it because there was some mix-up.</p>
      <p id="b314-12" data-blocks='[["BL_314.11",314,[331,1830,1090,504]]]'>What we are going to ask for today is that the Court direct that he be placed into an area where he can get a complete psychiatric evaluation with a follow-up program to help him. Otherwise he will be in jail forever. We all want to help Mr. Heeman, he wants this kind of help. I have discussed it with him, Mr. Thomas has represented him before from the Public Defenders’ Office, he has also discussed it with him. Miss Whalen spoke with him this morning. She also spoke with him in jail. He doesn’t remember speaking to her in jail. She’ll be glad to do whatever follow-up program is necessary when we get the federal money to help him. Whatever offices this Court can use to help Mr. Heeman we would certainly appreciate it. I know he would. We might as well have sent him to jail forever.</p>

The record indicates that appellant was not advised at the colloquy or at sentencing of his right to file a motion to withdraw his plea. Since we hold that there was neither a colloquy, <em>nor a plea entered by appellant himself, </em>there is no need to address the Commonwealth’s contention that the right to challenge the adequacy of a plea has been waived by not filing a motion for withdrawal of a plea.</p>
