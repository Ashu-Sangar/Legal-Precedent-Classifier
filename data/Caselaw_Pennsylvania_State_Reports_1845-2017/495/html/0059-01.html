A disagreement over access to a stairway leading to the salon had been an ongoing source of bad feeling between Romeo and the salon owner, and had culminated earlier on the day of the fire with the arrest of Romeo and one of his employees, Frank Spinelli (“Spinelli”), pursuant to the salon owner’s private complaint, on charges of harassment and disorderly conduct. Shortly after the fire had been set, three badly burned men, including appellant, appeared at a Pittsburgh hospital. Of the three, only appellant survived.</p>

During the hearing, the Commonwealth called Romeo as a witness, but he immediately invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify. The suppression court ordered Romeo to answer questions seeking his name, his residence and prior residence, and whether he knew Spinelli, Sandoval and appellant. When asked whether he was the owner of the pizza shop, however, Romeo again invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. After a side bar discussion, the assistant district attorney, Edward Fagan (“Fagan”), withdrew the question and asked Romeo if he had seen Spinelli, Sandoval, and appellant on the morning of August 7, 1977. Romeo replied in the affirmative, but when asked where he had seen them, he again invoked his privilege against self-incrimination and declined to answer. The suppression judge informed the district attorney that he would not order Romeo to testify further unless the Commonwealth agreed to grant him immunity. Court was adjourned until the following morning. At that time, the Commonwealth withdrew the witness.</p>

This holding, it seems to me, expands even <em>Starks </em>beyond its limits, and is certainly well beyond the parameters of the exception mandated by <em>Dinitz.</em>

Therefore, to qualify as <em>Dinitz </em>overreaching (as interpreted by Starks), appellant must demonstrate that Fagan’s actions constituted “prosecutorial misconduct undertaken in bad faith to prejudice or harass the defendant.”</p>

I am not in complete accord with Justice Pomeroy’s approach in <em>Potter, </em>however, as I can conceive of cases where the governmental machinery is used in a heavy-handed and oppressive fashion to harass and/or convict an individual without attempting to provoke a mistrial. For example, the prosecution’s knowing use of false and perjured testimony would rightly cause the government to lose its opportunity for a second prosecution of that defendant based on whatever legitimate incriminating evidence remained even though the prosecution in such a case may not have been attempting to provoke a mistrial; this bad faith harassment of the defendant and the severe blow to the integrity of the judicial process would outweigh society’s interest in reprosecuting the defendant. Under some conceivable circumstances, then, the “Pomeroy-Potter” approach would not give sufficient consideration to the interests of the accused or the integrity of the judicial process.</p>
    <p id="b105-5" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[169,1402,1151,650]]]'>Conversely, the <em>Starks </em>approach, as applied in the instant proceedings, overemphasizes those interests to the disproportionate detriment of society’s interests. Bad faith harassment as identified by <em>Dinitz </em>implies something more than an isolated instance of one prosecutor’s indiscretion, even if deliberate. Society’s desire to prevent the guilty from going unpunished will ordinarily outweigh the risk of harassment and the burdens the defendant will incur in going through a second trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Wright, </em><a href="/pa/439/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="439 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1931035" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0198-01">439 Pa. 198</a>, 201, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20651" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="266 A.2d 651">266 A.2d 651</a>, 653 (1970).

They can get caught up in, and carried away by, the passion of an emotional trial. Sometimes, as here, they are overzealous and they deliberately employ unprofessional, prejudicial tactics. Such tactics cannot and will not be ignored! How<a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>ever, the price demanded by the majority for such prosecutorial tactics is excessive. In the instant case, society loses the opportunity to prove the guilt or innocence of one who stands accused of arson and murder because of the transgression of the prosecutor, Mr. Fagan. In this case, as in most cases of prosecutorial misconduct, the unfairness to the defendant can be remedied by the grant of a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[261,735,1159,877]]]'>I agree with the majority that conduct such as Mr. Fagan’s damages the integrity of the criminal justice system, but I cannot accept its determination that the discharge of a possible arson/murderer is necessary to restore that integrity. The integrity of the judicial process is equally tarnished by “remedies” which place total (myopic) focus on the rights of the accused while relegating the every-bit-as-important interests of society to the back seat. To safeguard the integrity of the judicial system, I would recommend, in all cases where noninadvertent prosecutorial misconduct is found, that the matter be referred to the disciplinary board for proper sanctions. The threat of disciplinary action for such misconduct would be a more direct and effective deterrent to prosecutorial misconduct than the possibility that the defendant might be discharged at some remote time following exhaustion of all appeals.</p>

Only in such cases does the damage to the individual outweigh society’s interests and the double jeopardy clause require the defendant’s discharge. This is not such a case, because the harm to this defendant can be cured by a retrial, and is far outweighed by the societal interests in having a final adjudication of his guilt or innocence.</p>
