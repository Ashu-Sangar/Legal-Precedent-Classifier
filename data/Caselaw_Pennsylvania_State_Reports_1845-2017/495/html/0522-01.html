Appellants filed an answer to the petition. At a hearing held on November 9, 1977, the appellants, the appellee-executor (who also drafted the will), Mr. Grovanz, two friends of the decedent and two of decedent’s attending nurses testified. The lower court noted the appellee’s objection to the testimony of the donees but allowed them to testify reserving the right to rule on the issue after the hearing. The lower court held: (1) that the contents of the safe and the car did not pass to appellants by ITEM II of the will; (2) that the appellants’ testimony concerning the alleged inter vivos gift of the bulldozer was inadmissible under the Dead Man’s Act;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and (3) that the decedent did <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>not make an inter vivos gift of the bulldozer to the appellants.

Principles governing the interpretation of a will are well settled. One of these is that technical rules or canons of construction should be resorted to only if the language of the will is ambiguous or conflicting or the testator’s intent is for any reason uncertain. <em>Lewis Estate, </em><a href="/pa/407/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="407 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="1307361" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0518-01">407 Pa. 518</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20919" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="180 A.2d 919">180 A.2d 919</a> (1962). The words in ITEM II of the will “my house and garage” are clear and unambiguous and must be given their common meaning, <em>i. e. </em>the property and the structures themselves. The only question is whether the car in the garage and the safe’s contents could be included within the phrase “all furnishings within said house.”</p>

The car, which apparently was found in the garage after the testator’s death, certainly cannot be included within the phrase “furnishings within said house”.

The word “furnishings” as defined by WEBSTER’S NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY, 1021 (2d ed. 1948) means “furniture, fixtures, apparatus, etc.” Even in cases where the testator specified that the bequest include the “contents” of the house the courts have held that this word does not include money, stocks, mortgage papers or bank accounts found within the house. <em>Lamb Estate, </em><a href="/pa/445/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="445 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1940023" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0323-01">445 Pa. 323</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20163" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="285 A.2d 163">285 A.2d 163</a> (1971); <em>McCartney's Estate, </em><a href="/pa-d-c/61/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="61 Pa.

There is no dispute here that the three conditions enumerated in <em>Hendrickson Estate </em>are present in this case and bring the provisions of the Dead Man’s Act into play. The difficulty here is the application of the Dead Man’s Act where there is an allegation of an inter vivos gift. Appellants argue that the evidence shows a gift by decedent to them thereby removing the adverse interest of the decedent and making appellants competent to testify. We have encountered this argument in the past and have fashioned the following answer to it:</p>

All four of the witnesses related general conversations they had had with the decedent prior to his death. Only one witness’ testimony related to the bulldozer, the item in question here. This witness, a nurse attending the decedent prior to his death, described how, during one of the appellants’ visits to the decedent in the hospital, the decedent was asking the appellants to take care of several tasks he could not accomplish from his hospital bed. The nurse testified that Mrs. Olson came to her desk in the hospital and said that the decedent wanted someone to write down these things he needed accomplished so that the appellants would be sure to get everything done correctly. The nurse complied and wrote down nine items on a piece of scrap paper. This paper was introduced as evidence during the nurse’s testimony. One of the items is: “Take bulldozer to your house.” The nurse’s testimony is limited to what she did in the decedent’s room and the fact that she accurately abbreviated into one sentence or phrase the general instruction the decedent was making. None of her testimony relates to whether the decedent was making a gift of this item or not.</p>

Indeed, the appellee-executor testified that he had spoken with the appellants shortly after the decedent’s death at which time they informed him they had the bulldozer at their house for safekeeping. This instruction has no words indicating transfer of ownership nor did the nurse testify that any such words were uttered. The appellants had the burden of proving that the decedent, with donative intent, had delivered, either actually or constructively, the bulldozer to them and that the decedent had divested himself of and invested them with requisite dominion over the bulldozer. <em>Donsavage Estate, </em><a href="/pa/420/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="420 Pa. 587" data-case-ids="1898593" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0587-01">420 Pa. 587</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20112" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="218 A.2d 112">218 A.2d 112</a> (1966). “To establish such a gift inter vivos the evidence must arise not only from legally competent witnesses but also be clear, direct, precise and convincing.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20112" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="218 A.2d 112">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/420/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="420 Pa. 587" data-case-ids="1898593" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0587-01">420 Pa. at 594</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20112" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="218 A.2d 112">218 A.2d at 118</a>.
