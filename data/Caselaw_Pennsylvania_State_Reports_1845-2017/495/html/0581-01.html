Our sister states are almost evenly divided as to whether prosecutorial consent should be required for waiver of a jury trial. All states which do have such a requirement speak of the prosecutor’s “concurrence” or “consent” as did original Rule 1101, not of an absolute right on the part of the prosecution to a jury trial as does 42 Pa. C.S. § 5104(c). Further, of the twenty-six states to adopt such a requirement, all but seven have done so through court rule, judicial decision or the state constitution. In none of the seven states which have done so by statute, does there exist a constitutional grant of exclusive rule-making power to the judiciary as there does in Pennsylvania.

C.S. § 5104(c) was adopted “in order to compensate for the elimination of the Commonwealth’s right to object to a defendant’s waiver of jury trial,” Joint opinion, 435 A.2d at 171. In addition to contradicting the joint opinion’s assertion that the rule and statute are compatible, this statement clearly misperceives the import of amended Rule 1101. The amended rule does not eliminate the Commonwealth’s right to object. Rather, it makes clear that the court must rule on the Commonwealth’s objection. The rule subjects both the defendant’s motion in support of waiver of jury trial, and the Commonwealth’s motion in opposition, to an impartial judicial determination. Cf.

The joint opinion of Justices Larsen and Kauffman suggests that appellee Coleman waived jury trial on June 16, 1980, rather than on April 14, 1980, as contended by appellee Coleman. However, the April date is undisputed by the Commonwealth in its briefs on appeal. Further, it is immaterial whether the waiver was approved by the trial court on June 16, three weeks before trial, or on April 14, three months before trial. The critical fact remains that, having concurred in the defendant’s motion to waive jury trial, the prosecution on the day of trial refused to proceed before a judge as scheduled and insisted upon a jury trial, simply because it had obtained a favorable ruling on the suppression motion and therefore believed it would have a tactical advantage in proceeding before a jury.</p>

We were not persuaded, however, that the consent requirement was the equivalent of a substantive right.
