Appellee refused payment on the claim because appellant was not dependent upon the deceased for support at the time of his death. Appellant then filed a class action on her behalf and for others similarly situated, alleging that the insurance policies in question were in contravention of the expressed intention of the Legislature which passed the <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">1</a> Appellant thus sought reformation of the applicable insurance policies for both her and all the members of the class.

Appellant argues that if a parent must establish dependency on the deceased, the Act is not humane, prompt and adequate. I disagree. The purpose of the No-Fault Act, as is the purpose of compensating any accident .victim even if not in a No-Fault context is just that, <em>i. </em>e., to compensate the victim for the injury suffered. The No-Fault Act was never meant to provide windfalls to accident victims or the survivors of deceased victims. Thus, the Act as drafted presumes a spouse to be dependent on the deceased. Any other relative may still recover under No-Fault if that person is able to establish dependency on the deceased. Further, while the Act itself sets limits on the amount of recovery, see 40 P.S. § 1009.202 (Supp.1980-81), the Act allows recovery in excess of those limits under traditional tort theories of liability. 40 P.S. § 1009.301 (Supp.1980-81); <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v.
