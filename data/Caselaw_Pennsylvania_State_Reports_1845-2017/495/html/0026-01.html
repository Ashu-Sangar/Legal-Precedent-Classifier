A full evidentiary hearing was held on December 18, 1968, following which the Honorable Joseph Sloan denied the petition.

Appellant filed a motion to withdraw guilty plea on October 12, 1978 (more than 24 years after it was entered) and a motion to vacate sentence on December 12,1978. These motions were consolidated and treated as another PCHA petition — his sixth to date! This petition alleged: appellant’s “arrest was invalid as he was not arraigned until nine hours after his custody and was not given an opportunity to speak to his attorney during this time”; that he was denied an opportunity to present a witness; that he was denied an opportunity to cross-examine and confront the complainant; that he was denied effective assistance of counsel; that the guilty plea was invalid; that he was denied the opportunity to testify in mitigation of his sentence; that there was no voluntary or knowing waiver of his “constitutional rights”; and that the sentence was excessive and severe under the circumstances. The Honorable Edward Blake denied the petition without a hearing on the grounds that all of appellant’s claims had either been finally litigated or waived. Mr. Alexander now appeals that denial to this Court, asserting the PCHA court <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>(the latest one) has abused its discretion in denying the petition without hearing.</p>
