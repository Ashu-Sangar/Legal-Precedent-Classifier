The four police officers who took appellant into custody testified that appellant was alert, coherent, responsive to questions and did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The officers opined that appellant’s emotional and sometimes erratic behavior was a natural consequence of the trauma which normally follows the commission of a violent crime and did not impede his ability to waive his rights. Further, the record contains evidence that appellant asked to see a priest after the questioning began and also requested to contact his parents and wife via phone. These factors lend additional support to the conclusion that appellant had sufficient mental capacity to voluntarily waive his right to remain silent. The lower court did not err in refusing to suppress appellant’s statements.</p>

The Commonwealth attempted to impeach the witness by calling her attention to statements she made while testifying in a prior proceeding which were contradictory to her testimony on direct examination by defense counsel. When asked if she recalled making the prior inconsistent statements, the witness testified that she did not recall her specific testimony at the prior proceeding. The Commonwealth then proceeded to further cross-examine the witness concerning the quality of her recollection as to the prior inconsistent testimony. Appellant maintains that it was error for the trial court to allow the Commonwealth to continue cross-examination for purposes of impeachment after the witness had stated that she could not remember making the inconsistent statements. We see no error in the Commonwealth’s manner of impeachment.</p>
