Appellant’s case was consolidated for trial with that of codefendants Dale Troop and Ronald Brown. The charges in this case arose out of a double slaying which occurred on August 2, 1969 when individuals armed with various firearms drove through the southeast section of Lancaster and fired shots into two occupied automobiles.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial court entered an opinion and order denying post-trial motions on April 12, 1979.

This Court has recently reviewed the law dealing with pre-trial publicity in a change of venue setting in <em>Commonwealth v.

Of course, each case must turn on its own facts. In our opinion the facts of this case fall well within the limits set forth in <em>Casper. </em>The approximate five and one-half months “cooling-off period” was sufficient to dissipate the prejudice, if any, engendered by the two somewhat sensational articles of October 7 and October 8, 1976. <em>Commonwealth v. Hoss, </em><a href="/pa/445/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="445 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1940012" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0098-01">445 Pa. 98</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=283%20A.2d%2058" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="283 A.2d 58">283 A.2d 58</a> (1971). The additional articles published on the first two days after voir dire were factual in nature. Although one of these articles referred to his criminal record, this article was not enough to establish that prejudicial material was widely disseminated at the time of trial. <em>Compare Commonwealth v. Cohen, </em><a href="/pa/489/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="489 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1762407" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0167-01">489 Pa. 167</a>, <a href="/pa/489/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="489 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1762407" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0167-01">413 A.2d 1066</a>, <em>cert. denied, </em><a href="/us/449/0840-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="449 U.S. 840" data-case-ids="11735102,11735149,11735203,11735260,11735334,11735403,11735495,11735566,11735648,11735733,11735797" data-case-paths="/us/449/0840-01,/us/449/0840-02,/us/449/0840-03,/us/449/0840-04,/us/449/0840-05,/us/449/0840-06,/us/449/0840-07,/us/449/0840-08,/us/449/0840-09,/us/449/0840-10,/us/449/0840-11">449 U.S. 840</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20S.%20Ct.%20118" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="101 S.

The pre-trial publicity, even when considered with the statistical evidence of the public opinion poll conducted by appellant (a permissible means of demonstrating the dissemination of prejudicial material) is not sufficient on this record to disturb the trial court’s exercise of discretion in denying the change of venue.

Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion as the homicides were not so complex that they could not be easily separated in the minds of the jury. Furthermore, evidence of each offense is relevant and thus admissible at a separate trial of the other in that it tends to show a common scheme or plan. The homicides occurred within minutes of each other and within two blocks of each other. Also, appellant committed both offenses from a car containing the same people. Clearly, the test for consolidation of offenses has been met. <em>Commonwealth v.
