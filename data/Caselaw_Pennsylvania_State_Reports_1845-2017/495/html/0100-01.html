The Court retained jurisdiction to review the Chancellor’s decision after the basis for that judgment had been set forth.

    <p id="b135-4" data-blocks='[["BL_135.4",135,[160,763,1152,976]]]'>Although the Chancellor again affirmed that appellee, acting under a power of attorney, abused her confidential relationship with the parties’ mother by redeeming savings bonds belonging to the mother and placed in trust for appellant and depositing the proceeds of said bonds to her own account, he nevertheless concluded no injustice or unfair enrichment would result from a denial of pre-verdict interest. The reasons given by the Chancellor were that appellee “did not intend to harm or spite appellant,” but that it was appellee’s “sincere and honest conviction” that the bonds were a gift from her mother; that denial of pre-verdict interest to appellant would not result in an unjust enrichment to appellee, as she had given constant care to her mother during the mother’s final illness; that the denial of pre-verdict interest would restore family harmony; and that it was unclear whether the mother intended appellant receive the interest on the bonds after the mother’s death.</p>

    <p id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[250,663,1157,483]]]'>Nor can the denial of pre-verdict interest which rightfully belongs to appellant be justified by a desire to compensate appellee for the care she gave her mother. As noted in our prior opinion, the mother had made special provisions for appellee’s financial security. There is no justification for bestowing additional benefits not intended by the deceased parent upon appellee at the expense of her sister, particularly where the misguided generosity disturbs the scheme of distribution intended by the mother.</p>

It was appellee’s wrongful action which led to the “deteriorating sisterly relationship.” Denial of pre-verdict interest is unlikely to promote family harmony in the present case. Rather, the more equitable approach was to follow the mother’s plan of distribution which intended for appellant to receive the principal held in trust at the mother’s death.</p>
    <p id="b136-7" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[248,1679,1157,539]]]'>We find unconvincing the Chancellor’s speculation that the mother may have intended appellant to receive only the principal, and no interest, after the mother’s death. The savings bonds in question wpre held in the name of the mother, in trust for appellant. The legal effect of such a trust arrangement is that at the trustee’s death, title to the corpus automatically passes to the beneficiary, and the beneficiary is entitled to both the corpus and any interest accruing thereon after the trustee’s death. There is no evidence that the mother wished a different arrangement.</p>

Appellee has not shown, nor has the Chancellor found, that some overriding inequity would result from an award of such interest. The arguments appellee proposes are that she sincerely believed the funds she misappropriated were a gift to her and that she be permitted to retain the earned interest as compensation for the care she provided her mother. It is clear from the record, however, that the mother’s plan of distribution generously favored appellee so that denying appellee the pre-verdict interest would not be inequitable. Moreover, her belief, however sincere, that “she was acting in accordance with the spirit of her [m]other’s thinking”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> should not be used to take from appellant funds to which appellant was entitled in accordance with her mother’s actual intention.</p>

These authorities are also in agreement that the decision whether to award interest and the amount of such interest, is vested in the discretion of the chancellor.
