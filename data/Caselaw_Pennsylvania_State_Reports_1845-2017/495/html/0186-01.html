Savitt, Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, accepted for submission to the June 1, 1979 Investigating Grand Jury of Philadelphia County an investigation into alleged tampering with water pollution monitoring and sampling equipment at Mrs. Paul’s Kitchens, Inc. (Mrs. Paul’s). After 15 months of <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>investigation, the grand jury issued a presentment against, <em>inter alia, </em>Richard Drapczuk, petitioner herein, David Bohannon and Richard Wolf, petitioners at Nos. 184 and 187 E.D.Misc.Dkt.1981, recommending that each be charged with theft of services (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3926), unsworn falsification (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4904), obstructing the administration of law (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5101), conspiracy (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 903), and corrupt organizations (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 911).

He presented a motion to quash the subpoena to Judge Savitt, the supervising judge of the grand jury, which motion was denied on March 26, 1981. Having been informed of Drapczuk’s intention to refuse to testify before the grand jury on self-incrimination grounds, the Commonwealth petitioned Judge Savitt for a grant of immunity pursuant to section 5947 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5947, which petition was granted on March 30, 1981 over petitioner’s objection.</p>

His reasons set forth in that statement were, essentially, that the immunity order of Judge Savitt was, under the facts of his case, insufficient to safeguard his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because of prior abuse by the same prosecutors of grand jury testimony in a criminal trial also stemming from the Mrs. Paul’s investigation (in the case of one Gary Zanecosky). The statement explained to the grand jury its obligation to protect the individuals who come before it from such asserted abuse, and requested the grand jury to refuse to ask questions and to refuse to obtain the initiation of contempt proceedings against him. After refusing to answer questions propounded by the prosecutor, Drapczuk and his counselor left the grand jury room while <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>the grand jury presumably discussed Drapczuk’s statement with the prosecutors.

At this hearing, counsel for Drapczuk attempted to make a record concerning the grand jury deliberations while she and her client were outside of the grand jury room. Her offer of proof was that the record would reveal whether the grand jury had requested the prosecutor to obtain the initiation of contempt proceedings, arguing that without such a request it was improper for the court or the prosecutor to initiate a contempt proceeding under section 4548 of the Investigation Grand Jury Act, (the Act) 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 4548, (formerly 19 P.S. §§ 265-278 (Supp. 1980-81), Act of Nov. 22, 1978, P.L. 1148, No. 271).</p>

Where the parties in a property dispute fail to introduce a prior deed which they had believed to be irrelevant, can an appellate court which finds that deed relevant then go to the recorder of deeds in the appropriate county and obtain a copy? Where the parties in a civil litigation have failed to include documents demonstrating that certain required notice had been given, is the appellate court permitted to send its staff to the prothonotary and obtain the missing documents? The answers to these questions are obvious — these documents may be “public records” in that they have been filed and/or duly recorded in the proper government office. However, neither such documents, nor the final grand jury report in this case, automatically become part of the record on appeal simply because they are matters of “public record.”</p>

(Perhaps beyond since the parties might petition for reargument on the basis of subsequent events. One must wonder whether the majority’s peculiar view of what constitutes a “record” would permit such a practice). The rules of appellate procedure and the overwhelming weight of authority (according to Justice Roberts, the “authorities are legion” in support of the proposition <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>that an appellate court cannot consider anything which is not part of the record. <em>Commonwealth v.

Is there some perceived distinction between the authority discussed above and the instant proceedings. I think not — the majority would be hard-pressed to advance a distinction with a straight face and any such attempt would be intellectually dishonest.</p>
