Appellant and the co-conspirator remained at the party for only a short time. At 4:30 a.m., Janice Brown and Diane Newsome left the party. Soon thereafter they encountered appellant and his confederate sitting in a bluish green car. As they approached the car, both women noticed the co-conspirator seated in the back seat with a shotgun in his lap. Both women testified that appellant, in response to Diane Newsome’s inquiries, stated that he was going to “get revenge” on the victim for a stab wound which the victim’s stepfather had previously inflicted upon appellant and that he was “going to kill that . . . . ”</p>
    <p id="b563-6" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[185,1334,1147,258]]]'>The victim left the party shortly after the departure of the two women and stood alone on the sidewalk in front of Caroline Baylor’s home.

    <p id="b563-7" data-blocks='[["BL_563.6",563,[185,1628,1147,581]]]'>Moments later, Prosser testified, appellant’s co-conspirator was seen crossing the path of a bluish green car, which pulled slowly up to a nearby corner, and walking in their direction carrying a shotgun. The victim stood up and took a few steps toward the co-conspirator. At this point, the co-conspirator fired the weapon, at close range, striking the victim in the chest. He died a few hours later. The assailant then ran to the car, its headlights on and engine running, jumped in the driver’s seat and drove away. Prosser, the only eyewitness to the shooting, was unable to identify the other occupant of the car.</p>

In the defense opening, in various cross-examinations and in summation, counsel focused the jury’s attention on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and suggested that they had been pressured into testifying by gang members intent upon avenging the death of a former member.
