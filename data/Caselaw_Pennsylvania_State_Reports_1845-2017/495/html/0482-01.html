Testator therefore did not intend the words “upon obtaining such consent” to carry with them an <em>implication </em>of an authority to sell since he <em>expressly </em>provided in his original will for authorization not only to sell, but also to rent or demolish. He even added that such authority is under the power and authority granted the trustees under paragraph Twentieth (a). Testator was therefore not attempting to place in juxtaposition two opposing alternatives to the exclusion of all other alternatives. In his <em>will </em>he was providing for no sale without his wife’s consent, but with her consent, his trustees had the power to rent, sell or demolish. In his <em>codicil </em>he was providing for no sale without his wife’s consent, but with his wife’s consent, his trustees were directed to transfer and convey. From the language of his codicil the Court finds no implication that the real estate was to be offered for sale to the four named entities. (Emphasis in original)</blockquote>

Approximately six months after the Orphans’ Court entered its final decree, testator’s children (“petitioners”) filed with this Court a Petition To Remand The Record To The Lower Court For Supplementary Proceedings Necessary For A Declaratory Judgment. They maintain therein that a remand is necessary since the Orphans’ Court: (1) failed to decide who was entitled to the proceeds of a prior partial condemnation of “Aubrey” by Whitemarsh Township in 1959; and (2) failed to appoint a guardian or trustee <em>ad litem </em>to represent minor and unascertained remainder interests in the trust. We conclude that these contentions have been waived. Petitioners were made parties to the declaratory judgment proceeding and were served with a citation to show cause why a declaratory judgment should not be granted. Instead of responding to the citation and raising the contentions, now being raised in their Petition for Remand, petitioners relied on trustees to represent their interests as residuary beneficiaries under the will, and chose not to make an appearance in the declaratory judgment proceeding or to join in this appeal from the final decree. Moreover, petitioners have no standing to petition for remand on the ground that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>was not appointed by the Orphans’ Court to represent minor and unascertained remainder interests, since they are requesting this remand entirely on their own behalf and not as natural guardians for or on behalf of any minor or unascertained remainder interests.</p>

    <p id="b521-8" data-blocks='[["BL_521.8",521,[188,749,1148,309]]]'>I dissent. Contrary to the majority’s assertion, testator’s direction to his trustees to “transfer and convey” the Aubrey property does not “clearly and unambiguously” establish an intent to make a gift. If anything, the language of the codicil to testator’s will can reasonably be read to require a different result — that the Aubrey property be sold.</p>

    <blockquote id="b521-10" data-blocks='[["BL_521.10",521,[232,1135,1108,734]]]'>“My said residence or farm cottage shall not be sold by my Trustees so long as the same is occupied by my said wife pursuant to the foregoing provisions, without her written consent; but, upon obtaining such consent, or upon the death of my said wife, my Trustees shall transfer and convey the aforesaid real estate to such of the following as may desire to acquire the same for such public use, as a park or otherwise, as they may deem most suitable, preference being given in the order named: Commissioners of Fairmont Park; Montgomery County; St. Thomas Church, Whitemarsh; Whitemarsh Township. I further direct my Trustees to suggest, but not to require, that the body acquiring title to said real estate designate the same as ‘The Aubrey Memorial Park’.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b521-11" data-blocks='[["BL_521.11",521,[193,1886,1148,467]],["BL_522.1",522,[257,318,1154,301]]]'>By this codicil, testator authorized his trustees to “transfer and convey” the Aubrey residence on one of two conditions — the written consent of his widow, or the widow’s death. By itself the meaning of “transfer and convey” is consistent with both a sale and a gift. However, testator specifically stated that “[m]y said residence or farm cottage shall not be sold by my Trustees so long as the same is occupied by my said wife pursuant to the foregoing provisions, without her written consent . . .. ” Testator followed <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>this language immediately with the direction that, “upon obtaining such consent, . .. my Trustees shall transfer and convey ... . ” Testator’s language “such consent,” in context, can refer only to the widow’s consent to a sale. Surely testator would not have required the trustees to obtain the widow’s consent to a sale as a prerequisite to a gift.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[255,637,1155,558]]]'>If on the contingency of the widow’s written consent the trustees must “transfer and convey” the property for consideration, so too on the contingency of the widow’s death the property also must be sold. Common sense dictates that the words “transfer and convey” cannot mean one thing in the case of one contingency and a different thing in the case of another. Indeed, it is a well-settled canon that “[a] construction which will satisfy the language used without leading to absurd or inconvenient results is to be preferred . . ..” <em>Duffy Estate, </em><a href="/pa/313/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="313 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1152663" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0101-01">313 Pa. 101</a>, 106, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.%20142" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="169 A. 142">169 A. 142</a>, 144 (1933).</p>
