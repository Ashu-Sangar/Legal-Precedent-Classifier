The traffic engineer noted that Section 104(c) of PennDOT’s Driveway Regulations provides that access driveways should not be located in such a manner as to cause “areas of undue traffic congestion on the highway,” and that the 1975 traffic volume map showed that 22,800 vehicles per day were using Old Gettysburg Road. He then concluded: “In light of the high volumes of traffic and the fact that the property has access to two township streets, . . . any and all driveways to this property [should] be from township streets.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> On the same day, in a verbatim copy of the traffic engineer’s letter, the district engineer communicated to Hardee’s that PennDOT rejected its permit application request. Hardee’s was thus denied any and all ingress to and egress from Old Gettysburg Road. Subsequently, Hardee’s filed a Petition for Review with the Commonwealth Court seeking to set aside PennDOT’s determination.
