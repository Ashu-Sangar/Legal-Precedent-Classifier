    <p id="b416-13" data-blocks='[["BL_416.13",416,[250,1717,1157,464]]]'>The instant controversy involves the condemnation of approximately four and one-half acres of Crozer Park, a municipal park owned by appellant, the City of Chester. The land had been condemned by appellee, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, for the construction of access ramps to an existing interstate highway, 1-95. To adequately understand the problems involved, however, we must give a factual narrative dating back to 1959.</p>

At the time of the original condemnation, Crozer Park was dissected by <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>railroad tracks of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad which ran through the park in an east-west manner. The railroad tracks ran through the park on a grade substantially lower than the rest of the park. In the late 1800’s, the B <em>&amp; </em>0 had built a timber bridge which connected a small southern portion of the park to the much larger northern section of Grozer Park by way of Finland Drive, the main road through the entire park. The construction of 1-95 was accomplished by a deep excavation of the condemned land; 1-95 runs through the park parallel to the railroad tracks directly south of said tracks. At the time of the original construction of 1-95, the city was paid appropriate damages; in connection therewith, PennDOT had constructed a bridge over 1-95 which was also a portion of Finland Drive. One proceeding north on Finland Drive from the southern entrance of the park would thus first cross the 1-95 bridge and would immediately thereafter cross the B &amp; 0 timber bridge to reach the northern section of Grozer Park.</p>
    <p id="b417-4" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[175,1306,1149,421]]]'>Crozer Park contains, inter <em>alia, </em>a swimming pool, baseball diamonds, football fields, running tracks, picnic areas, and large wooded areas. Near the southern entrance to the park, at Finland Drive and Concord Road, are located the athletic facilities of Chester High School. The area surrounding the southern entrance of the park is predominantly residential. The main access for these families to the larger northern area of Crozer Park was by way of Finland Drive.</p>

The city was unsuccessful in attempts to get the B &amp; 0 to repair the structure. Thus, at the time of the 1974 condemnation involved instantly, the two sections of Crozer Park could not be reached by Finland Drive.</p>

The B &amp; O was seeking approval to remove its timber bridge which had been closed since 1972.

Various witnesses called by the city testified about the unity of use relating to all of Crozer Park. Since the city was seeking the replacement cost of the bridge as an element of its damages, it introduced into evidence a September, 1975, cost estimate which forecast the cost of replacing the bridge at $874,361. Penn-DOT’s real estate expert, Richard DeGrouchy, estimated the fair market value of the four plus acres of land condemned at $41,100. Following the hearing, the Board of Viewers made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>

The city thus had no choice in closing that bridge; in fact, it had an obligation to do so to provide for the safety of its citizens. Further, city officials testified that they had tried, without success, to get the B &amp; 0 to repair the structure. Eventually, the Public Utilities Commission granted the B &amp; 0 permission to remove the structure. PennDOT asserts that the city has never appealed from the commission’s order; while such a fact may be relevant to the instant inquiry, it is by no means dispositive. Even assuming no appeal was taken (and there is simply no way to ascertain this fact from this record), the city could be entitled to compensation for the taking of the 1-95 bridge if the city would be willing to <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>spend its own funds to replace the railroad bridge in some form so that Finland Drive would again provide access to both portions of the park. We must note, however, that if no appeal were taken and if the city will not somehow replace the railroad bridge, PennDOT would be relieved of any obligation to pay for the taking of the 1-95 bridge, because the permanent removal of the railroad bridge alone foreclosed any access to the northern portion of the park by way of Finland Drive from the southern section of the park.

The Eminent Domain Code does not contain any provision specifically stating compensation shall be paid only to private owners of property.

The citizens of Chester, to whom the municipality owes a duty, were deprived of reasonable access to a public park by the demolition of the bridge. The assertion that the wooden railroad bridge remained closed and unavailable for public use was “justified” because of the condemnation is specious reasoning. There was a loss of a facility necessary for the public welfare.</p>

While the Eminent Domain Code sets forth various methods for reaching the measure of damages for just compensation, the methods enumerated are not exclusive.
