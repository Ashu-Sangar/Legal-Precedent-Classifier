However, present counsel has not found it necessary to expand further on this allegation of <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>error. We assume, from the statement of the issue in appellant’s PCHA petition, that appellant desired the witnesses to appear because he believed they could have proven that two Commonwealth trial witnesses had committed perjury. At the evidentiary hearing, first post-conviction counsel advised the court that the witness would not aid in resolving the issues set forth in the petition. The court agreed with counsel but permitted appellant to state on the record his reasons for wanting to call the witnesses. Appellant claimed the witnesses could establish what pre-trial proceedings appellant had been afforded and could testify to the contents of the crime laboratory report. The hearing judge found that these matters were part of the record and denied appellant’s request.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant does not further detail the substance of the proposed witnesses’ testimony or its relevancy. As the substance of the witnesses’ testimony, as described by appellant, could be established by a reading of the record, the refusal to present the testimony of witnesses who add nothing to the case was not ineffective assistance. <em>See Commonwealth v.

This claim is directly refuted by the record. At the evidentiary hearing trial counsel testified that appellant had been adequately informed of his rights of appeal. He further asserted that appellant had advised him that he no longer desired his services or those of the Office of the Public Defender, and that he would obtain private counsel. Post-conviction counsel, on appeal to the Superior Court Special Transfer Panel, argued that trial counsel was ineffective for complying with appellant’s wishes because the statement was made when appellant was distressed. As noted, <em>supra, </em>the Special Transfer Panel affirmed the order of the Court of Common Pleas, thereby finding this argu<a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>ment to be without merit. Clearly, post-conviction counsel activity pursued trial counsel’s failure to file a direct appeal. Appellant’s attempt to resurrect the issue must be the result of careless research and preparation or a complete disregard of the PCHA’s proscription of claims that are finally litigated. In either case, this allegation is totally without merit. Within the purview of this claimed error, appellant states that he was confined at Farview State Hospital prior and subsequent to sentencing. However, he does not suggest that his confinement affected his ability to understand the sentencing proceeding nor does he suggest evidence is available to support this claim. The mere fact that appellant was placed in a mental hospital after conviction is insufficient to support a finding of incompetence, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Hilberry v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/424/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="424 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1904937" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0493-01">424 Pa. 493</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20159" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="227 A.2d 159">227 A.2d 159</a> (1967), and insufficient to form the basis for relief.</p>

The suggested objectionable testimony by trial counsel was to the effect that there were no witnesses who would have testified on behalf of the defense at trial. At the evidentiary hearing, trial counsel stated that he reviewed a list of witnesses given to him by appellant and concluded that none of those available to testify would be helpful to the defense. Two of those on the list included appellant’s co-defendants, Stanley Hoss and Daniel Delker. The record discloses that trial counsel had been advised by their counsel that Hoss and Delker were not free to testify. There is no indication from this testimony that trial counsel was committing perjury. It is clear that all of the above claims lack arguable merit and counsel had no obligation to pursue them. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, as counsel does not allege why or how the judge was biased, we must resort to the posture of the allegation as stated in appellant’s petition. Mr. Butler there asserts <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>that the hearing judge was biased because (1) he also had been appellant’s trial judge and had refused to permit appellant to call witnesses at trial and at the evidentiary bearh <em>g, </em>(2) he denied appellant a &lt; o— of his transcripts, (8) he had ordered appellant to be bounc i handcun's ¡i. leg shackles during the evidentiary hearing, and (4) he did not advise appellant of his appeal rights.

As to appellant’s claim that he was denied copies of the transcripts, the record reveals that the allegation is without merit. When filing the notice of appeal upon the denial of appellant’s first PCHA petition, counsel noted that the official transcripts had been incorporated into the record. The “Certificate of the Contents of the Remanded Record” issued by the Prothonotary of the Superior and Supreme Courts indicates that three transcripts were included in the record presented in the appeal following the denial of post-conviction relief. Apparently, the only transcript not available was the sentencing transcript and it is at that proceeding that appellant claims he was not informed of his appellate rights. He suggests, then, <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>that a hearing is necessary to develop an alternative record of the events on which his claim is based.</p>

We discussed, <em>supra, </em>testimony concerning this issue elicited at the hearing: appellant’s failure to take a direct appeal, his knowledge of his right to do so, and post-conviction counsel’s pursuit of this issue at the hearing.

    <p id="b123-5" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[187,817,1152,533]]]'>It is not true that “[t]he PCHA provides for an evidentiary hearing if it cannot be determined from the record whether counsel’s actions had a reasonable basis . . .

The PCHA does not equate the absence of a reasonable basis on the record (one component of the ineffective assistance of counsel standard) with the necessity of granting a hearing, as the majority would have it. Rather, the PCHA, § 1180-9, provides:</p>

However, the court may deny a hearing if the petitioner’s claim is patently frivolous and is without a trace of support either in the record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner. The court may also deny a hearing on a specific question of fact when a full and fair evidentiary hearing upon that question was held at the original trial or at any later proceeding.</blockquote>

The issue that first post-conviction counsel “refused to subpoena certain witnesses to appear at the evidentiary hearing” is without specific factual predicate demonstrating what prejudice may have been caused by the asserted ineffectiveness. The majority opinion acknowledges that “counsel has not found it necessary to expand further on this allegation of error” and was forced to “assume... that appellant desired the witnesses to appear because he believed they could have proven that two Commonwealth trial witnesses had committed perjury.” The PCHA does not require, or encourage, this Court or the lower court to supply omissions in a PCHA petition with such assumptions, particularly petitions subsequent to the first.</p>

The issues of PCHA counsel’s failure to challenge trial counsel’s failure to appeal, failure to charge trial counsel with perjury and failure to challenge the bias of the hearing judge are all frivolous as I believe has been demonstrated by the majority opinion. The relative worth of these issues has also been diluted by the number, nature and quality of the prior petitions.</p>
