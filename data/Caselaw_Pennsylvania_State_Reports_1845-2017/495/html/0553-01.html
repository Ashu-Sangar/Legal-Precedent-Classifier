Appellant, Robert J. Wilson, seeks to open a judgment in ejectment confessed against him by appellee, Exxon Corporation (“Exxon”), after he refused to vacate a leased gasoline service station at the end of the lease term. In his timely petition to open the judgment filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, appellant contended that Exxon had failed to negotiate a renewal lease in good faith and that termination therefore was in violation of Section 3(c)(1) of the Pennsylvania Gasoline Petroleum Products and Motor Vehicle Accessories Act (“Gasoline Act”)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and in breach of fiduciary duties allegedly owed to him by Exxon.

Because of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, however, the rentals under the lease were modified to provide for payment of 1.5 <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>cents per gallon up to 60,000 gallons and one-half cent per gallon over 60,000, with a minimum rental of $810.00 per month.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Near the end of the lease term, Exxon submitted a proposed new lease to appellant which, while otherwise virtually identical to the old lease, contained a “rental re-opener” clause authorizing Exxon to increase the service station rental by no more than one cent per gallon once during the term of the lease.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Anticipating the expiration of federal rent controls during the next term, appellant rejected Exxon’s proposal, but did not vacate the premises.</p>

Appellant made no counter proposal and refused to exercise his appraisal rights under the clause. Accordingly, the proposed increases became effective fifteen days after notice.</p>
    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.4",590,[251,813,1156,1052]]]'>Approximately three months before the end of the renewal term, Exxon and appellant, who had retained counsel, commenced negotiations for a new lease. During the course of the extensive negotiations, Exxon not only agreed to eliminate the rental reopener clause it had proposed, but also offered to adjust its last rental proposal if appellant could demonstrate that it was disproportionate to the value of the premises or that it would impose a financial hardship.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Although he rejected Exxon’s rental proposals as “outrageous,” appellant refused to produce any of his financial records to substantiate his position. Because the parties failed to agree to terms for a new lease, Exxon, by letter dated February 24, 1977, gave notice to appellant to vacate the premises as of March 26, 1977. Despite the notice and despite the fact that it had found another prospective tenant who agreed to pay the rental proposed to and rejected by appellant, Exxon communicated its willingness to execute a new lease with appellant under any of its outstanding proposals and continued making new proposals until the very end.</p>

    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[169,520,1151,1246]]]'>We conclude that appellant’s petition to open the confessed judgment was correctly denied because the undisputed factual record leads inexorably to the finding that Exxon did not seek to terminate its relationship with appellant, but rather bargained with him in an honest and serious effort to reach a commercially reasonable accommodation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> By submitting no less than five different proposals, all of which were rejected by appellant, Exxon conscientiously and unambiguously sought to retain him as its lessee. That the rent increases proposed were reasonable with respect to the economics of operating the service station is reflected, <em>inter alia, </em>by the fact that Exxon produced another tenant who would accept the terms appellant had refused and by the fact that appellant rejected Exxon’s invitation to demonstrate either that the proposed rental would cause financial hardship or that it would be disproportionate to the value of the premises.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> To the very end, Exxon made every effort to keep open the possibility that appellant would accept its lease proposals, even after having given notice to vacate. Indeed, Exxon ultimately made a compromise proposal which would have permitted appellant to operate the service station at a <em>lower </em>rental than already had been offered by another.</p>

By establishing nothing more than the inability of two counselled parties to reach a new lease agreement after extensive good faith negotiations, appellant has not even come close. We refuse to permit the courts of this Commonwealth to intervene whenever negotiations between an oil company and a gasoline service station operator fail to produce mutually acceptable terms for a commercial lease.</p>
