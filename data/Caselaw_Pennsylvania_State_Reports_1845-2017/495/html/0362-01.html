The convictions arose from an incident where appellant and a co-defendant, William Von Smith, had beaten to death a Harrisburg barber, George Fautz, and had then taken the victim’s wallet. Appellant was informed of both his right to file postverdict motions and the right to appeal immediately after the jury had announced its guilty verdicts; the court then sentenced appellant to life imprisonment.</p>

Appellant informed the assistant public defender that privately retained counsel had represented him through the post-verdict motions, but that he lacked sufficient funds to pursue an appeal to the Supreme Court. At that time, appellant erroneously believed that postverdict motions had been filed in his case.</p>
    <p id="b396-5" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[276,625,1157,581]]]'>The assistant public defender thereafter filed a motion on behalf of appellant seeking the right to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Appellant alleged that he had understood postverdict motions had been filed, when, in fact, they had not. Appellant contended that private counsel failed to inform appellant that no appeal had been taken. The Commonwealth opposed the motion and submitted an affidavit by trial counsel, which stated that no appeal was filed because appellant had never requested such action. The petition to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>was denied by our court in a <em>per curiam </em>order of January 15, 1974.</p>

Herein, appellant was informed on the record of his post-verdict rights. Nonetheless, no post-trial motions or appeal were ever filed. Furthermore, appellant was denied the right to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>by this court in 1974. The Commonwealth thus contends that appellant waived his right to file an appeal by failing to request such action in a timely fashion, and that our denial of appellant’s appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>represents a final litigation of any appealable issue.</p>

The court may also deny a hearing on a specific question of fact when a full and fair evidentiary hearing upon that question was heard at the original trial or at any later proceeding.” Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. 1580, 19 P.S. § 1180-9.

The basic objection being raised in the instant case is appellant’s denial of an absolute right of severance. This objection would have obviously been cognizable on direct appeal. However, no direct appeal was taken in this case. Appellant asserted that he was improperly denied his right to appeal. That claim was rejected by this Court. In view of our prior finding in this case, that the right to direct appeal had been effectively waived, any complaint cognizable during a direct appeal has obviously been waived under the terms of section 4. Since that waiver appears on the fact of the record, the court below was correct in concluding that the petition attempting to raise the waived claim was patently frivolous.</p>
