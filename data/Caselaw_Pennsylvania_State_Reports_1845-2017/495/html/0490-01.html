    <p id="Ad7S" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[282,520,1116,1215]]]'>The words ‘some other such’ immediately preceding ‘first step in the trial’ clearly indicate that the events specifically referred to in the comment are to be considered first steps in a trial for the purposes of Rule 1100, see <em>Commonwealth v.

For example, if a case were called to trial and after determining the parties were present, the trial Judge held a <em>hearing on a Suppression Motion which had been reserved for the time of trial, </em>presumably the trial would have commenced for purposes of Rule 1100. This leads to the conclusion that the principle concern behind Rule 1100 is simply that the commencement of trial be mafked by a substantive, rather than a pro forma, event. Moreover, each of the events specifically referred to in the foregoing portions of the comment represents a degree of commitment of the Court’s time and resources such that the process of determining the defendant’s guilt or innocence follows directly therefrom. Accordingly, <em>the beginning of any stage which leads directly into the guilt determining process is a ‘first step’ in the trial for the purposes of Rule 1100.</em>

The evidence suppressed may well mark the difference between success and failure in the prosecution; to deny the Commonwealth its only opportunity of securing an appellate review to determine whether the evidence was properly suppressed is highly unfair to the Commonwealth and the interest of society which it represents.

    <blockquote id="b536-11" data-blocks='[["BL_536.11",536,[291,1881,1114,146]]]'>“This Court consistently has held that the Rules of Criminal Procedure must be <em>interpreted as </em>written.” (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>

When the Commonwealth is unable to commence trial <em>for any reason </em>despite its due diligence, Rule 1100(c) literally requires the Commonwealth to seek an extension of time. <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>
      <em>Commonwealth v. O'Shea, </em><a href="/pa/465/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="465 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="1712678" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0491-01">465 Pa. 491</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="465 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="1712678" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0491-01">350 A.2d 872</a> (1976). Yet, the majority classifies the necessity of requesting an 1100(c) extension as “at most, a technical requirement.” This assertion, however, presupposes that every request for a Rule 1100(c) extension where the Commonwealth wishes to exercise its appeal rights will automatically be granted. I do not believe that to be the case.</p>
    <p id="b537-4" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[183,677,1149,732]]]'>In the instant case, the Commonwealth obviously took its appeal in good faith and if an extension had been requested, it should have been granted. Situations could arise, however, where the Commonwealth could, in bad faith, attempt to exercise its appeal rights for the sole purpose of keeping the defendant incarcerated, knowing full well that it will be unable to obtain a conviction should the matter proceed to trial. In such cases, it would be incumbent upon the court entertaining the motion to extend time to determine if the appeal is being taken in good faith. Were it otherwise, an appellate court would then be charged with responsibility of making certain factual findings, a function we have always held to be within the domain of the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em><a href="/pa/464/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="464 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="1710330" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0314-01">464 Pa. 314</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="464 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="1710330" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0314-01">346 A.2d 757</a> (1975).</p>
    <p id="b537-5" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[181,1429,1150,246]]]'>The majority further holds that the Commonwealth was not required to request an 1100(c) extension, since the Commonwealth, by taking its appeal, deprived the trial court of jurisdiction. Pa.R.A.P. 1701(a), cited by the majority, states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b537-6" data-blocks='[["BL_537.6",537,[225,1699,1105,147]]]'>“Except as otherwise prescribed by these rules, after an appeal is taken. . ., the lower court. . . may no longer proceed further in the matter.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b537-7" data-blocks='[["BL_537.7",537,[183,1865,1147,95]]]'>The majority thus assumes that the trial court would have lacked the power to act on a petition to extend time.</p>
    <p id="b537-8" data-blocks='[["BL_537.8",537,[183,1979,1150,362]],["BL_538.1",538,[253,293,1156,259]]]'>I believe the majority’s reliance on Rule 1701(a) is misplaced for two reasons. First, the Rules of Appellate Procedure did not go into effect until July 1, 1976, some seven months after the suppression hearing in the instant case. Secondly, the Commonwealth’s appeal cannot work to <em>wholly </em>deprive the trial court of jurisdiction. To the contrary, the trial court is obliged under 1100(c) to enter any and all <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>orders' appropriate to maintain and protect a defendant’s rights to a prompt trial. Thus, by entertaining a motion to extend time after an appeal has been taken, the trial court would be doing no more than maintaining the status quo until after the appeal has been decided.</p>
    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[253,571,1155,469]]]'>Literal reading of Rule 1100 clearly obligates the Commonwealth to seek an extension of time whenever it cannot, despite all due diligence, try a defendant within the time period mandated by the rule. <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth does not assert that either of the excludable periods is applicable and for good reason, as neither would apply instantly.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[253,1058,1154,408]]]'>Criminal complaints were issued against appellant on April 4 and 5, 1975. He was arrested on April 6, 1975. Trial, however, did not commence until May 2, 1978. As none of that time is excludable under Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(d) and no order extending time was issued pursuant to Pa.R. Crim.P. 1100(c), I would order appellant discharged because he was not tried within the time period mandated by Rule 1100.</p>
