(Mrs. Paul’s). After 15 months of investigation, the grand jury issued a presentment against David Bohannon and Richard Wolf <em>(inter alia), </em>petitioners herein, and Richard Drapczuk, petitioner in No. 162 E.D. Misc.Dkt. 1981, recommending that each be charged with theft of services (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3926), unsworn falsification (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4904), obstructing the administration of law (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5101), conspiracy (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 903), and corrupt organizations (18 Pa.C.S.A. § 911). Following five days of preliminary hearing, petitioners were held over for court on these charges on March 9, 1981.</p>

Their reasons as embodied in the statements for their refusals were essentially, that the immunity orders of Judge Savitt were, under the facts of these cases insufficient to safeguard their Fifth Amendment privileges against self-incrimination because of prior abuse by the same prosecutors of grand jury testimony in a criminal trial also stemming from the Mrs. Paul’s investigation (in the case of one Gary Zanecosky). The statements explained to the grand jury its obligation to protect the individuals who come before it from such asserted abuse, and requested the grand jury to refuse to ask further questions <em>and </em>to refuse to obtain the initiation of contempt proceedings against petitioners.</p>

Upon refusing to answer the questions, each petitioner was informed, in the presence of the grand jury, that he would be taken before Judge Savitt for an adjudication of possible contempt. The grand jury session was recessed, the contempt proceeding was held immediately, and Judge Savitt found petitioners to be in contempt of court and ordered them confined to the county jail until they purged themselves of contempt by agreeing to testify before the grand jury or until the grand jury expired (scheduled expiration date was May 30, 1981).

We hold that such immunity from use and derivative use is coextensive with the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination, and therefore is sufficient to compel testimony over a claim of the privilege. While a grant of immunity must afford protection commensurate with that afforded by the privilege, it need not be broader. Transactional immunity, which accords full immunity from prosecution for the offense to which the compelled testimony relates, affords the witness considerably broader protection than does the Fifth Amendment privilege. The privilege has never been construed to mean that one who invokes it cannot subsequently be prosecuted. Its sole concern is to afford protection against being “forced to give testimony leading to the infliction of ‘penalties affixed to . . . criminal acts.’ ” Immunity from the use of compelled testimony, as well as evidence derived directly and indirectly therefrom, affords this protection. It prohibits the prosecutorial authorities from using the compelled testimony in <em>any </em>respect, and it therefore insures that the testimony cannot lead to the infliction of criminal penalties on the witness.</blockquote>

The petitions also argue that the Investigating Grand Jury Act, Act of November 22, 1978, P.L. 1148, No. 271, formerly 19 P.S. §§ 265-278, recodified at 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 4541-4563.1 requires that, before a witness may be adjudicated in contempt of court, the record must disclose that the investigating grand jury obtained the initiation of contempt proceedings. For the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of this author to the companion case of <em>In re: County Investigating Grand Jury of June 1, 1979: Appeal of Drapczuk, </em><a href="/pa/495/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="495 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="1770753" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0186-01">495 Pa. 186</a>, <a href="/pa/495/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="495 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="1770753" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0186-01">433 A.2d 5</a> (1981), I agree that the Act imposes such a requirement. However unlike in <em>Drapczuk, </em>I believe the requirement was fully met in the instant proceedings as the record clearly and unambiguously discloses that the grand jury did obtain the initiation of contempt proceedings.</p>

Companion case petitioner Drapczuk’s trial was scheduled to begin on June 8, 1981; the record is unclear as to petitioners Bohannon and Wolf but the Commonwealth makes no objection to their characterization of the grand jury session as “on the eve of trial.”</p>

I would not adopt a per se rule for investigations wherein the witness before the grand jury is also a defendant awaiting trial. Circumstances might exist where the prosecution could meet its <em>Kastigar </em>burden. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Pantone, </em><a href="/f2d/634/0716-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="634 F.2d 716" data-case-ids="1304320" data-case-paths="/f2d/634/0716-01">634 F.2d 716</a> (3rd Cir. 1980) (defendant convicted in first trial and appealed; court of appeals reversed and remanded; prior to remanded second trial, defendant gave testimony before a grand jury under a grant of immunity; defendant raised pre-trial motion to dismiss indictment arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>government will be unable to discharge <em>Kastigar </em>burden; third circuit disagrees and distinguishes <em>McDaniel </em>on grounds that, because of transcript of Pantone’s first trial and prosecutor’s assurance that the reprosecution would exactly parallel the first, court determined that objective evidence would be sufficient to demonstrate whether or not government had made any use of immunized testimony).</p>
