    <p id="b354-9" data-blocks='[["BL_354.8",354,[275,862,1156,585]]]'>Appellant, Miriam L. Bupp, commenced this action in trespass by a praecipe for a writ of summons filed in the Court of Common Pleas of York County on August 17, 1973. She filed a complaint on August 9, 1977, seeking damages for injuries sustained in an automobile accident on February 25, 1973, when she was a passenger in a car driven in an allegedly negligent manner by appellee. Both at the time of the accident and at the time of the issuance of the summons the parties were unmarried. However, the parties were wed sometime thereafter, on a date unspecified in the record. They continue to be married.</p>
    <p id="b354-10" data-blocks='[["BL_354.9",354,[275,1483,1155,314]]]'>On April 11, 1979, appellee filed an answer and new matter, raising the affirmative defense of interspousal immunity. The trial court granted appellee’s motions for summary judgment and a stay of all further proceedings for the duration of the marriage. The Superior Court affirmed, and this Court granted allowance of appeal.</p>

Instead, we conclude that a tortfeasor’s immunity from liability because of his marital relationship with the injured party cannot be sustained on the basis of law, logic or public policy. Hence we abrogate the judicially-created doctrine of interspousal immunity.”</blockquote>
