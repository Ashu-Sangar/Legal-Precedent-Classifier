After review of public comments, the Commission prepared and proposed a revised set of rules. 3 Pa.Bull. 2966 (December 29, 1973). A first set of rules was adopted by the Commission in February of 1974 and made effective as of that March. 4 Pa.Bull. 409 (March 9, 1974). That same year the Commission proposed amendments, 4 Pa.Bull. 2534 (December 14, 1974), and adopted them, 5 Pa.Bull. 434 (March 8, 1975).

The following day appellee hospitals and appellee Hospital Association filed a petition for review in the Commonwealth Court, challenging the clause primarily on the ground that the regulations of the Human Relations Commission were promulgated without statutory authority.

Appellees especially sought to demonstrate the perceived evils of the clause’s “subcontractor” requirement, which obliges a contractor to “include the provisions of this non-discrimination clause in every subcontract, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor.” 16 Pa.Code § 49.101(d) ¶9 (See supra text and Appendix).

The materials management director predicted that the clause would require his hospital to employ a full-time clerk, to conduct its operations at a slower pace, to increase its inventory, to expend more money for inventory storage, and to pay more in postage costs.

At the evidentiary hearing, the petitioning hospitals attempted to establish that harm would befall them upon the implementation of the various provisions of the non-discrimination clause. The court was persuaded that paragraph 9, mandating the inclusion of the non-discrimination clause in subcontracts, would impose a burden upon the hospitals by requiring a “total revision of their purchasing practices and procedures with respect to vendors.. . . ” However, the court also rejected the hospitals’ claim that the <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>“increase in administrative costs occasioned by the initial implementation of affirmative action and affirmative action programs” justified a finding of immediate and irreparable harm. In light of this latter determination, not challenged on this appeal, there can be no basis for a determination of the requisite harm with respect to paragraphs 7, 8, and 10.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[168,615,1149,572]]]'>So too, the court’s determination with respect to the subcontract-inclusion requirement of paragraph 9 is fatally flawed. The testimony offered by the petitioning hospitals was premised on the assumption that paragraph 9 would require the hospitals to reduce their previously oral agreements to writings which include the non-discrimination clause. However, this assumption has not the slightest trace of support — statutory, regulatory, or otherwise. Indeed, there is every reason to believe that the requirement of paragraph 9 can easily be met by informal procedures between the hospitals and their subcontractors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>
