The Commonwealth contends, however, that the assistant district attorney responsible for the conduct of appellant’s prosecution believed that the results of the neutron activation and fingerprint tests were not exculpatory, but rather were inconclusive and thus inconsequential to either the prosecution or the defense. At a hearing below on the motion to quash now before us, the <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>prosecutor testified that it was his understanding that the test results were of no value at all, and his failure to bring them to defense counsel’s attention was totally inadvertent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The absence of appellant’s fingerprints on the gun is, under the facts here presented, similarly inconclusive rather than exculpatory. Since appellant had admitted the shooting to police shortly after her arrest, the prosecutor had no reason to attribute significance to the inconclusivity of the test results, for he, like defense counsel, accepted the veracity of appellant’s admissions.</p>

Although a review of the record suggests that the prosecutor may have been deficient in judgment or knowledge of the law, we can hardly describe his behavior as intentional bad faith misconduct. The test results were not <em>per se </em>exculpatory, but only could have been used in connection with a theory that appellant did not fire the gun. Because that fact already had been admitted, it was by no means unreasonable for the prosecution to have concluded that the information would be of no use to the defense. The mistrial was granted simply because the <em>possibility </em>of an alternate strategy denying the shooting had been precluded by the failure to disclose the non-inculpatory test results.</p>

The remedy of discharge without a fair and complete fact-finding procedure is extreme and will not be invoked absent <em>deliberate bad faith prosecutorial misconduct. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.
