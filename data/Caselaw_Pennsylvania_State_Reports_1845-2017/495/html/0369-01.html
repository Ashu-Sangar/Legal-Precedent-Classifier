By virtue of the condemnation, necessary for construction of a bridge access roadway, the Commonwealth accuired 32 units in the Township’s 150 unit low-income housing facility. A hearing to establish the amount of compensation due the Township was held before a Board of Viewers: witnesses for the Commonwealth appraised damages at $137,700.00, the fair market value of the property taken; witnesses for the Township appraised damages at $1,336,120.00, the cost of constructing a new building to replace the condemned structure. The latter damage amount, termed the “substitute facilities” measure, was awarded by the Board of Viewers.</p>

Therein, we noted that a replacement measure had been awarded in <em>Pennsylvania Gas &amp; Water Company v.

    <p id="b408-8" data-blocks='[["BL_408.9",408,[246,1665,1156,697]]]'>In the instant case it has been demonstrated that the substitute facilities measure of damages is imperative. Township witnesses testified as to a shortage of low-income housing. The only way the Township of Chester can afford to replace the low-income units is to be awarded replacement costs. The Township has an obligation to provide low-income housing for its citizens who are unable to pay higher rents. An award of “fair market value” will not allow the rebuilding of the units taken and makes hollow the substitute facilities doctrine. The fact that the subdivision may derive the benefit of another public use as a result of the diversion does not lessen its responsibility in the area of the condemned facility.</p>
