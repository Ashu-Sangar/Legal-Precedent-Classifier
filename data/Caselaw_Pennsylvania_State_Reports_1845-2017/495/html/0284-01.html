At trial, the court instructed the jury that, notwithstanding the duty of NFG to obey the order of the commission, NFG would be liable for breach of contract if it was guilty of “contributing fault.” Restatement of Contracts § 458 (1932). The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellants and awarded damages of $45,000. On appeal, a majority of the Superior Court granted NFG’s motion for judgment n.o.v. Observing that NFG is not an ordinary party to a contract but rather “a ‘utility,’ . . . subject to control and regulation by the PUC,” the Superior Court correctly held that such a utility “should not be subjected to liability for damages to others for acts done by it in compliance with the PUC’s orders unless there is evidence of bad faith or malice on [the utility’s] part, or gross negligence.” <em>Kasemer v.

On April 1, 1975, NFG determined that it could not supply gas to additional tenants of appellant without exceeding its peak capacity in violation of a February 1972 order of the PUC. On May 27, 1975, appellants secured an injunction from the court of common pleas directing NFG to provide gas service to appellants’ tenants.- NFG immediately complied with the injunction. On July 23, 1975, the PUC ordered NFG to cease making <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>sales to customers other than those already being. served. NFG thereupon refused to supply gas to additional tenants of appellants. On August 12, 1975, the court of common pleas held NFG in contempt of the May 27 order. NFG immediately purged itself of the contempt by renewing the supply of gas to appellants’ customers. NFG also appealed the contempt order to the Superior Court, challenging the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas to enter the order in light of the conflicting cease and desist order of the PUC. NFG did <em>not </em>ask for a supersedeas, but continued to provide gas service to appellants until the PUC intervened and secured a supersedeas on October 6, 1975. On March 6,1975, appellants filed a motion to remove the supersedeas. NFG responded by asking the Superior Court “to maintain the supersedeas as modified until such time as it decides the jurisdictional issue that is the subject of the Appeal.” Record at 63a. On November 22, 1976, the Superior Court affirmed the contempt order, and NFG immediately resumed service to appellants. In short, NFG attempted throughout these proceedings to comply in good faith with every conflicting order it received.</p>

Especially is this so in light of section 508 of the Public Utility Code, which provides that “[t]he commission shall have <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>power and authority to vary, reform, or revise, upon a fair, reasonable, and equitable basis, any obligations, terms, or conditions of any contract heretofore or hereafter entered into between any public utility and any person, corporation, or municipal corporation, which embrace or concern a public right, benefit, privilege, duty, or franchise, or the grant thereof, or are otherwise affected or concerned with the public interest and the general well-being of this Commonwealth.”</p>
    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.4",320,[268,813,1157,577]]]'>Surely the Legislature did not grant such broad power to the Public Utility Commission to act in the public interest with the expectation that regulated utilities would be required to oppose the exercise of those powers every time a customer was adversely affected or else be held liable for breach of contract. Rather, the possibility of PUC intervention is implicit in all contracts between a utility and its customers, and a utility should not be held liable for compliance with that intervention, whatever form it may take, absent “evidence of bad faith or malice ... or gross negligence,” none of which the Superior Court found to exist.</p>

(hereinafter Kasemers) began development of a proposed one hundred site mobile home park in 1972. Prior to commencing construction, the Kasemers entered into a contract with appellee, National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (hereinafter NFG) whereby NFG was to provide gas service to all units of the mobile home park. On February 1, 1972, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (hereinafter PUC) issued an order prohibiting gas utilities from entering a contract to supply gas where such contract would cause annual or peak day deliveries to exceed annual or peak day supplies. Pursu<a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>ant to this order, NFG submitted a letter to the PUC which stated NFG would no longer provide gas service for new customers “unless the customer had applied for service or received commitment from the company.” This letter was approved by the PUC and made part of NFG’s tariff.</p>

However, on April 1, 1975, NFG refused to supply gas to any additional tenants of the Kasemers. This action was taken due to earlier curtailments of gas by NFG’s suppliers in December of 1974 and NFG’s self-determination that the PUC’s order not to contract to supply gas beyond peak capacity was then applicable. The Kasemers then brought an action in equity against NFG seeking a mandatory injunction to force NFG to supply gas service pursuant to the contract. On May 27, 1975, the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County ordered NFG to provide gas service to the Kasemers up to a maximum of thirty units, thereby assuring gas to incoming tenants. NFG complied with this order until July 23, 1975 when the PUC issued an order without notice to either the Kasemers or the court directing NFG to cease making sales of gas to customers other than those already being served. Pursuant to this order, NFG refused to supply gas to additional tenants of the Kasemers.</p>

The power of the court to enter a judgment for the losing party notwithstanding a verdict for the opposing party is not intended to be a means by which the court may invade the province of the jury and, in effect, overrule the findings of a jury; rather, it is merely a procedural device which is an extension, in time, of the power of the court to grant, at the close of the evidence, a directed verdict for a party. Thus, there is the requirement that a party who petitions the court for judgment n.o.v. must have requested, in writing, a binding instruction to the jury directing them to return a verdict for the movant. <em>Dora v.

In order that a judge may have time for reflection and deliberation on a case, there has arisen this method of entry of judgment which allows the trial court the flexibility of granting judgment for the movant even though the case has already gone to the jury.
