However, <em>Anders </em>does not require that counsel be forced to pursue a wholly frivolous appeal just because his client is indigent. The major thrust of <em>Anders </em>was to assure a careful assessment of any available claims that an indigent appellant might have. That end is achieved by requiring counsel to conduct an exhaustive examination of the record and by also placing the responsibility on the reviewing court to make an independent determination of the merit of the appeal. These requirements were clearly satisfied here. What does present the problem is that the counsel’s brief would not appear to meet the standards set by <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>The majority’s conclusion that the role of an advocate insisted upon in <em>Anders </em>refers to the manner in which the record was examined is simply incorrect. If the <em>Anders </em>Court had been solely concerned with counsel’s review of the record, there would have been no need to reject the “no merit letter” utilized by Mr. Anders’ attorney, for the court could have verified counsel’s conclusions by its own review of the record. Rather, the <em>Anders </em>Court was concerned with what counsel submitted to the court that might verify counsel’s examination of the record and aid the Court in conducting its independent evaluation of the case. At the same time the Court in <em>Anders </em>expressed its concern that counsel not brief his case against his client.</p>

Unfortunately, in this case, counsel did indeed “do more,” in the form of argument <em>against </em>his client. Counsel should have limited his brief to a statement of the facts with citations to the transcript and discussion of the legal issues involved in the case with citations of authority.</p>
    <p id="b508-6" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[224,1373,1160,980]]]'>Instead, counsel for appellant stated, “it is clear that the jury filed [sic] the evidence of such volume and quality as to overcome the presumption of innocence and satisfy the jury of the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Counsel went on to describe how the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict, why the court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing and further cited precedent (albeit insufficiently) upon which this Court could base a finding that a due process claim lacked merit. In answering each point raised, counsel sought to show this Court why each would fail. Such representation does not constitute the assistance of counsel required by <em>Anders </em>and adopted by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Collier, </em><a href="/pa/489/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="489 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1762419" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0026-01">489 Pa. 26</a>, <a href="/pa/489/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="489 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1762419" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0026-01">413 A.2d 680</a> (1980) and <em>Commonwealth v.

The majority’s notion that the brief filed on behalf of Mr. McClendon does not meet the standards set by <em>Collier </em>and <em>Perry </em>is only partially correct.

As then Judge (now Chief Justice) Burger has observed, “[c]ounsel . . . must remember that under our adversary system an appellate court cannot function efficiently without lawyers to present whatever there is to be said on behalf of appellant, however meager his claims may be, so that the Court can make an informed appraisal.” <em>Johnson v. United States, </em><a href="/f2d/360/0844-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="360 F.2d 844" data-case-ids="3657700,825665" data-case-paths="/f2d/360/0844-01">360 F.2d 844</a> (D.C. Cir. 1966) (concurring opinion). The American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice echoes this view: “The court’s processes will be aided, not impeded, if a trained legal mind has been applied to presentation of the issues. This consideration surely underlies the Supreme Court’s position in <em>Anders.” </em>ABA Standards, The Defense Functions, § 8.3(b), Commentary at 299-300 (Approved Draft, 1971).

Thus, it is clear that appointed counsel’s allegation that he has thoroughly reviewed the record, together with his submission of a brief against his client, cannot suffice to satisfy counsel’s duty to this Court and to his client. A contrary conclusion not only derogates the profession of advocacy but also impedes the process of fair, equal and efficient appellate review.</p>

Thus, it is especially ironic that, in this case, where appellant has received no assistance from his appointed “advocate,” a majority of this Court should summarily affirm judgment of sentence, thereby compelling appellant to turn to the Federal Courts for vindication of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.
