The petition, filed on November 3, 1978, sought to reopen the 1970-71 account, adjudication and schedule of distribution of her husband’s estate seven years after judicial confirmation of the schedule of distribution. In 1971 appellant had signed her approval to that schedule, which clearly recited the striking short-term decline — by nearly fifty percent — in the value of the principal asset of the estate, 82,533 shares of stock in STV, Inc. The orphans’ court determined that appellant had had notice for over seven years of the drastic decline in fortune of her husband’s company from 1970 to 1971 and could have inquired into the circumstances surrounding that decline at any time during the statutory five-year period for the reopening of an account, 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3521. It thus held that she was barred by laches from asserting her belated claim. We agree and affirm.</p>

Testator authorized his executors to “accept in kind and retain any property which I may own at my death without regard to any principle of diversification.” As stated previously, the principal asset of his estate consisted of 82,533 shares of stock in STV, Inc., the successor by merger to a company founded by decedent and co-executor Whitney Sanders. On April 15, 1970, the executors filed the first and final account of the estate, listing the value of the STV shares at $1,320,-528. No exceptions to the adjudication were filed, and the account was confirmed absolutely by the orphans’ court on July 26, 1970.</p>

Appellant then signed her approval to the schedule containing this graphic evidence of the dramatic decline in value of the major asset of the estate. The schedule was filed with the court on July 14, 1971, and subsequently confirmed. In December 1971, in compliance with the decree of distribution, the executors completed actual distribution from the estate to themselves as trustees of the marital and residuary trusts.</p>

The petition further alleges that this loan precipitated the decline in value of the remaining STV stock and that appellant learned only recently of this transaction.
