        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellee Larry E. Haggerty was charged with burglary and arson. A first trial ended in a mistrial on January 24, 1978. Subsequently, appellee was convicted by a jury of burglary. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellee was sentenced to a prison term of seven and one-half to fifteen years.\nOn appeal the Superior Court reversed, holding that appellee\u2019s confession should not have been admitted into evidence because appellee had not been arraigned within six hours of his arrest as required by Commonwealth v. Davenport, 471 Pa. 278, 370 A.2d 301 (1977). Commonwealth v. Haggerty, 282 Pa.Super. 369, 422 A.2d 1336 (1980). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and this appeal followed.\nThe instant appeal involves only the factual determination of when appellee was arrested. The facts are as follows. Following a fire at Franklin High School, appellee was questioned by police at his home for approximately fifteen minutes on October 5,1977. Appellee denied any knowledge of or involvement in the incident. Five days later, on October 20, 1977, two plainclothes policemen went to appellee\u2019s house at 11:00 a. m. Appellee\u2019s wife woke him and the police asked appellee if he would come to the State Police barracks to discuss his earlier statement concerning the fire. Appellee agreed. Upon arrival at the barracks, appellee waived his Miranda rights. He was questioned for ninety minutes but he denied any involvement in the incident. Appellee then agreed to take a polygraph examination. Since the polygraph examiner was administering a test to another individual, appellee and a police officer remained in the investigator\u2019s room.\nThe polygraph test began at 2:30 p. m. About an hour later, the polygraph examiner informed one of the original interviewing officers that appellee had admitted his involvement in the fire. Appellee was arraigned at 5:55 p. m.\nAppellee claims that he was arrested at 11:00 a. m., thus making his arraignment almost seven hours after arrest and outside the six hour period mandated by Commonwealth v. Davenport, supra. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argues that appellee was not arrested until immediately after his initial admission of involvement at some time between 2:30 p. m. and 3:30 p. m.\nIn Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, 411 Pa. 56, 68, 190 A.2d 304, (1963), we stated:\n\u201cAn arrest may be accomplished by \u2018any act that indicates an intention to take [a person] into custody and that subjects him to the actual control and will of the person making the arrest.\u2019 Am.Jur.2d, Arrest, \u00a7 1, p. 695.\u201d\nWe have also held that the test is an objective one, i. e., viewed in light of the reasonable impression conveyed to the person subjected to the seizure rather than the strictly subjective view of the officers or the persons being seized. Commonwealth v. Richards, 458 Pa. 455, 327 A.2d 63 (1974). We are of the opinion that the instant record contains nothing which would indicate that the officers attempted to subject appellee to their will and control before appellee admitted involvement in the instant crime. It is thus our view that on this record appellee was not arrested until sometime between 2:30 p. m. and 3:30 p. m. As the arraignment was well within the six hour period mandated by Davenport, we believe the Superior Court erred in granting a new trial for this reason.\nBecause the Superior Court reversed on this issue, that Court did not address other assignments of error raised by appellee. Therefore:\nThe Order of the Superior Court is reversed and the matter is remanded to Superior Court for consideration of appellee\u2019s remaining assignments of error.",
