In this direct appeal he raises only one issue: whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict of murder of the first degree in view of his evidence that he was intoxicated and acting under the influence of a mental illness at the time of the shooting. We have reviewed the record and find appellant\u2019s contentions without merit.\nThe judgment of sentence is affirmed.",
