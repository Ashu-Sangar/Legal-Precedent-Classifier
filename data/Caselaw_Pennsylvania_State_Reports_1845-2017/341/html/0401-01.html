In support of his petitions, which were not filed until May 31, 1940, appellant contends that he is absolute owner of the proceeds of two fire insurance policies constituting the sole assets of the Sterling Company, by virtue of a written <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>assignment of the policies to him prior to the appointment of the receiver, and that the court below was without jurisdiction to appoint the receiver because of an alleged lack of proper service of the original bill upon the company and because of an omission to give him such notice of the institution of the proceedings and opportunity to be heard in opposition to the appointment of the receiver as he claims he was entitled to.</p>
