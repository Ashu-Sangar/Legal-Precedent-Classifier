The distance between the easterly rail of the street railway track and the westerly rail of the first track of the railroad is 9 feet, 11 inches. There is no street intersection at the place where the deceased endeavored to cross.</p>
    <p id="b406-7" data-blocks='[["BL_406.10",406,[288,1334,1147,918]]]'>The plaintiff’s witness, Balog, gave the following account of the accident, which took place at one o’clock in the morning. The witness was standing at the curb on the West side of Duquesne Avenue, and during the entire time the deceased was within his view. The night was very cléar. He first observed the deceased on the other, East, side of the railroad tracks, walking towards them; he was facing toward Grant Avenue, to the South. When he had reached the middle of the railroad tracks, crossing diagonally in a South-Westerly direction, Balog noticed the street car, which was then at Grant Avenue, approaching from the South, He fixed its distance from the deceased at 500 to 600 feet (a plan shows the distance to be 561 feet). The car was plainly visible at that distance; the headlight was lit and it was illuminated within. The witness estimated its speed at 40 to 45 miles an hour.</p>

He then proceeded to cross the space between the railroad and street car tracks, looking toward the approaching car. There was nothing between him and the car to obstruct his view of it. When he reached the first rail of the street car track, the car was “about 75 to 80” feet away. He started to cross, and was struck on the second rail, the one nearest the witness and 30 feet from where the latter was standing.</p>

Without further hesitation he traversed a distance of 9 feet, 11 inches, and entered upon the track, with the car only 75 or 80 feet away, less than two car lengths. Whether he then looked at the car we do not know, but the point is immaterial. As we said in an analogous case: “If the plaintiff had looked at the point of danger, as it was his duty to do, he would have seen what his witness saw, that the car was so near that in attempting to cross he was placing himself in a position of imminent danger:” <em>Boring v. Union Traction Co., </em>supra, at p. 595. We there held that a pedestrian who halted at the curb, saw a street car 150 to 200 feet away and continued forward upon the tracks where he was struck, was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. And, in <em>Danks v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., </em>supra, we said of a person attempting a similar crossing (p. 358) : “if <em>he did </em>see the street car as he left the curb, he was negligent because he then walked knowingly into its path. ... On the other hand, if we believe his statement that he <em>did not see </em>the trolley car until it struck him, he is none the less at fault, for in that event it is clear that he failed to perform his duty to look for it.”</p>

In <em>Patton v. George, </em>supra, we said (p. 345): “. . . one who walks in front of <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>a moving engine or car, which is plainly visible, and is immediately struck is guilty of contributory negligence, regardless of evidence as to his having stopped, looked or listened.” The only inference that can be drawn from such instantaneous striking is that of contributory negligence: <em>Wolf v.

    <p id="b409-3" data-blocks='[["BL_409.4",409,[160,898,1152,1522]]]'>The fact that the car was travelling at a rapid speed does not relieve the deceased of the charge of contributory negligence. When he stood at the last railroad track the car was plainly visible to him. He was not directly in line with its approach, but was at a distance of 15 feet from the center of its track and upon a slight elevation. His opportunity to observe its speed was greater than that of the witness Balog, and he was bound to take that factor into consideration before attempting to cross: <em>Lieberman v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., </em>supra; <em>Jerdon v. P. R. T. Co., </em><a href="/pa/260/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="260 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="1040263" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0275-01">260 Pa. 275</a>, 276, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.%20733" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="103 A. 733">103 A. 733</a>. In <em>Patton v. George, </em>supra, the street car which struck the plaintiff was approaching “terrible fast”, but, as in the present case, the night was clear, the car’s headlight was burning, and plaintiff’s view of its progress was unobstructed. A judgment n. o. v. for the defendant was sustained. In <em>Clark v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., </em>supra, although the plaintiff was struck at a regular crossing, we held (p. 405) : “That a person who crosses a track in front of a ‘pretty fast’ moving street car 70 feet away without again looking at the car until it is four or five feet away from him is guilty of contributory negligence is too plain for argument.” Here the deceased was crossing between intersections, and had no reason to expect that the car would decrease its speed as it approached the point where he entered upon the tracks.

      <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>Plaintiff asserts that the deceased was struck at a “permissive” crossing, because people coming from River Avenue, which came to an end at the East side of the railroad tracks, customarily walked across the tracks there to the West side of Duquesne Avenue. The doctrine of “permissive” crossings has no application to street railway tracks located in a public thoroughfare. The only case cited by plaintiff in support of her contention is <em>Quattrochi v. Pittsburgh Rys.
