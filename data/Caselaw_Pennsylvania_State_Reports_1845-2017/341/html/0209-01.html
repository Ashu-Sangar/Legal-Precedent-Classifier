Caruso was 48 years of age and slightly crippled in one leg. The established cause of death was drowning.

The application was rejected. H. B. Forjohn, agent of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, testified that ■ Petrillo was the payer of the premiums on policy “C” (written by this agent) and that in June, 1934, he called on Petrillo and informed him that the two policies (“C” and “D”) “were in excess of the tabular limits allowed by the company” and that policy “0” (in Petrillo’s possession) would have to be returned and that he would refund "him the premiums. (Agent Bove had written policy “D.”) Petrillo replied: “Well, what are you all worried about?” Forjohn directed Petrillo to have the agent in Petrillo’s territory transfer the policy to Forjohn’s territory so that he could cancel it.' Petrillo agreed to do this. When the agent returned from his summer vacation he found that the policy had not been transferred and cancelled and that the insured had' died. The agent then requested Petrillo <em>not </em>to present a claim on Policy “C” and gave him $20. Petrillo then agreed to present a claim only on Policy “D.”</p>

He reported to the agent of the Home Life Insurance Company that Caruso had “died accidentally.” When the check for $600.00 was ready on policy “A” (why the amount was not $630.00 does not appear), the defendant and Mrs. Cerrone and the undertaker, A. J. Errichetti, came to the agent’s office and Petrillo said: “Give me the money and I will pay the undertaker.” The agent testified that after Mrs. Cerrone cashed the check at the bank, Petrillo took the money out of her hands. He gave the agent $50.00 for a policy on Mrs. Cerrone’s life. What Petrillo did with the balance of the money does not appear.</p>

Benjamin Kreseh, a lawyer, testified: “Petrillo came to my office and told me that he had a friend who was having difficulty collecting on an insurance policy, that they were trying to collect double indemnity on it, and were only able to get single indemnity from the company, which involved a policy [“B”] with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. I asked who the person was. He said, ‘Mrs. Christine Cerrone.’ ” The attorney testified that he got in touch with that insurance company on several occasions and “finally the Metropolitan agreed to pay the sum of $420.00 in settlement.” The witness said he told defendant about this' offer and the latter “said he would talk to Mrs. Cerrone and let me know, and he returned in a short time and said that the amount was agreeable. ... I communicated with the insurance company and received a check from them payable to Mrs. Cerrone.” The witness said he cashed the check at the Pennsylvania Company, that he gave the cash to “Mrs. Cerrone, and as I remember, she handed some of the money to Petrillo.

Lyman, a home office representative of the John Háncock Mutual Life Insurance Company, testified that when the claim for insurance on Caruso was presented to his company he tried about fifteen or twenty times to meet defendant and finally met him. The latter first represented himself to the witness as “Herman Caruso.” The witness said to defendant: “If you are Herman Caruso, why did you sign our change of beneficiary form as Raffaele Caruso, making yourself brother and beneficiary?” Defendant said that the agent made him do that. The witness said: “What agent made you go into our branch office at 7th and Chestnut and forge the name of Caruso to the claim certificate?” Defendant did not answer. The witness stated the defendant claimed $2,080.00 “because the man was accidentally drowned.” Petrillo, the witness testified, “wanted the one policy that Mr. JBove wrote paid with the double <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>indemnity, and then he propositioned that they pay both of them without double indemnity. Then he propositioned that he would be willing to accept the one that Forjohn wrote with double indemnity. In other words, I think one was $640.00 and the other was $400.00 even.” When the witness told defendant that “the company would have a public administrator appointed, he [the defendant] pulled out an administration paper out of his pocket, a blank, and said that he was going to be made administrator.”</p>

Jones, District Cashier for the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, testified that Petrillo presented a death certificate to him, made an affidavit to it and demanded payment. When the witness asked him by what right he made his claim, “He said he was a brother, beneficiary in the policy” and had “paid the premiums always.” This witness identified a check of that insurance company for $445.00 “to the order of Antonio J. Errichetti” (undertaker) and stated that this check was issued in pursuance of Petrillo’s claim. He said that it was “a partial settlement of two policies” (i. e., policies “C” and “D”). Petrillo signed the release, both as “Herman Caruso” and as “Herman Petrillo.” Later in his testimony the witness said that the release referred to was “in full consideration of both policies.” The Commonwealth called as a witness the undertaker’s son-in-law, who assisted him. He testified that Petrillo got this $445.00, gave the undertaker $250.00, gave the witness $20.00 for flowers and “kept the change.” (Errichetti died in 1936.)</p>

Herron, Assistant District Manager of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, testified that after Caruso’s death the defendant, in reply to a question, said: “I gave the agent the name Herman Caruso because I knew he would not issue the policy unless there was a relative or some beneficial interest in the policy.” Petrillo admitted to an agent that he had <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>signed the name “Raffaele Caruso” to the application for change of beneficiary of policy “C.” Agent Lowa testified that the defendant paid the premiums on policies “C” and “D” and that he represented himself as “[Herman] Caruso.”</p>

Defendant introduced Bolber to “a cripple sitting in a chair,” as Caruso, and when the latter did not reply to Bolber’s question (in English) about his condition, Petrillo said: “Don’t worry about him, I am going to make plenty of money on this man.”</p>

He told her that he wanted her to give him plenty of good attention, as he (Caruso) was about to be operated on for hernia. A week later defendant brought Caruso to her home. She said Petrillo gave her each week, $6.00 for Caruso’s board and $1.00 to pay Caruso’s insurance premiums. Caruso resided at her house from September 1933 to the time of his death.

The next morning Petrillo said to the witness: ‘Would you want to go fishing this afternoon or evening?’ He made the arrangements that this witness should go to the West River bridge, stay near the bridge — and find his car. They met at the point indicated on July 20, 1934. Caruso was on the bank of the Schuylkill River fishing. Defendant came to Sortino, put his left hand on top of his right shoulder and said: ‘I want you to give that man [Caruso] a push.’ ” Sortino testified further: “Beings that it was Herman Petrillo had done me a favor and lent me $10 to pay my rent a few weeks ahead of time, I didn’t know what to do. I got like a shock and I started shaking, and after I start shaking, I made up my mind, I don’t know whether the man would turn around and want to kill me with the other one. So I figured that I would go to it, which he followed me in the back, and I would give the man a push to push him on the ground and I would start to run. ... I went around behind the man, I pushed the man on his left shoulder and pushed right on the ground and when he was on the ground, I started to run. . . . When I looked backward, I saw Herman Petrillo pushing the man in the water. So I got more scared and start to run. I went direct to Morris Bolber and told him the exact thing what had happened.” It was testified by another witness that the water in the river was at that place and time about ten feet deep. Sortino testified that three or four months later the defendant gave him $75.00, telling him “that was for the job done,” and “I advise you to keep quiet if you want to eat bread.”</p>

Park Guard McClain testified that the East River Drive in Fairmount Park (near which drive the drowning of Caruso took place) is well travelled between six and seven o’clock at night and the Girard Avenue Bridge is also well travelled at that hour.

A man came running toward them and said: “Did you hear that?” They replied: “Yes, what is it?” These boys called the park guard’s attention to what they had heard. The park guard took them down to the bank but “they couldn’t see a thing, except a faint haze over the river and it was dark underneath the bridge.” The purpose of this evidence was to contradict Sortino who had testified for the Commonwealth that the drowning of Caruso took place between 7 and 8 p. m. (Daylight Time) on that date. There was no proof as to who made the outcries the boys claim they heard on the night in question. When Park Guard Eckes at about 10:45 p. m. (D.

Sick people, I make them well, but I don’t make them die.”</p>
    <p id="b267-3" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[154,670,1154,429]]]'>In view of the fact that Petrillo was so flatly contradicted in nearly all of his material statements by agents and officers of the insurance companies and by police officers and others, we cannot hold that any substantial error was done him by the court’s permitting defendant to be contradicted on a “collateral” matter by the two statements offered in evidence and dated respectively, April 28th and 30th, 1939.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[153,1110,1154,702]]]'>The trial judge could have emphasized more clearly and forcibly than he did that the evidence contained in these statements was strictly limited to the question of what would be the appropriate penalty should the jury adjudge defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. However, in view of the fact that the trial judge did state when the testimony was admitted that “it was to be considered in connection with the question of penalty, in the event a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree should be reached,” and in view of what the court in its charge said on this point, we find no substantial error in the admission and use of these statements. The above assignments of error are all overruled.</p>

This is based upon the refusal of the court to withdraw a juror when the Commonwealth elicited from the witness, Sortino, the fact that he had pleaded guilty to the same murder for which the appellant was being tried, and that the degree of his guilt had been fixed at murder of the first degree and he had been sentenced to life imprisonment. When the defendant took an exception to this the court said to the jury: “I tell you to ignore and to put out of your minds any statements made heretofore as to what any other tri<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>bunal has decided, whether that tribunal was composed solely of judges or otherwise. The law requires you to reach and to act upon your own and no one else’s opinions and conclusions upon the fact of guilt or innocence of this defendant, and upon the matter of degree of guilt and upon the matter of punishment, and you are obliged under your oaths and the law to let any decision that you may make as a jury reflect only . . . your own collective minds.” We think if' there was any error in the permitting of the fact complained of to be brought out it was cured by the court’s admonition. This court said in <em>Com. v. Fugmann, </em><a href="/pa/330/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="330 Pa. 4" data-case-ids="1183024" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0004-01">330 Pa. 4</a>, 18, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%2099" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="198 A. 99">198 A. 99</a>: “There is seldom any criminal or civil trial of any magnitude or duration into the record of which some irrelevant, incompetent and immaterial testimony does not ‘creep’ and has been subsequently ‘stricken out’ and the jury instructed to ‘disregard it.’ To grant new trials whenever such a thing occurred would mean an interminable and intolerable succession of new trials. . . . If a trial judge or the appellate tribunal believes that the introduction of incompetent testimony subsequently stricken out or ordered disregarded, excites the jury’s prejudice against a prisoner or that the jury disobeyed its instructions to base its verdict exclusively on the other evidence in the case, a new trial should be granted.” The situation presented by this assignment does not call for the granting of a new trial. The Commonwealth’s evidence, if accepted by the jury, made a verdict of guilty of first degree murder the only one which could be reached consistently. The knowledge that the co-principal Sortino received less than the death penalty was a fact tending to favor the defendant when the jury came to fixing the penalty in his case. This assignment is overruled.</p>

Since the defendant had no “insurable interest” whatever in Caruso, the fact that he applied for this insurance and made himself the beneficiary and described himself as Caruso’s “nephew” was evidence from which the jury could legitimately infer that even at that time defendant was already planning the murder of Caruso for profit. This assignment is overruled.</p>
