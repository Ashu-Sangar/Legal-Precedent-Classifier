P. Black, D. Franklin Black, Jr., and Herbert M. Packer, executors named in thé will of D. Frank Black, deceased, as stated by D. Franklin Black, Jr. The appellants, Miriam P. Black and D: Franklin Black, Jr., are the widow and son of the decedent and the principal beneficiaries named in the will; D. Frank Black, prior to his decease on June 3, 1936, <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>was engaged in the dairy supply business on North Broad Street, Philadelphia, a successful and a profitable business built up after many years of effort. The son had been employed by him in his lifetime and was familiar with the details of the business. Expressions in decedent’s will would indicate that he had enjoyed a happy family life from which discord was absent, although Miriam was his second wife and not the mother of his grown children. After his death harmony disappeared and conflicting interests have given rise to this litigation.</p>

Franklin Black, Jr.” He then expressed a wish that a corporation be organized and that his son be elected president and. treasurer. After commenting on the happy relations that had existed in the family he expressed a further desire that the corporation should be good to his wife, Miriam, and give her, if possible, at least $75 a week as long as she remained single. He made his wife his residuary legatee, specifically providing that she should take all stocks, building and loan shares in his name “and all Insurance and Lodges”, also his personal automobile, his personal bank account in the Girard Trust Company, and his savings account in the Liberty Title and Trust Company. He then named the widow, the son, and his friend, Herbert M. Packer, to be executors and trustees of his will.</p>

The court below affirmed the finding of the auditor to the effect that the son Franklin accepted the gift to Mm contained in paragraph 8 of the will, saying: “That the son unequivocally elected to accept the testamentary gift of the business, subject to his payment of decedent’s debts, is established by abundant, clear and convincing evidence. We approve the Auditor’s finding without further discussion.” We are all of the opinion that the finding was amply supported by the evidence. Consequently, we may not interfere with it.

He immediately qualified as executor of his father’s estate and assumed active management of it. Within a week after the death of his father he sent a written notice to all the business customers of his father advising them of his father’s death, that the business had been bequeathed to him, and that he would continue the business as his father had done. He forthwith cancelled the lease for the premises where the business had been conducted and took a new lease in the same building in his own name. By June 7, 1936, he was carrying on the business with the same personnel that had been employed by his father. He secured for himself representation as agent for various concerns which his father had represented. In sixty days he had liquidated seventy per cent of the business and within seven months, ninety-eight per cent <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>thereof; Although, he deposited the proceeds in an estate account, this was but a recognition of the fact that the money so collected ¡ was to be used first in discharge of the obligations of his father as provided by the will. While he was entitled to a reasonable time to determine whether he would accept the legacy with its burdens, he did in fact accept it. Acting as executor he could not allow the assets of the estate to be dissipated; but he could not take advantage of his position as executor, take over the business for his own benefit and, after acquiring the -business, say that he had not accepted the legacy with its burdens. ■ The court below reached the only conclusion possible under the proven facts.</p>

In each case he gave his promissory note<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> payable one day after date and pledged installment stock in the particular association as collateral security. Not only was the withdrawal-value of such installment stock in each association much more than the amount of the loan when it was made,, but in each case the value of the stock was increased more than, the amount of the respective loan <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>between the date of the loan and decedent’s death; After death the stock was withdrawn and the withdrawal value less the amount of the particular loan was paid to the executors of the decedent.

United States, assigning a life policy held by him as security. The agreement provided that the advance with interest should be deducted from any sum payable on the policy at death. At the time of Black’s death the amount due on the policy exceeded the advance and interest by a considerable amount. The auditor and court below held that the advance was not such a debt as was required to be paid out of the business of decedent. With that conclusion we are in accord, for the association could not make any claim against the estate of decedent. It could not have proceeded against the decedent at the date of his death. Consequently there was no indebtedness, as clearly appears from a perusal of the agreement. The policy holder had the right to repay the advance made but he could not be compelled to do so.</p>

The auditor and court below correctly held that this was not such a debt as was required to be paid out of the decedent’s business.

Just prior to the decease of D. Frank Black, the premises were owned by him and his second wife, Miriam P. Black, as tenants by entireties, and the balance then due on the bond and mortgage was $11,500. The auditor directed that this sum should be allowed and paid out of the business. The court en banc likewise so ordered but further directed that upon payment of the claim out of the business assets “such bond and mortgage or judgment thereon, be duly assigned, in subrogation, to the said D. Frank Black, Jr.” We agree with the conclusion reached by the auditor basing that result on the peculiar terms of the will and particularly that provision requiring payment of decedent’s debts from the business bequeathed to the son. The will exhibits a primary intent that the widow should have sufficient out of his estate to meet her necessities, that the son should have the benefit of the valuable business decedent built up in his lifetime, but that the legacy to the son <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>should carry certain responsibilities which would at the same time add to the amount received by the widow. To require the business to pay the bond and mortgage and then permit the son to be subrogated by the amount of such payment meant nothing unless the real estate was worth less than the amount'of.the mortgage. The.creditor asked payment from the personal estate as it had a right to do under the law of this state since' Black’s estate was solvent: <em>Mason’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/89/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="89 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1063198" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0402-01">89 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/89/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="89 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1063198" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0402-01">402</a>; Merkel’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/131/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="131 Pa. 584" data-case-ids="810314" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0584-01">131 Pa. 584</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.%20931" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="18 A. 931">18 A. 931</a>.
