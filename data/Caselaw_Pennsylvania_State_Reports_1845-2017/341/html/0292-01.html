By the earlier of the two, dated July 12, 1927, the original of which has not been produced, she gave the whole of her estate, except for bequests of $500 to each of her two sisters, Emily A. Shaplin and Elizabeth B. Tucker, to The First National Bank of Pen Argyl, which institution she also named as executor, in trust to pay the income and principal, if necessary for his care and maintenance, to her invalid brother, George E. Bundle, during his lifetime, the balance remaining at his death to be divided equally between her aforementioned two sisters. Following the death of the invalid brother, in January of 1937, testatrix removed this will from the bank, where she had left it for safekeeping, and thereafter, on April 30, 1937, executed a new will, “revoking all former wills by me at any time heretofore made”, by which she gave all her estate to her two sisters, share and share alike, and named them and a nephew by marriage, Charles O. B. Martin, as executors.</p>

Knecht, for the rest of his natural life.

Furniture and other personal property to be divided. In case the heirs cannot agree to divide, they all must be sold and divide the money equally, or in six shares.” After her return from California,.and while she was confined as a patient in St. Luke’s hospital by reason of her last illness^ testatrix, on April 23, 1940, executed and prepared a formal “Codicil to my last Will and Testament dated approximately ten years ago”, reciting that it is made “Owing to the fact that I have become intermarried with Edwin F. Knecht, of the Borough Of Wind Gap, County and State aforesaid; since the writing of my last Will &amp; Testament at which time I was a single woman, (my name being Ada Jane Bundle at that time)”, and providing: “Therefore I hereby give, devise and bequeath unto my said beloved husband. Edwin F. Knecht, of Wind Gap Borough, the income from my entire estate, Beal, Personal and mixed, whatsoever and wheresoever the same may be at the time of my decease, for and during his natural life, and after the death of my said husband Edwin F.

These writings were duly probated by-the Register of Wills- as together constituting the last will and testament of testatrix, and letters testamentary were issued to the executors. Thereupon the surviving' husband, who had offered the informal writing dated May 4, 1939 for probate as the last will and testament of testatrix, demanding that letters of administration c.t.a. be issued to him thereon,' appealed to the orphans’ court. On appeal, the orphans’ court concluded that “the will bearing date May 4,1939 and what [testatrix] ' states as a codicil bearing date April 23, 1940 must be taken together as carrying out her intention to dispose of her entire estate”, stating: “It: seems to us to be plain that the decedent intended the codicil of April 23, 1940, tó be made a part of her will as written on May 4,1939, even though she says that it is a codicil to. her last will and testament dated approximately ten years ago.” In accordance with this view, the court sustained the husband’s appeal and entered the decree from which this appeal was taken, ordering that the register “admit to probate the instrument in writing of -the decedent dated May 4, 1939, upon proper proof of [testatrix’s] signature thereto, and further to probate the. instrument in writing signed by her and duly witnessed bearing date April 23, 1940, as a-codicil to the writing bearing date May 4, 1939,” and directing the register “to issue letters of administration c.t.á. or d.b.n.c.t.a. to-, the surviving husband of the said decedent, upon his petitioning for same.” This appeal followed..</p>

It is well settled that, in the absence of a contrary intention, “A duly executed codicil operates as a republication of the original will, so as to make it speak as of the date of the codicil . . .; and it not only operates as a new adoption of the prior will to which it refers, but also as a revocation of an intermediate will”: <em>DeHaven’s Estate (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa/207/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="207 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="933566" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0152-01">207 Pa. 152</a>, 153.
