L. 363, 20 PS § 2601, limiting the right to appeal to “Any party aggrieved by the definitive sentence or decree of any orphans’ court ...” Appellants must therefore bring themselves within the definition of aggrieved parties. In considering whether they are aggrieved, several facts shown by the record must be kept in mind: all the parties in interest are before the court; the City of Lancaster and both hospitals, contingent beneficiaries, are satisfied with the declaratory judgment rendered; on their behalf no question remains for adjudication; the time fixed for the termination of the trust has arrived; the protection of the trust property is not threatened.</p>

Testator’s expressed intention was to supply a park if the City desired it, and, as he made the gifts to the hospitals contingent on the City’s rejection of the park, we must understand that his preference was to benefit the City in that way. He did not authorize his executors to say to the City, here is a site on which we propose to <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>establish a park; take it or leave it. He must be understood to have known and considered that the transaction would involve negotiation with the City because he required municipal action as an attendant fact or circumstance; he contemplated joint consideration by the City and his executors of the elements — inter alia, availability, location, size, expense of maintenance, and its relation to general municipal development, existing and proposed — normally for consideration in such circumstances. His direction that the City must enact a consent ordinance before the executors purchase the land and establish the park, indicates that he intended his executors and the City to join in selecting the site. He assumed that both parties would act, or would be required to act, in good faith in trying to agree to execute his charitable intentions, first, to benefit the City, and, second, the hospitals; while referring to acts in good faith, we add that there is not the slightest suggestion in the case of want of good faith, but the statement of the case would be incomplete if we did not add that the conduct of the parties in carrying out testator’s will is subject to the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court in determining to whom distribution should be made.</p>

We think that is not what the testator meant by what he said. The objection to this literal construction is well, stated, in the brief filed under Rule 61 by counsel for the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce, in these words:</p>

(1) The executors are to purchase, lay out and establish a park. (2) <em>After </em>this has been done, the park is to be conveyed to the City of Lancaster, bnt (3) <em>before </em>the land is purchased the City must adopt an ordinance accepting the park. If this <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>language is construed in the most literal possible sense, the chronological sequence of the contemplated events must necessarily be (1) the adoption of an ordinance by the City, (2) the purchase, laying out and establishment of a park by the executors and (3) the conveyance of the park to the City. <em>In other words, the City must adopt an ordinance accepting a park without knowing what park the executors intend to purchase</em>

By a codicil, he authorized Ms niece “to take out of the income of my estate, all that she requires to render her more than comfortable in her housekeeping during her lifetime.

They have no right to any portion of the income during the lives of Mrs. Thomson and Mrs. Reed, except what may remain after what they have pleased to require.
