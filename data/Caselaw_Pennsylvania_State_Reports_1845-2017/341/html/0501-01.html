The appellants, the trus<a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>tees, strenuously argue that the trust has not terminated, but has been executed in its present manner by virtue of necessity; and furthermore, that the trust is a general one for the benefit of the poor of the Township of Buckingham and should be maintained either as at present administered or under some modified manner devised by the court or by an auditor appointed by it.</p>

With this conclusion we are in accord.</p>

The findings of that court are amply supported by the evidence and áre, therefore, binding on us: <em>Patterson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/333/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="333 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1187959" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0092-01">333 Pa. 92</a>, 93. Scrutiny of the record reveals that John Randall never occupied the farm and buildings dedicated to the trust, and when he died the buildings on the premises were unimproved and unfurnished. The trustees, although in possession of the property from the time of the acceptance of the trust in 1923 until the farm house was destroyed by fire in 1940 (it never having since been replaced), have not improved, repaired or furnished the building so as to make it available or adapta<a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>ble as a Home of the type which Randall had in view for the maintenance of the poor. It has never been specifically identified by signs or otherwise as the “John Randall Memorial Home”, nor has the income from the fund been applied to the maintenance of the premises. On the contrary, the property has been rented by the trustees to various tenants almost continuously under an arrangement whereby such tenants agreed to board any indigent person sent to them by the trustees, but in these seventeen years only one person applied for and received such accommodation. The trustees lent money from the trust fund to several of the tenants in order to stock the farm, all of which loans having since been repaid, and have made some repairs to the propei*ty for the benefit of the tenants. The Township of Buckingham is strictly a rural community with a population of but 590 people; and the trustees, in their answer, admit that, for this reason, it is impractical to establish a Home for the poor as directed by Randall.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.4",544,[272,1385,1152,1027]],["BL_545.1",545,[131,344,1152,483]]]'>In ascertaining whether the trust here involved was intended to be a specific or general one for charity, we must seek the testator’s intention from an examination of the will and its codicil as one instrument: <em>Dutton’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/301/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="301 Pa. 94" data-case-ids="1126483" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0094-01">301 Pa. 94</a>, 97. In so doing, however, we must also take into consideration the agreement inter vivos with the Honesdale National Bank, since by its provisions it is clearly intended to be incidental to and dependent upon the creation of the trust set up in the will. Looking thus to the four corners of these instruments, it seems perfectly obvious that the predominating intention of Randall was to establish a Home for the poor of the township who sought its shelter, with the further benevolent purpose of perpetuating his own memory. That this was the intent is clear from an examination of all three writings, without any necessity whatever of resorting to speculation. We search in vain for the slightest indication of a general charitable intent. There is absolutely nothing to indicate that testator, in his <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>will, codicil or inter vivos agreement, intended to make any provision for the poor generally of the township, unless they could be cared for in the Home, or could not secure admittance therein because of overcrowding or some other such reason. The establishment of the Home was the paramount and primary consideration in the thought of Randall, and a general provision for the poor of Buckingham Township would indeed appear to be quite beyond his contemplation.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[128,838,1155,1027]]]'>Appellants rely on the isolated expression “. . .or for the benefit of the poor of Buckingham Township only . . .”, used by testator in the Eighth paragraph of his will, as the primary support for their contention that decedent contemplated aid or benefit to the poor generally of the community. We find no merit in such argument, for a careful study of the entire paragraph from which this excerpt is taken makes it clearly apparent that the poor for whose benefit the trust was intended to be created are those “who cannot become inmates of said Home.” Obviously this latter qualification cannot be ignored since it presupposes the continued existence of the “John Randall Memorial Home”. The establishment and maintenance of the Home was the main purpose of the trust — the other portion as to those who could not secure accommodation therein was merely ancillary to this principal object. Furthermore, the phraseology contained in the entire will, the codicil and the agreement fortifies this conclusion.</p>

It is well settled that whether a condition shall be construed as precedent or subsequent depends upon the testator’s intention as expressed in his will; and the fact that the time of the performance is indefinite leads to the conclusion that the condition <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>was intended to be subsequent: <em>Thompson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/304/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="304 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1132416" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0349-01">304 Pa. 349</a>, 353. A condition subsequent has been defined to be one which operates upon estates already created and vested, and renders them liable to be defeated: <em>Gypsy Oil Co. v. Escoe, </em><a href="/okla/126/0003-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="126 Okla. 3" data-case-ids="6408714" data-case-paths="/okla/126/0003-01">126 Okla. 3</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=258%20P.%20906" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="258 P. 906">258 P. 906</a>, 908. It is aptly stated, in Scott on Trusts, Vol. 3, Par. 401.2: “Where property is conveyed or devised upon a charitable trust and it is provided that if the property is not used in the manner directed it shall revert to the settlor or his heirs, the trust is subject to a condition subsequent. In such a case if the condition is broken, the settlor or his heirs are entitled to the property.”</p>

It was, however, defeated when the trustees, as found by the learned court below, failed to establish the Home, for the will expressly provides “. . . upon the failure to use the said land for the said Home or should the purpose of this trust fail for any reason whatsoever, I do hereby direct that the said property and trust created for said purpose shall revert to my estate and shall go to my nearest next of kin then living.” Relative to such provisions, we said, in <em>Penna. Horticultural Society v. Craig, </em><a href="/pa/240/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="240 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="993205" data-case-paths="/pa/240/0137-01">240 Pa. 137</a>, 148: “These conditions were intended to safeguard the benefaction of the donor and we are not advised of any declared policy or rule of law making them illegal.

Since no further disposition of this income was directed either by the inter vivos agreement or by the codicil, it follows that the product of the fund was to be applied to the same uses contemplated by the will itself, that is, the establishment and maintenance of the “John Randall Memorial Home”: <em>Baughman’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/281/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="281 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1086979" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0023-01">281 Pa. 23</a>, 39. Consequently, this fund also became part of the res of the “trust created for said purpose” and was subject to the reverter clause of paragraph Sixth of the will. This portion of the trust, being purely ancillary to the main trust and dependent upon it, must of necessity fall when the primary trust itself fails. In <em>Wood’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/321/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="321 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="1165827" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0164-01">321 Pa. 164</a>, this court rejected the contention that the failure of the principal trust would not carry with it the ancillary fund.</p>

With such argument we cannot agree. The auditor, appointed solely to distribute these funds then in the hands of the executor of testator, recommended that they be placed in the Scranton-Lackawanna Trust Company “. . . with instructions that the said fund be maintained in perpetuity, the income thereof, only, be paid to the Overseers of the Poor of Buckingham township [later modified to read “Board of Trustees of the John Randall Home”] for the support of the Poor of Buckingham township, and for necessary repairs of ‘John Randall Memorial Home.’ ” Appellants erroneously argue that this constitutes a finding that the primary purpose of the testator was general poor relief of the township and that such find<a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>ing binds appellees under the doctrine of res judicata.
