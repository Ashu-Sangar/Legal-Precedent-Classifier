Wisegarver, executor of the estate of Nathaniel Moyer, deceased, petitioned the court below for a citation directing Mabel Moyer, appellant, to turn over to the estate certain assets alleged to have been the property of the testator and in his possession at the time of his death, including a certificate of deposit, in the amount of $8,098.35, issued to the testator by the Keystone National Bank of Manheim, Pennsylvania. Appellant filed an answer averring that the certificate of deposit, the only asset mentioned in the petition with which we are here concerned, was her property and not the property of the testator and that it was not in his possession at the time of his death. After hearing upon the petition and answer the court held, without submitting the issue thus raised to a jury, that the certificate was an asset of the estate and directed that it be delivered over to the executor. Exceptions filed by appellant were dismissed by the court en banc and this appeal followed.</p>

He was a childless widower, nearly eighty-two years of age, and for some time before his death had been confined to his home, suffering from dropsy and arteriosclerosis. <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>Edith Bours, a foster daughter, and her husband lived with testator for a year and a half prior to his death and appellant, who was testator’s niece and a trained nurse, went to live with him on November 3, 1937, nursing him until his death. On November 22, 1937, testator executed and acknowledged a power of attorney conferring upon appellant broad powers to act for him in affairs of business and to manage and dispose of his money and personal property. Being unable to affix his name to this document, testator signed it with his mark, duly attested, and it remained in effect until his death. Prior to the execution of the power of attorney, the certificate of deposit, which was testator’s principal asset, was in the custody of Edith Bours who testified that “a few days” thereafter she surrendered it to appellant.

An aunt and a cousin of appellant testified •that on this date they came to testator’s home, at his request, and were present in his room when the alleged gift was made. They stated that he instructed appellant to go into another room and procure the certificate, which she did. After examining it, testator handed it to her, saying: “Mabel take this, this is yours”. The witnesses testified that appellant seemed “stunned” and hesitant, but accepted when testator repeated his insistence. The aunt inquired whether testator intended to make a gift to appellant and he replied that he did. Another cousin of appellant, who was not present when the certificate was delivered, stated that testator subsequently informed her of the gift and said that he was “ready to die”. In rebuttal, Edith Bours testified that the certificate was still in her custody on November 25, 1937, and that she did not surrender it to appellant <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>until “either the 30th of November or first of December”.

Admittedly the certificate of deposit was not .in the actual possession of the testator at the time of his death, nor was it thereafter in the possession of his personal representative.

    <p id="b443-5" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[164,1328,1156,1083]],["BL_444.1",444,[273,340,1146,374]]]'>Whether the certificate was presumptively within the possession of testator was a jurisdictional fact within the power of the court below to determine: <em>Cutler’s Est., Cooper’s Est., Keysets Est., Crisswell’s Est., </em>all isupra. And, it appears that there was sufficient evidence to create, <em>prima facie, </em>such a presumption. The certificate of deposit had been in the possession of the testator until a few weeks before his death; it remained payable to his order and was never endorsed to the appellant; and it had not been presented to the bank for payment by appellant. Furthermore, appellant was, at the time of the alleged transfer to her, the holder of a broad power of attorney authorizing her to take into her custody the personal property of the testator. In <em>Keyser’s Est., </em>supra, it was said, at 522: “The agency relationship existing between decedent and appellant and his wife prior to the former’s death was not denied, and its existence warranted a finding that appellant’s possession of the certificates at his father’s death, if such was the fact, was as agent only”. Clearly the <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>court below was justified in concluding that it had jurisdiction, in the broad sense, over the subject matter of the controversy. But it is equally clear that, if a “substantial dispute” existed between the parties as to the ownership of the certificate, it had no power to go further and finally determine the question of title raised by appellant’s averment of a gift <em>causa mortis.</em>

The fact-finding power of the court is limited to a determination of whether a substantial dispute exists, and for this purpose it may hear evidence in support of the pleadings. In <em>Cutler’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/225/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="225 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="965391" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0167-01">supra,</a> it was said, at 171 : “If at testator’s death the property is shown to have been in his possession, or if for any other reason it was presumptively his, a mere denial of his ownership unsupported will not oust the court of its jurisdiction, but the court may proceed with the investigation <em>so far as to inform itself whether the denial is made in good faith and a substantial dispute exists”. </em>The submission of the case to a jury upon the disclosure of a substantial dispute of title is not, therefore, merely a matter of formal procedure, unrelated to the question of jurisdiction; it is a procedure pre-requisite to the final settlement of the issue of ownership, and unless and until it is taken, the orphans’ court is without further jurisdiction in the case. Since the finding and conclusion that there is no substantial dispute, in good faith, between these parties, over the ownership of the certificate, is determinative of the power of the court <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>below to make the decree from which this appeal was taken, it is necessary to consider whether, upon the whole record, that determination is supported by the evidence and the law relating to the alleged gift <em>causa mortis.</em>

See also <em>McCown v. Fraser, </em><a href="/pa/327/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="327 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1176688" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0561-01">327 Pa. 561</a>, 564-65. To meet this burden, appellant called three witnesses who testified, in substance, that the testator voluntarily requested her to produce the certificate; that he examined it and knew what it was; that he delivered it manually to appellant, using words indicative of a gift to her; that she was surprised and “stunned” by his act; and that he expressly stated his intention to make a gift to her in contemplation of death. These witnesses offered their testimony without hesitation and with such clarity that the court below found it “too good to be true”. If they were to be believed, their evidence was obviously sufficient to rebut the presumption that the gift was void. That the witnesses are related to appellant by marriage affects merely the weight of the evidence and their credibility. As the contradictory testimony of Edith Bours raised a sharp issue of fact and there is no evidence of bad faith on the part of appellant in claiming title to the <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>certificate, there was such a clear and substantial dispute between the parties as required the submission of the case to a jury.</p>

Prior to the Negotiable Instruments Law of May 16, 1901, P. L. 194, certificates of deposit were held in this state to be non-negotiable, and it was well settled that a valid gift could be effected without either endorsement or assignment in writing, See <em>Connell’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/282/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="282 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1088406" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0555-01">282 Pa. 555</a>, 560.

An endorsement would have made them a gift inter vivos, and the donor would have parted with the proceeds entirely. As he gave them without endorsement, it left them subject to revocation by will or otherwise during his lifetime”. Although certificates of deposit have been held to be negotiable instruments under the Act of 1901 <em>(Gordon v.

In the last cited case it was stated: “The weight of authority seems to establish the rule almost beyond controversy that the indorsement of an instrument of the character we are considering is not necessary, as a matter of law, to sustain a gift inter vivos or one causa mortis. The absence of the indorsement is, however, a proper matter for evidence, and might be considered by a jury in case of a gift inter vivos, with more suspicion than in one causa mortis”.

In the present case, therefore, the absence of an endorsement upon the certificate of deposit would not be conclusive of an incomplete gift, but would merely be evidence to be considered by the jury with all of the other circumstances of the case in determining whether a gift <em>cansa mortis </em>was effected as a matter of fact. In this connection it would be proper to consider whether the testator, at the time of the alleged transfer, was physically able to make such an endorsement. See <em>Westerlo v.

In the case of money on deposit or loaned out, the certificate of deposit or bill, note or bond may be delivered <em>properly endorsed </em>and it will confer on the donee an absolute title of the fund represented by it, but if there remains something for the donor to do before the title of the donee is complete, the donor may decline further performance and resume his own”. This manifestly refers to gifts <em>inter vivos, </em>and the statement with regard to endorsement is made generally, and not with particular limitation to certificates of deposit. Nor does it purport to imply that there can be no valid gift of a certificate of deposit <em>without </em>endorsement. Furthermore, an examination of the facts of that case discloses how inapplicable it is to the situation now before us. There the decedent gave her niece certain certificates of deposit, saying: “Those are the certificates for you, as I intend fixing up my affairs”, but immediately took back the instruments and restored them to their accustomed place in a drawer to which both she and her niece had access. Subsequently the niece, as agent for the decedent, took the certificates to the bank and collected the interest thereon, and new certificates were issued in the name of the decedent and were placed by her in the drawer where the old certificates had always been kept. They were found there upon her death, and passed into the possession of the executors of her estate, of which the niece was one. The only testimony to sustain the gift was that of the niece herself, whom the auditor found to be an incompetent witness.
