    <p id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.7",109,[165,2026,1148,374]],["BL_110.1",110,[268,326,1146,480]]]'>“After careful consideration, the Court is convinced that there was substantial and legally credible evidence to sustain the conclusion of the . . .

At one time she had neglected to wait on a customer, but was excused by the manager of the store. . . .”</p>

If it appear that Mrs. Pupack was offered appropriate employment and declined it, or otherwise became disqualified from performing the duties of the employment, such facts should be taken into consideration in determining the sum necessary to reimburse her. What Mr. Chief Justice Hughes said in <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. Nat’l Labor Relations Board et al., </em><a href="/us/311/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="311 U.S. 7" data-case-ids="6136494" data-case-paths="/us/311/0007-01">311 U. S. 7</a> (November 12, 1940), is also true of our Act: “The Act is essentially remedial. It does not carry a penal program declaring the described unfair labor practices to be crimes. The Act does not prescribe penalties or fines in vindication of public rights or provide indemnity against community losses as distinguished from the protection and compensation of employees.” In <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. N. L. R. B., </em><a href="/f2d/113/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="113 F.2d 202" data-case-ids="1023500" data-case-paths="/f2d/113/0202-01">113 F. 2d 202</a>, 206 (C. C. A. 2d 1940), it was said: “There is no reason to suppose that Congress intended to have those who had unlawfully been deprived of their jobs maintained in idleness beyond the period when they had an opportunity to do work they were fitted to perform. They were bound to use reasonable efforts to find work and to keep employed.” See also the opinion of Biggs, J., in <em>Subin v. N. L. R.
