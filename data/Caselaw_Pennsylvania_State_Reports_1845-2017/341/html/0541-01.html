The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree and fixed the penalty at death. Appellant’s motion for a new trial having been refused and judgment having been entered and sentence of death imposed, he has taken this appeal, claiming that the record discloses trial errors which deprived him of a full, fair and impartial trial such as he was entitled to.</p>

He was taken to a near-by doctor’s office by persons attracted to the scene by the shot, where the doctor informed him that he had not long to live, and thereafter was removed to the McKeesport Hospital, where he died at 10:21 the same morning. Before dying, Akerson stated to his wife that he had been followed and hailed by a colored man, that he, Akerson, asked the man what he wanted, that just then a car approached and he shouted for help, whereupon the colored man, while he “still had his hands up”, “let him have it”, and he stated to one of his employers, “You know that nigger shot me down like a dog”. Death was ascribed to hemorrhage and shock due to a gunshot wound entering the chest through the arm-pit beneath the right arm, severing the spinal cord.</p>

And, during the investigation of the crime, appellant himself identified one John Ryan, who testified that on the night of the killing appellant had followed him for several blocks and hailed him as he turned into his home, located near the scene of the crime, ivhere he arrived between 12:00 and 12:15 a. m., as “the man that I followed up Locust Street that fooled me and went into the house”.</p>

At first he denied any participation in the shooting, stating that he had not been out of his rooming house on the night in question and that at the time of the shooting he was in bed with his alleged girlfriend, one Anna Lou Davis, who lived at the same address. The truth of this assertion having been denied by the girl, appellant said that on the night of the shooting he had left his home at 11:18 p. m. and burglarized the house of one George Raback, but had returned by 12:25 a. m. When this statement was likewise proved to be false, the burglary having taken place on May 30, 1940, the night prior to the night of the killing, appellant, on June 7, 1940, made and signed a detailed written statement in which he admitted participating in an attempt to rob Akerson with a man named Spencer who, as it was subsequently learned, could have had no possible connection with the crime, but stated that Spencer fired the fatal shot. On June 8, 1940, appellant wrote a letter to the aforementioned Anna Lou Davis, asking forgiveness “for participating in that heinous crime”, referring to the killing of Akerson, as he admitted, and thereafter, on June 13, 1940, he stated <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>that “he wanted to get it over with, he was going to tell everything”, whereupon he made a statement, later repeated in a more detailed statement given to the District Attorney, on June 17, 1940, which was reduced to writing and signed by appellant, relating that he alone intercepted Akerson, asking if there were any “good time houses” in that locality, that Akerson made an insulting remark to him and he thought Akerson was reaching for a gun, when he, appellant, pulled his gun from his pocket and it accidentally discharged.</p>
    <p id="b581-3" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[133,904,1153,1247]]]'>On the following day, June 14,1940, appellant pointed out where he had thrown the gun into the Youghiogheny river, and, on June 15, 1940, one John Phar delivered to the authorities a gun which he had found imbedded in the mud of the bank of the river at a point near that indicated by appellant. This gun was identified by appellant as his gun with which he had shot Akerson, and it was shown by the testimony of a ballistic expert, called by the Commonwealth, to have been the gun from which the bullet taken from the body of Akerson had been fired. In his statement of June 17, 1940, appellant detailed his movements on the streets prior to the shooting. He stated that after he had shot Akerson he returned to the unused attic of his rooming house, where he hid the gun behind a loose brick in the chimney, and that he threw it in the river the following day because, as they testified at the trial, his landlady and her niece had discovered that he had been in the attic and were curious as to his purpose in going there. He further stated that he identified the gun as his gun by the series of numerals appearing on its butt end, the first three figures of which he used in combination, in “playing the numbers”.</p>

He testified that he was at home at the time of the shooting, having arrived there about 12:07 a. m., which testimony was in no way corroborated. On this appeal the assignments of error, many of which are trivial and relate to matters which were not objected to, are principally directed against (1) the admission in evidence, as a dying declaration, of Akerson’s statement to his wife as to the circumstances of the shooting, (2) the admission of appellant’s signed statements, (3) the cross-examination permitted of appellant and of his character witnesses, and (4) against the charge as a whole.</p>

His knowledge may appear from declarations made to or by him. The nature of the wounds is also important as bearing on the injured party’s knowledge of his condition: <em>Kehoe v.

      <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>Here the deceased was informed by the physician, to whose office he was taken immediately after the shooting, that he “had not long to live” and that his- family should be notified. Later, at the hospital, and shortly before making the statement in question, he himself stated that “he <em>thought </em>he was dying”. In view of the nature of his injuries, his spinal cord being severed, the information given him with no hope of recovery, his own statement indicating that he was fully aware of the seriousness of his condition, and the fact of his death following within a few hours, less than ten hours after the shooting, it may safely be assumed that Akerson realized he was about to die. The court, in its charge, carefully pointed out to the jury that Akerson’s statement had not been made under the sanctity of an oath; also that it was made at a time when appellant was not present, and without opportunity for cross-examination. The jury was instructed that “if Mr. Akerson, when he made the statements [to his wife], realized that he was about to die and pass into the presence of his Maker, if he had no hope of recovering, then you should consider these statements and give them such weight as you find they are entitled to receive at your hands”, but that “if, on the other hand, you are not satisfied that he realized he was about to die, and you find that he had hopes of recovering, then ignore them and give them no consideration whatever”. There- can be no doubt of the competency of the statement, as a dying declaration, under all our cases, and the instructions of the court as to the weight to be given such evidence were adequate.</p>

Becker, </em><a href="/pa/326/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="326 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1174415" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0105-01">326 Pa. 105</a>, 114-15, “A distinction is drawn between cases where it is sought to prove particular acts of misconduct and those where the purpose of the examination is to test the accuracy of the testimony by showing either that the witness is not familiar with the reputation concerning which he has testified or that his standard of what constitutes good repute is unsound. . . . The admission of testimony of good reputation is of doubtful value and often deceptive where there is not applied to it the acid test of cross-examination to prove the accuracy of the testimony and the standard by which the witness measures reputation”. We have carefully considered the portions of the record involved and are convinced that the purpose of the cross-examination was solely to test the reliability of the character witnesses, as the prosecution stated at the trial, and not to show that appellant had committed other specific offenses for which he was not on trial; hence, the objection cannot be sustained: <em>Com. v. Becker, </em><a href="/pa/326/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="326 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1174415" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0105-01">supra.</a> In any event, we are satisfied that none of the questions, or responses thereto, could possibly have had any serious effect upon the jury’s verdict, and complaint concerning them is, therefore, unavailing.</p>

Such misstatements of fact as may have inadvertently crept into the charge could not possibly be regarded as having prejudiced appellant, particularly in view of the court’s caution to the jury that its own recollection of the testimony, and not the court’s, should be relied upon in case of any conflict. If the charge referred at greater length to the evidence of the Commonwealth, it was only because more evidence was offered on that side of the case and, under these circumstances, it was proper that it should do so: <em>Com. v.

Isolated excerpts torn from the heart of the charge cannot be considered apart from their context, and if the whole is accurate and fair, the parts objected to do not form a proper basis for reversal: <em>Com. v. Schurtz, </em><a href="/pa/337/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="337 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1197334" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0405-01">337 Pa. 405</a>, 411; <em>Com. v.
