Giacobbe died on April 2, 1933. His body was exhumed in May, 1939, and some of the vital organs were extracted and turned over to the city chemists, Drs. Burke and Lampert, for analysis. Dr. Burke testified as to large quantities of arsenic which he found in the liver, stomach and kidneys, and which, he declared, were “far in excess of the usual amount of arsenic found in poisoning cases.” Dr. Wads-worth, the coroner’s physician, stated that, on the basis of Dr. Burke’s report, it was his opinion that Giacobbe had died of arsenic poisoning. There was evidence that no arsenic had been prescribed for the deceased by any physician, and also that the embalming fluid used on his body contained none.</p>

Stetson Company where the deceased had been employed. Not only did defendant participate largely in the negotiation of these policies, but some of them were taken out on her own initiative. On one occasion she requested the insurance agent not to mention the matter to her husband because he “didn’t care much for insurance and I [the agent] would spoil it if I spoke to him about it.” This agent prepared the application and asked Giacobbe to sign it without informing him as to its nature or even showing it to him, and, upon Giacobbe saying that he could not write, the agent himself signed Giacobbe’s name and made a cross-mark. Later defendant asked this same agent “if she could get more insurance on her husband,” and another policy was taken out, the application again being executed by the agent by making a cross-mark and signing Giacobbe’s name. Two policies were also written on Giaeobbe’s life at the request of one Paul Petrillo upon his false representation that Giacobbe was his uncle; they named Petrillo as beneficiary, the applications being executed by the agents signing Giacobbe’s name. Petrillo, who conducted a tailor shop in the immediate neighborhood of the Giacobbe home, was an intimate friend of defendant; she admitted that she had meretricious relations with him both before and after her husband’s death.</p>

She admitted that by “fix” she understood he was going to kill her husband, but at the trial testified' that she “thought it was a joke.”</p>

It <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>was not until a week later, on March 30th, that defendant sent for a physician, Dr. Pescatore. The doctor found Giacobbe in great distress, gave him a hypodermic of morphine “to quiet him down,” and told defendant he thought he ought to come back the following day because her husband “looked very ill.” She told him not to return, that she would call him if she thought it necessary. Three days later, on April 2nd, he and several other physicians received emergency calls, but upon arrival at the house they found Giacobbe dead. As Doctor Pescatore emerged from the room where Giacobbe lay, defendant took him aside and asked for a death certificate. On that very night she notified one of the insurance agents of her husband’s death, and shortly thereafter the necessary proofs were executed and the insurance money was collected by her and Petrillo on their respective policies. Although by that time, at least, she had knowledge that Petrillo, pretending to be a nephew, had placed insurance on her husband’s life, she made no objection or comment.</p>

The only thing, your conscience bothers you and therefore you think he is coming,” to which she made no reply.</p>

Facts which individually are not of controlling importance may, when cumulated, lead to probable or even well-nigh inevitable inferences, since each incriminating fact brings not merely additional but often multiple weight to the conclusion which it tends to establish. Here we have a variety of motives for the murder arising from defendant’s lack of affection for her husband, her relations with Petrillo, his desire to marry her, and the insurance which they carried on Giacobbe’s life. We have also the element of constant opportunity for the commission of the crime by Petrillo and its facilitation by defendant. We have Petrillo’s announced intention of “fixing” Giacobbe and his subsequent statement that he had carried out that intention. We have the fact that, although defendant was told by Petrillo of his purpose, she continued her association with him; also that, while she had every reason to believe or at least gravely suspect that her husband’s acute pains and distress were due to Petrillo’s handiwork and not to the chronic diabetes, she not only did not procure medical aid until a week after his serious illness began, but even then, in disregard of the doctor’s advice, would not permit him to call again, and it was not until her husband finally collapsed that physicians were summoned. We have also her subsequent incriminating conduct, such as her callous behavior (see <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Karmendi, <a href="/pa/328/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="328 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1179726" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0321-01">328 Pa. 321</a>, 337, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2062" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="195 A. 62">195 A. 62</a>, 68), her immediate request for a death certificate, her unseemly haste, manifested on the very day of Giacobbe’s death, to collect the insurance, her sleeplessness and delusional fears regarding the “coming” of her dead husband, and her silence when charged by Bolber with having a guilty conscience. We <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>have the further fact that when, some two months after her husband’s death, Petrillo expressly told her that he had murdered him, she made no attempt to notify the authorities or to bring Petrillo to justice. Finally, we have her suicidal attempts six years later when discovery- occurred and prosecution was imminent. While none of these facts was, of course, conclusive, the jury, could properly conclude that, in combination, they were not only “consistent with and pointed to the guilt-of the accused but were inconsistent with her innocence.”-</p>

While the probative value of such evidence has apparently never come before a Pennsylvania court for consideration, there is a unanimity of decision in other jurisdictions<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that it is admissible on the same theory as flight, or manifestations of mental distress, fear, nervousness or excitement on the part of one charged with crime. The learned trial judge charged the jury that they might give to this testimony, in connection with all the other facts and circumstances of the case, whatever weight they, in their discretion, thought it deserved,' because an attempt to commit suicide under a given set of .circumstances might or might not indicate a consciousness of guilt.

While this witness stated that the formula was a secret, he gave the principal ingredients and testified that the preparation contained no arsenic. One of the city chemists who made an analysis of the fluid as now used found that there was no arsenic in it, and certainly it is reasonable to assume that one in authority in the business would know whether his company had used the same kind of fluid during the past few years, and also, in general, the elements which composed it.</p>

The whole theory of the Commonwealth’s case was that defendant and Petrillo were acting in concert in the perpetration of the crime and were actuated by the same motives. It was proper, therefore, to show that when she learned that Petrillo had taken out such insurance she made no protest, objection or comment, even though, <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>as site was informed, he had falsely represented himself to be her husband’s nephew, but, on the contrary, she joined with him in executing the proofs of their claims.
