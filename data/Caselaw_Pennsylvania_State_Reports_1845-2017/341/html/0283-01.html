Both it and the Pennsylvania Act expressly include within their scope controversies not only where <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>the parties are interested in the same business enterprise and occupy the proximate relation of employer and employee, but also where they are merely engaged in the same <em>industry </em>or have “direct or indirect interests therein.”</p>

It is that industry which is the source of profits for plaintiff and of wages for members of the union. There is necessarily an interdependence and interrelation between the production, selling and delivery units of every business, these being but successive stages in the conduct of an industry. Of course, as need hardly be added, the ultimate consumer of the product has no interest of the kind contemplated by the statute in the industry manufacturing or selling that product.</p>

The act, for example, does not purport to legalize a “secondary boycott.” If employees, or a labor union, have a controversy with an employer, they may picket the retail outlets where the product made by that employer is sold, in order to induce consumers not to purchase it. Indeed, to the extent to which they merely publicize, by true and fair statements, the facts of a labor dispute, they are within the protection given to freedom of speech by Article I, section 7, of the State Constitution and the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution: <em>Kirmse v. </em>Adler, <a href="/pa/311/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="311 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1146314" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0078-01">311 Pa. 78</a>, 85, 89, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20566" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="166 A. 566">166 A. 566</a>, 569, 570; <em>Thornhill v.
