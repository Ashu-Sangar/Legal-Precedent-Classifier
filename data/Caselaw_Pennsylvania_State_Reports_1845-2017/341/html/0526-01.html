    <p id="b563-12" data-blocks='[["BL_563.21",563,[134,1768,1152,539]]]'>The court below invalidated an ordinance of the City of Scranton relating to barber shops on the ground that it violated Article 2, Section 1, and Article 1, Section 1 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and the 14th amendment to the Federal Constitution. We propose to pass upon that feature of it only which involves an unlawful delegation of legislative power. Parenthetically, we may observe that it is difficult to understand how the ordinance could be considered a health measure and as such a valid exercise of the police power.</p>
