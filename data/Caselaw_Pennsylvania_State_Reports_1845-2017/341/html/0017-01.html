McBride, was injured by collision with another car operated by defendant at the intersection of Eleventh and Ruscomb Streets, Philadelphia. Plaintiff averred facts from which defendant’s negligence might be found by a jury and sought recovery for personal injuries and damage to her car. Defendant, Manko, by his answer, denied the negligent operation alleged. Pursuant to Rule 2252, 332 Pa. cxxiii, he filed a petition to join McBride, driver of plaintiff’s car, as additional defendant. He alleged facts which would support a finding that the collision was caused by the additional defendant’s negligence. After stating the facts of the collision, he concluded, “that the said negligence of the said Thomas D. McBride was either the sole cause or a major contributing cause of said collision, it being impossible to determine which of said alternatives is correct until the case is tried”; and that he “desires to protect his right of contribution in the event that your petitioner be found to <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>have been jointly negligent with the said Thomas D.

The order dismissing the action against the additional defendant ivas final and subject to appeal. The learned judge said: “The writ [defendant’s petition] alleged liability in the alternative on the part of the additional defendant, that is to say, it averred: first, that the additional defendant was solely responsible for the accident ; and, second, that if the additional defendant were found to be jointly liable with the defendant for the accident, the latter desired to hold the additional defendant to a liability to contribute to the satisfaction of any verdict that might be recovered against the defendant.

L. 663, and May 18, 1933, P. L. 807. The Amendment- of June 25, 1937, P. L. 2118, which permits a more liberal use of the writ of scire facias is suspended. In thus returning to practice prior to the Amendment of 1937, this rule seeks to avoid the confusion which that amendment might produce and follows in general Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” He added that “From this explanatory note it is evident that the right to bring in an additional defendant on an alternative liability was intended to be abolished by the adoption of the new rules by the Supreme Court.” The publication of the Rules was accompanied by a statement, 332 Pa. xxxvi, that “The explanatory notes to these rules were inserted by the Procedural Rules Committee for the convenience of the Bench and Bar; they are not part of the rules and have not been officially adopted or promulgated by the Supreme Court.”</p>

L. 663, to the Act of April 10, 1929, P. L. 479, both of which are suspended by the Rules.</p>

This amendment included much more than the mere addition of the words “or in the alternative”; other provisions enlarged third party procedure, and it is perhaps fair to say that it ivas these other provisions that had resulted in quite general dissatisfaction with such procedure as developed after and pursuant to the amendments of 1937. This dissatisfaction, we think, did not result from the effect of the words “or in the alternative,” because, prior to the Act of 1937, conclusions in the alternative were accepted under the amendments of 1931: <em>Clineff v.

The facts constituting the transaction as averred in defendant’s petition may enable the jury to find that the additional defendant is in class 1 — alone liable; or in class 3— jointly liable with the defendant. The result of plaintiff’s election not to file a supplementary statement <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>against the additional defendant is that she cannot recover against him, but that fact, standing alone, does not take him out of the case. The defendant has the right to keep him in to enforce contribution if the jury find against both. The statement in the Committee’s note to Rule 2258 that “If the defendant joins an additional defendant on the ground that the latter is alone liable to the plaintiff but the plaintiff files no supplementary statement there will be no party in the action asserting any claim against the additional defendant and he should therefore be dropped from the record,” applies between a plaintiff and the original defendant but cannot apply when an issue between the two defendants is for trial.

While plaintiff’s election removed the possibility of the additional defendant’s being held alone liable to the plaintiff, we still have to consider whether proof of the facts averred would support a finding of joint liability of the two defendants.

This court held that “The evidence of the original defendant made out a prima facie case of sole liability on the part of the additional defendants and it is of no moment that the jury, under all the evidence, found that all the defendants contributed to causal culpability. The finding against her [original defendant] was in all probability based upon the testimony that was offered respectively by plaintiffs and by the additional defendants.
