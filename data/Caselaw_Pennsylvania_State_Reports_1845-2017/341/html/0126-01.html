    <p id="Atf" data-blocks='[["BL_163.11",163,[162,1121,1148,811]]]'>Plaintiff brought a bill in equity to which defendants filed preliminary objections in the nature of a general demurrer, but before hearing thereon plaintiff filed an amended bill. Defendants renewed the preliminary objections, which were sustained with leave to plaintiff to amend her bill within thirty days under penalty of having it dismissed. Plaintiff filed another amended bill to which defendants once more filed the preliminary objections. These objections were again sustained by the court and the bill was dismissed. Plaintiff complains that she was not given an opportunity for still further amendment, but the action taken by the court was in accordance with Buie 49 of the Buies of Equity Practice (see, by way of illustration, <em>Compton v. Heilman, </em><a href="/pa/331/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="331 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1184264" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0545-01">331 Pa. 545</a>, 548, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20A.2d%20682" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 A.2d 682">1 A. 2d 682</a>, 684).</p>

The bill prayed that defendants be enjoined from attempting to purchase the mortgage and obtain her property by foreclosure, that plaintiff be given relief from foreclosure under the Act of June 2, 1937, P. L. 1182, that defendants account to plaintiff for the “several amounts” which they owe her, and that they be compelled to “contribute” whatever sum may be necessary to satisfy the mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.4",164,[262,1607,1148,644]]]'>It is obvious that there are no facts sufficiently presented to warrant equitable relief. True, there is an indirect reference to alleged “false assurances of defendants,” but plaintiff does not seek to rescind the transaction. Moreover, her unexplained delay in not filing the bill of complaint until thirteen years after making settlement for the property would be such laches, apparent on the face of the bill, as to bar any rights in equity which might otherwise have existed: <em>Kinter v.
