The policy was issued at Bayonne, N. J., December 8, 1923, and, inter alia, provided “that if . . . the Company receives due proof that the Insured, as the result of injury or disease occurring and originating after the issuance of the Policy, has become totally and permanently disabled so as to be unable at any time to perform any work or engage in any business for compensation or profit, the Company will allow the following benefits: “(a) . . . the Company, commencing with the anniversary of the Policy next following receipt of such proof, will waive payment of each premium becoming due during such disability, and, in addition, commencing six months from the receipt of such proof, will pay each month . . . a Monthly Annuity . . .” of $50.00 on this policy.</p>

It is unnecessary to deal with the adjective “due” in the phrase “due proof,” and, as the policy did not require written proof, the familiar rule of construction of insurance policies requires that we hold, in the circumstances to be referred to, that the defendant cannot complain because the proof was oral.</p>

J., maintained by or on behalf of the defendant. The district manager of that office until June, 1926, was a Mr. Goff;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the assistant manager was named Gleich; an agent named Lakoff sold the policy to the plaintiff. Lakoff testified that in 1926 plaintiff’s wife told him that her husband “was very, very ill, and that he had a disease that was going to incapacitate him for apparently a long time; he had sleeping sickness.” She asked, “ ‘Is there anything that we can do because of the policy that you wrote for him?’ She said that it had something in there that in the event of disability, that we will be able to take care of it. That is the way she expressed it. ... I said that the policy had a disability clause in it. I would see what can be done.” He testified that he presented the subject to the assistant manager of the Bayonne Office, who “subsequently told me that ... he did not think that there was a disability. We both talked to Mr. Goff [district manager] at the Bayonne Office. He said at that time that apparently there was not a disability as far as the policy was concerned. . . . No specific instructions Avere given me to tell Mrs. Astrin that there was no disability. I was simply told that there would be no disability claim; it wasn’t one which we could properly file. . . . Q. Did you communicate with Mrs. Astrin? A. Yes. Q. What, if anything, did you say to her? A. I told Mrs. Astrin that Ave were unable, from the standpoint of the people who told me this, that they could not file it with the company — they have not considered taking the claim or filing it with the company.” The plaintiff himself testified that in 1926, Gleich, the assistant manager, came to plaintiff’s house, where he had a conversation with him: “Q. Can you tell us Avhat it was? A. I told him I had a disability, I am entitled to get disability. Q. What did they tell you? A. They told me I Avasn’t sick enough.”</p>

If the defendant desired more formal or more detailed proof, it was its duty so to inform the plaintiff instead of denying liability on other grounds.
