The legislature took from the institution districts throughout the state, created by the Act of 1937, supra, the power to operate hospitals for indigent mentally ill persons and declared the Commonwealth would thereafter perform that service, and, in order to perform it, took from the institution districts existing hospital properties. The Act provided for details incident to making the change. The law was complete. Nothing remained except to put it in effect. The duty of enforcement was vested in the executive department of the state government; the Governor “shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed ...” Constitution, Article IY, section 2. If the problem had been simple and free from complications, the legislature might have provided, with respect to all the mental health hospitals involved, what it provided in section 3, that, without waiting for the survey by the Department of Welfare, the Commonwealth should take over the management of such a hospital in any city of the first class as soon as practicable after the effective date of the act. But in some of the districts, the problem was not simple in its elements. The record shows that conditions in Avhich these hospitals were conducted varied and were complicated by the fact that in some districts, institutions for the care of the poor, operated pursuant to the Act of 1937, supra, were operated in conjunction with the mental health hospitals. The state could have taken over the care of the poor as well as indigent men-<a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>.tAT health cases and the property used by the districts in caring for both classes. If that had been done, no district, for the reason stated above, could be heard to complain that property was taken without compensation. As the Commonwealth was not taking over the operation of all these institutions but only the mental health hospitals, it became necessary to provide for the application of the law as the facts might require.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> No complaint therefore can be sustained merely because of difficulty in separating the property used for the poor from that, used in the mental health eáses. If the Commonwealth may take all, it may take part. These complications, not present in the case of the Philadelphia hospital, required different legislative treatment from that applied to that institution and the Act so provided. The legislature, having declared that all the property devoted to care of mental health cases should be taken, and that the Commonwealth should thereafter perform the service, might have retained all the property devoted to that purpose and there is nothing in the Act which prevents the Commonwealth from retaining all of it. It was unneces- ' sary in this Act to provide to return any part of it.</p>

Section 3, on which the contention of unlawful delegation of legislative power is based, directs the Department of Welfare to “make an investigation and survey of the institutions hereby transferred to the Commonwealth for the purpose of determining— (1) which of the institutions are necessary, having regal'd to the number of persons requiring care and treatment because of mental illness, and the geographic location and capacity of other such mental hospitals; and (2) which of the institutions, having regard to existing facilities, may be operated by the Commonwealth in such a manner as to insure the proper maintenance, custody, safety and welfare of mental patients. Upon the completion of its investigation and survey, the Department of Welfare shall submit to the Governor a report setting forth its findings and recommendations, with respect to the institutions deemed necessary and suitable for the care, maintenance and treatment of mental patients and the institutions deemed unnecessary or unsuitable for this purpose. Upon receiving the report of the Department of Welfare, the Governor shall, from time to time, but not later than the thirty-first day of May, one thousand nine hundred thirty-nine, [extended by subsequent amendment] having regard to the standards of necessity and suitability hereinbefore set out in this section, determine which of the institutions shall be managed and operated by the Commonwealth as State mental hospitals and which institutions, if any, shall be closed.. ..” There is provision, then, for a survey based on two comprehensive lines: necessity and suitability, as outlined. Whether an existing institution is suitably equipped for the care of such patients requires the exercise of scientific judgment of persons qualified on the subject. The opinions of physicians, psychiatrists, architects, engineers and others will doubtless be necessary. Similar considerations will determine whether, in view of the number of such mental patients in a giyen district, all <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>the existing hospitals need he continued or whether some will be unnecessary or unsuitable.</p>

He merely determines whether, now that the state must care for these patients, and now that the power was taken from the districts to do' so, the hospitals and equipment with which the state would perform this service, are, by the legislative standard, necessary and suitable or not. It is in the interest of the hospital service and of the taxpayers throughout the state to have this public service rendered as well as the state can render it and at no greater expense than is necessary.</p>

The established principle is that while the legislature can not delegate its power to make a law “it can make a law to delegate a poAver to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend”: <em>Locke’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/72/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="72 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="434662" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0491-01">72 Pa. 491</a>. The rule is sometimes stated in other words: “The true distinction . . . is between the delegation of power to make the law, which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be, and conferring authority or discretion as to its execution, to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law. The first cannot be done; to the latter, no valid objection can be mad§”: <em>Cincinnati, etc., R. R. v.

Some of the Cases illustrating the application of the principle may be referred to. It was held <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>in <em>O’Heil v. Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/166/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="166 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="864260" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0072-01">166 Pa. 72</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20A.%20943" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="30 A. 943">30 A. 943</a>, that the Act involved was not complete in itself and could only be completed by the Insurance Commissioner to whom that power was delegated. It was not a delegation of power to determine some fact or state of things calling for the enforcement of the Act, but power to complete the Act as the commissioner, in his discretion, might think it should be. It was “An act to provide for a uniform contract or policy of insurance to be made and issued by all insurance companies taking fire risks on property within the state.” It directed the commissioner to prescribe a standard form of policy and forbade the use of any other. The court said: “The effect of our cases is to settle firmly the rule that the law must be complete in all its terms and provisions when it leaves the legislative branch Of the government, and that nothing must be submitted to the judgment of the electors or other appointee of the legislature except an option to become or not to become subject to its requirements and penalties.” Id. at 77. There was no doubt of the power of the legislature to prescribe the form of an insurance policy, but the legislature had not done that. While declaring the need of a standard form and providing punishment for failure to use it, the Act failed to provide the form and delegated the legislative duty of preparing it to the Insurance Commissioner. Mr. Justice Williams said: “By its provisions the legislature says in effect to its appointee, ‘Prepare just such a policy or contract as you please. We do not care to know what it is. The governor shall have no opportunity to veto it. File it in your own office and we will compel its adoption, whether it is right or wrong, by the punishment of every company officer or agent who hesitates to use it.’ ” Id. at 79-80. The General 44-Hour Week Law, 1937, P. L. 2766, contained a provision that “Where the strict application of the schedule of hours provided for by this section, imposes an unnecessary hardship and violates the intent and purpose of this act, the Department of <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>Labor and Industry, with the approval of the Industrial Board, may make, alter, amend and repeal general rules and regulations prescribing variations from said schedule of hours ...” No standard was provided. It was held the delegation was invalid because it gave the appointee an unlimited right to set aside the statute. It was not a power merely to determine some fact or state of things upon which the' law should operate, but a power arbitrarily to dispense with it: <em>Holgate Bros. v.

This appeal was doubtless selected by the learned court for the discussion of this question because of peculiar local conditions which existed in Lackawanna County in the administration of the Poor Law at the time the County Institution District Law of June 24, 1937, P. L. 2017, and two other Acts approved on the same day, 1937, P. L. 2003 and 2051, were put into operation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The case was heard on bill and answer and facts submitted in a brief. We make the following quotation from the opinion <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> filed: “The Bill of complaint avers that prior to the County Institution District law of June 24, 1937, P. L. 2017, there were in Lackawanna County twenty-one independent poor districts, established by various local Acts of Assembly. Of the said twenty-one districts, three had built, established and maintained large and well-equipped institutions for the care of indigents and of mental patients: The Hillside Home and Hospital, of the Scranton Poor District; the Blakely Home, of the Blakely Poor District; and the Ransom Home and Hospital, of the Jenkins-Pittston Poor District. By this law of 1937, the independent Poor Districts were abolished, but the title of the property that had been paid for by the group of citizens and taxpayers who made up each of said Poor Districts was vested in the same group by a transfer thereof to the municipalities that had made up and comprised each respective Poor District, in proportion to the assessed valuation of each of said municipalities. Section 602 of this Act of 1937 provides as follows: *. . . Title to the real and personal property of any . . . [independent poor] district lying <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>in Wo or more municipalities is hereby transferred to and vested in such municipalities in proportion to the last assessed valuations of real estate for county purposes in each of them . . . ’</p>

The Hillside Home and Hospital belonged in part to the City of Scranton and in part to the Borough of Dunmore. The Ransom Home and Hospital belonged in part to the City of Scranton, the Borough of Pittston, later the City of Pittston, and in part to a group of Boroughs.</p>

Only one of the twenty-three Wards of Scranton participated in the ownership of the Ransom Home and Hospital. It would also be co-tenant to the Boroughs of Old Forge, Taylor, Moosic, Avoca and Hughestown, and the Townships of Jenkins and Lackawanna. As to the Hillside Home and Hospital, the ownership is divided between the Borough of Dunmore and a portion of the City of Scranton.

He said that “boroughs and townships are thus treated differently from counties, cities and institution districts. Title to three of said hospitals [as real estate] involved in. the instant case, by virtue of Section 602- of the Act of 1937, P. L. 2017, is vested in whole or impart in boroughs and townships.” The learned judge was of opinion that to accomplish what the Preamble suggested, “it is necessary that all local communities be divested of-the right to operate mental hospitals. This the Act fails to accomplish. Furthermore, no reason exists for taking the property of some local communities and not others ...” He concluded that the “need for remedial legislation is as great in the excluded communities as in the included ...” and therefore held that the statute was within the prohibition.</p>
