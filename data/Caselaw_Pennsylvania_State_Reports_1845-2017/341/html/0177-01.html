Kachura to show cause why certain monies in the possession of the Union Bank and Trust Company of Pottsville in the name of John Patterson and Francis Kachura should not be paid to the executrix after the death of John Patterson.

Kachura and relating to a deposit in that bank in the sum of $3,085.74. On December 1, 1938, decedent executed a will, bequeathing a specific legacy of $300 to Francis J. Kachura, one of the respondents, and the residue to Mrs. Michael Kachura, who was appointed executrix. Testator died two days later.</p>

Both respondents (Francis J. Kachura and the bank) filed answers denying petitioner’s contention and alleging that the balance in the account is the property of Francis J.

Kachura; the interest of decedent, upon his death, passed under the control of the Orphans’ Court and therefore this court has jurisdiction of the subject matter as well as the parties: <em>Mauser et al. v.

There the decedent, the owner of a savings account in a trust company, and the respondent executed together, on the reverse side of the signature card, an agreement, under seal, by which they agreed that any money placed in the bank account should be deemed to belong to them as joint tenants, subject to check by either, and that in case of the death of either, the trust company was to deal with the survivor as sole and absolute owner. The Orphans’ Court of Erie County awarded the balance in the joint account to the surviving joint-tenant. The executrix of the estate of the other joint tenant presented a motion to vacate the order for the reason that the Orphans’ Court did not have jurisdiction of the subject matter involved and therefore had no power to make a decree disposing of the bank account in question. The Orphans’ Court held that it did have jurisdiction to award the fund either to the estate of the one joint tenant or to the other joint tenant, who was the claimant. Upon appeal to the Superior Court, it was held: “The [Orphans’] Court had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and jurisdiction could not be conferred by the initial consent of the parties. ... Its order was unenforceable and a nullity.” The order of the Orphans’ Court was reversed.</p>
