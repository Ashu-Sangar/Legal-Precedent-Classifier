They showed interest and severáb days later appellant and appellant’s alleged common law wife again saw Lagaña and Euggeri, and appellant explained that he had information concerning fine Morrison,1 a retired naval officer, who kept large sums of money in a seciret compartment in a chest of drawers in his rooms in Lenox Apartments and that this man would be an easy victim.</p>

They stopped at'a restaurant near Eitténhóuse Square that afternoon and Mrs. Guida made a telephone call. On leaving the restaurant, Guida advised Euggeri and Lagaña that the job was not ready and that they would have to wait until the next day.' That evening the five registered at a hotel under fictitious names. The three men met in one room and discussed for several hours plans for obtaining the money. Later appellant informed Lagaña and Euggeri that Morrison and one Esther- Smith, who was: a frequenter of his apartment, would be in Morrison’s apartment-and the Smith girl would have Morrison in such condition that they, would not have any trouble in tying him and binding him with some tape. The Smith girl was to allow them to bind her. The.appellant-produced and delivered, to Lagaña, and Euggeri adhesive tape to be used to tape the mouths of Mr. Morrison and Esther Smith. Tape of a similar kind was found in the apartment. ...</p>

All five checked out of the hotel and drove to the apartment house. ■ Lagaña and Euggeri went into the apart, ment house and appellant remained outside as a lookout while the two women remained in the car. Lagaña and Euggeri went to Morrison’s apartment, rang the bell and were met at the door by an elderly lady, Miss Flannery, who was housekeeper for Morrison. Euggeri stepped into the apartment, placed'his hand over Miss Flannery’s mouth and pushed her. before them. They bound her hands and feet, gagged her' mouth, and left her on a bed. They ransacked the premises for money but were unable to find any. They- left the apartment, joined the others, and drove back to Washington.</p>

He promptly notified the police and coroner. The physician who performed the post mortem examination gave the cause of her death as manual strangulation. Tape was found on the floor near the bed. The main threads of the case were shown by the testimony of Lagaña and Euggeri and by a statement made by appellant after his arrest in March, 1940.</p>

We cannot assent either to the conclusion or to all the steps in the argument. We have held again and again that an unintentional homicide in the commission or attempted commission of a felony such as rape, burglary, or robbery was murder at common law: <em>Com. v.

There was thus supplied the state ! of mind called malice which was essential to constitute ‘murder. The malice of the initial offense attaches to ¡whatever else the criminal may do in connection therewith: <em>Com. v. Lessner, </em>supra, p. 112. To show that the killing was murder it was competent to show that it was done in the commission of or attempt to commit a felony. The essential ingredient is either the commission of the felony or the attempt to commit a felony and the criterion is not whether the mere attempt to commit the felony is of itself, as a distinct crime, a felony or a misdemeanor. It is not the successful completion of the robbery by securing the money or property that imperils human life, but the attack that results in death.</p>

We see no reason to revise our <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>former declarations on this subject. We do not mean to assent to the claim of appellant that an attempt to commit robbery was not a felony. In this connection we call attention to the fact that assault with intent to rob was made a felony by § 102 of the Criminal Code of 1860 (18 PS §2891).</p>

L. 382, § 74, as amended; 18 PS § 2221), by implication recognizes that the essential is not the completion of the robbery, rape, etc., but murder may be present in an attempted robbery, rape, etc. It scarcely seems possible that the legislature would have made murder in the course of an <em>attempt </em>to commit robbery murder in the first degree if killing in an <em>attempt </em>to commit robbery was not murder in any degree. It is a recognition by implication of the principle to which we adhere.</p>

The connection of the defendant with the crime was shown by the testimony of the co-defendants and the confession of the defendant made immediately after arrest, corroborated by other circumstances. The defendant took the stand and denied the confession and much of the testimony of his co-defendants, but if there was any doubt as to the safety of receiving the testimony of the other conspirators it was removed by the defendant’s own direct testimony and cross-examination. We do not believe that a reasonable mind could come to any other conclusion than that the defendant was guilty as indicted. Guida provided the tape to be used in quieting the victims.
