The appellant (now married to Eoeco G-iovanetti) was the wife of Pietro Pirolli, who died April 21, 1935, aged 53 years. The attending physician certified the cause of death to be chronic myocarditis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Pirolli’s body was exhumed in 1939 and the autopsy performed on it revealed that the cause of death was arsenical poisoning; the vital organs were found to contain “enormous amounts of arsenic.”</p>

The corpus delicti having been established, the only question was the guilt of the accused. The Commonwealth’s case is logically divided into two parts: (1) the evidence of motive, and (2), alleged incriminatory admissions made by her. The evidence of motive is weak and inconclusive. The defendant and her husband had been married twenty-three years and had lived together on friendly terms. All the insurance policies ever placed on the life of Pirolli, he himself had applied for. He had carried two <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>insurance policies totalling $1010 as early as 1927 but these had lapsed. At the time of his death in 1935 there was a six-year-old policy on his life for $1,000 (and on which $150.00 had been borrowed), and a five-year-old policy for $440. As an employee of Merck and Company he participated in an employee’s group insurance plan which provided for the payment of $1,500.00 on his death. His wife testified that she did not know of the existence of this insurance until after her husband’s death and her testimony on this point is persuasive and uncontradicted. The policy for $440 had been “given” by the defendant with her husband’s consent (so she testified) to Josephine Sadita in January, 1935, when defendant’s husband was ill and the Sadita woman promised to cure him. She testified that her husband said in January: “Let her hold it [the policy] to see if she can cure me.” Defendant testified that her husband “got very well at the time.” This is not contradicted. During that January illness her husband had also the medical attention of two licensed practitioners. As the deceased was earning $20.00 a week just prior to his fatal illness in April, 1935, and as the expenses incident to his burial were $1,147.00, it is clear that the appellant had no reasonable expectations of profit from her husband’s death.</p>
    <p id="b384-4" data-blocks='[["BL_384.4",384,[263,1714,1153,700]],["BL_385.1",385,[147,343,1158,2072]],["BL_386.1",386,[258,344,1154,1463]]]'>The record does show that the poison which killed the deceased was probably administered to him by Josephine Sadita, now a fugitive from justice, and by Rose Carina, who is also indicted for this murder. Josephine appears in this record, in a rather shadowy form, as a worker of some form of “witchcraft.” Defendant testified that her husband (Pirolli) “believed in those things.” It was testified that the $440 policy “had no surrender value” until it had been in force six years (whether six years from its date or from January, 1935, does not appear). It had at the insured’s death a value of $450.50. After the insured’s death in April, the Sadita woman demanded the proceeds of <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>the policy. Defendant testified that she answered her demand by saying: “You ain’t going to get a cent. I told you if you cured my husband, and he is dead.” Mrs. Sadita replied: “Yes, but I gave him the care. Anyhow you have had to pay the doctor and you have to pay me.” Defendant testified that Mrs. Sadita “trailed” her “three or four days” and threatened her and sent “a couple of men” to her home “until finally I had to give it to her.” Defendant offered Mrs. Sadita $40 and the latter said: “I want the whole policy or nothing or you know what you are going to get.” Defendant said: “You might put spells on me.” Mrs. Sadita answered : “I can do worse than that.” Then Mrs. Sadita’s “common law husband” told the defendant that she “had to pay” Mrs. Sadita. Defendant testified: “Finally I took the money and gave it to her. Otherwise I could not come to work any more.” (Defendant was employed at Bayuk Brothers at and before the time of her husband’s death.) Defendant then gave Mrs. Sadita $440. The latter profited to that extent from the death of Pirolli and obviously planned after she received possession of the $440 policy in January to profit by his death. It was she who gave Pirolli “a cup of coffee” on Monday, April 15, 1935, while his wife was at work. After drinking this “coffee” he became violently ill and died six days later. The defendant testified that she left her husband at home that morning and upon her return home she learned about the “cup of coffee.” Vincenzo Pelio, a boarder at the Pirolli home, testified that when he returned from work on Monday evening, April 15, 1935, he noticed that Pirolli did not look well and he said to him: “What has happened to you?” He answered: “I don’t know, Jim, Josephine was over here this morning and we had a cup of coffee together, and since then I got my stomach upset.” The witness said: “Then the wife [Pirolli’s] came from work. She started to set the table. She asked him, ‘Pete, why don’t you eat?’ He says he don’t feel like to eat.” The husband <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>was sick all that night. On Tuesday both husband and wife went to work, at different places. That evening the husband told his wife that he had “been laying down the whole day because I was very, very sick.” At midnight he complained of a stomach-ache. Defendant called “Jimmy,” the boarder, and told him to get a doctor. “Jimmy” called Dr. Boccella unsuccessfully and then called Dr. Aversa, who came and treated him. Pirolli was “worse” on Thursday and Dr. Aversa “gave him an injection to put him to sleep.” On Friday night Pirolli said to defendant: “Grace, I think my life is gone.” The defendant said: “You break my heart. Don’t never talk that way.” Saturday Pirolli wanted the doctor again. The latter came and thought it was “a very bad heart case” and advised on Saturday morning that the patient be sent to a hospital. He said that “quite a few people” were present each time he called. On Saturday night he asked why the patient hadn’t been sent to the hospital and “they said the patient himself was not willing to go.” At 11 p. m. Saturday the doctor said: “This man is going to die, he ain’t got much to live, only about three or four hours more.” Defendant testified she then said in reply to the suggestion about the hospital: “When he has to go to the hospital and die, might as well let him die in my bed. Why should I send him to the hospital to die there. So I would not let him.” Pirolli died at 3:20 a. m. Sunday.</p>
    <p id="b386-4" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[256,1819,1154,589]],["BL_387.1",387,[123,349,1155,757]]]'>Thus far the evidence does not criminally connect the defendant with this homicide. The Commonwealth relies on certain alleged admissions by the accused. Detective Franchetti testified that after the defendant’s arrest in 1939, she told him that on or about the 12th of April, 1935, the defendant “was complaining to Josephine Sadita about her husband and Josephine said to her, H can fix your husband, but it will cost you money’ ” and the defendant answered: “I haven’t got any money, but I have two insurance policies.” Defendant also said: “I will give you [Josephine Sadita] the smaller <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>one of the two policies if you will take care of him.” The agreement was made then that Josephine was to take care of her husband for the smaller policy which amounted to four or five hundred dollars. On Monday, the day after Palm Sunday; Pirolli did not go to work and Josephine was home with him. The Commonwealth attempts to import a sinister significance to the word “complain” as used by the defendant, and the word “fix” as used by Mrs. Sadita, but these words as here used are equally susceptible to interpretations favorable to the defendant. The “complaint” may well have referred to the husband’s condition of health and while “fix” may be used in a sinister sense, its true meaning is “to put to rights.”</p>
    <p id="b387-3" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[125,1117,1154,537]]]'>Captain Kelly, the commanding officer of the Homicide Division, testified that the defendant told him that she and Josephine Sadita were “in conversation” in January, 1935. Mrs. Sadita saw Dr. Boccella in defendant’s home treating her husband and said to defendant: “Why use Dr. Boccella? I can do away with your husband for a certain financial sum.” Defendant answered and said that she did not want to kill her husband at that time, that she wanted him to be better and the conversation ended at that point.</p>
    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.5",387,[125,1666,1156,756]],["BL_388.1",388,[288,360,1157,1299]]]'>Captain Kelly then produced a statement made by the defendant on May 23, 1939, in the presence of certain officers and taken down by the official police stenographer. The statement contains the defendant’s narration (already set forth in this opinion) relative to her husband’s last illness and these additional facts: Bose Carina “was upstairs on Thursday” (April 18, 1935). Pirolli called for his wife. She went to him. He said : “It is time for me to get my medicine.” Mrs. Carina said: “Never mind’ Grace, I give it to him.” Mrs. Carina then gave him the medicine. Mrs. Carina stayed with Pirolli in his room much of the time and when no one else was present. When the question of sending Pirolli to the hospital arose, a few hours before Pirolli’s <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>death, Eose Carina said: “Don’t send him to the hospital,” saying: “What’s the nse, if he is going to die?” When Pirolli died, Eose Carina said: “I will call the undertaker.” She did so. According to defendant’s statements, she had known Eose Carina a couple of weeks before her husband’s death and had known Josephine Sadita eight or nine years. Josephine lived in the defendant’s house “from April or May until November 1936.” According to the <em>statement, </em>Josephine came to the defendant’s house “about three days before Pete got sick” and said: “I will get him to be better.” Defendant replied: “I don’t want nothing to happen to him. Get him better.” “Josephine said she was going to get him better.” In the statement the defendant then narrates the threats Josephine made after Pirolli’s death, in order to induce the defendant to pay her the proceeds of the $440 insurance policy. She declared that Josephine said: “You are going to be sorry as a dog,” and that Josephine and her boy-friend “Joe” said to her: “You will be dead in the street.” Again Josephine came to her and said: “What about the policy?” Defendant said: “You don’t get my husband better.” Finally the defendant gave her the proceeds of the policy. She said: “Both checks amounted to $1,345.00.”</p>

The <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>witness was asked on cross-examination: “Did you ask her if she meant at the time that the husband died or thereafter?” He replied: “I didn’t ask her anything.” The question thus asked of the witness on cross-examination was not well framed to elicit whether defendant’s “knowledge” antedated or postdated her husband’s death. The detective made only a “mental note” of this conversation and he testified about it 68 days afterwards. He said he reported this conversation to his superior officer, but “could not say” whether that was a week or a month later.</p>
    <p id="b389-3" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[164,948,1152,473]]]'>The appellant denied that she ever told Detective Lynch or anyone else that she knew that they “were killing” her husband. She was asked by her own counsel: “When did you first know they were killing your husband?” She answered: “The night that I was an rested” (i. e., May 22, 1939). She denied administering any poison to her husband and denied knowing until after she was arrested that anybody had poisoned her husband.</p>

If the defendant had knowledge beforehand that her husband was being killed and <em>if she aided the Idllers in </em>any way, <em>even to the extent of harboring them in her home for this felonious purpose, </em>she would be as guilty as they. On the other hand, if. the defendant knew or suspected just before her husband died and after all the arsenic had been administered to him that they “were killing him” and did nothing to aid, encourage or countenance them, she would not be guilty. “The mere presence at a homicide and knowledge of its commission, does not make a person guilty unless he aids, assists and abets”: Warren on Homicide, Vol. 1, p. 228, sec. 62 (citing cases). If one is “only a terrified onlooker,” neither his presence at the homicide nor his failure to report it would make him an accomplice: <em>Bird v. U.

If by her understanding of tbe detective’s question and her reply to it, she meant nothing more than that she “knew” after her husband’s death that “they” had killed him, this evidence alone would make the defendant neither an accomplice nor even an accessory after the fact’ for a person who does nothing more than fail to report a murder is neither an accomplice nor an accessory after the fact: <em>Com. v. Mazarella, </em><a href="/pa/279/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="279 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1083530" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0465-01">279 Pa. 465</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.%20163" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="124 A. 163">124 A. 163</a>. Detective Lynch’s testimony should have been submitted to the jury <em>under most careful instructions. </em>On the credit to be given to it and on its interpretation if credited, the fate of this defendant largely depended. If the question was asked as the witness said it was, did the defendant clearly comprehend it? Did the question import to her understanding a knowledge of the killing <em>before </em>the fact or <em>after </em>the fact? “When she was on the stand her own counsel asked (as above noted) a question in the same form (i. e., “knew they were killing”) as Detective Lynch’s question, and her answer shows that she understood the.question as relating to her “knowledge” of the fact of killing <em>after </em>the fact. The trial judge referred briefly to Detective Lynch’s testimony and his reference to it shows that his own recollection of it was not verbally accurate. When witnesses testify to conversations, it is important to know whether they are narrating the exact language used or are merely giving <em>their later impressions </em>of the conversation. The question the detective said he addressed to the defendant was not phrased interrogatively. He said: “You knew they were killing your husband?” The question if <em>fairly </em>put should have been: “Did you know <em>before your husband died </em>that they were killing him?” If she replied “Yes,” he should have asked, <em>When </em>did you first know this? This defendant obviously inept in the use of the English language may have missed the significance of the past perfect tense, in its <em>progressive </em>form; she may have understood the detective with charg<a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>ing her with knowledge of the killing <em>at the time </em>she paid, under alleged duress, Mrs. Sadita the proceeds of the $440 policy. The other phrase attributed to her: “They made me” is also indefinite. What did “they make” her do? Did “they make” her acquiesce in a plot to kill her husband, or did “they” merely “make” her turn over $440? All this was, of course, for the jury, but as to it the jury should have been given instructions which would have aided them in their quest for the truth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> We said in <em>Sears v.

Only a few of them require discussion. The 14th assignment is based upon the court’s refusing defendant’s offer to prove by a witness “that Josephine Sadita was engaged <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>in the business of fortune telling and curing people.” We think that this offer so far as it relates to “curing people” should have been received. The Commonwealth’s contention is that the defendant and Mrs. Sadita were in a conspiracy to poison Pirolli. The fact that the defendant permitted Mrs. Sadita, an unlicensed practitioner, to attend Pirolli during his illnesses would weigh against the defendant unless it could be shown that Mrs. Sadita was in the business of attending sick people. The defendant offered to prove this; she should have been permitted to do so.</p>

What Franchetti testified to was that “she was complaining to Josephine Sadita about her husband.” The complaint might well have referred to the husband’s illness. There is no evidence that the defendant complained about her husband’s treatment of her or had any occasion to do so.</p>

In view of the fact defendant denied knowledge of the existence of this policy before her husband’s death and there was no evidence to the contrary, this request so far as it related to this insurance policy should have been affirmed.</p>

The rule itself is not merely merciful. It is both reasonable and just. There may be cases in which, owing to the peculiar circumstances in which a man is placed, evidence of good character may be all he can offer in answer to a charge of crime. Of what avail is a good character, which a man may have been a lifetime in acquiring, if it is to benefit him nothing in his hour of peril.” In <em>Com. v.

Superior Ct. 136</a>, the lower court, in the trial of a defendant, charged the jury with reference to character testimony as follows: “It is for you to say whether he [defendant] has proven such previous good reputation by the testimony of these witnesses. If he has, if you are satisfied that he had that kind of a reputation before the time of his relations with this girl, then that is a fact that he is entitled to have considered by you, and it is for you to say whether that in itself operates to create a reasonable doubt, if you find that he had such reputation.” In a subsequent part of the charge the evidence of good character is referred to as “a fact to be taken into consideration and weighed in the scales in his favor, and as viewed by you to see whether in itself it operates to create a reasonable doubt.” The Superior Court re<a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>versed the court below, saying: “It is not the only office of evidence of good character to create a reasonable doubt. It has frequently been said that it is substantive evidence to be weighed and considered in connection with all the other evidence in the case. ‘The evidence of good character is to be considered with the other evidence in the case and if it all combined creates a reasonable doubt the defendant is to be acquitted’: <em>Com. v.

A hypothesis is a statement of fact or of theory which, without itself having been proved, is taken for granted as a premise from which to test or discover an assured conclusion, a logical supposition; more widely, a supposition of an imaginary state of things assumed as a basis of reasoning.” This language scarcely meets the test laid down by this court in <em>Com. v.

Nothing in her conduct during her husband’s illness indicated consciousness of guilt. She immediately directed the boarder to “call a doctor.” She specified no doctor and the boarder secured the services of the first doctor he found available, Dr. Aversa. The latter was afforded full opportunity to diagnose the patient’s symptoms. That he failed to diagnose this case of arsenical poisoning was due to nothing said or done by this defendant. While the defendant did not accept Dr. Aversa’s advice given seventeen hours before Pirolli’s death to send him to a hospital, a verdict of guilty of murder cannot be predicated on that fact. The defendant may well have believed that sending her husband to the hospital at that late stage in his illness would accomplish nothing.

Vincenzo, as already pointed out, testified that Pirolli was sick when his wife reached home Monday night and Pirolli told about the cup of coffee he and Josephine had had “together this morning” and since then his “stomach was upset.” The witness did say that the defendant after inquiring why Pirolli did not eat, “forced him to eat” and Pirolli “got a couple of spoons of supper and he quit.” The court then asked: <em>“Who </em>made the supper that night?” and the witness replied: “The husband made the supper and I helped him. I learned to cook.” The defendant’s “forcing” her husband to eat a little of the supper he and his boarder <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>prepared when she was at work cannot justly be given any criminal significance.

But how do we get to believe in the fact of a confession having been made? Always and necessarily by somebody’s testimony. And what is our experience of that sort of testimony on which we are asked to believe that a confession was made? A varying and sometimes discouraging experience. Paid informers, treacherous associates, angry victims, and over-zealous officers of the law, — these are the persons through whom an alleged confession is oftenest presented; and it is at this stage that our suspicions are aroused and our caution stimulated. Suppose a judge <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>is offered from the lips of a single witness a detailed and complete avowal of guilt, attributed to the accused, and suppose the accused denies absolutely the fact of confession; suppose the judge now to think of himself, ‘Here is a confession which, if authentic, would make this man’s guilt clear beyond doubt. But do you expect us to take it as authentic, against his denial, on the word of this man alone, who has such and such strong motives for inventing it or for misinterpreting what was said? Must we not listen to him with the greatest doubt and suspicion? Then, would it not be natural for the judge, in commenting on such evidence to the jury, to say: ‘What you have heard here from this man about a supposed confession is to be taken with caution; for that is the weakest and most suspicious kind of evidence.’ This is a natural and proper attitude, and it is precisely that of the authorities above quoted. They were thinking, not of the <em>confession as evidence </em>of the act, but of the <em>testimony to the alleged confession. </em>Take, for instance, the phrase above of Mr. Justice Foster’s [Sir Michael Foster] which has been quoted again and again [with and without acknowledgment] in the records of the profession for a century and a half, in the mangled and misleading form that ‘confessions are the weakest and most suspicious of all evidence.’ Why did he so regard them? Not because of their own evidential weakness; but for the following reasons: ‘Proof may be too easily procured; <em>words are often </em>mis-reported— whether through ignorance, inattention, or malice, it mattereth not to the defendant, he is equally affected in either case; <em>and they are extremely liable to mis</em>construction... In other words, the suspicion that he has found it necessary to entertain is directed entirely to the work of <em>proving an alleged confession </em>[italics supplied]. . . . We are inclined to hesitate and demand the most satisfactory testimony before we accept that as a fact which, if believed, will practically render other evidence superfluous.”</p>

According to John Fiske, the historian, “Kebecca Nurse had just been acquitted of witchcraft. The judge then told the jury that ‘they must have overlooked the fact, — that in an unguarded moment, the prisoner had really confessed her guilt.’ It seems that one of the prisoners, Deliverance Hobbs, had gone clean daft with fright, confessed herself a witch, and joined the accusing girls as a sort of king’s evidence. When she was brought in to testify against Kebecca Nurse, the old lady exclaimed: ‘What! do you bring <em>her? </em>She is one of us!’ Of course, she meant <em>one of us </em>prisoners, but the atrabilious chief justice was sure she meant <em>one. of us </em>witches, and he insisted that the jury should go out again. They were not convinced, but presently returning to the court room asked the accused to explain what she meant. She made no reply, and the jury at' length reluctantly accepted this silence as a confession of guilt. Afterwards she explained that being somewhat ‘hard of hearing and full of grief,’ she did not realize what was asked of her. She was sentenced none the less and taken to the gallows.” (Witchcraft in Salem Village by John Fiske, pp. 39 and 40).</p>
