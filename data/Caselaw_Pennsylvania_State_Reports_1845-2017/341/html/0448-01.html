P. Datt in a northerly direction on the eastern side of Main Street, within the intersection of Franklin and Main Streets, on Sunday morning, January 7,1940. The two actions, one by Gasperoni’s administratrix, Mary Gasperoni, against Datt, and the other by Datt against Mary Gasperoni, administratrix, were tried together before the court below and a jury, resulting in a verdict in the sum of $6000 for the plaintiff in the former and a verdict for the defendant in the latter. Datt filed a motion for judgment n. o. v. in the action against him and moved for a new trial in each case, all of which motions were refused and judgments were entered in accordance with the verdicts. These appeals followed.</p>

A traffic light suspended above the intersection was not in operation on the morning of the accident and neither of the streets in question was a “stop” street. Under these circumstances, the jury was fully justified in finding that Datt, being “the driver on the left”, was clearly negligent in failing to yield the right of way to Gasperoni, as provided by section 1013 of the Act of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, as amended by the Act of June 29, 1937, P. L. 2329, section 3, and that Gasperoni was warranted in assuming that he would do so and in acting accordingly; hence, the court below committed no <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>error in refusing the motion for judgment n. o. v.: <em>Hostetler v.
