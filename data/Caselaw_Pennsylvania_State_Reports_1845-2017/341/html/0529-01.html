Scull, Anna B. Scull and Robert S. Scull entered into an agreement whereby they rented, or conditionally sold, to Henry B. Reiley, defendant, the plant of the <em>Somerset Herald, </em>a weekly newspaper of general circulation, and the job printing business conducted in connection therewith, at a total rental or consideration of $30,000, of which $5,000 was paid upon <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>execution of the contract, and the balance agreed to be paid in annual instalments during the period of four years. On January 12, 1933, defendant being in default as to all instalments, with the exception of the initial payment of $5,000, the parties entered into a new contract, substantially in the same form as that of the original agreement, but superseding and in substitution therefor, whereby the property was relet, or conditionally resold, to defendant for the sum of $25,000, payable in annual instalments during the period of three years, and interest on the sum of $25,000 from May 23, 1929. On June 17, 1936, George E. Scull and Anna B. Scull having died and defendant having defaulted in the payment of all instalments and interest provided for in the second agreement, a third contract was executed by Eobert S. Scull and the representatives of George E. Scull and the heirs of Anna B. Scull. This latter agreement, being also intended as a novation for the prior contracts, provided for the reletting, or conditional reselling, of the property to defendant for the sum of $25,000, playable in instalments during a further period of three years from the date of this latter contract, as follows: the amount of $7,500 each for the first and second years, payable $625 per month, and $10,000 for the third year, payable $750 per month for the first ten months and $1,250 per month for the remainder of that year, and interest payable presently at the rate of 5% on the sum of $25,000 from May 23, 1929, the date of the original contract. This agreement, as well as the prior ones, contained, inter alia, a provision that title to the property was to remain in the lessors, or sellers, until the entire amount of the rental, or purchase price, and the additional sum of $1, was paid, at which time they agreed to execute and deliver to defendant a bill of sale for the property; and also provided that in case of default, the lessors, or sellers, had the right to repossess the property and to recover damages for any injury to it, together with any expenses <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>incurred by them in recovering possession, as well as the “rental”, which, under the express terms of the agreement, includes the interest on the sum of $25,000, to the time of repossession.

The defendant did not redeem the property and it was sold at public sale for the sum of $10 to the highest bidder, the Somerset Trust Company, for the use of all plaintiffs. Thereafter the plaintiffs filed a statement of claim and defendant, without answering the averments thereof, filed an affidavit of defense raising questions of law. The learned court below sustained the questions so raised, on the ground that the statement of claim showed upon its face that the plaintiffs by repossessing the property availed themselves of an alternative remedy provided by the agreement, whereupon all rights of action thereunder determined as of the date of the exercise of such right. With this interpretation of the contract of June 17, 1936, we cannot concur.</p>

Under this clause of the contract, by which the rights of the parties are fixed and which is the law as to them, it is obvious that they have expressed, in as clear language as could be used, that the remedies in case of default were to be cumulative, and therefore, although plaintiffs have repossessed the property, they are still entitled to collect the “rental” due to the time of repossession, i. e., the two monthly instalments of $625 each, and the interest, on the sum of $25,000 at five per centum per annum from May 23, 1929, to June 17, 1936, the date of execution of the third contract, as well as interest on the two monthly instalments from the time each became due and payable to the date of retaking of the property.</p>

Therefore, when, by paragraph 5 of the contract they provided that in case of default “Sellers shall have the right to collect <em>rental </em>... up to the time of repossessing . . . of the property” (Italics added), they clearly and definitely expressed an intention for the collection of both sums which were due at the time of retaking; that is the interest on the sum of $25,000 from May 23, 1929, and for the two monthly instalments of $625 each.</p>

      <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>In the agreement between the parties dated June 17, 1936, as set forth in plaintiffs’ statement of claim, it is provided, inter alia: “That the Sellers have . . . let unto the Buyer, the newspaper plant and job printing business formerly conducted by the Sellers, in the Borough of Somerset, ... all of which are particularly enumerated in the schedule hereto annexed and made a part hereof . . . for the term of three years from the date hereof, at the rent of $7,500 for the first and second years, payable $625.00 per month in advance for the first ten months of said year, and $1,250.00 per month for two months of said year; together with interest at the rate of five (5) per cent, per annum from May 23,1929.” In other words, the interest <em>has exactly the same status </em>under this contract as the purchase price of $25,000.00 and no more. The majority opinion holds that the <em>principal </em>sum of $25,000.00 provided for in the agreement <em>cannot </em>be collected by the sellers. With this I agree and I submit that neither can the <em>interest </em>be collected.</p>

As paragraph five, which, as the majority opinion states, “is the law as to” the parties, is completely silent as to any interest payments, I find no warrant for the holding that the sellers can collect interest on the principal which, it is conceded, cannot be collected. The sellers having <em>repossessed </em>the property and determined the agreement, their rights are those given them in paragraph five, which paragraph in unequivocal language declares that “upon any determination of this agreement, the Sellers shall have the right [1] to collect rental, at the rate hereinbefore agreed upon, up to the time of repossessing themselves of the property and [2] to recover damages for any injury which may have been done to it, and [3] as well as for any expenses or costs incurred by them in recover<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>ing possession thereof.” No other items whatsoever are mentioned in paragraph five. Since no other items than <em>“rental”, “damages” </em>and <em>“expenses” </em>are mentioned in that paragraph, the sellers can claim no rights as to other items. This is so obvious that it is not necessary to invoke the maxim “expressio unius est exclusio alterius”, but this is a case where the maxim clearly applies. This court has frequently recognized this maxim’s logical value. In <em>Catawissa R. R. Co. v. P. &amp; R.

Upon appeal to this Court it was held, in an opinion by Justice Simpson : “Where, as here, the agreement provides the lessors ‘might repossess themselves of [the machinery] ... as though these presents had never been made,’ the only possible conclusion is that ‘if the agreement “had never been made,” the note would not have been given; when the agreement is rescinded, with like effect as if it “had never been made,” the note fell with it for want of consideration.’ . . .

Schlimme, </em><a href="/pa/220/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="220 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="1005921" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0413-01">220 Pa. 413</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.%20867" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="69 A. 867">69 A. 867</a>, was an action upon thirteen promissory notes given as evidence of monthly instalments of payments due for two steam road rollers sold on a “lease contract.” These notes were to draw interest at 6%. The lease gave the lessor the right to repossess the rollers in case of default in payment of the notes, etc. If payments were duly made the lessee could secure a bill of sale for the machines for one dollar each. Claiming default the plaintiff repossessed the rollers and <em>also sued for the principal and interest </em>on the notes. It was held that plaintiff could <em>not </em>maintain this latter action. This Court said: “The failure to make payments as they became due was a breach of the contract and the plaintiff had the right to rescind ‘and take possession of, and remove same without trespass.’ . . . The plaintiff’s assertion of its right to rescind by repossessing itself of the machines was the end of its alternative' right to enforce the agreement by compelling payment of the consideration money.”</p>

    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[268,518,1153,1503]]]'>In the instant case the remedies of the seller were cumulative only <em>to a limited extent. </em>What those limits are is stated in clear language. The word “rental” in the last sentence in paragraph 5 of the agreement of June 17, 1936, clearly does <em>not </em>include interest on $25,000.00, which sum is named in paragraph one of the agreement as the <em>value </em>of “the newspaper plant, equipment, etc.” In other words, $25,000 was the purchase price of the plant, etc., and any interest due was interest on that purchase price. <em>Rent </em>as used in paragraph five is quite a different thing than interest on the purchase price or on any instalment of the purchase price. In the very beginning of paragraph five the word “rent” and the word “interest” appear with the disjunctive “or” between them. Upon the failure to pay “rent or interest” or insurance premiums or upon certain other breaches of the lease, “the tenancy shall forthwith cease and determine, at the option of the sellers, and it shall be lawful for them to retake and repossess themselves of said property as though the same had never been rented.” Immediately thereafter the cumulative clause sets forth that “upon the determination of this agreement” the sellers shall have the right “to collect rental up to the time of repossessing themselves of the property”, but <em>no right is given to collect interest, </em>and, as above pointed out, the parties in their own contract treat “rent” and “interest” as two things utterly distinct.</p>
