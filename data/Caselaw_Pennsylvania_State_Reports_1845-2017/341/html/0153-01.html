Milk Control Commission, </em><a href="/pa/332/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="332 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="1186581" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0015-01">332 Pa. 15</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20A.2d%20775" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 A.2d 775">1 A. 2d 775</a>. The question now raised is in regard to" the legality of the <em>discretionary </em>power vested in the Commission to regulate the prices of milk used in manufacturing. The reason why the exercise of that power was made discretionary instead of mandatory becomes evident from even a cursory study of the manner in which the milk industry is conducted. Milk to be used for drinking can travel, because of its ephemeral life, only within a restricted area, but manufactured milk products, owing to their less perishable nature, can be, and are, imported into Pennsylvania from other states where milk is sold at a lower cost than that at which it can be produced here. The result is that the prices of milk absorbed into manufacturing processes must face the competition of low-cost production areas which may be located far away, and, because of the necessity of meeting such competitive conditions, it is practically impossible to establish a price of milk used in manufacturing that would pay the cost of production in Pennsylvania. The majority of dealers use milk both for resale in fluid form and for manufacturing, and, under the so-called “utilization” system which is commonly employed, the total price received by the producer for milk delivered to the dealer is determined at periodic <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>intervals when the latter reports the different uses to which the milk has been devoted; a “blended” price is thus obtained, made up in part of the higher price of the milk resold as fluid and in part of the lower prices of that used in the manufacture of various dairy products. The main purpose of the Milk Control Law being to insure a sufficient supply of wholesome milk, which cannot be accomplished unless, as the preamble of the act recites, “the high cost of maintaining sanitary conditions of production and standards of purity is returned to the producers of milk,” it is obvious that, under ordinary conditions, the proper minimum price that producers should receive will depend not only upon the amount obtained for fluid milk used directly for human consumption but also upon the portion of the blended price derived from the lower rate for the milk used in manufacturing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> If the Commission were not given the power to fix minimum prices of milk for manufacturing purposes, there would be a tendency for the prices of such milk to be so depressed by the competition which characterizes the sale of the manufactured products that the total price received by the producers might fall to a point where they would not be able to furnish the pure milk necessary for the maintenance of public health and which it is the object of the Milk Control Law to secure. On the other hand, it would not always be necessary for the Commission to exercise that power. Circumstances and conditions in particular areas might conceivably be such that, at times, the prices of milk for manufacturing would exert no substantial influence upon the market as a whole, and consequently the Commission might find that the fixing of minimum <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>prices for milk so used would not be needed to fulfill the major purpose of the Milk Control Law. There might occasionally be places where all the milk produced would be marketed only for resale in fluid form, or where certain types of milk would be used for making products the prices of which would have no effect upon the price of milk generally. Then again, notwithstanding the play of competitive forces, the market prices of the milk used for manufacturing might not become so drastically lowered as to interfere to any great degree with the total or blended price received by the producers, in which case no regulatory action on the part of the Commission would be required. For such and, no doubt, other reasons, the legislature, appreciating the fact that the situation demanded a flexible control, deemed it wise to leave to the Commission the duty of investigating conditions to ascertain whether, and to what extent, the prices of milk for manufacturing purposes affected, in any given area, those prevailing in the milk market as a whole, and, in accordance with the findings made, to exercise, or to refrain from exercising, the power to fix the prices of such milk in order to accomplish the object for which the Milk Control Law was designed.</p>
    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[274,1662,1152,809]]]'>It is not a novelty in legislation for power to be given to a body other than the legislature itself to determine facts upon which should depend whether, and when, a law was to become effective, or for authority to be granted to such a body to act, or to withhold action, depending upon a factual ascertainment of conditions, in order to carry out the legislative intent in conformity with the principles laid down in the law itself.

There are many analogies to this in our system of laws.” A quotation from <em>Tranter v. Allegheny County Authority, </em><a href="/pa/316/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="316 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1158989" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0065-01">316 Pa. 65</a>, 76, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20289" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="173 A. 289">173 A. 289</a>, 294, is also in point: “It is first said that the statute violates Article II, section 1, vesting legislative power in the General Assembly; that, by empowering the county commissioners to take the steps necessary to obtain the charter for Allegheny County Authority, legislative power was delegated. The legislature has made the law permitting organization of the corporation in certain circumstances. No power to make the law was delegated to the county commissioners; all that remained for them to do was to find a fact from which they should determine whether to act or not, i. e., whether it was desirable to take advantage of the law in accord with its provisions. If they decided in the affirmative, it was then necessary to comply with the statute to bring the corporation into existence.”</p>

In <em>Hampton &amp; Co. v. United </em>States, <a href="/us/276/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="276 U.S. 394" data-case-ids="3901603" data-case-paths="/us/276/0394-01">276 U.

The court pointed out that all that was thereby conferred upon the President was a discretion as to the execution of the law to be exercised under and in pursuance of its terms, and that (p. 407) “Congress may feel itself unable conveniently to determine exactly when its exercise of the legislative power should become effective, because dependent on future conditions, and it may leave the determination of such time to the decision of an Executive, or, as often happens in matters of state legislation, it may be left to a popular vote of the residents of a district to be affected by the legislation.” In <em>United States v.

While, however, it is true that the Commission cannot fix the prices of the manufactured products, it can, and presumably does, take the currently prevailing market prices of such products into consideration in determining whether the dealer will receive a reasonable return under the prices fixed by the Commission for the milk purchased by him. In order to produce a desired mathematical result it is not necessary to have control of more than one variable factor in the process by which the result is produced.

Whether or not one part of a statute can survive the excision of another part which has been held invalid is a question of statutory construction, and in determining it the court searches for the intention of the legislature.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In the present instance the legislature has <em>expressed </em>its intention, because section 1201 of the act states: “It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that if this act cannot take effect in its entirety because of the decision of any court holding unconstitutional any part, <em>sentence or clause </em>hereof, the remaining provisions of the act shall be given full force and effect as completely as if the part held unconstitutional had not been included herein. It is hereby declared as the intent of the Legislature that every other part, <em>sentence or clause </em>of this act would have been enacted had such unconstitutional provision not been included herein.” (Italics supplied.)
