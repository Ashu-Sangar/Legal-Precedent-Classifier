    <p id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[126,389,1154,1796]]]'>This is an appeal from the dismissal by the Orphans’ Court of Fayette County of a petition for an issue devisavit vel non. Newell Armstrong Porter, Sr., died on October 9, 1940, aged 84 years, leaving a personal estate of $145,979.60 and real estate valued at $11,000. His only heirs at law were a brother, C. R. Porter, a niece, Mary Porter Wyatt, and six children of Mary Louise Stewart, a deceased sister. Decedent’s wife died in 1913 and they had no children. In October, 1940, Linn V. Phillips, Esq., counsel for Earl Huston, presented for probate to the Register of Wills of Fayette County a paper purported to be the will of decedent. Huston was a beneficiary named in the challenged will and was therein named executor. The paper consisted of three typewritten pages, the first two of which are each signed at the bottom on a typewritten line the name of Newell Armstrong Porter, Sr. The third page being about one-half filled with testamentary provisions is signed after the clause appointing Earl Huston the executor. It is followed by the testimonium clause, and it is again signed on a typewritten line “Newell Armstrong Porter, Sr.” John W. Rankin and George C. Steele were subscribing witnesses to this will. It gives nothing to the heirs at law and bequeaths $35,000, free of all taxes, to the executor, Earl Huston, and cancels his indebtedness amounting to $5,000 and bequeaths to Mrs. Verna McCrory, testator’s housekeeper, $50,000.00, free of all taxes, and numerous articles of personal property. The real estate and residuary estate is devised and bequeathed to P. R. Luce, son-in-law to Mrs. Mc-Crory. The will bears a typewritten date of July 17, 1937. Attorney Phillips testified that the will was prepared by him about ten days prior to its date.</p>

R. Luce, beneficiaries thereunder, and others. Said paper writing is not the last will and testament of Newell Armstrong Porter, Sr., deceased.” Contestants mean by this last assertion that Porter’s alleged signatures on the “paper writing” are forgeries.</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[291,611,1145,206]]]'>A hearing was held by the register on November 7, 1940. The will was probated without taking contestants’ testimony. Probate was revoked and the record certified to the Orphans’ Court.</p>
    <p id="b514-6" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[286,829,1150,1297]]]'>At the trial a transcript of the testimony of the subscribing witnesses before the register was received in evidence, pursuant to the respective counsels’ agreement. John W. Rankin, one of the subscribing witnesses, testified that he was then, and for nine years had been, a County Commissioner of Payette County and that he knew Newell Armstrong Porter, Sr., “very well”. He testified that Mr. Porter signed the will and then he at Porter’s request signed it “after him.” Rankin identified his own signature to the paper. All this signing was done in the presence of George Steele, the other subscribing witness, in the conference room of the commissioners’ office. He said that Porter “had the paper with him when he came to my office but I did not see what it was.” No one else was present when the paper was thus executed and witnessed. He identified the two signatures on page 3 as the two names he saw the decedent write. He does not remember whether he saw Porter sign pages 1 and 2. The other subscribing witness, George Steel, gave testimony substantially like that of Mr. Rankin and differing only in inconsequential details. He identified his own signature and that of the decedent. He said that he had known Mr. Porter for 50 years.</p>

Contestants also presented evidence which they argued supported the charge of undue influence.</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[143,782,1151,1524]]]'>As the court below pointed out, there is no evidence of testator’s testamentary incapacity and “a substantial part” of the testimony in support of the charge of undue influence in making the will consists of the testimony of the three principal beneficiaries of the will, Mrs. McCrory, P. R. Luce, and Earl Huston, who were all called “as if under cross-examination.” The contestants showed friendly and even intimate relations between the three chief beneficiaries of the will and Mr. Porter, but while such relations may provide opportunities for undue influence they do not prove its exercise. Porter lived in close domiciliary association with Mr. and Mrs. McCrory for many years before Mr. McCrory’s death in 1933. For a long time they lived in the same apartment, which belonged to Porter. For 22 years Mrs. McCrory furnished Porter with all his meals. Porter charged no rental for the apartment and he paid nothing directly for his meals. Mrs. McCrory married a man named Sturgis on July 3, 1937, but continued to be called by Porter and many others as Mrs. McCrory. She was divorced from Sturgis on November 10, 1939. Porter made from time to time gifts to Mrs. McCrory, some of these gifts being checks for $100.00. In October 1936 Porter contributed $600.00 to the purchase of a Plymouth car for her and in 1939 he contributed $1,600.00 to the purchase of a Packard car for her. He also gave her diamond jewelry and a $1,000 postal savings bond.</p>

He frequently consulted Huston (who later became chief clerk in the county commissioners’ office) about his (Porter’s) business affairs and loaned money to Huston. The latter prepared Porter’s personal property tax returns and was co-administrator with him in the settlement of the estate of Porter’s sister. Porter promised to take care of him in his will and gave him instructions as to his funeral and place of burial.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[269,782,1149,579]]]'>P. R. Luce, another beneficiary of the will, married Mrs. McCrory’s daughter in 1920. He worked for Porter for 20 years irregularly on Porter’s farm and after 1937 he worked regularly on the farm for $100.00 a month, giving up all other employment. The court below regarded the will in question as a “natural one” for Porter to make. The court found that Porter had not been on friendly terms with his brother and that there was “no close association between him and his nieces, all of whom were born and have always resided in the middle west.”</p>
    <p id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[267,1382,1144,263]]]'>The court below correctly held that the contestants had failed to establish the charge of “undue influence” used on the testator in making his will, as this court has defined that phrase in <em>Phillips’ Est., </em><a href="/pa/244/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="244 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1003479" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0035-01">244 Pa. 35</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20A.%20457" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="90 A. 457">90 A. 457</a>, and in many other cases.</p>

They claimed that the signatures on the testamentary paper were made by tracing. They described the technique employed as the “use of a light under a genuine signature, one sheet at a time being placed over some genuine signature and the outline made.” The second expert witness testified that “there is an unusual similarity between the four signatures on the reputed will.” He added: “We have here the signature of a man who is reputed to be over eighty years of age at the time this signature was made. In each signa<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>ture the characteristics are carried out to almost exactly from a fractional point of an inch and each measurement bearing the exact measurement in — for example, the first letter is capital N.” He also said that the signatures showed “a sense of uniformity of writing, showed definite signs of premeditation, extensive planning and scheming and not the result of a mere chance. . . . Now I will take the last word ‘Porter, Sr.’ We find again the capital P exactly the same size, o-r, space t, then the e-r and the Sr. All the .Sr.’s are crowded in almost exactly the same measurements.”</p>
    <p id="b517-4" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[144,962,1152,1360]]]'>As against the opinion of the two expert witnesses that the signatures to the will are forgeries, we have the testimony of the two apparently disinterested subscribing witnesses, who say they saw the testator sign his name. Their testimony was neither contradicted nor discredited except by implication in the testimony of the handwriting experts. There was also the testimony of eight laymen who said they were familiar with the testator’s handwriting and that the signatures in question were genuine. An examination of the four questioned signatures shows that they are remarkably similar in size and form though they are not “identical with each other and with a genuine signature of Porter” (contestants’ exhibit No. 11), as appellants assert in their paper book. For example, the letters “r” in the last half of the name “Armstrong” are not alike in the four signatures. The loop of the letter “A” in “Armstrong” in the last signature differs from the corresponding loop elsewhere in the signatures. There is also a slight difference in the lengths of the four signatures. In <em>Com. v. Snyder et </em>al., <a href="/pa-super/123/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="123 Pa.

Contestants assert that the evidence of forgery is more than the mere opinion of the witnesses; that it is a mathematical demonstration that the general formation of the letters, the height, the slant, the spacing, and in short, everything about them, is so nearly identical in all four signatures that they could not be genuine: <em>Com. v.
