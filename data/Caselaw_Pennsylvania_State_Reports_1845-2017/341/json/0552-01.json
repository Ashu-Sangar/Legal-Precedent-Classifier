        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Schaffer,\nThis is an action of assumpsit to recover damages for breach of a contract of employment, which plaintiff avers was for a year. He was discharged during the fifth month of his service.\nThe contract was confirmed by a letter from defendant to plaintiff and accepted in writing by the latter. It appears in the notes of the Reporter. The court below sustained an affidavit of defense raising questions of law and entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appeals.\nThe position assumed by appellant is that the letter is not the entire contract between the parties and, therefore, he should be permitted to show that, by a prior oral agreement, he was to be employed for a year or longer.\nThe contract says nothing about a yearly employment. It provides that plaintiff is to receive a salary of $75 weekly. It speaks of the termination of the employment \u201cat any time\u201d, of the bonus payment to be made \u201cup to the date of the termination of the employment\u201d and fixes as the measure for its amount the increase of sales \u201cfor the same period over the preceding year\u201d, not for the entire year, which it necessarily would be, if the contract covered a hiring for that period. This being the situation, plaintiff cannot import into the written contract by parol something absolutely contrary to its terms, an employment for a year. This would be to render the writings nugatory. Under all our decisions since Gianni v. Russell & Co., Inc., 281 Pa. 320, 126 A. 791, the last of which is Penna. Co. v. Lebanon B. & L. Assn., 337 Pa. 316, 10 A. 2d 418, parol evidence is inadmissible to change the terms of the written contract. See also 9 Wigmore on Evidence Sec. 2430.\nSo far as the claim for bonus is concerned, we call attention to the fact that suit was brought on June 27, 1940, whereas the bonus was not payable until \u201con or about January 15, 1941.\u201d As to the bonus, the suit was premature. A claim for it can be asserted in another action, if such claim exists.\nThe judgment is affirmed without prejudice to the right to bring an action for the bonus.",
