        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe facts are stated in the opinion of the Superior Court from which these appeals come: 139 Pa. Superior Ct. 553, 12 A. 2d 816.\nAppellant complains that its motions for binding instructions and judgment n. o. v. were refused; the charge is not complained of. In the argument in this Court appellant contends that the Superior Court \u201capplied the test of extraordinary care, required of companies maintaining wires carrying a dangerous current, to a telegraph company whose wires do not carry such current and to whom the logic of the rule relating to carriers of dangerous currents is inapplicable.\u201d We do not so understand the decision. The principle applied was simply that \u201cthe care to be exercised . . . should be commensurate with the peril inherent in the situation.\u201d Whether that measure of care was exercised may vary with the circumstances.\nThere was sufficient evidence to be submitted to the jury of constructive notice that the wire sagged over the public road in such way as to interfere with lawful highway travel; failure to remove it was a breach of duty to such travelers.\nThe judgments are affirmed.",
