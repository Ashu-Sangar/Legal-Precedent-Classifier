        "text": "Chief Justice Agnew\ndelivered the opinion of the court, June 26th 1877.\nIt was not quite accurate to say, as the learned judge below did, that the trust in Mi\u2019s. Fry\u2019s deed might have perished, if it had been determined under Ogden\u2019s Appeal. Ogden\u2019s Appeal has not been impaired by the subsequent cases: Earp\u2019s Appeal, 25 P. F. Smith 119; Ashhurst\u2019s Appeal, 27 Id. 464; Ash\u2019s Appeal, 30 Id. 497, and some others, are plainly distinguishable from both Yarnall\u2019s and Ogden\u2019s Appeals, 20 P. F. Smith 501. The grounds are broad and clearly visible, and were stated in Earp\u2019s Appeal, which the other cases mentioned followed. This distinction has been re-stated in the recent case of Williams\u2019s Appeal, 2 Norris 377. In that case there were two instruments creating several trusts of a very different character, but which the auditor and the court below confounded, one of which was governed by Ogden\u2019s Appeal and similar cases, and the other by Earp\u2019s Appeal and its sequents, and so we held.\nMrs. Fry\u2019s deed is plainly governed by the principles stated in Earp\u2019s Appeal and is quite as easily distinguished from Ogden\u2019s Appeal. The trust created by her was, \u201cto pay over the net rents, issues and profits, interest and income thereof for and during the lifetime of the said Emily L. Fry,\u201d to her appointee or herself,\u201cwhether sole or covert,\u201d and \u201cin case of such coverture for her separate use.\u201d Then follows a proviso which gives character to the trust for her life, and show's that it was intended for her protection without regard to coverture, \u201c provided that such rents, issues and profits, interest and income, shall -not be liable to her debts, contracts or engagements, or the debts, contracts or engagements of her present or any future husband.\u201d Thus she clearly indicated her intention to protect herself against her own acts as well as those of any husband, present or future. A trust for coverture only, falls at the death of the first husband, but this she intended to be carried over to any future husband, and in connection with the provision against her own debts she discovers a plain intention to make the trust for life and not for coverture merely:\nMrs. Fry\u2019s trust for her own life is very similar to that in Ash\u2019s Appeal, in which the same expressions occur, to wit: \u201cwhether sole or covert.\u201d Her trust not being for coverture merely, and being equitable and of the income only and for life, was active, and did not fall with the divorce, and therefore could not coalesce with the remainder for her heirs, which was legal. The exclusion of the husband from the descent or succession, in the language defining the persons to take under the intestate law, was therefore an immaterial circumstance, as the rule in Shelly\u2019s case would not operate under any circumstances. The language used in Earp\u2019s Appeal, distinguishing it from Yarnall and Ogden\u2019s Appeals, is quite as applicable to this case.\nMrs. Fry\u2019s will, made long before she declared this trust, and not republished, cannot operate as an appointment under her deed. There are some plausible considerations which might be argued to make the will an appointment under the deed of trust, but upon a careful review of the entire subject we think the intention to execute this posterior power cannot be fairly inferred from the antecedent will, without a republication. This subject was discussed in Bingham\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 849.\nThe decree of the Common Pleas is affirmed, with costs to be paid by the appellants, and the appeal is dismissed.",

J., Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson, Woodward and Sterrett, JJ.\nCertiorari to the Court of Common Pleas, No. 3, of Philadelphia county: Of January Term 1877, No. 126.\nAppeal of O. B. Dunn and George Biddle, executors under the will of Emily L. Fry, deceased, from the decree of the court confirming the report of the auditor to whom was referred the account of the Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives, trustees under a deed of trust executed by Mrs. Fry and her husband.\nEmily L. Fry, deceased, was- the daughter of John Grigg, also deceased. She was born in the month of August 1840. \u25a0 In August 1858 she was married to Horace B. Fry, and had two children, Nannie McClellan Fry and Reginald Fry, both of whom are still living. Mrs. Fry went to Europe in 1865, and remained until 1874, when she returned to New York, remained there two weeks, and went back to Europe. She came back to this country in May 1875, and died in New York on the 23d of October 1875.\nWhile residing in Paris, Mrs. Fry, who was possessed of an estate of nearly $300,000, made and published her last will and testament. The will is dated the 18th of June 1869. Mrs. Fry, on the 23d of October, executed a codicil to the will. In this will the first clause was : \u201c In pursuance of all laws, authorities and powers enabling me to make a last will or appointment in the nature thereof.\u201d She then, after reserving some personal effects, gives, devises and bequeaths her entire estate to her executors in trust for the benefit of her children and their issue, and in case of the death of both of her children before attaining the age of twenty-one years, without leaving lawful issue, then she directs her trustees, or the survivor, to dispose of her residuary estate, by applying the same to charitable uses in France.\nOn the 10th day of June 1875, Horace B. Fry and Emily L. Fry, his wife, executed a deed of trust to the Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities, of all the estate of said Emily L. Fry, real, personal a.nd mixed, excepting $7000 in nominal amount of the seven per cent, coupon bonds of the New York Central Railroad Company, and $3000 in nominal value of bonds of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company ; also equipages, household furniture, books, pictures, &c., \u201cIn trust as respects one fell equal undivided third part of the property hereby granted and assigned to pay over the net rents, issues and profits, interest and income thereof, for and during the lifetime of the said Emily L. Fry, to such person or persons as she, the said Emily L. Fry, whether covert or sole, shall appoint from time to time to receive the same by any revocable instrument under her hand, and not by way of anticipation, and in default of such appointment, then into her own proper hands, notwithstanding coverture, and in case of such coverture for her separate use, and the receipt of such person so appointed, or of herself in default of such appointment, shall only be a sufficient discharge therefor, jProvided, that such rents, issues and profits, interest and income, shall not be liable to her debts contracts or engagements, or the debts, contracts or engagements of her present or any future husband. And from and after the decease of the said Emily L. Fry, then to grant, convey, assign, transfer and set over the said one equal undivided third part of the said trust estate hereby granted and assigned unto such person or persons, and for such use and uses, estate and estates, as she, the said Emily L. Fry, shall, whether covert or sole, by her last will and testament, or any instrument in the nature thereof, under her hand and seal, executed in the presence of two or more credible subscribing witnesses, direct, limit and appoint, and for want of such direction, limitation or appointment, then to grant, convey, assign, transfer and set over the said one full equal undivided third part of the said trust estate hereby granted and assigned unto and to the use of such persons and in 'such proportions as they would be entitled to under the present intestate laws of the state of Pennsylvania, if the said Emily L. Fry had survived her husband and died intestate in the state of Pennsylvania while an inhabitant thereof, seised and possessed in her own right of said equal undivided third part of said trust estate, and if the real estate therein included were situate in said state of Pennsylvania.\u201d The other two-thirds of the estate were conveyed in trust for the two children, and in the event of their death without issue, to such person or persons as they might by will or other instrument constitute, limit and appoint to receive the same, and in default of such will or appointment then the estate was to be conveyed as in the case of the third named above. There was no dispute about these two-thirds. On the 7th of September 1875, Horace B. Fry and Emily L. Fry were absolutely divorced from the bonds of matrimony under proceedings instituted, by Horace B. Fry v. Mrs. Fry, in the Circuit Court of Dubuque county, Iowa, and Mrs. Fry died on the 23d day of October following.\nShortly after Mrs. Fry\u2019s death the Pennsylvania Company filed their account as trustees, which was referred to an auditor, before whom appeared the executors and the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company, the former claiming one equal undivided third part of the entire trust estate under the provisions of the will, and the latter claiming the entire trust estate as guardian of the two minor children, under the- provisions of the deed of trust. \u2022\nThe auditor was of opinion that the trust created in the deed executed by Horace B. Ery and Emily L., his wife, dated June 10th 1875, was an active one, and continued to the day of the death of Emily L. Fry, and that the will of Mrs. Fry was revoked and of no effect, and he, therefore, awarded the whole trust estate to the Fidelity Company.'\nThe exceptions filed to this report were dismissed by the court, Ludlow, P. J., saying:\n\u201c Under no circumstances can we interpret the will of Mrs. Fry, made many years before the deed of 1875 was executed, as an execution of a power of appointment contained in that deed. The question is always one of intention, and though a will is ambulatory until the death of the testator, yet the very fact that it was made in 1869, and was not republished, rebuts any presumption of an intent to execute a power not then in existence.\n\u201cIt is argued that although no execution of a power can be established, yet the trust cannot be sustained, inasmuch as the divorce terminates the marital relations.\n\u201c It would be sad indeed, if tlie very object of the trust should thus, through a technicality, perish. Such might have been the case after Ogden\u2019s Appeal was decided, but the recent authorities cited by the auditor, are, we think, strong enough to enable us to decide that this trust is yet active and must be sustained. It was not merely a trust during coverture, but also whether covert or sole.\u201d\nThe action of the court in dismissing the exceptions and confirming the report was assigned for error by the executors, who took this writ\nA. Sydney Biddle and George W. Biddle, for appellants.\n\u2014 The gift to Mrs. Fry of one-third part of the trust estate in question constituted a trust for her sole and separate use, and gave her a legal estate at the termination of the marital relation: Dodson v. Ball, 10 P. F. Smith 496; Mackason\u2019s Appeal, 6 Wright 330; Nice\u2019s Appeal, 14 Id. 144; Mogargee v. Naglee, 14 P. F. Smith 216; Yarnall\u2019s Appeal, 20 Id. 338; Ogden\u2019s Appeal, Id. 502; Rife v. Geyer, 9 Id. 396.\nMrs. Fry, upon becoming discovert, took an estate in fee simple, in the one-third of her trust estate: Dodson v. Ball, supra; Ralston v. Waln, 8 Wright 279; Physick\u2019s Appeal, 14 Id. 128; Nice\u2019s Appeal supra; Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 16.\nThe will was not revoked by the deed of trust and was a good execution of the power reserved to herself under said deed: Patch v. Shore, 2 Drew. & Smale 591; Act of Assembly April 8th 1833, Purd. Dig. 1476, pl. 16; Wogan v. Small, 11 S. & R. 145; Balliet\u2019s Appeal, 2 Harris 459; Thomas v. Jones, 1 DeGex, J. & S. 63; Act of Assembly of 1833, Purd. Dig. 1476, pl. 11; Thomas v. Jones, 31 Law Journal Rep. Ch. 733, and 2 Johnson & Hemming 475: Cofield v. Pollard, 5 Weekly Rep. 774.\nThomas J. Diehl and William A. Porter, for appellees.\n\u2014 A general devise, however unlimited in its terms, will not comprehend the subject of a power unless it refer to the power itself: Sugden on Powers 385. There is no authority that holds that a general power of appointment was executed by the donee of the power in an instrument of anterior date to that which created the power itself: Bingham\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 349. The intention of the party, where the power is general, is to be sought only in the instrument by which the appointment is made : Thompson v. Garwood, 3 Whart. 287. Mrs. Fry\u2019s will, executed six years before the creation of the power, contained no reference to this power, as was in the nature of the case impossible.\nThe deed was a revocation of the will: Balliet\u2019s Appeal, 2 Harris 460; Leigh v. Norbury, 18 Vesey 339.\nThe deed of trust was not intended for coverture only, but it was intended that it should operate on this one-third if the parties should afterwards become discovert, either by a natural or legal dissolution of the marriage relation: Earp\u2019s Appeal, 25 P. F. Smith 119; Ashhurst\u2019s Appeal, 27 Id. 464; Ash\u2019s Appeal, 30 Id. 497."
