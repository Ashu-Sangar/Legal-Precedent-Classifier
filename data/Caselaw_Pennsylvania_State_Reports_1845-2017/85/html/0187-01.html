It was recovered for work done by the defendant in error in the construction of the railroad for that company. The indebtedness was evidenced by written certificates dated 16th September 1856. The corporation became insolvent. All its property, real and personal, and its franchises were sold under a decree of court, and the company ceased to exist. The purchaser and others for whom he acted, organized a railroad company. After some further changes and transfers, the whole property and franchises became vested in the plaintiffs in error; subsequently to this a scire facias issued on the original judgment, with notice to the plaintiffs in error, under the Act of April 4th 1862, Purd. Dig. 91, pi. 6, and judgment by default was duly recovered against it. On that judgment, and to revive and continue the lien thereof, this scire facias issued. It issued against the same parties who were defendants in the judgment recovered on the former scire facias. The plaintiffs in error were therefore restricted in their defence to either denying the existence of the judgment on which the sci. fa. issued, or to showing payment or some equitable defence, which had arisen subsequent to its rendition.

It was acknowledged on the day thereafter, and not recorded until the 20th of October. The lien of the defendant in error was therefore prior in time; hence it follows that the defence set up is not only too late in point of time, but manifestly insufficient, if it had been averred during the pendency of the first scire facias.</p>
