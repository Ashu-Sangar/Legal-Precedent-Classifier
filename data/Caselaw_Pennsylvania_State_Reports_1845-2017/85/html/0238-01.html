In the year 1875 he was the owner of|large amounts of real estate, situated in different parts of the city of Allegheny, in the counties of Jefferson, Eorest and.Clarion, in West Virginia, and in Michigan. In July of that year he bought a bill . of lumber from Bradner &amp; Hartman, and, in answer to questions put to him by one Willey, plaintiffs’ agent, stated that he was solvent, t and able to pay for the lumber; that he was as good as any of the persons named by Willey as having made bids for the lumber. The lumber was sold to Dilworth on a year’s credit, and he gave a note for the amount. Willey did not demand security, nor did he ask Dilworth whether he was indebted to any one. The sale was consummated on or about the 10th day of July, and on the same day the note in payment was given. On the 17th day of August of the same year, Dilworth filed his voluntary petition in bankruptcy, showing a large indebtedness, and that his real estate was, in most instances, mortgaged. He subsequently offered those of his creditors who were unsecured, including the plaintiffs, twenty-five cents on the dollar. On the trial the plaintiff showed the foregoing facts, and rested.</p>

He also testified that he was compelled to go into bankruptcy unexpectedly, by reason of failing to sell a valuable lot to the Allegheny Gas Company for the sum of $65,000 — a sale that he had fully expected to make, and which would have paid off the mortgage against that lot and given him cash enough to meet certain notes that were about to fall due ; that he was advised to go into bankruptcy, in order to prevent judgments being obtained by some creditors to the detriment of others; that he desired to return the lumber to the plaintiffs, but that his attorney advised him that such a course would not be legal.</p>

The rule which must govern in such an action has been stated with great precision by Chief Justice Gibson in Bokee <em>v. </em>Walker, 2 Harris 139. That was the case o'f a representation of the circumstances of a third person, but there is no distinction between such a case and this, as to the rule of decision, though of course the jury may be expected to make a difference. A man knows his own circumstances better than those of his friend or neighbor, and if hopelessly insolvent it will not always be easy to convince a jury that he believed himself to be solvent. They will more narrowly scrutinize his conduct to arrive at a conclusion as to the sincerity of his belief. But men often are very unreasonable in the estimate they form of the value of their property, and yet are very honest in their opinion. It would introduce a new and very dangerous element into the question to say that the jurv must decide whether the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>defendant had reasonable grounds for his belief. “In an action for deceit,” says Chief Justice Gibson, “the jury have to deal with a question of good faith, and if they are satisfied that the defendant believed his own story, it is their duty to find in his favor.” “ A man who believes what he says is not chargeable with bad faith, and the state of his belief is a fact for the jury.” “ Sincerity of belief, <em>however apparently unfounded, </em>is unmixed matter of fact; and, if it were not the test, every recommendation would be a guaranty.” We have been referred to no subsequent case which at all qualifies the principle thus announced. On the contrary, in Graham <em>v. </em>Hollinger, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%2055" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Wright 55">10 Wright 55</a>, wdiere it would seem the defendant had suppressed the fact that he held himself a judgment bond against the person recommended, Mr. Justice Strong said: “If the representations made were false and yet were honestly believed to be true, and if the existence of the judgment bond was not mentioned from thoughtlessness and without intention to deceive, the liability of the defendant for damages was not made out.” “It maybe that the defendant could hardly have been mistaken, but whether he w'as or not was for the jury.”</p>
