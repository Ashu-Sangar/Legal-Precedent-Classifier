    <p class="summary" id="b340-7" data-blocks='[["BL_340.7",340,[263,821,1171,334]]]'>“ Lastly, it is my will that after the death of my beloved wife, Mary, all my estate be appraised and sold as soon as it can be done with advantage ; and if any of my sons think proper to take the farm on which I now live, at the appraisement, he shall have the privilege of doing so on paying' the other heirs their respective shares; and it is my will that all the money arising from the sale of my real estate be equally divided among all my children, share and share alike.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b340-9" data-blocks='[["BL_340.9",340,[255,1252,1177,822]]]'>“ The intention of the testator is clear and unequivocal. He directs all his real estate to be appraised and sold, and that all the money arising from the sale of the same be equally divided among all his children. This, under the ruling in Morrow <em>v. </em>Brenizer, <a href="/rawle/2/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Rawle 185" data-case-ids="1820587" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0185-01">2 Rawle 185</a>, made all the estate personal at his decease. None of his children, neither his sons or daughters, had any interest in his estate as realty. The permission given any of his sons to take the homestead farm at the appraisement, meant plainly this: that any of the sons might, if he chose, become the purchaser of the homestead farm at the price fixed by the appraisers. Until the choice was made, the homestead farm, as to all the testator’s children, remained personal property ; and after the choice made by the four sons, it vested in them as real estate, as purchasers under the will of their father, and not as heirs to said real estate. In regard to the daughters, the homestead farm was as to them personal property all the time. It was such at the decease of the testator, and remained such after the sons had taken it at the appraisement, their interest being their respective shares; not of the land, but of its appraised value.”</p>

He then reported, inter alia, as follows: “ Erancis L. Johnston having died on the 8th of May 1870, within twenty-one years from his mother’s death, viz., four years, seven months and eight days after her decease, without issue, the estate did not vest in his lifetime. Did it vest in William R. Johnston? ' At the decease of William R. Johnston, on the 2d of June 1871, his wife, Elizabeth V., was <em>enceinte, </em>and on the 25th of July <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>1871 was delivered of a daughter, Eliza M.

    <p class="summary" id="b341-7" data-blocks='[["BL_341.7",341,[206,640,1171,1170]]]'>“ The conclusion is clear that W. R. Johnston, when he died, left issue living at the time of his death. The only remaining question is, to what time do the words £ then living’ refer — to the death of William R., who survived Francis L., or to the expiration of twenty-one years from the death of Eliza M. Johnston, the testatrix? The language of the will is as follows, viz : £ Item: If both my sons should die within the period of twenty-one years from my decease without issue then living, then, and in that event,’ &amp;c. Eliza M. Johnston, the younger, was the only lineal descendant of Eliza M. Johnston, the testatrix. It is a fundamental principle of (he law that the heir can only be disinherited by clear and express language — by an implication so strong that an intention to the contrary cannot be supposed. The authorities on this point are so numerous and so well known that the auditor deems it superfluous to refer to them here. The first object of the testatrix was to make provision for her sons and their descendants; and, therefore, if a fair construction of the devising clause in the will, will give the estate to the issue, that construction must be adopted. Transfer the words without issue then living, so as to make the sentence read: If both my said sons should die without issue then living within the period of twenty-one years from my decease, and the conclusion is almost irresistible that the words £ then living ’ refer to the time of the death of William, and not to the twenty-one years from the death of the testatrix. And keeping in view the fact that Eliza M. Johnston, the younger (the issue of William R.), was the heir of the testatrix, the same conclusion must be arrived at without transferring any word.”</p>

Having issue vested no absolute estate in the children of the testatrix, and their offspring, upon the death of either could take no greater estate than <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>the parent had at the time of his death, which would he a determinable-estate until the expiration of the twenty-one years. There is no possible implication of a devise to the issue within the twenty-one years, of a higher or mo.re certain character than that given to the sons of the testatrix, and on the decease of the last of them his issue had but a life-estate until the expiration of the twenty-one years, and having died before that period the estate passed under the residuary clause after the death of James R.

Because the appraisement and sale under proceedings in the Orphans’ Court divested her interest in the land, if she had any, and converted the estate into money.

That is, that if the condition was simply that if the survivor should die within the time without issue a birth of issue would have filled the condition regardless of whether the issue survived his father or not, as in the case of the husband’s curtesy at common law</p>

He died leaving sons and daughters. The rule is too well settled, to need the citation of authorities, that an express and explicit direction by the will, to sell the real estate of the testator and divide the proceeds, works a conversion of it into personalty on his death. In this case there was an express direction to sell. The fact that it further permitted one of his sons, at his option, to take it at the valuation to be made, did not change the effect of the direction to sell. Whether or not a son acquired it, it was nevertheless a sale, and the one taking it became a purchaser. Until that period of time it continued personalty.</p>

The will further provided, that in case both of her said sons should die within twenty-one years from her decease, without issue then living, then devise over to other persons. Francis died within less than five years after the death of his mother, without issue. William R. died afterwards, but within twrenty-one years after his mother’s death.
