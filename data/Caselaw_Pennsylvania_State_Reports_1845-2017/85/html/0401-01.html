They are bound by their oaths to obey the constitutional mode of proceeding, and any intentional disregard is a breach of duty and a violation of their oaths. But when a law has been passed and approved and certified in due form the courts cannot go behind the law as duly certified, to inquire into the observance of form in its passage.</p>

Those containing more than three hundred thousand inhabitants; 2. Those containing less than three hundred thousand and more than one hundred thousand; and 3. Those containing less than one hundred thousand and more than ten thousand. In fact, Philadelphia is the only city with a population greater than three hundred thousand, and Pittsburgh the only one with less than three hundred thousand and over one hundred thousand. To separate these two cities from all others in the state and put them apart, ■ each by itself, and to call that classification, is a curious use of language. When you separate persons or things, and deal with each by itself, you perform a process the very opposite to classifying, which consists in arranging a number of things together in accordance with some quality or accident which they all have in common. Class is a noun of multitude, and you cannot properly call a city a class of cities, for the same reason that you cannot speak of one ox as a drove, or one wolf as a pack. When the legislature says classification, it means segregation. It was intended to individualize these two cities — not to arrange them in classes or put them to<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>gether with one another. In that same act, and other acts subsequently passed, the phrase “all cities of the first class” signifies precisely the same thing as Philadelphia, and the words “all cities of the second class” furnish a perfect synonym for Pittsburgh. This law, therefore, applies solely and especially to Pittsburgh, and operates upon Pittsburgh as exclusively as if the framers of it had said so without circumlocution. It is not in form a local law for one particular place; it professes on its face to be made for all cities of the second class ; but all cities of the second class mean Pittsburgh. It might as wrell have been described by the words “ all cities situated between the rivers Monongahela and Allegheny, at the point of their junction with the Ohio.”</p>

The only question before us in these cases is, upon the power of the legislature to pass this law. After a thorough argument and a careful consideration, we' are unable to pronounce the law unconstitutional. The power to classify cities according to the number of their population was fully discussed and decided in the case of Wheeler <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 27 P. E. Smith 338. We adhere to that decision, and indeed cannot see how the question of power could have been decided differently. To say that no general law can be passed to regulate a certain subject because some of the classes contained in the regulation do not yet exist, or exist only in a limited number, is to hold that no law can be passed to provide for future wants or necessities. The welfare of the state and one of the chief purposes of legislation would be struck down by such a decision. If the classification had been different and the number of the population to constitute a city of the first class, had been fixed at one million, would the classification be void because no city had yet reached that number ? The absurdity of such a proposition is manifest, and it is simply to say that no law can provide for a state of affairs to which the subject is rapidly approaching, but which it has not yet reached. If the power to classify and regulate the subjects of cities generally be admitted, and clearly it cannot be successfully denied, the question of local legislation is at an end; for though it may happen that but one city may fall within the class, <em>non- constat </em>that others will not shortly do so and therefore may be provided for. The law was not passed for Pittsburgh as the only city happening within the second class, but for all cities having the population to bring them within that class. If I agree to sell all my lands at a certain rate according to a classification of tracts I have adopted, and only one tract falls within the rate of a given class, will any one be guilty of the absurdity of saying that it is not governed by my classification. The motives of those who passed the law are not involved. Suppose they did perceive that Philadelphia was the only city falling within the first class, and Pittsburgh the only one in the second, yet the motive influeiíbing that classification cannot be inquired into. If the power to classify for wise purposes exists, that ends the matter.</p>

But ’when a law has been passed and approved and certified in due form, it is no part of the duty of the judiciary to go behind the law as duly certified to inquire into the observance of form in its passage.
