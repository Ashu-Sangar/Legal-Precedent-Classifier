The Act of April 24th 1874, entitled “An Act for the taxation of corporations,” provides, that every company now or hereafter incorporated by or under any law of this Commonwealth, except hanks and savings institutions, and of every company now or hereafter incorporated by any other state, and doing business in this Commonwealth, which is taxable under the laws of the state, “ shall make annual report concerning the capital of their respective corporations, dividends, and the appraisement of their capital stock,” and provides for a settlement of taxes by the auditor-general and state treasurer.
