In addition, to these, it was claimed by the plaintiff that the defendants had not put in a sufficient frame, nor roof, nor proper timbers in the frame; that one of the wheels was not sufficient to drive the circular saw, and had to be taken out and supplied by another immediately, in order to do any sawing at all; that the gates would not open, and there were general defects in the whole structure.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b267-9" data-blocks='[["BL_267.9",267,[213,990,1177,1383]]]'>“ The first clause describes the machinery, the last the result to be obtained by that machinery, to wit: quality of machinery and manufacturing capacity equal to the old mill at the time it was burned — this to be obtained, by the use of the same kind of machinery. Nearly, if not all of the machinery for want of 'which the plaintiff claims damages, had gone out of use or been laid aside. Its presence in or about the mill at the time it was burned, as a then available element in manufacturing lumber, did not enter into the minds of any one. At the time it was burned, and for some time previous, the machinery necessary to operate successfully a circular sawmill was used. This the parties had in their minds when they made the contract. The mill as it actually was, not what it had been. This view is supported by several considerations not referred to in the contract. The defendants were millwrights ; they could not but know that to build and furnish the mill described, with all the machinery now claimed, would have cost about double the amount of the stipulated price. It is not to be supposed that they understood the contract to be as now alleged by the plaintiff, nor is it probable that the plaintiff himself, when he made the contract, understood it as now asserted. Upon this point the evidence of Mr. Derby is of great weight. He testified as follows: ‘ I have seen the mill built by defendants for plaintiff in place of the one that was burned. I saw' it in the summer of 1874. I went there for the purpose of seeing the mill. I went at the request of Mr. Ellis, the plaintiff in this suit. Mr. Ellis said he was not a judge of the work, and that he wished to have it inspected by competent judges. Therefore he called upon Mr. Olmstead and myself. I examined it for the purpose of giving an opinion as to whether it was a good mill or not, whether properly built. I saw a writing which was said to be the contract for building the mill, and I told Mr. Ellis I thought the work was fairly done.’</p>
