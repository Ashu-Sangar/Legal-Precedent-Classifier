It has been held that where a party has acted upon a particular construction of a contract which has been acquiesced in by the other, the latter is estopped from contesting, it as the proper construction : Mercer Mining and Manufacturing Co. <em>v. </em>McKee, 17 P. F. Smith 170.</p>
    <p id="b418-8" data-blocks='[["BL_418.8",418,[297,1681,1170,476]]]'>The constitutional right against unjust taxation, which the plaintiff in error invokes, is given him for the protection of his private property. He may waive that protection and consent to such action in regard to it as would otherwise be invalid. Having consented, and the other party having acted thereon, and made expenditures and incurred expense predicated thereon, the consent cannot be withdrawn. Hence, an act appropriating the private property of one person for the private purpose.of another on compensation made, was held valid when he whose property was taken assented thereto, and receiving the compensation awarded was a sufficient assent: Cooley on Const. Lim. *181.</p>

The constitution guarantees the right of trial by jury to one charged with a crime, yet he may waive that right and plead guilty in a case where his life will pay the penalty. So his private <em>property </em>may not be taken for a public highway without compensation paid or secured, yet he may just as <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>effectively divest his right by a voluntary dedication to the public followed by acceptance and expenditure.</p>

We are unable to see any force in this objection. His own direct.action has charged his land with this special tax. If one of the consequences of that action has been to throw a portion of the cost of the improvement on the tax-payers generally, on what principle ought he to claim exemption therefrom ? Ho has not derived. less benefit than they from this improvement. No voluntary act of theirs caused the expenditure. Why, then, shall he not bear his share of the obligation, which his voluntary action has created and not cast it wholly on. others ? As, then, a portion of any general tax levied for this purpose would justly fall on him, it cannot furnish any ground for relieving his property from the payment of the special tax. If so relieved, his conduct would have the effect of imposing lai’ger taxation on others, and thus work still greater injustice.</p>

The bonds issued by the city for the improvement of various streets under that act amount to about five millions of dollars. It may be that all who passively enjoyed the benefits of the improvements may not be liable to specific assessments to pay the bonds under the act; yet it by no means follows that the plaintiff in error is discharged from his obligation: City of Burlington <em>v. </em>Gilbert, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20Iowa%20356" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="81 Iowa 356">supra;</a> Kellogg <em>v. </em>Ely, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Ohio%20St.%2066" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="15 Ohio St. 66">15 Ohio St. 66</a>.
