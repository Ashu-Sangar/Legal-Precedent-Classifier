It was agreed at the time of this purchase, that in case the said defendant should desire to sell any of said lots, that the plaintiffs would release the morfc gage from the lots so sold, on receiving a reasonable amount of the purchase-money, so as not to. unreasonably reduce their security for the remaining part of the purchase-money. That a short time after the giving of the mortgage defendant sol/i thirteen of the least valuable of the lots to one E. P. Pingen, and offered to pay plaintiffs $1000 on account of the said mortgage, and requested them to release the lien of the mortgage from the thirteen lots so sold, as they by agreement were bound to do, and which they refused to do, by reason whereof this defendant was sued by said Pingen for not making good title to the lots so sold him, and a recovery of $1500 was had against this defendant. The defendant further says, that the twenty-three lots remaining unsold, were ample security for the remaining $2000 due on said mortgage, and constituted more than three-fourths in value of the entire purchase. By reason of the <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>failure of plaintiffs to release the said thirteen lots as requested, defendant believes he has sustained, in addition to the damage of Pingen’s recovery of $1500, at least $500 and upwards, and in all at least $2000.”</p>

It appears by the record that the mortgage was assigned to. Mrs. Parsons on the 25th of August 1873, thirteen days after its execution. The assignment was acknowledged on the day of its date, and was recorded on the 9th of September. The affidavit of defence did not assert that the sale of the thirteen lots was prior to the date of the assignment, nor did it set out any facts showing or tending to show that the parol agreement was anything more than a purely collateral and subordinate understanding; that it had formed the inducement or even a motive for the completion of the original contract; or that it had been omitted from the mortgage by fraud, accident or mistake. There was no pretence that the assignee had actual notice of the agreement, and, as there had been no breach of it when the assignment was executed, its existence could not impair or affect her rights under the expressed terms of the mortgage. As in Davis <em>v. </em>Barr, 9 S. &amp; R. 137, this agreement in no respect related to the validity of the instrument assigned, to the existence of the debt it secured, or to the amount of it that was due. It was held, in The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>The Councils of Pittsburgh, 10 Casey, 496, that a secret equity or an agreement merely collateral could not be asserted by the obligor in a bond against a holder without notice. This was a-collateral contract enforceable perhaps between the parties to it, but it created no equity attaching to the mortgage in regard to which it was the duty of the assignee to inquire.</p>
    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[256,1459,1170,217]]]'>No difficulty can arise in adjusting the claim for a credit of ninety dollars made in the affidavit of defence. When the rule for judgment was applied for, the plaintiffs offered to allow it, and it was not objected to at the argument. The prothonotary will deduct it in liquidating the amount due on the mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b220-7" data-blocks='[["BL_220.7",220,[430,1674,996,207]]]'>The order of the Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and it is now ordered and adjudged that the rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered for the plaintiffs for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence be made absolute.</p>
