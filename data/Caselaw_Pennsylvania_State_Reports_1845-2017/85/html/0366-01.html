For a portion of the purchase-money Kaiser gave his mortgage on the premises for §1700, payable in two equal annual instalments, with interest.

The assessment was paid June 3d 1875. The plaintiff below claimed that the lien had expired at the time of payment, and the defendant was, therefore, not entitled to a set off. Hazlewood avenue, on which the property covered by the mortgage has a frontage of over five hundred feet, throughout nearly its whole length, passes through rural property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b367-8" data-blocks='[["BL_367.8",367,[199,1312,1176,259]]]'>The plaintiff contended that, under these circumstances, the assessment was illegal and invalid; that if Kaiser had objected to its payment, the city could not have recovered, and that he was, therefore, not entitled to a credit for the amount. The court below sustained this view and ordered a verdict for plaintiff, which was the error assigned by defendant, who took this writ.</p>

The grading of a street is a necessity, in order that the owners of property can have ingress and egress to and from the same, but the paving of a street is as a general rule a matter of convenience. Seely <em>v. </em>The City of Pittsburgh, 1 Norris 360, ruled upon by the court below, differs from this case. That case arose upon a paving lien on an avenue extending through property of different kinds on a great highway of the city. Here, however, the use of Hazel-wood avenue is restricted to the limited number who live contiguous thereto, and who alone derive benefit therefrom, and owing to the character and extent of their property in almost equal proportions.</p>

Under the provisions of the Act of 1864, “ The assessments authorized by this act shall be liens upon the properties assessed, from the commencement of the' improvements for which they were made, and shall, if filed <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>within six months after the completion of the said improvement, continue liens for five years.” The work was approved and the contract taken off the hands of the contractor on December 3d 1874, by the street committee. Kaiser paid the assessments on June 3d 1875, having been told by the city attorney that if the assessments were not paid on that day a lien would be filed.</p>
    <p id="b368-6" data-blocks='[["BL_368.6",368,[255,669,1184,562]]]'>Defendant in error contended that the court below also held, that from the fact that the contractor actually stopped work on December 2d 1874, although the work oh the avenue was not approved nor the contract taken off the hands of the contractor by the regular committee of councils until the next day, December 3d 1874, that the payment of the assessments for said grading was not within the statutory period of six months; that the assessments were not a lien upon the property of John Kaiser, on the day the same were paid by Kaiser, and that the said payment cannot be set up as a defence to the plaintiff’s claim in this case. We submit that the completion of the improvement under this act means the time when the work was approved, and the contract taken off the hands of the contractor by the street committee.</p>

    <p id="b368-9" data-blocks='[["BL_368.10",368,[251,1620,1181,304]]]'>By the very terms of the act a secret lien is allowed to exist against the property during the entire continuance of the work and for six months after its completion. Such liens are justly looked upon with disfavor by the courts, .and the statute authorizing them should be rigidly construed. The right to extend them a day beyond the completion of the work involves the right to extend them indefinitely.</p>
    <p id="b368-10" data-blocks='[["BL_368.11",368,[251,1924,1179,163]]]'>In this case the secret lien had been running since November 1872 — nearly three years. Public policy, as well as private rights, would seem to demand that it terminate at the earliest possible moment.</p>
