J., that the bonds were kept in the safe, inside the vault, in the bank. On the 5th of August 1871 the bonds were stolen. The fact that the loss occurred by theft was not denied, but the manner of the theft was not explained in any way. It was shown that other parties had left bonds, at different times, in the bank for safe keeping and that some of the directors knew of this habit of receiving them on the part of the cashier. It was in evidence also that having obtained the information that' the bonds were stolen, from an outside source, about two weeks after the theft, Miss Graham made inquiry at the bank, and was told that they were stolen, but both the president and the cashier told her not to be alarmed, that she should lose nothing, and that she should come as usual, and the interest on the bonds should' be paid her as usual. This interest was credited to her on the books of the bank and was paid to her for two years subsequent to the loss. In 1878 the bank suspended payment and Miss Graham having demanded the bonds and failing to get them brought this suit.</p>

If the bonds be lost or stolen through the gross negligence of the bank this liability becomes fixed. The debatable question in this case is whether there was sufficient evidence of such negligence to he submitted to the jury. Upon the whole evidence we think there was. Whether the bonds in question were lost, stolen or abstracted by some one in the bank does not clearly appear. It certainly is a circumstance of some weight that a satisfactory solution of the manner of the loss has never been given by the bank, if, then, we refer to the structure and arrangement of the banking house and the vault, we find it almost impossible that this vault could have been entered in broad daylight, as alleged it must have been, by a person entering to steal these bonds, without his being seen by the officers of the bank. If we add to this an entire absence of any breach of the windows, doors, vault and floors, through which an entry might have been effected, and that no information was given to the plaintiff of the loss of her bonds until she called herself, and then that she was called into a private room to communicate the loss, the case acquires more strength. And then, if finally she was told by the bank that the loss would not be hers but that of the bank, and that the bank would continue to pay her the interest, and accordingly did so for about two years, carrying the payments into the books of the bank, implying a consciousness of the officers that the loss was caused by some fault of the bank, we reach a point in the evidence of such strong import as to the fact of gross negligence, the evidence could not be withheld from the jury. Having been submitted to them, and gross negligence found <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>by them, and a new trial refused, we cannot say that the evidence was insufficient, and that an error was committed. The verdict establishes the negligence. We discover no error in the record and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
