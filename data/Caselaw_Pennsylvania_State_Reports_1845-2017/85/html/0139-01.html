In 1869, II. was discharged from prison, where he had been confined on a charge of complicity in the murder of It. The indictment had been found at February term of that year, and when discharged the May term, the second after his arrest and imprisonment, had expired. Eight years thereafter H. was again indicted for the murder of It., and set up this discharge as a bar to the prosecution, claiming that he was entitled to the benefit of the “two-term rule,” prescribed by the Act of 31st March 1860. It appeared from the record that immediately before the motion for the discharge the district, attorney had asked leave to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to El., and tlxat the entry was made at once. <em>Held, </em>that the record did not slxow a disciiarge under. the two-term rule of the statute, and the entry of the <em>nolle prosequi </em>was not a bar to the second indictment.</p>

A confessed accomplice in the murder was offered as a witness to fasten participation in the crime upon the prisoners. He was objected to on the ground that he had been convicted of larceny and his sentence had not expired. To meet this objection a pardon was offered, granted by the governor. Against this it was alleged that the rules of the board of pardons had not been observed and that the full sentence of the court had not been recited therein. The only omission was the direction for the restoration of the property stolen, or the payment of its value. <em>Held, </em>that the court was bound to accept the executive action as controlling and conclusive.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b139-9" data-blocks='[["BL_139.7",139,[227,1252,1178,315]]]'>3. Against the same witness it was alleged that he had been convicted of highway robbery and sentenced, and subsequently discharged under the provisions of the Act of May 1st 1861. It was insisted that he was not competent to testify, because he had not complied with the terms of his sentence. Upon the production of the record it appeared that the trial had been in the Quarter Sessions and not in the Oyer and Terminer. <em>Held, </em>that as there was thus presented the record of a conviction in the Quarter Sessions, for a crime triable only in the Oyer and Terminer, the whole proceeding was a nullity and was properly disregarded.</p>

The prisoners were charged with murder, which had followed a highway robbery, and it was proposed to prove that they were members of a secret society, tlxat had lor its object the commission of crimes, chiefly boatings, arsons, robberies and murders, and the protection of its members from arrest and punishment by secreting them, aiding their escapo and otherwise. This evidence was offered to show an extensive organization of conspirators to commit crime, having the robbery and murder charged within the general scope of the conspiracy, as well as tending to show opportunity, means, preparation and disposition on the part of the prisoners to commit the crime in question, and to explain and corroborate other testimony, in regard to the arrangement for the commission of said crime. The court below ruled that the Commonwealth might prove the fact of the membership of the prisoners in such organization, confining the testimony to facts that existed at the time of the murder. <em>Held, </em>that this evidence was clearly competent to the extent to which it was admitted.</p>

McHugh and Tully each pleaded, “Not guilty,” and Hester filed a special plea, which set forth that in December 1868 he was arrested for the murder of Rea, and confined in the county jail; that while so confined he was indicted for said felony; that during the period of his confinement the February and May terms of the Court of Oyer and Terminer were held, and he was not called for trial; that on the 11th of May 1869, being the last day of the second term, he was duly discharged from imprisonment for the murder of said Rea; wherefore he prayed judgment of the court if he should be again charged with the same felony and murder of which he has once already been acquitted and discharged.</p>

There was no court held in March 1869, and the business in the court at the May sessions 1869 precluded the possibility of trial at that term unless other trials had been postponed in order to give preference to the case of defendant. The record does not show that the defendant was discharged under the two-term provision of the statute. The discharge on the 11th May 1869 was merely a judgment that, as the district-attorney had entered a <em>nolle prosequi, </em>the defendant was entitled to he discharged from imprisonment.

    <p class="summary" id="b141-7" data-blocks='[["BL_141.7",141,[204,683,1182,999]]]'>Rea resided at Centraba, and was superintendent of the Locust Mountain Coal and Iron Company. On the morning of the 17th of October 1868 he left his house, in his usual health, and started to go to Mount Carmel. He was seen in his buggy alone, on this morning, driving towards the Coal Ridge Colliery. Not returning in the evening, search was made for him by citizens of Centraba, and on the following morning his body was found on the right side of the road leading from Centraba to Mount Carmel, not far from a place known as the “Water Barrel,” in a clear spot, with brush all around it, and a path leading to it. The body was found lying upon its back with the face turned up. There were six pistol wounds on the body, five of which were mortal. One wound was in the face, three in the body, apparently fired from the front; one in the neck, and one at the base of the skull behind the ear. No watch or money, except a few copper coins, were found on the body. Several men were seen near the “water barrel,” a short time before the deceased would have reached there after leaving Centraba — that is, between 9 and 10 o’clock in the morning. The theory of the Commonwealth was that, as this Saturday was the general pay-day in the coal regions, these men had concealed themselves at this point for the purpose of securing the money with which Rea was going to pay the hands at the colliery, and that they had stopped him on the road, robbed and killed him.</p>

To meet this objection the Commonwealth produced a pardon granted by the governor on the 6th of January 1877. In reply the defendants offered to show that this pardon was not obtained at a regular meeting of the Board of Pardons, on the day fixed by the rules of the Board of Pardons, but at a special meeting, of which no notice was given; that notice was published by the Board of Pardons that no regular meeting would be held on the 2d day of January 1877, the regular day of meeting by the board, and the day when Kelly, or some one for him, gave notice he would apply to the board for a pardon.</p>

The exemplified copy of the record is from the Court of Quarter Sessions of that county. It shows that Dennis Kelly, who is shown to be the Avitness, A\'as indicted in the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Schuylkill county, on the 7th September 1869, for highway robbery, and that ho Avas tried in the Court of Quarter Sessions, on same day, found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine of one hundred dollars and costs and undergo imprisonment for ten years in Schuylkill county prison. The record itself is produced and appears to be the docket of the Quarter Sessions. It is testified by the clerk that there was an Oyer and Terminer docket kept in that county, in which were entered homicide trials, also for burglary and the like. In the case of Dougherty <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 19 P. F. Smith 292, Avhich Avas a writ of error to Armstrong county, directed to the Oyer and Terminer and Quarter Sessions, it appeared that no separate docket Avas kept in the Oyer and Terminer, and the Supreme Court held, that as the record purported to be the record of the Quarter Sessions it must be so regarded and treated. The indictment was for murder. It was said, per Williams, J., “the court of Quarter Sessions therefore had no jurisdiction or power to try and punish the defendant, and if as appears by the record, he was tried, convicted and sentenced therein, the Avhole proceedings must be regarded as null and void. If the case had been in fact tried in Oyer and Terminer, the record might have been corrected by an order of the court, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>as was afterwards permitted in the case cited, and as was done in Brown <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 28 P. F. Smith 122. But until such amendment or change is made the record must be taken as it stands and cannot be supplemented by parol evidence. No part of a judgment can rest on parol: Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Briggans, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%201866" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts 1866">5 Watts 1866</a>. Inasmuch as the record of a court is to be taken as importing absolute verity, it cannot be shown by parol that it is the record of a different court from what it purports to be. There are other questions raised by the evidence in regard to the paying of the fine imposed and enduring the imprisonment for the time mentioned in the sentence. But as upon the whole showing I am of the opinion that the witness is not incompetent, I give no opinion upon these questions. The objection is overruled.”</p>

From a careful examination of the voluminous record that has been brought up, it is manifest that no effort was spared to secure an accurate and just result. The charge of the president of the Oyer and Terminer developed the whole cause in a perfectly satisfactory way. It was full, fair, temperate and unprejudiced ; the material facts were stated in their due proportions; and the instructions upon legal questions were so intelligent and so clear as to make their apprehension and application by the jury free from the chance of mistake or doubt. In relation to the general features of the case, there is nothing, therefore, that requires remark. Only the particular errors alleged to have been committed in the .progress of the trial are left for examination and review.</p>

On the 11th of May 1869, Patrick Hester, on the motion of his counsel, was discharged from the prison of Columbia county, where he had been confined on a charge of complicity in the murder of Alexander W. Ilea. The indictment against him had been found at the February term of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, and when he was discharged, the May term, the second after his arrest and imprisonment, had expired. It began on Monday, the 3d of May, and closed on Saturday, the 8th, for an order had been made on the 10 th of February that it should be limited to a single week. Hester was discharged, therefore, three days after the day appointed for the expiration of the term. It was insisted on by his counsel that he was entitled, on the trial of this indictment, to the benefit of the provisions of the 57th section of the Act of the 31st of March 1860, declaring that if a prisoner “ shall not he indicted or tried at the second term, session or court after his or her commitment, unless the delay happen on the application or with the consent of the defendant, or upon trial he shall be acquitted, he shall be discharged from imprisonment.” Under this provision, the proceeding in May 1869 was set up as a bar to any subsequent prosecution. The section quoted was a re-enactment in substance of the third section of the Act of the 18th of February 1785, under which a doubt was expressed in Clark <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 5 Casey 136, whether the plea of a discharge under the two-term rule, prescribed by the statute, would be available against a second indictment. But the facts presented do not call for an inquiry into the effect upon the after liability to arrest and punishment of a prisoner in whose behalf the statutory provision may have been applied. Here, the record did not show a discharge under the two-term rule. It appears from the court minutes that immediately before the motion was made, the district-attorney had asked leave to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to Hester — that the motion was allowed — and that the entry was made <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>at once. The motion for the discharge was not grounded on the rule. From anything that the record shows, it could not be said that such a motion, if made, would not have been denied. When the <em>nolle prosequi </em>was entered without conditions, the right of the prisoner to his freedom accrued. The motion for his discharge was the assertion of the right thus created. The other proceedings of the court, as disclosed by the minutes, show that Hester, Thomas Donohue, John Duffy and Michael Prior were under joint indictment. A jury was empannelled in Duffy’s case, and after a trial, extending from the 3d to the 11th of May, a verdict of not guilty was rendered. A jury was then sworn as to Prior, and a formal verdict was taken on the 11th of May in his favor. The distinction made in disposing of the cases of the different prisoners proves that the district-attorney did not design to abandon all further prosecution of Hester. The effect of the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>is fully settled as well in Pennsylvania as elsewhere. It was said by Black, C. J., in McFadden <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 11 Harris 12, that a prisoner charged with crime is not in jeopardy until the jury is empannelled and sworn. At common law, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>may at any time be retracted, and it not only is no bar to a subsequent prosecution on another indictment, but may be so far cancelled as to permit a revival of proceedings on the original bill: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Wheeler, <a href="/mass/2/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="2 Mass. 172" data-case-ids="2007173" data-case-paths="/mass/2/0167-01">2 Mass. 172</a>; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Miller, 2 Ash. 61. It will not have the effect of a <em>retraxit </em>even where a personal agreement has been made by the attorney-general "that it should be a bar: State <em>v. </em>Lopez, <a href="/mo/19/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="19 Mo. 254" data-case-ids="315641" data-case-paths="/mo/19/0254-01">19 Mo. 254</a>. The cases collected in the notes to sects. 513, 514 and 515, of Wharton’s Criminal Law, fully support this doctrine. The record of the proceedings of the Columbia Oyer and Terminer, in May 1869, was conclusive as to the ground of the discharge, and ample authority justified the decision that the entry of the <em>nolle prosequi </em>was not a bar to this indictment.</p>

Daniel Kelly, a confessed accomplice in the murder of Rea, was offered as a witness to fasten participation in the crime upon the prisoners. Objection was made to his testimony on the ground that he had been convicted of larceny in the Quarter Sessions of Schuylkill, and sentenced, on the 10th of September 1874, to separate and solitary confinement at labor for three years, and as this cause ■was tried in February 1877, within the period of the sentence prescribed, it was urged that he was incompétent. The objection was met by the production of a pardon granted by the governor on the 6th of January 1877. Against this it was alleged that the rules of the Board of Pardons had not been observed, and that the full sentence pf the Court of Quarter Sessions was not recited. The pardon was the act of the chief executive officer of the Commonwealth. It recited a recommendation, in writing, by the lieutenant-governor, the secretary of the Commonwealth, and the attorney-general. It set out the offence for which Kelly was tried and con<a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>victed, the date of the conviction and sentence, the amount of the fine, the direction to pay the costs of prosecution, and the term of the imprisonment. All that was omitted was the direction for the restoration of the property stolen or the payment of its value. Upon irregularities and omissions of form such as these, it was proposed that the judges of the Oyer and Terminer should set aside and annul the deliberate action of the governor taken in the execution of a constitutional power expressly conferred. There was no allegation that the pardon was obtained by fraud or false pretence. If there had been, it is possible that the principles announced by Chief Justice Lowbie, in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Halloway, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20210" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="8 Wright 210">8 Wright 210</a>, might have required its investigation. With the evidence presented to them, the court were simply bound to accept the executive action as controlling and conclusive.</p>
    <p id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.6",155,[218,1042,1174,1210]]]'>8. Kelly’s testimony was objected to for another reason. Ho had been convicted of highway robbery in Schuylkill county, and sentenced, on the 8th of September 1869, to imprisonment for two years. On the 7th of July 1871, he was discharged from custody, under the provisions of the Act of the 1st of May 1861. It was insisted that he was not competent to testify, because he had not complied with the terms of his sentence. Upon the production of the record of the conviction, it appeared that the trial had been in the Court of Quarter Sessions, and not in the Oyer and Terminer, of Schuylkill county. It was held that the proceedings resulting in the conviction and sentence were <em>coram non judice, </em>and the objection to the competency of the witness was overruled. There was no doubt in the proof of the facts on which the decision of the court was rested. While the indictment appeared to have been found in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, Quarter Sessions of the Peace and General Jail Delivery, at September sessions 1869, the record produced was entitled as in the Quarter Sessions alone. It was certified by the clerk, and authenticated by the seal of that court. Indeed, the parol testimony showed that no other seal for the use of the constitutional criminal courts of the county was in existence. There was presented the naked case of the record of a conviction in the Quarter Sessions for a crime triable only in the Oyer and Terminer. The whole proceeding was a nullity, and was properly disregarded. Dougherty <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 19 P. F. Smith 286, was a trial for homicide, where the prisoner had been arraigned, tried, convicted and sentenced in the Quarter Sessions. It was held by this court that the conviction and sentence were void for want of jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b155-7" data-blocks='[["BL_155.7",155,[222,2252,1171,219]],["BL_156.1",156,[250,433,1177,1986]]]'>4. When the offer was made to prove the existence of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and its objects and operation, the' court expressed the opinion that it wras “ on the very outer verge of any evidence” that had been given in the trials in which the character of the organization had been involved. It was admitted, however, so <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>far as it related to facts existing in October 1868, but specific acts of others than those charged with complicity in the murder of Rea, committed either before or after that time, were excluded. Was this testimony irrelevant ? It was not designed to be used to establish the commission of any independent crime. Nor was its object to affect general character, or to repel inferences from adversary facts. Its purpose was to explain the relations existing between the conspiritors, the reason, motive and opportunity for their combined action, and the nature of the tie that bound them together. The reason for the exclusion of evidence of collateral facts is, that such evidence tends to draw away the minds of the jurors from the point in issue, and to excite prejudice, and mislead them: 1 Greenleaf s Evidence, sect. 52. Here the offer was not to show what could accurately be called collateral facts. The testimony could affect nobody but the parties charged with this murder, and could illustrate or tend to the proof of no other crime. Ten men, including the three prisoners, met in Donohue’s saloon on the evening of the 16th of October 1868, and openly arranged the details of their plan to attack and rob Rea on the following day. Hester was the body-master of the Locust Gap division, and the nine others were members of the order. It was proposed to prove that, under its practical workings, the organization had come to be the means of procuring crimes of every grade to be perpetrated with comparative impunity; that protection of the perpetrators from arrest and punishment was afforded by secreting them, aiding their escape, and employing counsel and procuring false testimony for their defence; that from .the members of each division individuals were selected by the body-master to commit any offence he might require at their hands; and that the members were bound to comply with his requirements. In effect, it was proposed to prove that those ten men, as members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and under the relations they held to each other as individual Mollie Maguires, organized themselves as a gang of bandits to carry into effect, on the 17th of October, the plot deliberated and decided upon the night before for the assault and robbery which ended in the murder. Without regard to the merits of other cases in which this class of evidence has been received, it was clearly competent, to the extent to which it was admitted, under the circumstances presented here. The facts were relevant, direct and essential. Without them the conduct of the prisoners and their associates would 'be explicable on no recognised or rational theory regarding the motives and modes of human action. With them, a jury were enabled to understand how the brutal and cold-blooded consultation in Donohue’s saloon could have been had without concealment or reserve, and how a horrible murder could have been committed the next morning on a public highway in the open day.</p>

Eor the same reasons that justified the admission of the <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>general testimony, the question to Kelly complained of in the fifth assignment of error was warranted. It was certainly relevant to prove that the place where the men met was a common resort of members of the order. It afforded them means of communication and intercourse, and tended to explain the circumstances of the gathering at which the plan for the altack on Rea was arranged. Under this assignment, the question of the extent of the credit to which the testimony of Kelly as an accomplice was entitled, was discussed. The question was not properly raised. If it had been it would be necessary only to say that it was disposed of with entire accuracy in the answers to the points and in the general charge.</p>
    <p id="b157-6" data-blocks='[["BL_157.6",157,[224,901,1173,733]]]'>6. If, from the testimony of John Cannon in contradiction of Kelly, which the prisoners offered, any motives operating on Daniel Kelly’s mind, when his alleged declarations were made, that had relation to this cause or these prisoners, could have been inferred, its admission would have been required by the principle decided in Gaines <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20327" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="14 Wright 327">14 Wright 327</a>. But the offer was not connected with the prisoners or either of them. The testimony could have had no effect except upon the general credibility of Kelly as a witness. Unconnected with the cause and with the parties as his answers on cross-examination had been, they were given in reference to collateral matter, and were not subject to contradiction. “ If a question is put to a witness which is collateral or irrelevant to the issue, his answ'er cannot be contradicted by the party who put the question, but it is conclusive against him:” 1 Greenleaf’s Ev., sect. 449. So much of the offer as proposed to prove Kelly’s declarations as connected with the murder was inadmissible, for as to those declarations, he had not been cross-examined.</p>
    <p id="b157-7" data-blocks='[["BL_157.7",157,[227,1638,1171,651]]]'>7. On behalf of Hester, all the evidence of his conduct and declarations that could be at all legitimate, was permitted to be given. Declarations which form part of the <em>res gestee </em>may be proved: Kirby <em>v. </em>The State, 7 Yerger 259. And declarations of one party made in the presence and hearing of the other, are <em>res gestee: </em>McClenkan <em>v. </em>McMillan, 6 Barr 367. Evidence was permitted of what Hester said and did in November 1868, when he went west. The fact that he apprehended arrest on a charge of adultery and a charge of violating the laws of the United States against illicit distillation, W'as allowed to be shown. And his words and acts at the time of his arrest, including his statement that he had come to give himself up, were testified to by Lewis S. Parr and Jacob L. Girton. Statements made by himself to outside parties in Illinois and at his home in Locust Gap, could not be made evidence on any principle as <em>res gestae.</em>

Parr had sworn to a conversation between Donohue and Hester in 1869. Evidence was given subsequently on behalf of the prisoners to discredit Parr’s statement. <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>Mr. Ikeler, who was district-attorney in 1869, was called to testify that Parr had made the same statement to him before Hester’s discharge on the first indictment. The eighth error has been assigned for the refusal of a motion to strike out Ikeler’s testimony. It was ruled in Henderson <em>v. </em>Jones, 10 S. &amp; R. 322, that where a witness is contradicted and evidence is given to impeach his character, evidence may be given of what he swore on a former trial of the cause in order to corroborate his testimony. “ A witness cannot be allowed, for the purpose of strengthening his testimony on his examination in chief, to state that he had previously communicated to others the same facts, but if it should become a material fact that the witness declared his knowledge to other persons, such persons may be called to prove it:” Daniel Dushore <em>v. </em>The Merchants’ Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Metc.%20199" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="11 Metc. 199">11 Metc. 199</a>. The same rule was laid down in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/mass/67/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="1 Gray 337" data-case-ids="1974016" data-case-paths="/mass/67/0337-01">1 Gray 337</a>, and in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Jenkins, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Gray%20489" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="10 Gray 489">10 Gray 489</a>. In the charge the jury were instructed that “the testimony of Mr. Ikeler, the district-attorney, is evidence only for the purpose of showing that Parr’s statement is not a fabrication of recent date, and not that the statement of Parr is true. That is for the jury to determine.” The refusal to strike out the evidence was justified by authority and proper instructions were given for its application.</p>
