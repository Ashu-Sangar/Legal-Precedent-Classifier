Smith 192, where the title to an act, in that case under consideration, set forth that it related to the liens of mechanics and others upon <em>leasehold </em>estates, and, in the body of the act, such liens were also given upon <em>freehold </em>estates, it was held that this latter part of the act was unconstitutional and void, because not mentioned in the title. As the language of the constitution, under which the abdve decision was made, is almost identical with that of our present one, we must regard the above-named case as decisive of the one in hand. And the argument is <em>a </em>fortiori, for, under the title of the act above mentioned, it might well be argued that, as it related to mechanics’ liens, there was something, in the general subject itself, which might have induced an examination of the body of the enactment by those interested, whilst, in that under consideration, there is nothing -which conveys the remotest hint that any inhabitant of Reserve township is at all interested therein. The words, “ An Act relative to grading, paving, curbing and otherwise improving Troy Hill road, <em>in the city of </em>Allegheny,” certainly notify all persons outside of the city limits, if of anything whatever, that the matters contained in the act of which they form the title, .do not affect them. If then it be true, as is said in the case cited, that the purpose of this part of the constitution is that members of the legislature, and all others interested, may have notice of the contemplated legislation, in order that such as is secret and unwise may be discovered and prevented, then, the act under consideration certainly comes within its prohibition and is of no effect as to all persons outside of the city of Allegheny. Reference has been made to the case of Blood v. Marcelliott, 3 P. F. Smith 391, as analogous to that now being considered; but it is not so. There the title was “ An Act to increase the boundaries of „Forest county,” and provision was made, in the body of the act, not only for the extension of ¡the boundaries, but also for the re-location of the county seat. No one, we think, will dispute but that this case carries the question therein discussed to the extreme of constitutional relaxation; in order, however, to make it analogous to the case under discussion <em>w-e </em>
