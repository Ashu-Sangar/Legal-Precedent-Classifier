The executor, as such, agreed in writing with B. to sell the same. Gr. had a mortgage for $4000 on the land, and the executor and B. agreed that Gr. should foreclose the mortgage and sell the land at sheriff’s sale, and that Gr. should hold it in his own name, and that it should remain in the hands of B. for sale, and when sold the debt of Gr. should be first paid, and the residue should go to the estate of A. The land was subsequently sold for $8000, and B. refused to account for the difference, on the ground that his agreement with the executor was not <em>qua </em>executor, hut with him for himself and children. Held, that the <em>question </em>whether B. was the agent of the executor, and whether the latter acted as the executor of the estate of his wife in the transaction, was properly left to the jury to determine.</p>

They sold plaintiff’s farm, and received the purchase-money. Both refused to give plaintiff' any explanation of the transaction. There was no alternative but to sue them both. On the trial of the cause, Beringer admitted that after the sheriff’s sale Guy left the farm in his hands for sale, just as it had been before, and offered in evidence á written article of agreement, in wdiich Guy agreed to convey the farm to him on the payment of his debt. It was then plain that the joinder of Guy as a defendant was a mistake, and that the action should have been against Beringer alone. The plaintiff’s counsel then moved the court to strike Guy’s name from the record. On the argument of the motion for a new trial it was contended that the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>did not remove Guy’s name from the record. The court, therefore, to remove all doubt, made an order amending it <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The Act of 12th of April 1858, 1 Purd.

    <p id="b226-10" data-blocks='[["BL_226.12",226,[269,1318,1177,510]]]'>On the trial of the cause it appeared that Guy was improperly joined; that the action should have been against Beringer alone. Thereupon the plaintiff below moved to amend by striking out the name of Guy as a defendant. The court then directed a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to him to be entered. This was clearly irregular and technically an error, nevertheless the case proceeded and went to the jury against Beringer alone. So far as the merits of the case were affected, it was tried as if the proper form of amendment had been entered of record. After verdict it was properly amended <em>nunc pro tune, </em>as of the date of the original application. The whole irregularity was thereby cured. The second assignment therefore falls with the fourth.</p>
    <p id="b226-11" data-blocks='[["BL_226.13",226,[271,1838,1176,562]]]'>The right of the defendant in error was based on the theory that Beringer acted as agent for the executor, and therefore for the benefit of the estate. There is abundant evidence that Beringer acted under some arrangement made with Davison Meanor, then executor. This is conceded by the plaintiff in error. He contends, however, that it was made with Davison for himself and children, and not with him as executor. If there was any evidence that in this arrangement Davison acted as executor, this question was properly submitted to the jury. We think there was evidence. By the will of the testator Davison was appointed executor, with power to sell the land, the'proceeds of which are in controversy. Before the sheriff’s sale he, as executor, entered into a contract with Beringer to sell the land for a commission on-the sale.</p>

Immediately after it was struck down to Guy, he said to Beringer and Davison Meanor, “ I bought it in, now I will put it back into your hands again.”</p>
    <p id="b227-6" data-blocks='[["BL_227.6",227,[225,631,1175,390]]]'>After Guy conveyed to the plaintiff in error he said to Meanor, “ I sold it to Mr. Beringer for that money because I knew him to be your agent; that is the reason I sold it to him.” Guy himself testified that at the time of the sheriff’s sale he did give several persons to understand 'that after he got his money the residue for which it might sell “should go to the benefit of the estate.” It is true he afterwards changed the language, for the “ benefit of these children.” Which was the true understanding, was properly left to the jury to determine.</p>
