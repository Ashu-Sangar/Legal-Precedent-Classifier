The sheriff’s proclamation for the election had been duly issued and advertised, designating the offices to be filled at the election; that of sheriff being one. Candidates had been nominated by both parties for election to the office of sheriff, and the political canvass nearly closed, when Powell, after an illness of a few hours’ duration, died. This was on the 14th day of October, and the election was to occur on the 2d day of November, .or within less than three weeks. The relator was appointed to fill the vacancy, and commissioned by the governor, as sheriff, his commission running according to its terms until the close of the next (the present) session of the legislature.</p>

This circumstance, it is argued, took from the electors of McKean county the power to elect a sheriff, because of the provisions of the new constitution, and the Act of May 15th 1874.

It then concludes with these words : ‘ But in any such case of vacancy in an elective office a person shall be chosen to said office at the next general election, unless the vacancy shall happen within three calendar months immediately preceding said election, in which case the election for said office shall be held at the second succeeding general election.’</p>

Powell created a vacancy within the meaning of sect. 8 of art. 4, the position of the relator is sustained. Before determining this point it is important to get at the exact sense in which the word is employed in this section ; it should be borne in mind that sects. 1 and 2 of art. 14, fix the terms of county officers, and provide for their election. • The whole subject, therefore, of the election and succession of all county officers, being thus distinctly provided for, we may safely conclude that such provisions as relate only to the filling of vacancies were intended to be auxiliary to, and not destructive of the provision of art. 14. With this thought in mind, let us now turn back to sect. 8, art. 4, and look once more at its words : ‘ But in any such case of vacancy in an elective office, persons shall be chosen to said office at the next general election.’</p>

Because a vacancy ought not to be filled <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>by ail election without time enough in which to select suitable candidates, and give general notice to electors that an officer is to be voted for, not ordinarily elected at that time. This construction leaves art. 14 to provide for the ordinary succession of official terms; and sect. 8 of art. 4, to provide for the extraordinary elections rendered necessary by the happening of a vacancy requiring to be filled by an election at another than the regularly triennial election. But, is the Act of 1874 capable of a construction in harmony with this view of the constitutional provisions ? It declares ‘ that in case of a vacancy happening by death, resignation, removal or otherwise, the governor shall appoint to fill the vacancy, where provision is not already made by the constitution or laws for filling it, and that the person so appointed shall continue in office till the first Monday of January next succeeding the first general election, which shall occur three or more months after the happening of such vacancy.’ The- title of this act shows that its purpose is simply ‘ to provide for the appointment of officers to fill vacancies in cases not otherwise provided for by the constitution or laws of this Commonwealth.’ It .was intended to carry out the provisions of sect. 8 of art. 4. If the view we have taken of that section be correct, then this Act of Assembly must be held to relate only to such cases of vacancy as require to be filled at another time than the regular or usual election for filling the office. A vacancy occurring at such time as "to be filled by the people without any departure from the rule of election' fixed by art. 14, is already ‘provided for.’ The case unprovided for at the passage of the act was the occurrence of a vacancy requiring to be filled at another than the usual time, of which all electors would have notice. The provision made for this case by the Act of 1874 is that such vacancy shall be filled at the first election occurring long enough after the vacancy arises to afford opportunity to make an intelligent choice. This time, is fixed at three months.</p>

If these consequences must follow when the death of the officer occurs three weeks before the election at which his successor should regularly be chosen, they must with equal certainty follow if the death occurs but one week or one day before the time for opening the polls. If the death of the incumbent works this serious change in the position of candidates and electors, so equally must his ‘ resignation or removal.’ It might happen, therefore, that the incumbent of a county office, becoming satisfied that his favorite candidate for the succession must be defeated, should resign on the eve of an election, thereby creating a vacancy, which the governor must fill, and so not only postpone the election for one year and secure an opportunity to fight the battle over, but by the appointment of his candidate by the governor to fill the vacancy, secure for him mean time, by this artifice, the very office that it had become apparent the people were not disposed to confer upon him, and when the second succeeding general election comes around, and the issue is again made up with another prospect of defeat, what could prevent the appointee from offering his resignation, and so creating another vacancy to bo filled by the governor, and postponing the election for another year ?

The true inquiry is whether under the constitution and laws of the state the governor, in filling a vacancy caused by death, can commission a sheriff for a term to last beyond the expiration of the term of the deceased officer. The argument of the relator fails to distinguish between the major power of the people to elect sheriffs, by way of regular succession, for fixed terms; and the minor power of the governor to fill a vacancy in an existing term. The second section of the 14th article of the new constitution declares that, “ county officers shall be elected at the general elections, and shall hold their offices for the term of three years, beginning on the first Monday of January next after their election, and until their successors shall be duly qualified ; all vacancies, not otherwise provided for, shall be filled in such manner as may be provided by law.” As the term is. fixed by the constitution to begin on the first Monday of January following the election, it is the clear constitutional right of the people to elect the successor of the incumbent of an existing term at the general election next preceding the expiration of his term; and if the successor does not qualify no vacancy takes place, but the existing term is extended until the successor is duly qualified. It is manifest, therefore, that the vacancy referred to in this section is one occurring in an existing term by death, removal, resignation or other cause, ívhich prevents the existing term being carried to its regular period of expiration. The appoinment to fill this vacancy, or intermediate period between the death and the period of the expiration, necessarily follows the nature of the vacancy. The constitution itself provides for the election of the sheriff in regular succession, and leaves no vacancy to be provided for as to him. When the successor is duly elected his term is fixed to begin on the first Monday of January following. It is clear, therefore, that the vacancy referred to in the section cannot refer to any portion of the new term which accrues under the constitution itself by regular election and by way of constitutional succession. It follows from this major requirement of the constitution, that the term vacancy used ill the 8th section of the 4th article, conferring power on the governor to fill vacancies, must have the same interpretation, so far as it relates to the office of sheriff, or other county elective offices under the 2d section of the 14th article, otherwise the two provisions would conflict. Such a conflict is unnecessary; for the general election referred to in the last clause of the 8th section of the 4th article can have no appropriate meaning without trenching upon the provisions of the 2d section of the 14th article. It says: “but in any such case of vacancy in an elective office, a person shall be chosen to <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>said office at the next general election, unless the vacancy shall happen within three calendar months immediately preceding such election, in which case the election for said office shall be hold at the second succeeding general election.” The true purpose of this provision is to preserve the popular right, and not to limit or destroy it. Without the provision for election, the appointment to fill the vacancy would run to the end of the term made vacant by death or other cause; hut with it, the right of the people to elect their officers takes effect at the next, or at the furthest, at the second succeeding general election. For example, if the sheriff die in the first year of his term and three months before the day of the general election, his successor will be chosen in the same year, or two years before the time fixed for the election of a successor in due and regular course of the constitutional arrangement of election to the office. If the incumbent die within three months of the election, then an election will take place one year in advance of the regular period. This is evidently the purpose of this part of the 8th section of the 4th article, and no conflict can arise between it and the 2d section of the 14th article. The true interpretation of the constitution being this, it is manifest that the Act of May 15th 1874 cannot change the constitutional provisions and extend a vacancy into the next regular term of office, and thereby defeat the popular right of election to fill the next regular term. That act, therefore, must have the same interpretation, and the right of appointment of the governor to fill a vacancy extends only to the period between the death of the incumbent and the beginning of the mew term by regular succession, under the provisions of the 2d section of the 14th article of the new constitution.</p>
