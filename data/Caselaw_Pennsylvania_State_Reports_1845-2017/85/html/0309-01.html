The defendant, by his counsel, contends that the action cannot be maintained in the form in which this suit was brought, and that raises a question of law for the court. By a careful examination of authorities, it seems that the sale by one of several joint owners of a chattel, denial of the rights of the other co-tenants, and exclusive use by the one having the chattel still in existence, have never been held sufficient to enable the excluded owner to maintain either trover or trespass. The principle on which a tenant in common cannot sue his co-tenant in trover or trespass is that he has another remedy, his right to take and use the chattel at all times when not actually occupied by the other, but this right ceases, and consequently a right of action accrues when the chattel is destroyed and trover or trespass lies. What constitutes destruction is an important legal question in this cause. The evidence tends to show that <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>tlie defendant, by his employees, drew out of the well the sucker-rods and tubing, and the greater part of the casing, part of it having become detached and remained in the well, and to show that he sold and otherwise disposed of those things, together with the boiler and engine, and nearly everything belonging to the well, against the wishes and protest of the plaintiffs, and that he sold the boiler for old junk, and if you find these facts to bo true, from the evidence, I instruct you, if you find also the allegations of the plaintiff to be true, that they were joint owners, as already explained of the chattel, it was equivalent to destruction of the property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b311-6" data-blocks='[["BL_311.6",311,[189,888,1183,1560]],["BL_312.1",312,[269,420,1172,173]]]'>“It is contended by the learned counsel of the plaintiffs, that selling the boiler for old junk, to be smelted in a furnace, was destruction of the engine and machinery, and everything belonging to the well; and here, I remark, the engine would cease to perform the wmrk for which it was designed by the owners of the well, and for which it was used; it could not operate without steam, and steam could not be raised without the boiler, and so you observe, for want of the boiler the engine and whole machinery and pumping apparatus inevitably stood still, and such I hold is destructive of the chattel. It is destruction for one tenant in common or joint tenant to take the exclusive possession of the chattel and appropriate it to a purpose not designed by the owners, against the protest of his co-tenants, denying to them the use of it and entirely refusing to apply it to the purposes for which it was held by both. This doctrine is taken from the language of Justice Lewis, in Agnew <em>v. </em>Johnson, 5 Harris 378: <em>‘ </em>When one misuses the joint property by appropriating the joint property to uses for -which it was not designed, and refuses to apply it to the purpose for which it was held by both, in such case trover can be maintained.’ I remark, that in case the one joint owner destroys such portion of the chattel as renders it useless and unfit for the purpose designed, it is equivalent to destruction of the chattel, and the design cannot be determined, as contended for by the learned counsel for the defendant. Ho contends it is the design of the working of the chattel that must govern in such case; that destruction consists in rendering the property wholly unfit for the purpose it was made. While the learned counsel of the plaintiffs contends it is the design of the purchasers and owners which rules the question. The latter position is clearly right; the maker of an engine or -boiler designs it either for his own use or for sale, while the purchaser designs it for his own use in the line of his business, and if one joint tenant thus destroys the chattel by rendering it useless for the purpose designed by the owners, and used by them, such is equivalent to destruction of the property in point of law. You will first take up the theory of the plaintiffs, and determine from the evidence how the issue formed by the allegations of the plain<a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>tiffs, on the one hand, and the allegations of the defendant on the other hand is. If you find the theory of the plaintiffs to he true, they are entitled to recover the value of one-fourth of the chattel so destroyed, with interest from the time of the destruction.”</p>

Where the defendant is a joint owner with him of a chattel, the right of each to the possession is equal, and therefore for the mere detention by one joint owner the action cannot be sustained. Nor can it be sustained against the vendor for a mere sale of a chattel in which he was a joint owner, for such a sale passes to the vendee the individual interest only of the vendor. This rule, however, should be restricted to cases in which the property remains <em>in specie. </em>Hence, where a hogshead of rum was held in joint ownership, and one of the owners had sold it, presumptively at retail, he was held liable to his co-tenant in trover. This was because he had practically made the liquor irrecoverable. It was substantially a destruction of the property: Wilson <em>v. </em>Gibbs, <a href="/johns/3/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Johns. 175" data-case-ids="2129826" data-case-paths="/johns/3/0175-01">3 Johns. 175</a>. Where a joint owner destroys a chattel, trover will undoubtedly lie against him by his co-tenant. The question arises, what constitutes destruction in law ? The sale of the rum in the manner stated was held to be one form of destruction. That, however, is not the only mode of destroying a joint owner’s portion of the property. It was said in Agnew <em>v. </em>Johnson, 5 Harris 373, where one <em>misuses </em>the joint property by appropriating it to uses for which it was not designed, and refuses to apply it to the purposes <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>for -which, it was held by both, trover may be maintained. In the case now under consideration, the learned judge denied the right of the defendant in error to recover, unless a destruction of the property was proved. He charged substantially, that rendering the property wholly unfit for the use and purpose for which it was made, was destruction. In this he committed no error, if the evidence was sufficient to justify the submission of the fact to the jury. We think it was sufficient. •</p>

    <p id="b313-7" data-blocks='[["BL_313.7",313,[216,975,1175,520]]]'>The evidence tended to show that the plaintiff in error tore up and removed from the well all the machinery. He sold part of the'tubing, and caused the remainder of tho machinery to be taken to Butler county, and applied the same to his own private use. Subsequently he sold the boiler as old iron. If he thus stripped the well of all its working power, removed dismembered portions of the machinery into an adjoining county, and appropriated portions of it to other purposes than those for which it had been designed and used by the joint owners, and caused the identity of other portions to be destroyed, it was manifestly such a misuser of the property as practically to work a destruction of the interest of the defendant in error. Judgment affirmed.</p>
