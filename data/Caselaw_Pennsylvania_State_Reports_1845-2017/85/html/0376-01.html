Miller; that at the time of making said note by said decedent there was delivered to the said plaintiff (as appears from the contract, a copy of which is filed by the said plaintiff, and which was also made part of defendant’s affidavit), fifty shares of the capital stock of the United Savings Bank of Pittsburgh, as collateral security for the payment of the same, which said shares of stock were, according to the contract, to be sold in default of the payment of said note at maturity, and the proceeds thereof applied to the payment of said note, and should any deficiency then remain unpaid said signer was to be liable for the deficiency; that at the time of delivery of said note the said shares of stock were of far greater value than the amount of said debt, to wit: of the par value of $5000, and the said plaintiff below still holds the same, as it does not appear from any allegation by the said plaintiff that the said stock has been sold as required by said contract. Defendant believes that she is not legally liable on said note, as said plaintiff has failed to comply with the terms thereof, and at all events she would only be liable for the deficiency, if any there bo, after the sale of the stock left as collateral and application of proceeds to the payment of said note, and defendant below claimed credit therefor, which she also claimed in case said stock, or any part thereof, be sold.”</p>

    <p id="b378-9" data-blocks='[["BL_378.13",378,[263,1155,1178,650]]]'>In the supplemental affidavit of defence, it was alleged in specific terms that the loan for the amount of which the note in suit was given, had been carried along by David Davis, the father of the defendant, for two years, at ten per cent, interest. The note signed by her was the renewal of one which appears to have been the last of a series given by the father for the purchase-money of stock of The United Savings Bank. The whole series of notes applied to and secured the same debt. The cases collected in Campbell <em>v. </em>Sloan, 12 P. F. Smith 481, unite in deciding with unmistakable emphasis that the taint of usury cannot be eradicated by the substitution of one security or one set of securities for another, so long as the original debt survives. The excess of interest for four months only was abated at the entry of the judgment. The defendant had the right to set up the excess of interest paid by her father against the plaintiff’s claim.</p>

While the use of indirect means by the officers of the bank may be understood to be charged, the facts are stated so vaguely that it would be premature now to discuss any questions to which they may possibly give rise. These questions can be developed in a trial in the Common Pleas, for the purposes of which the record is sent back.</p>
