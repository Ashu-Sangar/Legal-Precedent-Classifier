Edgar Thomson having in his lifetime become the purchaser of two thousand shares of the stock of the “ Pennsylvania Company,” of the value of $100,000, caused the said shares to be transferred on the books of the company to Miss Charlotte E. Foster, the plaintiff in this case. The certificates were made out in her name, and retained in the possession of Mr. Thomson, where they were found after his death, enclosed in an envelope, which was superscribed in his own handwriting, “ J. Edgar Thomson,” and in one corner of the envelope, also in his handwriting, the words, “ Miss C. E. Foster.” The certificates bear date April 1st 1874. Mr. Thomson died May 27th 1874, leaving no child or lineal descendants. His personal estate was inventoried at $1,222,406.04, besides which he left real estate valued at $300,000. Miss Foster was an orphan niece of Mr. Thomson’s wife. At his request she came to reside in his family when she was under fourteen years of age, and continued to reside with him until the time of his death, being treated by him (as is alleged in the bill and not denied in the answer) as his own child, and with the greatest tenderness and affection. On the 20th of December 1871, Mr. Thomson made his will, by which he gave and bequeathed his real and personal estate to trustees for charitable uses, first, however, reserving out of the proceeds so much as his <em>“ </em>beloved wife may deem necessary for the maintenance of herself and his dear niece, Charlotte F. Foster,” and certain other sums for the payment of legacies bequeathed by his will. On the 24th of May 1874, he made a codicil to his will, in which he declared: “I desire my dear niece, Lottie Foster, but to whom I cherish the feelings of a father, to be so treated and regarded in the law as if she were really my <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>child, receiving, during her lifetime, such income from my estate as if she were really my child, and I postpone the operation of the trusts of my will, so as fully to effect this result, until her decease, upon which event they are further to take full effect, as expressed in the will.” On the 26th of May 1874, he added another codicil, in which he declared as follows : “ The codicil which I added to my will the other night (May 24th) means that T wish my niece, Charlotte F. Foster, to be considered as my daughter, and to take out of the income of my estate all that she requires to render her more than comfortable in her housekeeping during her lifetime. I do not desire to postpone by it the operation of the trusts of my will except so far as may be necessary to secure the above object.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b86-8" data-blocks='[["BL_86.8",86,[279,978,1184,1038]]]'>“ It is to be observed at the outset that here was a complete, perfect and absolute transfer of the legal title to Miss Poster. The shares were transferred to her on the books of the company, by direction of the owner, and new certificates were taken out. in her name. The plaintiff stands in no need of legal or equitable remedies to complete her legal title. The only relief which she needs and prays for, is that her title be relieved from the claims of the administrators and trustees of Mr. Thomson’s estate, and that the bonds into which the shares were converted by her own agency, be surrendered to her. It is not the case, therefore, of an incomplete voluntary gift, or of a merely equitable title to a chose in action, acquired by an assignment which remains in the possession of the assignor. A gift of a chattel is not consummated and perfected until the delivery of the thing promised, and until then the party may revoke his promise. So also an assignment of a chose in action <em>(e. g., </em>a bond: Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Streeper, 25 P. F. Smith 147; or a policy of insurance: Trough’s Estate, 25 Id. 115; or a single bill: Pringle <em>v. </em>Pringle, 9 Id. 281; or a certificate of deposit: Withers <em>v. </em>Weaver, 10 Barr 391), where the assignor retains possession of the chose, or of the assignment, passes no title to the assignee or donee ; and the reason is that the retention of the chose, or of the assignment, is unmistakable evidence that the assignor, whatever his future intentions might be, has not parted with his property in the thing over which he retains entire control.</p>

And the result would have been the same if he had given her a parol assignment of them without valuable consideration, still retaining the shares in his own name, unless, indeed, circumstances could be shown amounting to a declaration of trust on his part to hold them for her use. But here the gift is complete <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>by the delivery of the thing itself, for transferring the shares to her upon the hooks of the company is putting her in complete possession of the thing assigned, and clothing her with the complete legal title. It stands in the place of a delivery. Such an act performs precisely the office which an actual delivery would perform if it were a chattel. It is as complete a delivery as the nature of the thing will admit of. There can be no clearer evidence of a design to part with the right of property in favor of another than an absolute transfer of the legal title to her for her own use. Retaining in his possession the certificates which are in her name, and which lie could not use without her consent, cannot undo or qualify the decisive ownership with which he had invested her by the actual transfer to her on the books of the company. The best evidence of her ownership is the transfer on the books of the company. The certificates were but secondary evidence of her ownership, and only useful for purposes of transfer. They were nothing more than the official declaration by the. company of what already appeared on their hooks. There was here no <em>locus poenitentice. </em>He could not have used the certificates, nor could any one have used them except Miss Eoster.</p>

The presumption of such a resulting trust is always rebutted, where, to use the language of the books, the purchase may fairly be deemed to be made for another, from motives of natural love and affection. Thus a purchase in the name of a child or of a wife is uniformly held by the unaided force of the relationship alone to rehut the presumption, unless there he clear evidence to show that the donee was intended to be a mere trustee. It would be a useless waste of time to go over the cases establishing this doctrine. They have been industriously collected in the paper book of the plaintiff’s counsel and are familiar to the profession. The doctrine is too well established to admit of the least doubt. It is not controverted by the defendants’ counsel; but it is contended that the presumption of a resulting trust cannot be rebutted in the present case because the donee is not related by blood to the donor. <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>Yet the ordinary case of a gift to a wife shows conclusively that blood is not a necessary ingredient to give effect to the presumption rebutting such a trust. The presumption in favor of a wife or child, which rebuts the resulting trust, is doubtless founded on the moral obligation which rests on the donor to provide for them, and the inference which arises therefrom, that it was the intention of the donor thus to provide for them, and that they should not hold as trustees. But why may not the presumption also arise where these relationships do not exist, if there is clear evidence to show that such was the manifest intention of the donor ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[263,846,1182,694]]]'>“ It is quite clear that other circumstances and other relations in life, besides the relationship of parent and child, or husband and wife, may sufficiently rebut the presumption of a resulting trust. Thus a gift to a sister: Kiddill <em>v. </em>Farnell, 5 Weekly Reporter 424; a grandmother to grandchildren: Gardner <em>v. </em>Merritt, <a href="/md/32/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="32 Md. 78" data-case-ids="1772607" data-case-paths="/md/32/0078-01">32 Md. 78</a>; 10 Am.

Now whether there is, or is not, a resulting trust, must, as was said by Lord Hardwicke in Hill <em>v. </em>The Bishop of London, 1 Atk. 618, always depend upon the intention of the grantor. As the presumption which arises in favor of a wife or child is founded exclusively upon the intention of the grantor inferred from the relationship, it would be extremely illogical to hold that a like presumption could not be derived from other circumstances clearly showing the same intention, and especially from proof of the express and deliberately declared wishes of the grantor.</p>

There is, no doubt, a great deal in blood, as indicating the intention with which such an act as this is done. But there is also a great deal in the fact that a childless man takes to his home and heart an orphan child — a near relation of his wife, and dependent upon him for support — and plants her there in the place of a daughter, treats her in all respects as a daughter, and in one of the most solemn acts of his life declares that, in measuring her legal rights, he desires her to bo considered, in all respects, as if she were really his daughter. It would bo a mockery of reason, and an unjust perversion of a wholesome principle, to apply the presumption of a resulting trust, because she is not a child, when the author of the gift so solemnly and so emphatically declares that he desires her ‘ to be treated and regarded in law as if she were really his child.’ The principle which raises a resulting trust where there is a conveyance to a stranger, or where there is not evidence of a manifest intent that the grantee should take as a beneficiary, is a principle founded in wise and just considerations ; but it is not to bo applied indiscriminately, or where there are facts and circumstances which fairly rebut it.</p>
