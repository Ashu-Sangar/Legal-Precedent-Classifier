The credit side was made up of some sixty disbursements, and showed a balance in the hands of the accountants of $352.32. Among these items on the credit side was a bond of Joel Bedell for $2834.83. As Joel Bedell was insolvent, they claimed credit for this amount as not collectable. Joel Bedell claimed, however, that it was paid and that he had the mortgage securing its payment receipted by his father, Andrew Bedell, Sr.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b398-12" data-blocks='[["BL_398.12",398,[269,1408,1176,773]]]'>In the inventory was also included the balance of a mortgage of A. W. Bedell to Andrew Bedell, Sr., dated June 20th 1867, for $4000, in four equal annual payments from April 1st 1867, with interest, on which had been paid, April 1st 1869, to the decedent $3400, which was receipted on the mortgage. The mortgagor had paid to divers persons, moneys for the decedent in his lifetime, and held the receipts for the same, but they had never been credited on the mortgage. These credits, the other administrator, on the 3d of April 1875, receipted on the mortgage as of their proper dates. They amounted in all, leaving out the $3400 receipted on mortgage, and receipt for $100 of interest paid, to the sum of $310.76 ; this left still a balance of said mortgage unpaid. On August 20th 1875, after decedent’s death and letters of administration, the mortgagor paid to Charles Percival $1180, the amount due him by Andrew Bedell, Sr., his former guardian; of this sum, $903.23 was applied to paying the residue of said mortgage, which was then satisfied by the co-administrator and the balance applied to a note of A. W. Bedell.</p>

He remained there until after the death of Mr. Bedell, without any new contract having been made. He now claimed for extra services in nursing Mr. Be-dell, who required more and more attention, and towards the last had to be assisted in and out of bed frequently, day and night. The greater part of the attendance was given by Mrs. Bedell and Mr. and Mrs. McKown, who were at times assisted by neighbors. The mind of Mr. Bedell had become enfeebled for some time before his death, and his sickness was of a very extraordinary character. The services which Mr. and Mrs. McKown were required to perform in nursing, were not such as could have been anticipated when they made the original arrangements to take care of Mr. and Mrs. Bedell. Mr. McKown could not have made a new arrangement, owing to the mental condition of Mr. Bedell, and it would have been inhuman, under the circumstances, to have left with his family. JDr. Shaffer testified that he would not have done the nursing for $3 per day during the year he attended Mr. Bedell; and the five months which followed must have been still more difficult.</p>

They also disallowed the commissions on the $310.76 and $903.23, receipted on the mortgage, for the reason that they were not proper subjects of charge and discharge in the administration account, thus surcharging the accountants on their claim of $339.27 for services, the sum of $202.63, leaving them for said services $136.54. They also surcharged the administrators, $160.93 on the $550 paid for gravestones as a preferred debt, and $14.64 on $50 paid McKown on his claim, and made a decree accordingly.</p>

      <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>The first assignment is, that “ the court erred in not allowing the administrators the sum of $339.27, which they claimed for their whole services, and in reducing the same to $136.54.” In their account, the appellants made no claim for compensation or services, as such. They claimed “ credit for their commissions on the debit side of their account, five per cent, on $6783.43.” This sum included the bond of Joel Bedell $2834.83, for which they took credit as uncollected, for the reason that the obligor was insolvent. The court, however, found that the bond had been paid in the lifetime of the intestate. It also included payments made by A. <em>W. </em>Bedell, one of the appellants, on his own mortgage, during the lifetime of his father, amounting to $1213.90. These payments were credited after his father’s death and fully satisfied the mortgage. The learned judge of the Orphans’ Court refused to allow the commissions claimed on these two sums, because, as he says, “ the former was not administered at all, and the latter were not legitimate subjects of charge and discharge in the administration account;” and then he adds, “ administrators may be allowed for adjusting a balance, but commissions on credit or set-off is not the proper measure of compensation, and especially is this so when one of the administrators is the debtor, as in the present case.” The court was clearly right in reducing the amount on which commissions were charged. There was no claim for adjusting balances, or for compensation generally, nor does it appear to us that there would have been just ground for allowing any in addition to the commissions on all the items that were proper subjects of charge and discharge in the account. The debit side of the account is composed of but two items in addition to the aggregate amount of the inventory; and a large portion of the credit side of the account .is made up of the items of credit which were applied to the satisfaction of the mortgage, and to the note of one of the appellants.</p>

They had paid general creditors of the estate, in full, to the amount of $903.40 and $50 to James McKown on account of his claim. McKown was the only claimant on the fund for distribution, and inasmuch as there was not sufficient actually in the hands of the accountants to pay him in full, he was entitled to his distributive share of the whole fund, including that which had been paid out. In order to give him this, it was necessary to ascertain the per centum that each creditor would have been entitled to receive, if none of them had been paid, and charge the accountants with the excess paid to creditors over their pro rata shares. The principle on which this was done was entirely correct, but the clerk, by mis<a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>take, included in Ms schedule of surcharges, the excess on the §50 paid to McKown. The effect of this was to give Mm the $50 entire and Ms pro rata on the residue of his claim, when he is only-entitled to a dividend on the whole. This dividend, after deducting the §50 paid on account, is found to be $797.09.</p>
