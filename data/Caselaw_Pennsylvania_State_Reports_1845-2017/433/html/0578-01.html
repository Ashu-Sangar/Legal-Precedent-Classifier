Hibbs carried on these activities under the name “Ben Reed” in the following surreptitious manner. All business was conducted through the mail addressed to a post office <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>box in Bala-Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Each month the tenants sent their rent to “Ben Reed” at that box. All complaints, including those concerning the lack of vital services such as heat and water, had to be sent through the mail, with the accompanying delays. The only available method by which the tenants could pay their rent or register their complaints was by resorting to this impersonal procedure. Although Hibbs maintained an insurance brokerage office, he stated that nothing in connection with his real estate activities was transacted at this office. Appellants, in order to publicize what they considered to be the deplorable activities of Hibbs and the manner in which he operated, conducted informational picketing at his home. After hearing, the lower court granted a preliminary injunction restraining the picketing. Certain of the picketers have taken an appeal to this Court. • ■</p>
    <p id="b628-4" data-blocks='[["BL_628.4",628,[214,1313,1152,486]]]'>Because of the secretive manner in which Hibbs was conducting his real estate business there was no other place to effectively communicate his activities. Under the circumstances, the residence is not an unreasonable situs to picket. When a landlord conducts his business in a manner to avoid detection and' not at a regular place of business, informational picketing may not be enjoined for the sole reason that tenants and others resorted to picketing the landlord’s home.</p>

    <p id="b629-8" data-blocks='[["BL_629.10",629,[191,1350,1149,758]]]'>I fully agree with the result reached by the majority opinion. I believe it must be emphasized, however, that because as the majority properly points out, “this is not a true case of residential picketing” (since no other place was available where appellants could effectively communicate), the question of to what extent purely residential picketing may be proscribed is not before us. Thus while the majority opinion correctly holds that residential picketing is permissible where no other alternative is available, it should <em>not </em>be read as authority for the converse proposition, i.e., that residential picketing may be enjoined merely if another nonresidential picketing situs can be effectively utilized.</p>
