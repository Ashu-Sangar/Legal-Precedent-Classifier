However, we must determine initially tbe argument raised in appellee’s supplemental brief that tbe Superior Court’s power in this regard is not properly before our Court in that tbe question was never raised in tbe Superior Court, never raised in tbe petition for an allowance of appeal, and <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>only first mentioned at the suggestion of members of this Court.</p>
    <p id="b511-3" data-blocks='[["BL_511.4",511,[143,465,1150,984]]]'>Appellee is correct in its observation that under most circumstances, matters not raised in the court below and not raised on appeal will not be considered in finally deciding a case on appeal. Notwithstanding this general proposition, there are situations wherein certain questions can be raised at any time, either on the suggestion of the parties involved or by the court <em>sua sponte. </em>Here we are confronted with a question as to the power of the Superior Court, which in our view may at any time be considered by the court on its own motion. In other words, if the Superior Court lacked the power or authority to reduce the revocation penalty imposed by the lower court, its action in doing so would be void and consequently subject to review at this stage in the proceedings. This is nothing more than an attack on the Superior Court’s subject matter jurisdiction to review the subject of reducing penalties imposed by a lower court.</p>

The Liquor Code, Act of September 15, 1961, as amended, P. L. 1325, 47 P.S. §4-471, provides in pertinent part as follows: “. . . Upon appeal, the court so appealed to shall, <em>in the exercise of its discretion, sustain, reject, alter or modify the findings, conclusions and penalties of the board, based on the findings of fact and conclusions of law as found by the court. </em>The aforesaid appeal shall act as a supersedeas unless upon sufficient cause shown the court shall determine otherwise.

This section has been interpreted to permit a lower court to change the penalty imposed by the Board only when it has made significant and material changes in the findings of the Board. <em>Ashlar Club Liquor License Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/203/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="203 Pa.

Similarly, the Superior Court has no power to reverse the imposition of a penalty when the lower court has materially changed the findings and in the exercise of its discretion imposes the same penalty as the Board.</p>

The mere fact that each individual judge both on the Superior Court and this Court might have imposed a less severe penalty had he been the trial judge below, is not sufficient to permit a higher tribunal to substitute its judgment for the judgment of the lower tribunal. In the instant case had the Board omitted the alleged violation that the licensed organization was not a <em>bona fide </em>club, the court below as well as the Superior Court would have been powerless to modify the penalty imposed no matter how harsh or severe. <em>Maple Liquor License Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/207/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="207 Pa.

While the lower court under the statute as interpreted by case authority may reduce the penalty imposed by the Board when material changes in the findings of the Board are made, we find no sound, judicious reason why an appellate court should be permitted to review the penalty imposed by the lower court. If we were to hold otherwise, litigants could appeal solely on the basis that the penalty was too harsh or too lenient, a result of which undoubtedly would overburden an already overburdened appellate court system.</p>

Each cita<a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>tion issued by the Board constitutes separate and distinct violations, and if the lower court fails to make any material changes in the findings by the Board with respect to one citation, the Board’s penalty of revocation must stand. Since, in the instant case, all of the Board’s findings with respect to the first citation were sustained by the lower court, the Superior Court had no authority to modify the penalty of revocation. Even if the lower court had made significant changes in the findings of the Board, only the lower court, in the exercise of its discretion had the power to modify the penalty, which discretion, in our view, once exercised is not reviewable by the Superior Court.</p>

However, <em>Club Oasis </em>as well as the other cases relied upon by the Superior Court and appellee involve the grant or. refusal of a license and not as in the instant case a revocation proceeding. Under the licensing provisions of the Liquor Code, Act of April 12, 1951, P. L. <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>90, 47 P.S. §4-464, the lower court is empowered to hear an application for a license <em>“de novo </em>on questions of fact, administrative discretion and such other matters as are involved.” This has been correctly interpreted as limiting the lower court’s review to the question of the Board’s abuse of discretion. Under those circumstances, it is clear the Board is required to produce all that which it considered so as to provide the court on appeal with a better insight on the question of abuse of discretion.</p>
    <p id="b515-4" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[153,921,1154,1424]]]'>The revocation provision under the Liquor Code differs substantially from the licensing provision with respect to the lower court’s scope of review. It provides in essence that the court on appeal “shall, in the exercise of <em>its </em>discretion, sustain, reject, alter or modify the findings, conclusions and penalties of the board, based on the findings of fact and conclusions of law as <em>found by the court.” </em>(Emphasis supplied). Act of September 15, 1961, as amended, P. L. 1325, 47 P.S. §4-471. Pursuant to this section the lower court on appeal is required to hold hearings <em>de novo, </em>make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law and then in the exercise of <em>its own </em>discretion either sustain, reverse, or modify the action taken by the Board. The court is in no way limited either by statute or by case authority to a review of the Board’s discretion, but rather makes a completely independent determination of all facets of the case in rendering its own decision. The only limitation placed upon the court is in the area of imposing penalties when no material changes are made in the findings of the Board. Therefore, it is obvious that the examiner’s report and recommendations are completely unnecessary and irrelevant in aiding the court in rendering its decision and hence need not be made part of the record by the Board on appeal in revocation cases.</p>

    <p id="b517-4" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[144,806,1154,1369]]]'>It appears to be basing its conclusion on one of two possible erroneous assumptions. First it states that “. . . if the Superior Court lacked the power or authority to reduce the revocation penalty imposed by the lower court, its action in doing so would be void and consequently subject to review at this stage of the proceedings.” However it is not disputed that the Superior Court had the power to hear an appeal in this type of case. Act of September 15, 1961, P. L. 1325, §1, as amended, 47 P.S. §4-471. The situation here comes precisely within the doctrine which this Court just recently reaffirmed in <em>Tops Apparel Manufacturing Co. v. Rothman, </em><a href="/pa/430/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="430 Pa. 583" data-case-ids="1915719" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0583-01">430 Pa. 583</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20436" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="244 A.2d 436">244 A. 2d 436</a> (1968) (quoting <em>Jones Memorial Baptist Church v. Brackeen, </em><a href="/pa/416/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="416 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1892958" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0599-01">416 Pa. 599</a>, 602, <a href="/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20861" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="207 A.2d 861">207 A. 2d 861</a>, 863 (1965)) : “The test ... is the competency of the court to hear and determine controversies of the general class to which the case presented for consideration belongs. The question is whether the court has power to enter into the inquiry and not whether it is able to grant the relief sought in the particular case.” Since the Act of 1961 clearly states: “The licensee or the board may . . . file an appeal therefrom to the Superior Court” there can be no doubt that subject matter jurisdiction was properly vested in the Superior Court.</p>

This is wrong. If we assume that the Superior Court had the power in “rare and unusual circumstances” then this appeal differs in no material way from hundreds of others wherein it is not questioned that the court below had the power to decide the question before it, but only whether they exercised that power in conformity with current statutory and judicial standards. If the new concept which the majority advances becomes the rule, any issue whether or not raised, below or presented in the statement of questions involved, could be raised before this Court on appeal with a mere allegation that because the lower court incorrectly decided a case it <em>also </em>violated its subject matter jurisdiction. Such a result would destroy all the procedural framework this Court has so carefully established to limit its decision-making to those issues properly presented to the court below. It would drastically and unwisely change and adversely affect practices governing litigation, advocacy and the decisional process in both the trial and appellate courts.</p>
