    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.8",312,[217,866,1155,596]]]'>The plaintiffs are owners of properties in Delaware County. The properties are located near the Philadelphia International Airport which is owned and operated by the City of Philadelphia. Plaintiffs allege that the Airport is partially located in Delaware County and that certain flight patterns utilized by planes using the Airport are causing a dangerous menace and nuisance to their properties and lives. They ask that these flight patterns be enjoined. They also seek to enjoin the construction of a new runway, part of which is located in Delaware County.</p>
    <p id="b312-7" data-blocks='[["BL_312.9",312,[213,1475,1156,376]],["BL_313.1",313,[224,358,1145,99]]]'>The Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule No. 2103(b) provides that: “An action against á political subdivision may be brought in and <em>only in </em>the county in which the political subdivision is located.” (Emphasis added.) But the plaintiffs argue that since the City of Philadelphia owns and uses the property located in Delaware County, it (the City of Philadel<a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>phia) is therefore located in Delaware County. We reject this reasoning.</p>
    <p id="b313-3" data-blocks='[["BL_313.4",313,[223,470,1146,484]]]'>The ownership of Delaware County land by the City of Philadelphia does not cause the political subdivision of Philadelphia to be located in Delaware County. Rule 2103(b) speaks of political subdivisions, not geographical or record-title subdivisions. The very service or process on the City of Philadelphia in this action indicates that the political subdivision known as Philadelphia is independent of and distinct from Delaware County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[220,968,1147,818]]]'>Rule 2103(b) says that “an action against a political subdivision may be brought <em>in and only in the County </em>(not the counties) in which the political subdivision is located.” (Emphasis added.) By implication, a political subdivision, as the term is used in Rule 2103(b), can be located in only one county. And the fact and extent of land ownership are not the deciding factors in locating a political subdivision. Quite to the contrary, a political subdivision is an area set out by the lines of governmental powers and jurisdiction. Philadelphia is governmentally impotent in Delaware County, and the clear intent of Rule 2103(b) is to place proper venue of a suit against a county in and only in the area or jurisdiction where it exercises governmental power.</p>

Congressional control begins with a construction of the ground facilities and ends with complete detailed supervision of flight operations, and is applicable to both commercial and private flying. It is not difficult to imagine the confusion and danger that would result from local regulation. Thus I can see no cause of action stated against the City of Philadelphia. If, however, this complaint is in the nature of securing recompense for a taking of property, <em>Gardner v.
