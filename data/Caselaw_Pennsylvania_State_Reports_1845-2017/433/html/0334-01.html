On appeal, the Superior Court remanded the matter for the appointment of <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>counsel and for an evidentiary hearing. Counsel was appointed, the hearing was held, and relief was denied. The Superior Court affirmed, and we are now faced with petitioner’s <em>pro se </em>petition for allocatur. In <em>Commonwealth v. Hickox, </em><a href="/citations/?q=438%20Pa.%20144" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="438 Pa. 144">438 Pa. 144</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=249%20A.2d%20777" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="249 A.2d 777">249 A. 2d 777</a> (1969) in response to a <em>pro se </em>petition for allocatur, we directed that counsel appointed for petitioner proceed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 318(c) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. That Rule, which pre-dated the Post Conviction Hearing Act, A.ct of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. §1180-1 et seq., is applicable only to direct appeals. We hold that §12 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act, 19 P.S. §1180-12, requiring the appointment of counsel under certain circumstances, places an obligation on counsel so appointed to represent a petitioner throughout the Post Conviction Hearing proceedings. We conclude that petitioner’s right to counsel in a Post Conviction Hearing matter is just as broad as a defendant’s right to counsel on direct appeal.</p>
