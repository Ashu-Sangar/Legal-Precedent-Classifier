    <p id="b130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_130.5",130,[194,1093,1155,1146]]]'>Appellant’s evidence consisted primarily of the testimony of persons who knew personally either the decedent or the appellant or both. Mrs. Sadie Lagodich, appellant’s first cousin and a native of the Soviet Union, was examined by deposition in Hartford, Connecticut. She testified that she personally knew appellant, that she knew that appellant had married the decedent and that she knew where they lived after the marriage. She could not remember when they were married; she was not actually present at the marriage ceremony. She remembered that the couple had three or four children. Mrs. Lagodich returned to Russia for a visit in 1929, and at that time she talked with appellant. In the course of her visit she was informed that all the children of appellant and decedent had died during World War I. Appellant spoke of her husband and the fact that she was now living alone. She asked Mrs. Lagodich to contact her husband when she returned to the United States. Mrs. Lagodich has not seen nor heard from the decedent since 1915 in Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>

Mrs. Lagodich recently sent some items to the appellant and the niece wrote back that appellant had received the items. A recent letter from the niece indicated that appellant was aware that her husband had been killed.</p>
    <p id="b131-4" data-blocks='[["BL_131.4",131,[177,705,1155,1150]]]'>The auditor found that Mrs. Lagodich’s testimony was “confused and uncertain.” On the contrary, we find that her testimony is remarkably consistent. Mrs. Lagodich, who was 70 years old when she testified, was questioned about events which transpired 50 years ago. It is not surprising that she has forgotten some details. She remembers clearly the facts which are important for the resolution of this case. The fact that she cannot remember when the couple was married and that she did not attend the wedding are of little consequence. What is important is that she knew both appellant and the decedent and knew that they were, in fact, married. It is important to note that the auditor did not question the credibility of Mrs. Lagodich but merely the probative weight of her testimony. While the auditor must determine the credibility of the witnesses <em>(Dettra Will, </em><a href="/pa/415/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="415 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1891828" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0197-01">415 Pa. 197</a>, 202, <a href="/citations/?q=202%20A.2d%20827" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="202 A.2d 827">202 A. 2d 827</a> (1964); <em>Patterson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/237/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="237 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="988951" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0024-01">237 Pa. 24</a>, 27, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.%2075" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="85 A. 75">85 Atl. 75</a> (1912)), an appellate court is certainly in as good a position as the auditor to judge the probative weight of evidence given by deposition.</p>

He was aware of the marriage of the decedent, but it is not clear whether he actually knew the appellant. Mr. Krepinevieh testified that decedent had only one child who died during the War. When asked about Mrs. Lagodich’s testimony, Mr. Krepinevieh testified that decedent had told <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>Mm that his wife had remarried and had other children by her second and third husbands.</p>
    <p id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[194,486,1154,976]]]'>The auditor places much weight on this inconsistency between the testimony of Mrs. Lagodich and Mr. Krepinevich. The apparent inconsistency is of no consequence, however. Both parties testified that decedent married the appellant and that there are no surviving children of the marriage. Mr. Krepinevich did not testify that decedent and the appellant were divorced. “Upon proof of a valid marriage, the law presumes that such marriage <em>continues </em>until the death of one of the parties (actual or presumptive after seven years) or a divorce is proven.” <em>Watt Estate, </em><a href="/pa/409/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="409 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="1883179" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0044-01">409 Pa. 44</a>, 51, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20781" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="185 A.2d 781">185 A. 2d 781</a> (1962). Both parties have testified to the fact of the marriage, and Mrs. Lagodich has testified that the appellant survived her husband. Therefore, absent proof of a divorce, there is a presumption that the appellant was still married to her husband at the time of his death. There is no evidence whatsoever in the record that there was a divorce.</p>

Appellant testified that she married the decedent in 1904, that they had four children, two of whom died before decedent left Russia in 1912 and two of whom died after he left Russia. She stated that she corresponded regularly with her husband until 1960, and the address she gave corresponded with the decedent’s address at <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>the time of his death.

    <p id="b135-4" data-blocks='[["BL_135.6",135,[166,468,1143,153]]]'>I agree with the majority that appellant has proved that she is the widow and heir of the decedent. However, I disagree as to the consequences which follow.</p>
    <p id="b135-5" data-blocks='[["BL_135.7",135,[159,634,1150,1701]],["BL_136.1",136,[198,359,1153,154]]]'>The majority would award the widow only $10,-000.00 and the one-half of the estate to which she is entitled under §2(3) of the Intestate Act, Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 80, §2, 20 P.S. §1.2. That provides that where there is no issue, the widow gets $10,000.00 plus one-half the balance. However, §2(4) provides that where the decedent is survived by no issue, parent, brother, sister, child of a brother or sister, grandparent, uncle or aunt, then the widow is entitled to the entire estate. The majority would deny the widow the balance of the estate on the ground that she failed to prove that no parent, brother, sister, child of a brother or sister, grandparent, uncle or aunt survived the decedent. I can see no reason whatsoever for placing this burden on appellant. It is in accordance with no sensible theory of allocation of the burden of proof. It requires appellant to prove a negative. It requires her to prove facts about which she may have no way of knowing. If it be replied that the Commonwealth likewise has no means of knowing these facts, the absurdity of the majority position becomes manifest. The Commonwealth would have no way of knowing because it is not even a proper disputant as to these funds. The dispute is between the widow and all the other relatives, if there are any. It must be presumed that if these existed, they would have come forward. The proof of their existence was indeed peculiarly within their knowledge. They would be proving a positive. It makes no sense at all to give a portion of the estate to the Commonwealth because the widow did not prove the nonexistence of relatives who, if they had existed, <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>would have .been entitled to that portion. Either the widow gets it, or tbe relatives get it. They have not claimed it, so she is entitled to it.</p>
    <p id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[195,524,1156,818]]]'>■ It is true that in <em>Bokey Estate, </em><a href="/pa/412/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="412 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="1887209" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0244-01">412 Pa. 244</a>, 250, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.2d%20194" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="194 A.2d 194">194 A. 2d 194</a> (1963), there is language to the effect that one more distant in relationship must prove the nonexistence of those closer. There it was an alleged first cousin who had not proven the nonexistence of brothers, sisters, or their issue. However, the language in that case was purely dictum inasmuch as the alleged first cousin had not proven that he was a first cousin and thus could not take regardless of the existence or nonexistence of other relatives. Aside from that dictum in <em>Bolcey, </em>no other case that I have found supports the utterly unjustifiable rule opted for by the majority. Since appellant has proved that she is the widow, and since there are no other relatives, claiming as heirs, I would award appellant the entire estate.</p>
