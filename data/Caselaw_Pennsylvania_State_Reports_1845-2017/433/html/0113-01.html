The question involved is whether lessees of property purchased by the Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh are entitled, <em>after the termination of their </em>leases, to business dislocation damages under Section 609 of the Eminent Domain Code of June 22, 1964, P. L. 84, 26 P.S. 1-609.</p>

The premises which they had occupied as lessees were purchased by the Parking Authority from the owners-lessors by <em>private negotiation and sale, </em>rather than by statutory condemnation. At the time of the sale to the Parking Authority, plaintiffs were lessees in possession of their respective leasehold interests. Each of them was permitted by the Authority to remain on his leased premises. until each of the leases had expired. Only when all the leases had terminated did the plaintiffs vacate the premises; the Parking Authority then caused the properties to be torn down a month later.</p>

The Authority is not mandated by any statute to proceed by condemnation, nor prohibited to acquire property by private purchase.

L. 84, §201, 26 P.S. §1-201 to mean “the owner of a property interest taken, injured or destroyed. . . .” This definition and the procedure provided in section 502(e)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> indicate that the <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>legislature intended a result other than that suggested by Justice Roberts’ concurrences. As noted in the Comment to section 502 by the Joint State Government Commission, the petition for appointment of viewers is the procedure available to one whose property has been injured even though no formal condemnation proceeding has been brought by the condemnor. This request for viewers is the historical method of determining whether one qualifies for compensation as a condemnee,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> and the Comment indicates that this method has not been disturbed by the Code. The function of the petition for appointment of viewers is to furnish a procedure by which a judicial determination can be made that a taking has or has not occurred. If it is determined that there has been a taking then the petitioner would qualify for relief if the taking is shown to be compensable.</p>
