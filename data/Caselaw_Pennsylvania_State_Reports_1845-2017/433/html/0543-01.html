Decedent’s signature and that of the one subscribing witness, Blanche Cline, were attacked as forgeries. A caveat to the probate of this writing was filed by the contestant with the Register of Wills and, after a hearing, the Register of Wills refused probate of the writing on the ground that it was a forgery. The proponent appealed this decree to the Orphans’ Court of Westmoreland County and, after a <em>de novo </em>hearing, that court held that the writing was not forged and directed the <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>Register of Wills to admit the writing to probate as decedent’s last will.

Present at that time and place were decedent, his two sisters and the proponent. The decedent’s other two sisters and the proponent’s husband and children were in another room at the time. According to the proponent, the conversation which led up to the preparation and execution of the will was inaugurated by Blanche Cline. The decedent allegedly stated that he was planning to give the home to his daughter, the contestant, <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>and what was left he would give to the proponent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The decedent requested the proponent to write a will and told her what he wanted; she wrote the will in her own language.

Boyle, Jr., a member of the Westmoreland County bar, stated that the decedent had told him that he wanted to give the house to the contestant and the rest of his realty to the proponent and that the contestant did receive the house.</p>
