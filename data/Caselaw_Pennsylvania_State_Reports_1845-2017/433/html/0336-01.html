In No. 445, appellant Leonard Arehambault, who is serving a life sentence following a conviction for first degree murder, filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act alleging that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a direct appeal. A hearing was held at which appellant’s trial counsel testified that he remembered appellant’s trial, that he had told appellant there was no possibility of securing relief through appeal, and that he warned appellant of the possibility of receiving the death penalty, rather than his present sentence of life imprisonment, should he be granted a new trial. The hearing judge chose to believe this account, notwithstanding appellant’s contrary recollection, and found that appellant had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right of appeal.</p>

He alleged that his withdrawal of a motion for a new trial (an essential prelude to an appeal) was involuntary because trial counsel told him (at the suggestion of the trial judge) that if he were successful in obtaining a new trial the district attorney would . . be free to ask the same penalty he did previously . . . the sentence of death in the event of your conviction.” The court below, after a full hearing, dismissed the petition, on the ground that the failure to make a motion for a new trial was voluntary.</p>

Act of February 15, 1870, P. L. 15, §1, 19 P.S. §1186. However, the Commonwealth argues that it is perfectly proper to establish as a condition to exercising that right, the implied agreement to waive all possible advantages which are part of the first conviction. But it does not require an especially vivid imagination to appreciate the unfortunate posture in which defendants are placed by this condition. The prisoner must decide whether to abandon his constitutional right to a fair trial and serve out his prison term under an invalid or unchallenged sentence, or exercise his statutory right to appeal in order to achieve his constitutional right to a fair trial, at the risk that his second <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>trial might result in the imposition of the death penalty..

The Court held that “whatever may be said of Congress’ objectives [in passing such a provision], they cannot be pursued by means that needlessly chill the exercise of basic constitutional rights.” The Supreme Court explained'that‘“[t] he inevitable effect of such a provision, is of course, to discourage assertion of the Fifth Amendment right not to plead guilty and to deter exercise of the Sixth Amendment right to demand a jury trial. If the provision had no other purpose or effect than to chill the assertion of constitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to exercise them, then it would be patently unconstitutional.”</p>

Here, the price exacted for the appellants’ attempt to ensure their constitutional right to a fair trial and their statutory right to appeal was the risk that on the second trial they would receive the death penalty. Thus appellants were presented with the same choice as were the defendants under the Federal Kidnapping Act. If either group chose to exercise its constitutional right (to secure a fair trial or a jury trial) the penalty was the added risk that the procedure might result in the death penalty. Therefore we believe it is clear that the risk of the death penalty is an unconstitutional condition to the right of appeal; unless the Commonwealth is able to advance a legitimate “purpose or effect,” <em>United States v.

Jackson, </em>309 U.S. at 583, <a href="/us/390/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="390 U.S. 570" data-case-ids="6174728" data-case-paths="/us/390/0570-01">88 S. Ct. at 1217</a>. The only possible reasons the Commonwealth might want the power to impose the death penalty are (1) because the first sentence was too lenient or (2) the desire to deter the number of appeals from first degree life imprisonment convictions. The former reason is constitutionally impermissible as a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>See discussion p. 345 <em>infra. </em>The latter is equally constitutionally infirm. If the Commonwealth is concerned, as it should he, with minimizing the number of frivolous and unmeritorious appeals, there must be a more rational method of determining those which are unwarranted. To accomplish the goal of deterring appeals through fear of the death penalty merely adds another risk to the choice to bring <em>any </em>appeal, whether frivolous or not. Pragmatic objectives — no matter how well motivated — which produce injustices as here, may not prevail when they violate constitutional standards of fairness.</p>
    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[193,1030,1160,1259]]]'>Nor would we hear the Commonwealth contend that meritorious appeals should be discouraged because of the additional stress which the appeal procedure places on the judicial process. First it is doubtful that the number of appeals from first degree murder convictions constitutes a heavy burden. Second, once the right of appeal is granted, appellate review should be allowed in a manner which in no way discriminates against those who face the possibility of a death sentence if their appeal is successful. Cf. <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/351/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="351 U.S. 12" data-case-ids="1105068" data-case-paths="/us/351/0012-01">351 U.S. 12</a>, <a href="/us/351/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="351 U.S. 12" data-case-ids="1105068" data-case-paths="/us/351/0012-01">76 S. Ct. 585</a> (1956). Finally, the comment of the ABA Advisory Committee on this issue deserves emphasis here: “The risk of a greater sentence as the result of the assertion of the right of review necessarily acts as a deterrent to the exercise of the right .... The extent of the pressure placed on an individual defendant bears no relation to the degree of injustice which may have been perpetrated [at trial]. A system which fears the assertion of error to a degree that it must place artificial deterrents in the path which leads to review is not a healthy system.” ABA Standards, Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures §3.8 at 199.</p>

It is definitely not permissible to take a small group from the class of <em>all </em>those who have been sentenced to life imprisonment and declare that <em>only </em>those who appeal or employ collateral relief will be “eligible” for this review. The reasons are quite clear: there is no reason to assume that the original sentences of this group are more in need of review than the sentences of the entire class of sentenced prisoners. In other words, instead of choosing a group for sentence review on the basis of some factor which bears a rational connection with the purpose of the review, this system employs a completely irrational standard for choosing those whose sentences may be changed.</p>

This classification is over-inclusive since many meritorious appeals are also deterred. The device of the threat of the death penalty does not bear <em>any </em>reasonable relation to the frivolousness or merits of the appeal. See <em>Patton v. North Carolina, </em><a href="/f2d/381/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="381 F.2d 636" data-case-ids="312525" data-case-paths="/f2d/381/0636-01">381 F. 2d at 642-43</a> (4th Cir. 1967) ; xlBA Standards, Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures §3.8, Van Alstyne, supra, 74 Yale L.J. at 621-22, 683.

We are inclined to agree with Mr. Justice Frankfurter that any such distinction is mere legal fiction. “As a practical matter and on any basis of human values, it is scarcely possible to distinguish a case in which the defendant is convicted of a greater offense from one in which he is convicted of an offense that has the same name as that of which he was previously convicted but carries a significantly different punishment, namely death rather than imprisonment.” <em>Green v.

It may be that the law places more legal significance on the difference between an offense for which a defendant can receive twenty years and one for which he can receive life imprisonment; but most assuredly more significance is placed by the defendant on the difference between life imprisonment and the electric chair, although the punishments are meted out for the same crime.</p>

See Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §701, as amended, 18 P.S. §4701. Although there are no legal standards by which the jury actually makes this sentencing decision, it is certainly true that a jury which returns with a sentence of life imprisonment has determined that the facts in the case do not warrant a death penalty. Just because the law does not establish what precise factors should guide <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>the jury in making this decision, does not mean that the law cannot attach legal significance to the jury’s choice and view the jury’s decision as an implied acquittal of the defendant of the penalty of death.

Therefore, the only appropriate disposition is to remand the case for a hearing on this issue.

As the jury was being escorted around City Hall during recess, a taxicab driver shouted at them from his car, “Not guilty,” and sped away. The incident was reported to the trial judge who held a conference with both counsel about the incident. All agreed that the incident was not sufficiently prejudicial to justify a mistrial, but before any final ruling was made, the judge asked that appellant be included in the final decision. After the conference, appellant stated to the judge that “if it [the in<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>cident] hag been deemed something detrimental, ...
