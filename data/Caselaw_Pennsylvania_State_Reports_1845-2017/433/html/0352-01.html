The interim taxes for the benefit of the City, anticipated to yield $13,750,000, were, allegedly, necessitated by two unexpected expenses: first,. the City had signed- a new contract with the City policemen, firemen and non-<a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>uniformed employees which, it was estimated, would require the expenditure of an additional $12,809,400; second, the remaining amount was to be used to defray the increased cost of running the judicial system in the City resulting from the consolidation of the various courts brought about bjr the amendments to the State Constitution effective January 1, 1969.</p>
    <p id="b407-4" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[178,755,1149,1373]]]'>On December 26, 1968, all eight revenue measures were approved by the Council and signed into law by the Mayor. On the same day, fourteen appropriation transfer bills were introduced into Council. Thirteen of these transfer bills were designed to transfer most of the budgeted surplus of approximately $24 million from the “working capital surplus” to various City departments. The City Finance Director subsequently testified that, during the course of 1968, various City department heads requested permission to exceed their budgets because of unforeseen expenses and, when the Finance Director was satisfied that these expenses were necessitated, he authorized the department heads to exceed their budgets with the promise that he would ask City Council to reimburse them from the budgeted surplus. It was also decided that the Council would not make the transfers to the departments piecemeal but would wait until the end of 1968 to make all the transfers at one time. The result was the thirteen appropriation bills introduced on December 26. Tbe fourteenth and final transfer bill appropriated $12,809,400 of the anticipated $13,750,000 to be raised by the new tax measures to the Finance Director to cover the new salary increases and the balance to the Finance Director for working capital.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

On December 31, a three-judge panel convened to hear the case enjoined the City from collecting the taxes and fines imposed by the revenue bills and from enacting the appropriation transfer bills. The court ruled, in effect, that the City had not established that the revenues to be raised by the new taxes were to meet “unanticipated emergencies” as required by §2-301 (a) of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter. Two days later the Council held a hearing after which it passed a resolution finding specifically that the needs of the School District and of the City for the wage increases and for the court consolidation costs were “unanticipated emergencies” and that the appropriation transfer bills “provide for the payment of expenses which were unanticipated and could not reasonably be anticipated, and in very large measure were of an emergency nature, and are properly within the budget provisions of the Home Rule Charter authorizing transfers in appropriations.” The City went bach to the Common Pleas Court to ash that the injunctions be dissolved.</p>

The three judges unanimously held that the injunction pertaining to the two tax measures for the benefit of the School District should be dissolved. As to the tax measures for the City, the court was divided. Judge Smith, writing for the majority, held that the City lached the power to pass interim tax measures and that the transfer bills — with the exception of the bill transferring the money for the salary increases — were also invalid because dissolution of the budgeted surplus would create a deficit. Judge Barbieri, in a concurring opinion, argued that the funds to be transferred under the appropriation bill® were not for “unanticipated emergencies,” that <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>the pay increases and increased costs of administering the courts should be paid for out of the operating surplus and that, therefore, there was no deficit and no “unanticipated emergency” requiring additional revenues. Judge Spaeth dissented to this part of the majority’s opinion, contending that the City had the right to pass interim tax measures, that the expenses of the pay raises and of the court system were “unanticipated emergencies” and that at least some of the budgeted surplus was not available for this emergency since the money had already been committed to various City departments. Judge Spaeth would have remanded the matter to Council for a determination as to which of the monies proposed to be transferred had, in fact, already been committed to the various departments. Finally, Judge Spaeth criticized the majority’s order upholding Bill No. 829 authorizing the School District to raise its real estate tax from $.42% to $1.10 on each $100 of assessed value and at the same time striking down Bill No. 826 decreasing the rate of real estate tax for use by the City from $2,375 to $1,825, pointing out that the result of the majority’s decision was to increase the real estate tax by $.67% on each $100 of assessed valuation, whereas the City Council had only intended to raise the rate by $.12%.</p>

Such limitation is found in the Charter which forbids the City from making unbudgeted appropriations save in an emergency situation. The vital factor is that the enabling acts of the General Assembly make no distinction between emergency and nonemergency interim taxes; in fact, these statutes do not mention interim taxation. The logical result of the City’s argument is that, if there were no limitation on <em>appropriations </em>under the <em>Charter, </em>the City would have unlimited interim taxing power under the enabling statutes. If we are to limit the City’s interim taxing power to emergency situations, we would, in effect, be holding that the enabling acts permit unlimited interim taxation. Since the enabling acts are completely silent on this question, we would have to draw two implications from these statutes to uphold the City’s position; first, that the statutes permit interim taxing measures and, second, that the statutes limit interim taxing measures to emergency situations.

Moreover, the Act of 1919 (Act of June 25, 1919, P.

Unfortunately, however, the City’s averred current needs total approximately $38,158,000, or about $14 million more than the amount of the surplus. The City would like to transfer the bulk of the surplus to the department heads under the authority of §2-300(6), thus depleting the surplus. The City would then like to appropriate the additional $13,750,000, allegedly still needed for the salary and wage increases, by invoking the provisions of §2-301 (a) : “The Council may not make any operating appropriations in addition to those included in the annual operating budget ordinance except: (a) To meet emergencies which could not be anticipated when the operating budget ordinance was passed; . . .” Following a hearing held after the lower court’s initial unanimous decision enjoining the enactment of the transfer bills, the Council specifically found that the expenses for the pay increases and for increased court costs were unanticipated emergency expenses.

Judge Spaeth likened this logic to that of the boy who shot his parents and then asked for sympathy as an orphan. Accepting the City’s finding that these two items — pay increases and increased court costs — constitute unanticipated emergencies, we hold that the money to meet these expenses is available in the surplus and should come out of the surplus.</p>

We realized that the City would be unable to comply with certain technical requirements of the Charter because the Charter speaks in terms of an <em>annual </em>budget, whereas in order to change over from a calendar year fiscal budget — which Council had the authority to do under the Charter — the Council would have to adopt either a six or eighteen-month budget. That was the holding in <em>Phillips. </em>We certainly did not give the City license to revamp the tax structure of the City in the middle of the fiscal year. In its brief, the City argues that the Mayor and Council “were justified in assuming that the courts would not insist upon complete technical compliance with the provisions of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter in this unique situation and that the courts would respect the sound discretion of City Council in meeting the practical problems inherent in the change of the fiscal year.” If this statement means that we would not insist on strict compliance with the requirements of the Charter that the City operate under an annual budget, we would agree that the statement is accurate. If, however, this statement means that in allowing the City to adopt a <em>one-shot </em>eighteen-month budget, we impliedly gave the City the authority to revise taxes after two-thirds of the fiscal year had expired, we cannot agree. A $13,750,000 tax increase during the fiscal year is more than a mere technical noncompliance with the provisions of the Charter.</p>

In effeet, the City is arguing that it is just not possible to anticipate the needs of the City over an eighteen-month period. But, if the Council were so concerned about its limited forecasting abilities, it had the option of adopting a <em>six-</em>month fiscal budget. When the School Board of Philadelphia changed over from a calendar fiscal year in 1966, it adopted just this procedure. The City cannot be heard to say now that it made a mistake when it adopted the eighteen-month budget and that we should rescue it by somehow finding that it has the power of interim taxation when the legislature has not seen fit to confer such power upon the City.</p>

In this statement, Justice Cohen, speaking for the majority, was attempting to answer the criticism of the three dissenters that the City was violating the requirements of a balanced budget because at the end of the first twelve months of the fiscal year, the City would face a $25 million deficit. We interpret Justice Cohen's statement to mean that the majority was aware of this fact and also of the fact that the $24.4 million surplus available at the end of the eighteen-month budget was perhaps smaller than it should have been in light of the fact that the eighteen-month budget encompassed the first halves of two years when two-thirds of the City’s annual revenues are collected. Nevertheless, the majority felt that the City was not <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>violating the requirement of a balanced budget because, at the end of the eighteen-month budget, there would be no deficit.

Thus, if the City finds that it costs $1.00 to enforce each parking violation, it is not restricted to imposing a $1.00 parking fine, if the payment of such an amount will not discourage illegal parking.</p>

Faced with this unbalanced deficit budget and the necessity for either reducing expenditures or increasing taxes, the City Administration chose to ignore the existence of a $24,000,000 deficit and proceeded to create in its stead the appearance of a $24,000,000 surplus by the simple but entirely unsound expedient of changing its annual budget to an eighteen month fiscal budget. See <em>Phillips v. Tate, </em>dissenting opinion. What the City did in effect was to join a twelve month unbalanced deficit budget with an additional six month surplus budget and thereby create an eighteen month budget showing a $24,000,000 surplus. In reality the City joined together two unbalanced budgets (each bad, because one is for a deficit and the other for a surplus). It is indeed a fundamental and well-established principle of local governmental tax and budgeting practice that precludes the taxing and budgeting authorities from budgeting for a deficit or for a surplus. In the former the City is proposing to spend more than its receipts and in the latter it is taxing more than is required to balance its expenditures. Either a deficit budget or a surplus budget is obviously an unbalanced budget. Each is equally contrary to sound and acceptable governmental administration. In 1967 the City by joining together two unbalanced budgets paved the way for its present fiscal predicament.</p>

The majority also does not find a provision which places a prohibition on interim taxes. However, the majority requires 38 pages to Nationalize such a prohibition into existence. On the contrary, I would find that the “unanticipated emergency” exception and the further reference that payments be made from “current revenues” in the Charter are consistent with the principle of “pay-as-you-go”, and hence permit the tax ordinances.</p>

At oral argument, appellees suggested that these items could be paid for by borrowing. This is contrary to good government, good administration and “pay-as-you-go.” It is undisputed that borrowing now can result only in <em>higher taxes </em>in the future.</p>

The majority has vitiated the taxes on the basis of provisions of the Home Rule Charter. The 1949 legislative enabling act granted “all powers and authority of lo<a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>cal self-government” to cities taking advantage of the Act. Philadelphia by its Charter took advantage of the Act. The majority now holds that the Home Rule Charter does not permit interim taxation. Thus, it is the Charter that requires amending.

    <p id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.8",449,[190,1222,1147,310]]]'>I dissent from the majority opinion which adopts an unwarrantedly narrow and restrictive construction of the City’s powers of taxation, and needlessly abandons the City and its schools in a desolate position, with only the hope that the legislature will come to the rescue.</p>
    <p id="b449-7" data-blocks='[["BL_449.9",449,[187,1551,1148,323]]]'>The core principle behind the majority’s disposition, namely, that a grant of the power of interim taxation has not been made unless by explication, is at loggerheads with the broad and pervasive grant of self-governing powers given to the City by the Home Rule Charter, and the Home Rule Enabling Act of 1949.</p>
    <p id="b449-8" data-blocks='[["BL_449.10",449,[183,1884,1149,489]]]'>Those laws place plenary legislative powers in the City with respect to its municipal affairs, and bestow to the City, by logical implication, the power of interim taxation. Thus I consider this problem with the preconception that unless somewhere the power of interim taxation is taken from the City, it exists; the majority considers the problem with the preconception that the power of interim taxation does not belong to the City, unless somewhere, it is explicitly given to it.</p>
    <p id="b450-3" data-blocks='[["BL_450.3",450,[171,359,1157,764]]]'>
      <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>The majority finds that the First Class Cities Act (Act of 1919) applies to this problem by force of a saving provision in the 1949 Charter Enabling Act, and precludes the existence of interim taxing powers in the City Council. I disagree. The 1949 Enabling Act bound the City by Acts of the General Assembly which <em>limited rates </em>of taxation. The 1919 Act was not a substantive restraint upon the City’s power of taxation ; it merely prescribed a budgetary scheme, and required that Council <em>adopt a budget </em>by a specified time. Nothing in the Act leads me to conclude that it was anything more than procedural. Since the Home Rule Charter provides its own budgetary scheme and procedure, the 1919 Act has no present applicability.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[166,1135,1156,762]]]'>Section 2-301 of the Home Rule Charter enumerates four situations when the Council can make post-budget appropriations. One such situation is “to meet emergencies which could not be anticipated when the operating budget ordinance was passed.” The section provides further that such appropriations can be paid for out of “current revenues” among other things. Such authorization contemplates the power of interim taxation, which, as I have indicated, belongs to the City by virtue of the pervasive Home Rule Charter, and the Home Rule Enabling Act of 1949. And this is so even if the Charter’s budgetary scheme has the general effect of curbing the <em>exercise </em>of the interim taxing power in other respects.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[162,1909,1155,430]],["BL_451.1",451,[185,359,1151,820]]]'>The question next arises whether, and to what extent, an emergency exists so as to justify the use of the interim taxing power. On that score, I agree fully with Judge Spaeth’s opinion in the lower court. It is harsh and unrealistic to say that no emergency exists because the City has a working surplus of some $24,000,000 from which to defray its $13,750,000 unanticipated emergency. In fact, significant portions <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>(exactly how much is not now evident) of the reserve had been committed to various City departments by the Director of Finance, with the knowledge and apparent approval of the Mayor and leaders of the Council, <em>before </em>the unanticipated emergency arose. Although only Council can make appropriations, still, since the transfers were authorized in good faith with Council’s acquiescence; and since transfer ordinances could have authorized the intra-budgetary appropriations at the time, we ought to regard the commitments (to whatever extent they were made) as having lawfully diminished the reserve. I would remand the case to the lower court so that it might be ascertained what fiscal commitments were made prior to the advent of the unanticipated emergency.</p>
    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[182,1192,1148,263]]]'>I agree with the majority that Bills Nos. 822 and 823, which increase the fines for parking and parking meter violations, should be sustained. Those measures result from the legitimate exercise by Council of its interim taxing powers.</p>
    <p id="b451-5" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[173,1469,1153,817]]]'>I cannot, however, refrain from noting the inconsistency of the majority opinion in upholding the above measures. Council either has the power of interim taxation, or it does not have that power. The majority opinion systematically concludes that Council lacks the power of interim taxation, because neither the Home Buie Charter nor any act of the General Assembly <em>bestows </em>the power of interim taxation upon Council. Yet, in a miraculous, and indeed motherless birth, the majority surprisingly finds some interim taxing powers in Council — enough, at least, to produce Bills Nos. 822, 823, which are, as sure as death and taxes, <em>interim taxes. </em>(Incidentally, the majority concedes that Bills Nos. 822, 823 were enacted primarily as revenue measures. )</p>
    <p id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.6",451,[173,2299,1144,97]],["BL_452.1",452,[184,361,1156,534]]]'>That turn of events, however, substantially changes the basic proposition of the majority opinion. Now the <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>proposition of the majority becomes: “Council <em>sometimes </em>has the power of interim taxation.” Now, in contradiction to everything which it said before, the <em>majority starts implying </em>interim-taxing powers. But its implications are themselves erratic. For does it enhance the welfare (the basis of the police power) of the people of Philadelphia any more to increase parking fines than it would to enact revenue measures now to avoid <em>additional </em>taxpayer expense later? I, for one, do not think so.</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[181,914,1155,488]]]'>Finally, I would uphold Ordinance Bills Nos. 828 and 829 which would raise approximately $28,750,000 for the School District. Section 12-303 (e) of the Supplement allows the Board to increase the aggregate total of budget appropriations when “unappropriated revenues become available in sufficient amount to maintain the budget in balance.” The quoted language implies the unrestricted power of interim taxation, and justifies the instant taxing measures.</p>
    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[180,1412,1152,321]]]'>Admittedly, my construction of the relevant provisions of the Charter and its Educational Supplement, as well as the Acts of 1919 and 1949, is as broad as the exigencies of this situation require. However, my basic approach finds warrant in the documents giving the City home rule powers.</p>
