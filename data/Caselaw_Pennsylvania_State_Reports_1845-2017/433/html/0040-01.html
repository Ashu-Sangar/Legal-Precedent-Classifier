On several occasions, this Court has stated that legislative findings of fact are entitled to a prima facie acceptance of their correctness: “It is to be noted, too, that the Housing Authorities Law declares the purposes of the act to be ‘public purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain,’ and, while such a legislative declaration is not conclusive — it being for the ultimate decision of the courts as to whether a proposed use is a public one — it is entitled not only to respect but to a prima facie acceptance of its correctness.”: <em>Dornan v.

Such a rule is salutary for courts are not in a position to assemble and evaluate the necessary empirical data which forms the basis for the legislature’s findings. The Authorities present data indicating that there is and has been an unemployment problem in Pennsylvania and that industry is and has been declining and the taxpayers counter <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>with evidence that demonstrates that the unemployment problem is not presently very serious and acute. Courts should not be called upon to sift through such data. It is the province of the legislature, not the judiciary, to determine the extent of the unemployment problem in Pennsylvania and to determine the means necessary to combat that problem. Furthermore, the concept of “public purpose” changes through the years. “Views as to what constitutes a public use necessarily vary with changing conceptions of the scope and functions of government, so that today there are familiar examples of such use which formerly would not have been so considered. As governmental activities increase with the growing complexity and integration of society, the concept of ‘public use’ naturally expands in proportion.”: <em>Dornan, supra, </em>at 221. Generally, the legislature, which is more responsive to the people and has more adequate facilities for gathering and assembling the requisite data, is in a better position to evaluate and determine public purpose than are the courts, especially at the appellate level.</p>

The legislature has found that the unemployment problem is sufficiently serious now to warrant that steps be taken to remedy the problem and such legislative finding is entitled to great respect by us. The taxpayers have not convinced us that the legislative findings are unrealistic nor are we convinced by their argument that the legislature has not proved that there is a <em>present </em>unemployment problem but that the Act is designed to prevent unemployment in the future.

There is another important factor to consider. Industrial development authorities are so prevalent throughout the country that Pennsylvania is at a competitive disadvantage in attracting industry to this state should we declare this act unconstitutional.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">9</a> Even the taxpayers do not maintain <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>that it is not within the police power of the legislature to attract industry into the state or aid industry presently located in the state if such attraction and aid will alleviate unemployment and increase the opportunities for employment.</p>

This Court responded, “It is no constitutional objection to the statute, nor does it derogate from the public character of its objective, that the Authority will to some extent conduct what may heretofore have been regarded as a private enterprise; to hold otherwise would mean that the State would be powerless, within constitutional <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>limitations, to act in order to preserve the health and safety of its people even though such action were imperative and vital for the purpose.”: <em>McSorley, supra, </em>at 270.</p>

Most of them had worthy objectives; some of them were beneficial and really needed; many of them were unrealistic and unwise. Many of them were created unnecessarily and unwisely and solely, for. political or financial or patronage reasons, or to demon-' strate to the voters how “liberal” the creators or ad-' vocates were. Often they were merely a tax dodge which exempted the companies directly benefited, but concealed the fact that they would increase the taxes <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>on all other taxpayers.

    <p id="b113-5" data-blocks='[["BL_113.6",113,[168,732,1146,210]]]'>I concur in the majority’s decision sustaining the constitutionality of the legislation and projects here under review; but I should add a few observations regarding one aspect of the case.</p>
    <p id="b113-6" data-blocks='[["BL_113.7",113,[164,955,1148,430]]]'>As I read the majority opinion, we do not by this decision venture any judgment as to the wisdom or desirability of the use of tax free revenue bonds to foster industrial development; that is a determination entrusted exclusively to the legislature. Ours has been the more limited inquiry of whether the legislative judgment to proceed in this fashion exceeds the boundaries of the constitutionally permissible.</p>
    <p id="b113-7" data-blocks='[["BL_113.8",113,[161,1398,1148,429]]]'>Our conclusion that the legislation and projects serves a “public purpose” in part reflects an evolution in attitude prompted by the changing nature of our public needs. It also reflects the deference courts must accord to the legislative branch where fundamentally at issue is the appropriate role of government in meeting those needs. In this area, there may be no pretense that we sit as a superlegislature.</p>
    <p id="b113-8" data-blocks='[["BL_113.9",113,[158,1840,1148,318]]]'>Once it is accepted that the reduction of unemployment and the reversal of economic decline are a legitimate concern of government, our sole inquiry is whether the particular approach selected — the fostering of new plant development — is reasonably calculated to realize that objective.</p>
    <p id="b113-9" data-blocks='[["BL_113.10",113,[157,2172,1145,213]],["BL_114.1",114,[204,376,1152,319]]]'>In the instant case, appellants argue that the legislation and projects serve no useful public purpose, but are designed primarily to facilitate private interests. This contention, however, in the context of this case, <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>misapprehends the public purpose doctrine and the extent to which courts may interpose themselves in the resolution of essentially legislative questions. That doctrine was not intended to preclude legislative innovation reasonably calculated to realize police power objectives.</p>
    <p id="b114-4" data-blocks='[["BL_114.4",114,[203,705,1153,708]]]'>Appellants have relied heavily on <em>Price v. Philadelphia Parking </em>Authority, <a href="/pa/422/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="422 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1901729" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0317-01">422 Pa. 317</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=221%20A.2d%20138" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="221 A.2d 138">221 A. 2d 138</a> (1966). As the majority correctly points out, that case is narrowly speaking inapposite because it was decided not on constitutional grounds, but on the basis that the specific projects under attack were not authorized by the enabling legislation. Yet in a broad sense, we deal here with the same basic problem. If the instant projects were determined not to be essentially “public,” in that the benefit accruing to the local communities were found not sufficient to justify the public involvement, then our conclusion must necessarily be in accord with that reached in <em>Price.</em>

    <p id="b114-5" data-blocks='[["BL_114.5",114,[202,1425,1153,706]]]'>In <em>Price, </em>the public authority’s mandated role was to provide public parking. Yet the only benefit to the public after an investment by the parking authority of $8,000,000 to $9,000,000 was the addition of 180 parking spaces over that generally available prior to the project. <em>Id. </em>at 321, 338. Two-thirds of the parking spaces created were to be utilized primarily by the private commercial tenants of the structure housing the facility. The public thus was unable to benefit from the greater part of the project. But while there was a minimal gain to the public, there was numerous and significant benefits to the private developer.</p>

Here, <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>unlike <em>Price, </em>the totality of the projects will be devoted to their stated purpose — the reduction of unemployment through the creation of new plant development. While private interests are necessarily aided, the purpose of this aid is to foster a vital public interest. Thus, within the confines of this specific program and its objectives — far more subtle than the direct provision of a public service such as public parking — industrial lessees are functionally only incidental beneficiaries, necessary to the realization of an essentially public objective.</p>
    <p id="b115-4" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[171,973,1148,761]]]'>Fundamentally, the instant programs involve no more than the creation of an atmosphere conducive to industrial and economic growth by providing the mechanism for the realization of permissible tax benefits. No public property is devoted, nor credit lent to the industrial lessee. Nor are there any local advantages exempting the private users from taxation (in light of the agreements for payments in lieu of taxes) or regulation. On this basis, we would be loath to deprive local communities within this Commonwealth of the opportunity to compete with the numerous other jurisdictions (many of which adjoin Pennsylvania) making available similar inducements for economic expansion and growth.</p>
    <p id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[169,1747,1147,486]]]'>Today’s decision will not preclude the courts from preventing an abuse of an authority’s discretion in participating in a specific project. What would constitute such abuse within the confines of this program need not be here specified. It suffices for present purposes, however, to state that in the instant cases no such abuse has been suggested or called to our attention. For these reasons, I concur in the result reached by the majority.</p>
