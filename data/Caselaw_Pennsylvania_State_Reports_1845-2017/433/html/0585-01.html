Fortunately, we have been blessed with fine briefs from both parties, simplifying our task. Two appeals from the courts of Allegheny County are here combined, having been consolidated by order of this Court. That at No. 64 March Term, 1969, is a <em>mine pro tunc </em>appeal from the order of the Court of Common Pleas dated December 27, 1965, entered by Judge Herman M. Rodgers, specially presiding, dismissing, after hearing, appellant’s habeas corpus petition. The appeal at No. 48 March Term, 1969, is from the order of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, by President Judge Ellenbogen, dismissing, after hearing, appellant’s petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, §1, as amended, 19 P.S. §1180-1 et seq.</p>

At the same time, one Bennie Flemming, Rose Smith’s common law spouse, sustained a stab wound. The appellant was indicted at No. 263 0.&amp; T. January 1956 for assault with intent to kill Bennie Flemming; at No. 83 O. &amp; T. February 1956 for the murder of Rose Smith; at No. 86 O. &amp; T. February 1956 for the murder of Carol Smith; and at No. 85 O. &amp; T. February 1956 for involuntary manslaughter. On February 8, 1956, appellant, after trial by jury, was convicted of assault with intent to kill upon Bennie Flemming. On June 8, 1956, in the case at No. 86, involving Carol Smith, appellant was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree. Immediately after the verdict was announced, court-appointed counsel for appellant requested that the court impose sentence because appellant did not desire to appeal. Appellant <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>was then given a life sentence in the murder case to take effect at the expiration of the <em>3y2 </em>to 7 years sentence then imposed for the conviction, at No. 263, of assault with intent to kill. Shortly thereafter, on the same day, June 8, 1956, appellant pleaded guilty to the murder of Rose Smith at No. 83, and on the basis of the testimony in the earlier murder trial, was convicted of first degree murder, for which he was given a life sentence to run concurrently with the life sentence imposed at No. 86. The involuntary manslaugh1 ter indictment was nolle prossed.</p>
    <p id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[200,985,1154,709]]]'>In 1965, appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, averring that the confession which was admitted into evidence against him at his murder trials was involuntary. Counsel was appointed. During the course of the three hearings which followed, appellant was permitted to amend his pleadings so as to allege an ’ unknowing guilty plea as well, and he produced testimony on this latter issue also. Judge Rodgers dismissed the petition, holding that the confession was voluntary and that the issue of an unknowing guilty plea was not cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding where the petitioner was represented by counsel at the time of his plea.</p>

A hearing on that petition was held on May 21, 1968.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> During the course of that hearing appellant sought to amend his petition to include the allegation of an unknowing guilty plea. Judge Ellenbogen denied the motion on <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>the ground that the issue had been raised in the habeas corpus proceeding, and that the function of the Post Conviction Hearing Act court was not to sit in review of the habeas corpus court. Appellant also moved to amend his pleadings to add that he had been denied counsel in perfecting an appeal from the dismissal of his habeas corpus petition. Judge Elienbogen noted that appellant had requested an appeal from the order dismissing his habeas corpus petition, and that on February 24,1966, he (Judge Eulenbogen) had sent appellant’s court-appointed counsel a letter directing him to take an appeal on behalf of appellant. This letter was apparently misunderstood by counsel. Judge Eixenbogen then directed petitioner’s counsel to seek leave from the appropriate appellate court to file an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>from the habeas corpus dismissal. This was done, and on October 30, 1968, we granted appellant leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc.</em>

Brierley, </em><a href="/pa/429/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="429 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1913459" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0156-01">429 Pa. 156</a>, 158, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20434" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="239 A.2d 434">239 A. 2d 434</a> (1968); see also <em>Com. ex rel.

Ct. 1860</a> (1961). With that standard in mind, it is apparent that the finding of voluntariness must be sustained. The involuntariness claim is based largely on a brain injury allegedly sustained by appellant when he was captured by the police. He also asserts that the questions posed by his interrogators were not explained to him, that there were five policemen with him in a small room, and that he was not advised of his constitutional rights. Further, he claims that he was poorly educated and intoxicated. Under the totality of the circumstances, <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>appellant asserts, his confession was involuntary. We do not agree. The factors he sets forth are either dehors the record, of little weight, or refuted by the Commonwealth’s evidence. There is nothing in either the trial testimony or the habeas corpus hearing revealing the extent of appellant’s education. The questions asked of appellant were self-explanatory, and thus the fact that no explanation was given cuts not at all. As for intoxication, appellant’s drinking preceded his confession by more than twenty-four hours. Several Commonwealth witnesses testified that appellant understood what he was doing. The number of policemen and size of the room has some weight, but not much. The Commonwealth’s witnesses all testified that appellant was not mistreated in any way. It is true that appellant was not advised of his right to counsel. However, what we said in <em>Commonwealth v. Hornberger, </em><a href="/pa/430/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="430 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="1915711" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0413-01">430 Pa. 413</a>, 415, <a href="/citations/?q=243%20A.2d%20341" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="243 A.2d 341">243 A. 2d 341</a> (1968), is here relevant : “It- is undisputed that appellant was. not advised of his right to counsel.

If accepting the petitioner’s allegations as true the writ would issue, then it is incumbent upon the court to hold a hearing affording the petitioner the opportunity to establish the truth of his allegations.” It is thus clear that a nonfrivolous, specific allegation of an unknowing guilty plea, uncontradicted by the record, entitles a petitioner to a hearing.</p>
    <p id="b642-4" data-blocks='[["BL_642.4",642,[189,1586,1155,542]]]'>Appellant here was given a hearing on this question. However, the habeas corpus judge did not rule on the merits, but held that appellant was not entitled to the hearing. Since credibility is the keystone of the grant or denial of relief, this Court cannot, on a cold record, make the determination. Nor should it be made by the habeas corpus judge some four or more years after the hearing. We thus remand for a hearing limited to the issue of the allegedly unknowing guilty plea.</p>
