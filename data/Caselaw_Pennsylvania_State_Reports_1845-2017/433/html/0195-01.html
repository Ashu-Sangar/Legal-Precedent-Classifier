Appellant was indicted in March, 1955, in Delaware County for the murder of Wunder. In the same month he was indicted in Philadelphia for a series of unrelated felonies, some of which were committed after the murder. He was tried and convicted in Philadelphia on the felony charges first. Subsequently, at his murder trial in Delaware County, the Commonwealth introduced <em>without objection </em>appellant’s previous record consisting primarily of the convictions in Philadelphia for the purpose of fixing the penalty under Pennsylvania’s so-called “split-verdict” procedure. There is no question that this procedure was proper. See: <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>McIntyre, </em>the record was introduced solely for the purpose of impeachment; since the defendant in <em>McIntyre </em>was convicted of second degree murder, the “split-verdict” procedure never came into play. Subsequently, the Superior Court in a unanimous opinion by Judge Jacobs held that our holding in <em>McIntyre </em>should be restricted to the particular circumstances of that case and that we had not abrogated the general rule that the Commonwealth is permitted to introduce the defendant’s record of prior convictions for the purpose of impeachment. <em>Commonwealth v.

In this case there is no evidence that the Commonwealth was attempting to create such a record. Appellant was indicted in Philadelphia for the felonies and in Delaware County for the murder in the same month. Trial was delayed in Delaware County because appellant moved for a change in venue. Therefore, there does not appear to be anything sinister in the fact that appellant was tried in Philadelphia on the felony charges and then tried for murder in Delaware County. We have studied the record and do not find that appellant was denied due process by the introduction of the record of his convictions in Philadelphia at his murder trial.</p>

In considering an almost identical case, Justice Roberts stated, “Having made a choice not to attack the voluntariness of the confession at trial, the defendant may not now, long after the final stage of the direct litigation has passed, claim and exercise the option of having all that followed that decision set aside and ignored. This the defendant seeks to do so that he may now have the second privilege of interposing a delayed and untimely objection in the hope of achieving a more favorable result.

If the defendant was tried and convicted without receiving such a hearing, the trial judge must hold a hearing to determine whether the confession introduced at the defendant’s trial was voluntary.
