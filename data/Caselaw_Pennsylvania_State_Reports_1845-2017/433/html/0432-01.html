L. 707, a bill to authorize the conduct of thoroughbred horse racing with pari-mutuel wagering in the Commonwealth. In addition the legislation provided that an independent State Horse Racing Commission would be established and permitted to grant up to four licenses renewable annually for the conduct of horse race meetings for a maximum of 100 racing days each, Needless to say, the passage of the act provoked more than a little interest among various groups across the length and breadth of the Commonwealth; the Commission soon found itself in a position where it had to choose from among fifteen serious applicants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It chose four, namely, The Continental Thoroughbred Racing Association, Inc., Eagle Downs Race Track, Inc., Pennsylvania National Turf Club, Inc. and the Shamrock Racing Association, Inc. It is these awards and the Commission’s decision-making process which are raised as bases for Man O’ War Racing Association’s instant appeals; named as appellees are the four successful applicants, the Racing Commission and the individual members and chairman of the Commission, Member A. Marlyn Moyer, Member Thomas A. Livingston and Chairman Roy Wilkinson, Jr.</p>

If an appeal is <em>prohibited </em>by an act, or the decision of an agency is described as final or conclusive, an appeal may be taken to the courts in the nature of narrow certiorari.

The next question is whether this appeal will lie. The precondition to our review by certiorari was only recently reiterated in the <em>Keystone Raceway </em>case: “[F]or an appeal by certiorari to lie the order or action of the agency, board or commission <em>must be judicial in nature.” </em>(Emphasis supplied. ) <a href="/pa/405/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="405 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1303599" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0001-01">405 Pa. at 6</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.2d%2097" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="173 A.2d 97">173 A. 2d at 100</a>; <em>Delaware County National Bank, </em>supra. However the cases have not been either clear or consistent in their determination of what factors should be considered in deciding wheth-' er an action is judicial.

First, the decision making power of the <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>Commission and the manner in which it functions indicate judicial characteristics. Section 7 of the Horse Racing Act provides that “If, in the <em>judgment </em>of the State Horse Racing Commission, the public interest, convenience or necessity will be served thereby and a proper case for the issuance of such license is shown consistent with the purposes of this act and the best interests of racing generally, it may grant such a license . . . .” (Emphasis supplied.) Thus the Commission must judge the merits of each applicant in terms of complicated and multi-faceted statutory standards. This determination represents much more of an adjudicative process or judicial decision than that required in issuing, for example, occupational licenses, where the only determination is whether the applicant meets specific <em>minimum </em>standards. Further, the act itself contemplates that the Commission will be making determinations essentially judicial in character in light of the judgment which the Legislature committed to its Commission. In §20 of Act of December 11, 1967, P. L. 707, the Commission is instructed that “it shall have the power to administer oaths and examine witnesses, and may issue subpoenas to compel attendance of witnesses, and the production of all material and relevant reports, books, papers, documents, correspondence and other evidence,” in conjunction with its hearing power.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

See <em>Ritter Finance Co. v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/401/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="401 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1294516" data-case-paths="/pa/401/0467-01">401 Pa. at 475</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.2d%20246" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="165 A.2d 246">165 A. 2d at 250</a>. Appellants correctly point to the magnitude of the tax revenues to be raised,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the enormous amounts of money which <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>will be wagered at Pennsylvania tracks, the importance of responsible supervision of legalized gambling and tbe importance of the proper introduction of thoroughbred racing as a sport in the Commonwealth, to demonstrate the public interest implications of a decision by the Commission. Appellees respond to this persuasive argument with the notion that “the prior illegality of the type of business at issue makes it obvious that there can be no strong public policy requiring appellate review.” In our view this is simply a non sequitur; factors other than the prior legality of an enterprise must determine whether the public has an important stake in such an undertaking. In fact, it is just those activities which at one time were illegal and which have been made legal in order to add revenue to the public coffers which tend to be more infected with the public interest.</p>

See, e.g., <em>Delaware County National Bank v. Campbell, </em><a href="/pa/378/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="378 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1250881" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0311-01">378 Pa. at 321</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.2d%20416" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="106 A.2d 416">106 A. 2d at 421</a> (1954). To demonstrate that no such property rights are affected here appellees cite many cases which declare that liquor or horse racing licenses are privileges granted by the Legislature and thus do hot represent property rights. See, e.g., <em>Tahiti Bar, Inc. Liquor License Case, </em><a href="/pa/395/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="395 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1282749" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0355-01">395 Pa. 355</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.2d%20112" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="150 A.2d 112">150 A. 2d 112</a> (1959); F<em>ink v.

In that case, the appellant sought a review of the Harness Racing Commission’s action after the Commission had only granted one of four authorized licenses. In holding that appellant had no standing, Mr. Chief Justice Beel (speaking for a four man majority) said “This is not the case of two or more persons (or corporations) applying for a license when only one license is available. Three licenses are still available for issuance by the Commission. Moreover, since the Philadelphia metropolitan area contains a very large percentage of the Commonwealth’s population, it is not unlikely that the Commission would allocate another license to this area. . . .

Both argue that even if this Court should fail to grant the general motions to quash discussed above, we still should grant these special motions because appellant does not have standing to challenge the grant of their two licenses. Their reasoning for this proposition appears to be as follows: appellant did not apply for a license in either Luzerne or Dauphin County; neither Shamrock nor Pennsylvania Turf Club were interested in a license in the Philadelphia area; therefore Man O’ War was not a competitor of either of these appellees and the litigation before this Court should be restricted to those who wish to conduct racing in the Philadelphia area. In addition, these two appellees rely on the language of the two-judge dissent in <em>Keystone Raceway. </em>In that opinion, the dissent would have granted standing to <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>appellant because “appellant seeks a license in the <em>same geographical area </em>in which this license has been granted.” (Emphasis in original.) <a href="/pa/405/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="405 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1303599" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0001-01">405 Pa. at 11</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.2d%2097" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="173 A.2d 97">173 A. 2d at 102</a>.</p>
    <p id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.4",492,[191,579,1155,1317]]]'>While these arguments seem appealing and persuasive at first reading, on reflection, we are satisfied that they are not sufficiently convincing to merit the granting of appellees’ motions to quash. First, it is apparent that appellant is not only attacking the statute itself but also the manner in which the Commission proceeded under the statute in granting <em>all </em>the licenses. Second, appellant had an interest in the granting of each application since each grant presented appellant with that much less chance of receiving one for itself. It is not for this Court to speculate whether the Commission would have granted three, or even all four, licenses to the Philadelphia area. It is enough to establish appellant’s standing that the Commission chose what it deemed to be the best four of fifteen submitted applications and appellant stands before us urging that <em>all </em>four represent abuses of discretion since it is better than <em>any </em>of the others. Finally, appellees’ reliance on the reasoning of the dissent in <em>Keystone </em>is misplaced. There the Court was presented with a fact situation wherein three of the four authorized licenses had yet to be granted. Here, <em>all </em>the licenses have been awarded and thus reasoning from the <em>Keystone </em>case is inapposite. See p. 442, supra.</p>

At every opportunity presented appellant to object to the procedures or suggest alternatives, not one mention was made by any representative of Man O’ War that they considered the procedures inadequate, unfair or unsatisfactory. When the Chairman described the proposed procedures (in virtually the same terms as actually employed later), there was no protest. In response to his request for written comments after the meeting, appellant filed nothing. During the time allotted Man O’ War at the end of the meeting on July 10, Mr. Raughlin, the President of Riddle Memorial Hospital, used the time to briefly describe the proposed nonprofit irrevocable charitable trust plan under which Man O’ War planned to operate. Further, it is abundantly apparent from the call for the meeting, that this was the time, place and opportunity when appellant should have presented comments, suggestions or objections on Commission procedures. Since our careful and tedious examination of the record indicates that appellant failed to raise these objections at any time below,'it is our view that Man O’ War cannot be heard to complain at this late stage of the proceedings. Therefore, we conclude, without deciding the merits of any of appellant’s due process contentions, that appellant has waived its right to raise these objections at this time.

In our role as a reviewing court, we must enter upon the performance of our judicial function ever mindful of the deference we should show to the Commission’s determinations.

Our review of the transcripts of each of the presentations and a careful study of each application indicates that the Commission was in the fortunate albeit difficult position of choosing from among fifteen applicants, all of whom seemed financially responsible, familiar with horse racing, imbued with sufficient enthusiasm, ready to build or rent an appropriate facility, composed of civic leaders and prepared to promote thoroughbred horse racing throughout the Commonwealth. Thus appellant’s argument that review of the qualifications of all the applicants would reveal “the overwhelming superiority of Man O’ War” must be rejected as mere hyperbole.

If' .the Legislature wanted to require a track to be placed in a first class school district it would have said so explicitly. This it did not do. Further the Commission did take the provision for this tax into serious consideration, but the minutes of the Commission clearly indicate why they chose not to grant a license to Philadelphia. “The Commission noted that no. application had been filed with it for construction of a new track within the limits of Philadelphia. . . . The Commission determined that in the best interests of producing revenue for the Commonwealth, and in serving the public interest, convenience and necessity, and in the best interests of racing generally, the Commonwealth should have a new and modern, independent track occupied by two licensees. . . .” The decision that a new track in the Philadelphia area was more important <em>to thoroughbred racing </em>than the tax for school districts of the first class was clearly within the discretion of the Commission and hardly justifies a reversal of their grants.</p>

These include: (1) the ability of Man O’ War to start racing earlier than any of the other applicants; (2) .the discrepancy between the patron capacity and the parking capacity at the proposed Neshaminy Park (where Continental and Eagle Downs plan to race);' (3) the need to build a road network around Neshaminy Park whereas one is already in place around. <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>Liberty Bell Park (where Man O’ War intended to race); (4) of the amount of “handle” (the amount wagered), Man O’ War was willing to contribute a greater percentage for purses and stakes than the other applicants; (5) Eagle Downs applied to be a joint owner of Neshaminy Park with Continental, but the Commission’s grant was for Eagle Downs to be a tenant of Continental; (6) doubt that if only $25,000,000 were spent on a new facility (Neshaminy Park) that it could compare in quality with a $20,000,000 plant built five years ago (Liberty Bell); (7) the Commission granted Shamrock the right to race at a converted harness racing track, while denying Man O’ War the same right; (8) if the Commission wanted a new track in the Philadelphia area, they should have awarded a license to Continental <em>and also </em>awarded a license to Man O’ War to race at Liberty Bell Park. We need not discuss each of these claims individually. Merely a cursory examination of all of them, indicates that neither any one nor all taken together point to an abuse of discretion. All these factors are present because the Commission, in its own area of expertise, judged that whatever disadvantages would result from making the grants as they did, were outweighed by numerous other factors which it also had to consider.

The word “judgment” as used in §7(a) is meant in its common usage, not as a word of art. Determination of “the public interest” and “the best interests of racing generally” are the main considerations of the Commission in its grant of licenses under §7(a). The action of the Commission is the bestowing of a privilege by the Commonwealth based on its investigation and its “judgment” relative to the public interest, and consonant with what it considers the best interests of racing. This function, and the process prescribed for exercising it, seems administrative rather than judicial in nature.</p>

But in the posture of this case, the appellant is seeking, and has not yet obtained, the property right involved.

One need only be a visitor at a county fair to recognize that horse racing in one form or another is a tradition in Pennsylvania. What the legislature accomplished by Act of December 11, 1967, P. L. 707, was to authorize the setting up of gambling facilities at horse races contrary to existing law. In effect, the legislature has granted immunity from the impact of the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §605, 18 P.S. §4605 (setting up or establishing gambling places), §603, 18 P.S. §4603 (maintaining gambling devices or apparatus), §606, 18 P.S. §4606 (enticing persons to visit places used for gambling), §699.5, 18 P.S. §4699.5 (running horses for money), to those licensed to conduct pari-mutuel betting at horse races.</p>

Unsworn testimony was accepted, cross-examination was not permitted, and there was no requirement that all information be presented publicly. This restrictive procedure was a “hearing” in name only and served as a screen behind which the Commissioners could bestow the licenses in whatever manner they desired.</p>
