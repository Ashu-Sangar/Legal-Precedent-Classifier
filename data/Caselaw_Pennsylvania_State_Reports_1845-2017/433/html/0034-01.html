A Court en banc denied appellant’s motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. An appeal from the judgment of sentence was then taken to this Court.</p>

Stanley Braxton, an eyewitness to the escape of the two masked men, notified the police about five or six days after the killing that he recognized both felons. As a result of the information obtained from Braxton and his identification of appellant from photographs and at a police line-up, appellant was arrested and charged with the murder of First. The other felon whom Braxton identified only as “Sam” has not been found.</p>

He took no exception to the Court’s charge. He urges that failure to so charge was prejudicial and reversible error because without the identification testimony, the circumstantial evidence was insufficient to prove defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Judge Bradley, the trial Judge, contrary to appellant’s contention, adequately and ably covered this point. He charged:</p>

In particular, appellant’s brief cites one instance where Braxton testified on direct examination that he saw appellant’s face for three seconds, while on recross-examination Braxton testified that it took only a fraction of a second for appellant to leave the pawn shop and spin around toward Eleventh Street and in that fraction of a second he was able to identify the man as the defendant.</p>

    <p id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[201,1147,1153,653]]]'>Here, Braxton never wavered in his identification of appellant. He testified that he had known appellant for about three years prior to the murder and that he had an unobstructed view of appellant’s face when appellant took off his mask as he backed out of the pawn shop. Braxton further stated that the five-day delay in notifying the police was the result of fear, since both felons knew Braxton had observed them leaving the pawn shop. We find nothing unbelievable about this explanation. This was clearly positive identification within the meaning of the <em>Kloiber </em>case, 378 Pa., supra.</p>

The majority notes that no exception was taken to the language in the charge.

      <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>or deciding whether the error is basic and fundamental,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> the majority simply goes on to decide the merits of appellant’s claim. To this procedure I must register two objections; first, it is my view that we should never consider errors in the charge to which no exception has been taken. The reasons why I believe such a review is incorrect have been set out in length in my recent opinions in <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/432/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="432 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1919746" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0557-01">432 Pa. 557</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20301" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="248 A.2d 301">248 A. 2d 301</a> (1968) (dissenting opinion) and <em>Commonwealth v.

See <em>Commonwealth v.

Second, even if the basic and fundamental error test should become the standard, I think the majority should consistently apply it in <em>all </em>cases where there is an error below to which no objection is made. Instead the majority not only seems to apply the standard with little consistency, compare <em>Commonwealth v.
