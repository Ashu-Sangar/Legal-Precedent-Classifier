Appellant now challenges both his guilty plea as having not been knowingly and intelligently entered and his 1966 recommitment because he did not have counsel at the parole hearing.

    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[192,1244,1161,981]]]'>Appellant claims that his guilty plea was not knowingly and intelligently entered because his counsel did not discuss a plea of involuntary manslaughter, and that this was necessary to inform appellant of the nature of his offense and the possible punishments. Cf. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. O’Lock v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/415/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="415 Pa. 515" data-case-ids="1891872" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0515-01">415 Pa. 515</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=204%20A.2d%20439" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="204 A.2d 439">204 A. 2d 439</a> (1964). However in this case, appellant was charged with murder and thus a conviction of involuntary manslaughter was not possible. See <em>Commonwealth v. Hardy, </em><a href="/pa/347/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="347 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1217365" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0551-01">347 Pa. 551</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20767" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="32 A.2d 767">32 A. 2d 767</a> (1943); <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant was charged with twice beating the deceased, then finally dumping her out of his car and leaving her in a small clearing where she died. Under this charge, counsel correctly concluded that involuntary manslaughter was not in the case, and of course appellant was in no way prejudiced by not being told about involuntary manslaughter.</p>

The remaining question concerns only the validity of appellant’s 1966 recommitment hearing, where appellant, unassisted by counsel, was sent back to prison because of technical parole violations.</p>
    <p id="b379-3" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[155,628,1146,821]]]'>The Commonwealth first contends that appellant’s claim is not cognizable in a Post Conviction Hearing Act proceeding. Under §3 of the Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, §3, 19 P.S. §1180-3, a person is eligible for relief under the act if he proves, inter alia: “(c) That his conviction or sentence resulted from .... (6) The denial of his constitutional right to representation by competent counsel.” Appellant comes within this provision since his claim here is that the part of his sentence that he has served since his recommitment hearing is a result of his not being represented by counsel at that hearing. Thus if we find that appellant does have a right to be represented by counsel at a Parole Board hearing, that right may be claimed in a PCHA proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b379-4" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[154,1462,1146,596]]]'>Even were this not the case, since strict pleading rules do not apply to writs of habeas corpus, e.g., <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

Writs of habeas corpus may still be had in cases not covered by the PCHA, cf. <em>Moss v. Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/f-supp/257/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="257 F.
