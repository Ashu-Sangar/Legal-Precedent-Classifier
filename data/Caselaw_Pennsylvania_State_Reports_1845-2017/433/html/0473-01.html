On the night of Alston’s death, defendant and Alston had argued at a local bar and also in their room. Tenants at the same apartment or rooming house testified that during the argument defendant chased Alston to the second floor with a knife in his hand. Afte,r the two men were separated by tenants, defendant and Alston returned to their room on the third floor. Defendant testified that Alston then attacked him and that during the fight Alston was accidentally cut by defendant’s knife. On the other hand, the Commonwealth contends that on their return to the. third floor <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>room defendant stabbed Alston and after the stabbing Alston ran from the house to a nearby service station, where he collapsed. Defendant went looking for Alston and found him at the service station. Defendant then accompanied Alston in the police ambulance to the hospital “giving the police the impression that he was Alston’s brother.” Since Alston was unable to speak, homicide detectives sought information from defendant, who told them that Alston had been stabbed. The Commonwealth proved that defendant, in response to a question by Detective DiMaria, “Did you stab this Man?” responded, “Yes, if you want to know the truth. Yes, I did it.” At this point defendant was warned of his Constitutional rights and was placed under arrest.</p>

The record reveals, however, that at the time defendant was arrested the arresting officer knew that a felony had been committed (Alston had been stabbed) and had probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the stabbing since defendant had chased Alston with a knife in his hand and after the stabbing, and immediately preceding arrest, had <em>volmitwity </em>admitted to the officer that he had stabbed Alston. Under these facts and circumstances an arrest without a warrant is valid. <em>Commonwealth v.

The récord reveals, however, that the search was not of the apartment owned, leased or occupied by defendant but of a first floor apartment, which defendant occasionally visited, and of the passageways, stairways and landings of the building which were used in common by all the apartment building tenants. This search of such premises without a warrant is not a violation of defendant’s Constitutional rights. Moreover, there was no pretrial motion to suppress this evidence, and no objection to its admission was made at the trial.</p>

The record shows that the request was not made to the Court below, but was filed with the Clerk of Courts and the District Attorney. The bill of particulars was never submitted to the Court for approval in accordance with Rule 221(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. In any event, the granting of a bill of particulars is within the discretion of the lower Court. Moreover, Rule 221(c) provides that “When an application for relief is made, the Court may make such orders as it deems necessary in the interests of justice.” Not only was Rule 221(b) not complied with, but we further find that a bill of particulars in this case was unnecessary in the interests of Justice and there was no reversible error.</p>

These appear of record in the trial transcript as follows: “Mr. Frye, I say to you very sincerely, I think that Mr. Harper has done a tremendous job for you and I compliment him for that.” The trial Judge’s summation of defense counsel’s performance was made after the jury returned its verdict. Nor do we find <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>any merit in the contention that defense counsel’s right of cross-examination was seriously limited, or defendant’s claim of denial of his right of assistance of counsel in perfecting an adequate appeal, because his first counsel did not feel there was anything to argue on appeal.
