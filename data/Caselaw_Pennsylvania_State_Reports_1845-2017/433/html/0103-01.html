    <p id="b153-5" data-blocks='[["BL_153.6",153,[154,421,1147,320]]]'>Margaret Stewart Maurice (decedent), a Bradford County resident, died testate on December 25, 1958. Citizens National Bank and Trust Company, Towanda, was named as Executor under decedent’s last will and testament. Decedent’s estate was valued at approximately $900,000.00.</p>
    <p id="b153-6" data-blocks='[["BL_153.7",153,[153,754,1147,319]]]'>On March 22, 1960, the Executor filed the Federal Estate Tax return and paid the tax which it estimated. Approximately two years and four months later — July 20, 1962 — the United States Government assessed a tax deficiency against the estate and this deficiency was paid on September 5, 1962.</p>
    <p id="b153-7" data-blocks='[["BL_153.8",153,[151,1086,1148,596]]]'>On May 21, 1964, a conference was held between counsel for the Executor and counsel for the present appellants, the testamentary residuary legatees, at which the latter outlined in detail for counsel for Executor an error made by the Executor in the Federal Estate Tax return. This error, it was claimed, was caused by the failure of the Executor to claim credit in said Estate Tax return for a tax previously paid on prior transfers from the Marion Maurice<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Estate, Marion Maurice having predeceased decedent by approximately three and one-half years.</p>

The Executor was successful in recovering $6,934.14 of an overpayment of tax because the statute of limitations had not barred a recovery against the deficiency assessment which it had paid. However, the bulk of the Executor’s claim <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>for a refund was denied because the statute of limitations had run.</p>
    <p id="b154-4" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[221,487,1153,651]]]'>When the Executor filed its Second and Final Account, later amended, the appellants filed exceptions thereto, only one of which was pressed before the court below and only one of which is now before us. The appellants excepted to the account claiming that, by reason of the Executor’s failure to claim an allowance of credit for tax previously paid on the prior transfers in the Marion Maurice Estate, an overpayment of Federal Estate Tax in the amount of $17,215.28 was made. For this overpayment and resultant loss to the estate the appellants claimed the Executor should be surcharged.</p>

    <p id="b155-4" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[148,518,1149,704]]]'>Appellants’ claim for a surcharge against the Executor was presented to the court below on the basis of this stipulation. The court dismissed appellants’ objection to the Executor’s account and confirmed the account. The rationale of the court below was that it was the burden of appellants, seeking to surcharge the Executor for the overpayment of tax, to bear the burden of proving that the Executor had failed to exercise common prudence, common skill and common caution in the exercise of its fiduciary duty, and appellants had failed to sustain their claim to a surcharge. From the decree confirming the account the instant appeal was taken.</p>

An examination of the record indicates that the Executor received commissions of approximately $35,000.00, counsel for Executor received fees of approximately $35,000.00, and the accountants and tax consultants received fees in excess of $17,500.00. It is only reasonable and logical to expect that services so well compensated for should have been performed in a careful and skillful manner. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that the estate wherein the property had been previously taxed was represented by the present fiduciary, the present counsel for the Executor and the present firm of accountants and tax consultants.</p>
