L. 431, 49 P.S. §52, filed a petition for special listing with the administrative judge of Philadelphia County which should have been granted but was denied. The action came to trial on November 16, 1966. Before any testimony was taken, appellant filed a motion for judgment in its favor on the theory that the lien had been lost because appellee had failed to recover a verdict on its claim within five years from- the date of issue of the <em>sci. fa., </em>as required by §10 of the-Mechanics’ Lien Law of 1901.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial judge nevertheless permitted testimony • to be offered on behalf of appellee, after which appellant renewed its motion for judgment which was subsequently denied and judgment was then entered in favor' of appellee.

The statute must be followed whether strict or liberal, harsh or equitable.</p>

      <em>sci. fa. </em>As the lower court properly pointed out, under the rule adopted by the majority, “the mechanics lien . . . could be nullified in almost every case in Philadelphia County by the simple expedient of ordering it on the trial list for jury trial (unless the Court Administrator chooses to grant a special listing), since the Philadelphia jury trial list as it is now functioning requires more than five years after the motion for trial until a trial can be had.” Furthermore, the majority concedes that appellee “filed a petition for special listing . . . which should have been granted but was denied.” I cannot believe that the Legislature intended to put lienholders at the complete peril of delays which are either fortuitous or inherent in the judicial system as it presently operates. A more sensible reading of the five year requirement would bar a lienholder only if the reason for his not recovering a verdict within five years was due to his own fault. Since the court below found no such fault, and since I do not believe that such a finding is compelled by the record before us, I would affirm the judgment in favor of appellee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>
