Decedent was survived by her husband, Joseph, a minor at the time, and her parents, Elliott and Margaret Lovering. Elliott Lovering and Elizabeth Nudo, Joseph Pozzuolo’s grandmother, were appointed co-administrators of decedent’s estate.</p>

Under this contingent fee agreement, attorney Gorham was to institute a trespass action for damages arising from decedent’s death against Sabena World Airlines, the owner of the ill-fated <em>airplane; </em>for his services attorney Gorham was to receive one-third (1/3) of the amount recovered in the action.</p>

This firm suggested that attorney Gorham also retain the services of Kriendler and Kriendler. Kriendler and Kriendler, a firm well known for its legal work in aviation crash suits, was then handling several other suits arising from the same Sabena plane crash and had gathered valuable information concerning the cause of the crash which would enhance the strength of the decedent’s personal representatives’ claim for damages. From the information garnered by Kriendler and Kriendler, it was indicated that the crash had resulted from a defect in the construction of the particular airplane, and, on the basis of this information, suit could be justified not only against Sabena but also against Boeing Airplane Company, manufacturer of the plane.</p>

Lovering, as the remaining personal representative, takes the position that the fifty (50%) per cent contingent fee agreed upon included the fee not only of attorney Gorham but also of New York counsel as well and that the latter’s fee of $10,-000.00 should be paid out of the $22,500.00, which would render attorney Gorham’s net fee approximately $12,500.00.</p>

A wrongful death action is intended to secure compensation to certain statutorily-designated relatives of the decedent (Act of April 15, 1851, P. L. 669, §19, 12 P.S. §1601, and Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 309, §1, as amended, 12 P.S. §1602). Any sum recovered in a wrongful death action does not become an asset of the decedent’s estate.

The Orphans’ Court Act of 1951, section 301 clearly directs that “The Orphans’ Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of: . . . (13) Title to Personal Property. The adjudication of the title to personal property in the possession of the personal representative. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b242-9" data-blocks='[["BL_242.10",242,[204,1897,1153,486]],["BL_243.1",243,[175,368,1145,98]]]'>The comment to this section reinforces the conclusion that regardless of the source of such property, if the personal representative claims title to it, the orphans’ court is the exclusive tribunal to determine ownership. Section 301(13) “is intended to obviate, whenever possible, a preliminary dispute as to whether the orphans’ court has jurisdiction to determine the title to the disputed property.” If the orphans’ court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine ownership it cer<a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>tainly has jurisdiction to control and direct the personal representative’s handling of such funds.</p>
    <p id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[169,478,1150,808]]]'>I might agree with the majority’s result if the individual who held the disputed proceeds were someone other than the personal representative; but because of the personal representative’s unique fiduciary relationship with the orphans’ court, it is not only legislatively mandated but also appropriate that the orphans’ court decide this dispute. The alternative result, regretfully reached by the majority, is to place the burden of proceeding upon the statutory beneficiaries who must bring an action in common pleas court to recover the funds which belong to them. The better approach is to direct the personal representative to turn over the funds to the orphans’ court and then establish his claim in the appropriate forum. Therefore I would affirm the action of the court below.</p>
