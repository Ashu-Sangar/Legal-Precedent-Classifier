In such a posture we accept as true all well-pleaded facts in the complaint. In their amended complaint the Lynches and Luptaks averred: “12. As a result of defendants’ violation of the aforesaid zoning ordinance and due to the close proximity of plaintiffs’ and defendants’ buildings, plaintiffs have suffered special harm not common to all the property owners in the neighborhood as follows: (a) Plaintiffs will be subjected to a great increase of noise and congestion due to the fact that a larger number of families will be living in defendants’ building; (b) There will be an increase in the everyday automobile and delivery truck traffic in the close proximity of plaintiffs’ homes which deprives plaintiffs of the peaceful enjoyment of their homes, (c) Due to the fact that there is a parking lot in the rear of defendants’ building in which defendants’ tenants park, there will be added noise, confusion and commotion which deprive plaintiffs of the enjoyment of their property to the extent that they are entitled; (d) Due to the fact that there will be an excessive number of people living in the same area and due to the fact that defendants did not adhere to the building line requirements in the construction of their building, plaintiffs will be deprived of the privacy to which they are entitled to under the zoning ordinance aforesaid, (e) Due to the fact that defendants did not adhere to their building line requirements, plaintiffs are being deprived and will be deprived in the future of the light and air to which they are entitled to under the zoning ordinance; (f) Due to the fact that there will be an excessive num<a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>ber of people residing in a very close proximity to plaintiffs, plaintiffs will be subjected to the noise, congestion, and commotion of an excessive number of visitors and guests of defendants’ tenants.”</p>
