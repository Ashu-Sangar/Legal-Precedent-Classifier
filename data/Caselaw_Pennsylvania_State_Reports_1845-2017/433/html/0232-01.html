Decedent gave Clevenger and his wife ground rents on properties owned by decedent. In 1939 two notes payable to the Clevengers were given in lieu of the payment of the ground rent liability. When the two notes were signed, decedent pledged all of his stock in the said corporations as collateral for their payment. On December 1, 1939, Rosemary D. McClatchy, wife of executor John B. McClatchy, purchased the notes from the Clevengers and acquired decedent’s stock as collateral. On May 1, 1940, the parties who are now executors wrote letters to the corporations calling attention to the fact that the notes were in default because of nonpayment of interest and because the corporations were insolvent. The letters contained a demand for immediate payment. On May 13, 1940, the corporations, acting through decedent, replied to those letters stating that the companies were unable to pay the notes, that they were insolvent, and that <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>owing to their precarious financial position, it was hoped that no action would be taken which would result in bankruptcy. However, on June 1, 1940, the notes were foreclosed upon and the collateral (the stock) was sold to the parties who are now executors for $1.00, there being no competitive bidding by any other party. No notice of the sale was given to decedent.</p>
    <p id="b284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[205,809,1154,367]]]'>Appellants contend that this sale did not constitute a valid foreclosure because (1) the notes on which the sale was based were not in default since no interest or principal payments were due at the time of the foreclosure sale; (2) there was no default resulting from insolvency and (3) no notice of the sale was given to decedent.</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[196,1197,1161,1158]],["BL_285.1",285,[183,339,1151,541]]]'>It is a well accepted principle that heirs cannot have, interests in decedent’s property higher than those which decedent had himself. <em>Grossman v. Hill, </em><a href="/pa/384/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="384 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="1263137" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0590-01">384 Pa. 590</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%2069" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="122 A.2d 69">122 A. 2d 69</a> (1956), Page, Wills §59.2 (3d ed. 1962). Thus, if decedent could not have brought an action for the recovery of the stock, then neither could appellants. Appellants’ objection is based upon events which occurred between decedent and appellees during a period of time so far in advance of decedent’s death (20 years) that had decedent himself at the time of his death attempted to bring any such action based upon the event in question, his action would have been barred by the Statute of Limitations set forth in the Act of March 27, 1713, 1 Sm. L. 76, 12 P.S. §31, and the Act of March 28, 1867, P. L. 48, 12 P.S. §41, which limit the bringing of an action to a period no later than six years after the cause of action has accrued. Appellants contend, however, that the Statute of Limitations was tolled because of the concealment of the true situation from decedent with respect to the acquisition of the stock via the foreclosure proceedings. <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>We must reject this contention in light of the amount of time which passed between the foreclosure sale and decedent’s death, the benefits which decedent received from the corporations, and the fact that he personally had a part in reissuing the certificates of stock after the sale was made. Furthermore, certain memoranda written by decedent indicate that he was satisfied with the overall state of his business affairs and had no intention to change that state of affairs even if he had been able to do so.</p>
    <p id="b285-4" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[171,901,1157,823]]]'>Appellants further contend that the stock should be held in trust for decedent because the purchase of decedent’s stock by the parties who are now executors violated a confidential relationship which existed between them. The cases are clear that a parent-child relationship does not per se constitute a confidential relationship. <em>Null’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/302/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="302 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="1129068" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0064-01">302 Pa. 64</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20A.%20137" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="153 A. 137">153 Atl. 137</a> (1930); <em>Leedom v.

McClatchy for his efforts to preserve the family business during difficult times. We believe that this evidence is insufficient to indicate that decedent was or could have been imposed upon in 1940. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that at that time decedent was unable to handle his financial and business affairs or was in any way so completely dependent upon the executors so as to <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>create a confidential relationship which would then shift the burden onto the executors to prove the absence of fraud and that the transaction was fair and equitable, <em>Carson Estate, </em>supra; <em>Brooks v.

    <p id="b286-7" data-blocks='[["BL_286.7",286,[212,1275,1154,375]]]'>Appellants assert that the executors should be surcharged for these payments on the basis that Community’s claim was invalid because (1) the executors were guilty of self-dealing in recognizing and paying the claim and (2) there was no legal obligation on the estate to reimburse Community because any amount due was barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>
    <p id="b286-8" data-blocks='[["BL_286.8",286,[209,1661,1155,377]]]'>In order to justify this payment, the executors rely exclusively upon the testimony of a nonstockholder and salaried employee of Community.

    <p id="b286-9" data-blocks='[["BL_286.9",286,[208,2048,1154,321]]]'>.

The Statute of Limitations did not begin to run until Community’s cause of action had accrued and since that event did not occur until decedent died in 1960, appellants’ contention must fail.</p>
    <p id="b287-4" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[193,798,1147,202]]]'>We, therefore, are of the opinion that the executors acted properly in paying $63,322.74 to Community as reimbursement for the payment of life insurance premiums on the life of decedent.</p>

    <p id="b287-6" data-blocks='[["BL_287.6",287,[190,1157,1148,421]]]'>Appellants contend that the executors’ commissions of $5,000 and the attorneys’ fees of approximately $20,-000 should not be paid out of the estate. Appellants base this contention on the claim that the efforts of the executors and attorneys were directed towards preserving the interests of the executors individually and not towards preserving the interest of decedent’s estate.</p>

The fact that the objectors raised these issues, however, is not the fault of the executors, and the questions here under discussion could take on a serious mien only if the executors and their attorneys claimed additional fees for the present litigation which they have not. The executors and their counsel should certainly be compensated for the ordinary and normal work which they have done, and the responsibility assumed, which in an estate of this size, is considerable. <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>Probate, advertising, tax returns, and accounting are only some of the matters which have to date been handled by the executors and their attorneys.

These parcels were conveyed by decedent to executor John B. McClatchy in 1949. The deed recites that the consideration for the conveyances was $1.00 but John B. McClatchy testified that he actually paid $23,609.55.</p>

There is no evidence that in 1949, as in 1940, decedent was or could have been imposed upon. There is no evidence suggesting decedent was not mentally capable or that he was unaware of the consequences of his acts. As stated previously, decedent was of sound mind and business intellect so as to negate any finding of a confidential relationship.</p>

    <p id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[191,598,1150,819]]]'>The account indicates that $1,057.55 was paid by the executors from the estate to the 69th Street Community House Corporation and that the same amount was paid to the 69th and Ludlow Streets Building Corporations as refunds for salary “unearned” by decedent before his death. These claims are explained by the executors as follows: In 1960, decedent was being paid a salary of $15,000 per year by each corporation. Immediately preceding his death he had received a check from each corporation in the amount of $3,856. The refunds in question were calculated by determining arithmetically decedent’s weekly salary and then computing the number of weeks after his death for which he had drawn salary. The executors then repaid the corporation the sum so calculated.</p>
    <p id="b289-6" data-blocks='[["BL_289.6",289,[184,1433,1152,705]]]'>The lower court sustained the executors’ determination that these salary refunds were proper. The court said: “[i]t is certainly not for us here to determine why the salary was paid, although we may assume that it was not for current services, it was likely paid because it had been earned over many years through exercise of the recipient’s abilities, intellect and loyalty.” This Court also will not delve into the reasons for the payment but will accept the lower court’s designation of the payments as “salaries.” A man who is dead cannot receive a salary so that the refund of the $2115.10 to the corporations will not subject the executors to surcharge.</p>
