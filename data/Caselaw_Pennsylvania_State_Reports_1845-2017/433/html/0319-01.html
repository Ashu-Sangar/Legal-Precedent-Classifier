This boiler, manufactured by Boiler Engineering and Supply Company, Inc. (Boiler), contained a valve manufactured by General Controls, Inc. (General). This valve was not part of the original boiler but was sold as a replacement unit for a boiler which was already in existence. The explosion occurred when General’s valve stuck in the open position, permitting an excessive amount of fuel to enter the ignition chamber. The sticking of this valve was caused by an indentation in the face of the valve. General urges that the valve was manufactured as one with a 120 coil and was changed to one with a 220 coil, which change, alleged<a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>Iy, took place between the time the valve left General’s hands and the time it reached Friedman’s hands.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

On the theory that General had manufactured the valve which had been incorporated into the boiler and, therefore, allegedly was responsible for the defect in the valve which caused the explosion, Boiler joined General as an additional defendant on the alternative theories that General was liable, jointly or severally, to Burbage or that, in the event Boiler was held liable, General was liable by way of indemnity to Boiler.</p>

No remittitur was filed within the twenty-day period but Burbage later petitioned the court to file a remittitur <em>nunc pro tunc </em>after receiving the amount of the verdict, as reduced by the amount of the remittitur, from Boiler. The court below discharged the rule to file the remittitur on the theory that Burbage’s acceptance from Boiler of the amount of the verdict, as reduced by the remittitur, constituted a <em>de facto </em>acceptance of the remittitur.

Component Parts. The same problem [application of strict liability] arises in cases of the sale of a component part of a product to be assembled by another, as for example, a tire to be placed on a new automobile, a brake cylinder for the same purpose, or an instrument for the panel of an airplane. Again the question arises, <em>whether the responsibility is not shifted </em>to the assembler. <em>It is no doubt to be expected that where there is no change in the component part itself but it is merely incorporated into something larger, the strict liability will be found to cm-ry through to the ultimate user or consumer. </em>But in the absence of a sufficient number of decisions on the matter to justify a conclusion, the Institute expresses no opinion on the matter.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

      <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>It is pertinent to note that this particular valve was found by the jury to have been sold in a defective condition and without ever having undergone any substantial change subsequent to its original manufacture. The valve itself was to be ultimately incorporated into a boiler since it had no operative significance or independent utility apart therefrom. In similar situations other jurisdictions have determined that liability will be fastened on a component-part manufacturer when there had been no change in the part after it left the factory in which it was manufactured. See: <em>Deveny v. Rheem Manufacturing Co., </em><a href="/f2d/319/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="319 F.2d 124" data-case-ids="158144" data-case-paths="/f2d/319/0124-01">319 F. 2d 124</a> (2d Cir.

In view of the fact that the jury found no substantial change in the valve since manufacture and since it was to be merely incorporated into a larger product, we see no reason why liability should not carry through to the valve manufacturer, Genera], as the manufacturer of a defective component part.</p>
    <p id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[174,1465,1150,872]],["BL_374.1",374,[194,359,1150,256]]]'>General’s third contention is that, even if the product was defectively manufactured, the buyer (Boiler) knew or should have known of the defect and, therefore, voluntarily and unreasonably assumed the risk of the danger. We find no merit in this contention. Comment n of §!02A, supra, explicitly states: “Contributory negligence of the plaintiff is not a defense when such negligence consists merely in a failure to discover the defect in the product, as to guard against the possibility of its existence. On the other hand, the form of contributory negligence which consists in voluntarily and unreasonably proceeding to encounter a known danger, and commonly passes under the name of assumption of risk, is a defense under this Section as in other cases of strict liability. If the user or consumer discovers the defect and nevertheless proceeds <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>unreasonably to make use of the product and is injured by it, he is barred from recovery.” There is no evidence whatsoever that Boiler did, in fact, discover the defect before proceeding to utilize and market the valve.</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[188,635,1156,927]]]'>We also hold that Boiler did not assume the risk by using the valve because there is no reason why it should have discovered the defect. Since this particular valve was merely sold as a unit and was not affixed to the boiler prior to its being sold to decedent’s employer but was sold as a replacement unit to be affixed to a boiler already in operation, we conclude that there was no reason why Boiler should be primarily liable. If such a valve was affixed prior to the entire product being sold to the purchaser, i.e., Friedman and Sons, Inc., then it might be said that the primary responsibility for the defect was shifted to the intermediate party, i.e., Boiler, since it presumably would have tested the boiler. Since that was not the situation in this case, it is necessary to conclude that the responsibility for discovery and prevention of the defect lay solely with General.</p>

The right of indemnity rests upon a difference between the primary and secondary liability of two persons each of whom is made responsible by law to an injured party. The right to indemnity enures to a person who, without active fault on his own part, has been compelled by reason of some legal obligation to pay damages occasioned by the negligence of another. The difference between primary and secondary liability is not based on a difference in degrees of negligence or on any doctrine of comparative negligence but rather on a difference in the <em>character </em>or <em>kind </em>of the wrongs which cause the injury and in the nature of the legal <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>obligation owed by each of the wrongdoers to the injured person. Secondary as distinguished from primary liability rests upon a fault that is imputed or constructive only, being based on some legal obligation between the parties or arising from some positive rule of statutory or common law or because of a failure to discover or correct a defect or remedy a dangerous condition caused by the act of the one primarily responsible. <em>Builders Supply Co. v.

Instead, Burbage sued Boiler. It would be transparent reasoning of the highest order to conclude that recovery could not be had by Boiler from General in the nature of indemnity. Nothing Boiler did exonerated General from being primarily liable for the accident. First, Boiler had no duty to inspect which would have precluded it from recovery under the assumption of risk provision in §402A. Second, the jury determined upon the basis of sufficient evidence that there was no substantial change in the valve subsequent to its leaving General’s hands.</p>
