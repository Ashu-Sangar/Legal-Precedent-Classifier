In my view, this disposition was erroneous.\nIt is fundamental that contributory negligence exists as a matter of law only where there is no reasonable basis for holding otherwise under the facts of the case. Cushey v. Plunkard, 413 Pa. 116, 196 A. 2d 295 (1964). I am not convinced that under all of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence in the instant case that there is no room for \u201cfair and reasonable disagreement\u201d as to the plaintiff\u2019s negligence.\nI dissent, and would reverse the judgment of the lower court and would enter judgment on the verdict returned by the jury.\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien and Mr. Justice Roberts join in this dissent.",
