        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellant and decedent emerged from a bar and engaged in an altercation during which the deceased was fatally stabbed by appellant. Appellant claimed self-defense. The jury found her not guilty of murder but guilty of voluntary manslaughter and appellant took this appeal.\nAppellant contended at trial that she stabbed the deceased only after he had beaten her. In attempting to establish his assaultive tendencies, she testified that on two prior occasions the deceased had attacked and beaten her. On cross-examination, the Commonwealth asked appellant whether she had stabbed the deceased three weeks before his death. Appellant\u2019s objection was overruled, and she now claims that the question violated the Act of March 15, 1911, P. L. 20, \u00a71, 19 P.S. 711, which forbids asking a criminal defendant \u201cany question tending to show that he has committed, or been charged with, or been convicted of any offense other than the one wherewith he shall then be charged, or tending to show that he has been of bad character or reputation,\u201d unless he first puts his own character or reputation in issue. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Smith, 432 Pa. 517, 248 A. 2d 24 (1968).\nEven assuming arguendo that appellant is correct in contending that the Act of 1911 bars asking a question about a prior act for which there has been no arrest or conviction, this case still falls without the act\u2019s coverage. The Act of 1911 \u201cwas intended merely to prevent blackening a defendant\u2019s reputation or attempting to prove a disposition to commit crime, but if there is another legitimate purpose . . . the Act of 1911 does not prohibit the Commonwealth from such interrogation . . . .\u201d Commonwealth v. Heller, 369 Pa. 457, 463, 87 A. 2d 287, 289-90 (1952). In the Heller case, the questioning was used not merely to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility but to establish motive, a substantive element of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The same is true here, where the Commonwealth was attempting to prove by past behavior who was more likely to have been the aggressor, a crucial inquiry where appellant is claiming self-defense.\nIn attempting to establish self-defense, appellant herself put in issue the past relationship of the parties. Her aim, of course, was to establish that she had acted reasonably in protecting herself. Thus had decedent inflicted beatings on appellant in the past, she might have been justified in using deadly force to protect herself in the present case. The Commonwealth\u2019s inquiry was merely an attempt to rebut part of appellant\u2019s substantive case by establishing that she, not decedent, had been the aggressor in the past. The Act of 1911 was not intended to prevent the Commonwealth from rebutting or disproving part of the substantive defense which appellant had already tried to advance.\nAppellant next contends that it was error for the court below to allow a pathologist to read into evidence the report of a toxicologist which indicated that the deceased was intoxicated at the time of his death. Appellant claims that this was hearsay and not within the Business Records Act, Act of May 4, 1989, P. L. 42, 28 P.S. \u00a791a, and in any event, that it violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. We need not decide these questions, however, since we can find no way in which appellant possibly could have been prejudiced by the admission of the toxicologist\u2019s report. It is hard to see for exactly what purpose the Commonwealth introduced this evidence. Evidence of the deceased\u2019s intoxication would if anything at all seem to support appellant\u2019s self-defense claim, and appellant certainly was not harmed by its use.\nFinally appellant challenges the jury charge as to self-defense. The judge told the jury that \u201cto justify a homicide as committed in self-defense, there must be an actual imminent peril of life, or, of great bodily harm, or a reasonable belief founded on facts as they appear at the time of such imminent peril or great bodily harm. In addition, there must be no other means of escape if the alleged attack takes place in the street, as alleged in this case.\u201d This charge was perfectly clear and properly stated the law. See Commonwealth v. Collazo, 407 Pa. 494, 180 A. 2d 903 (1962); Commonwealth v. Vassar, 370 Pa. 551, 88 A. 2d 725 (1952); Commonwealth v. Drum, 58 Pa. 9 (1868).\nThe judgment of the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Philadelphia County is affirmed.\nMr. Justice Eagen dissents.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien:\nI cannot subscribe to the majority\u2019s interpretation of the Act of 1911. That Act forbids asking a criminal defendant \u201cany question tending to show that he has committed\\, or been charged with, or been convicted of any offense other than the one wherewith he shall then be charged, or tending to show that he has been of bad character or reputation,\u201d (emphasis added) unless he first puts his own character or reputation in issue. To this one exception, the majority by judicial legislation adds another \u2014 unless the defendant claims self-defense. In that situation the majority would allow the Commonwealth \u201cto prove by past behavior who was more likely to have been the aggressor.\u201d This is the very evil which the statute is designed to prevent. In fact, Commonwealth v. Heller, 369 Pa. 457, 87 A. 2d 287 (1952), upon which the majority relies, far from supporting the majority\u2019s position, actually destroys it. Heller states, at page 463, that the purpose of the Act is \u201cto prevent blackening a defendant\u2019s reputation or attempting to prove a disposition to commit crime.\u201d The fact that in Heller the Commonwealth was permitted to cross-examine as to a crime, adultery, in order to show motive, in no way supports allowing the Commonwealth in the instant case to cross-examine \u201cto prove by past behavior who was more likely to have been the aggressor.\u201d The majority is thus allowing the Commonwealth \u201cto prove a disposition to commit crime\u201d, which Heller tells us is the very proscription of the statute.\nMoreover, even if this line of questioning would in some instances be permissible, surely the instant case is not one of them. When the Commonwealth asked appellant whether she had stabbed the decedent three weeks prior to his death, appellant\u2019s counsel objected, asked that the question be stricken, and moved for the withdrawal of a juror. A conference in chambers then took place as follows: \u201cThe Court: I will overrule your motion for the withdrawal of a juror. Mr. Johnson : If your Honor please, inasmuch as you have overruled my motion for the withdrawal of a juror, I specifically request your Honor at this time and in your final charge to the jury, to specifically instruct them to ignore the question and the answer, that they have nothing to do with this case, that it has no bearing, that there is no testimony that anything of this event ever occurred, and they should not consider it in their deliberations. The Court: This is cross-examination, and the prior conduct of the parties certainly is in issue \u2014 their entire relationship, which you, yourself, in direct examination have tried to elicit, and which the District Attorney has a right to establish it was not always as good as she has tried to present. And furthermore, if by competent evidence the District Attorney can prove that she did in fact cut him, he may\u2014 by competent evidence. Mr. Johnson : Your Honor then denies my request for the instructions? The Court: Yes, I do. Mr. Johnson: Very well.\u201d Still assuming that in a proper case this sort of question may be asked, I could not fault the trial judge for not granting the motion to strike at this point. However, when the Commonwealth declined the court\u2019s obvious invitation to follow up the question with some sort of concrete evidence, the court abused its discretion in failing to charge the jury to ignore this highly prejudicial question. Compare Wigmore, 3d Ed., Yol. Ill, \u00a7983. It should have been apparent at this point that the Commonwealth was either trying to besmirch appellant\u2019s reputation by the question alone or was on an impermissible fishing expedition. By contrast, in Heller, the Commonwealth called as a witness Heller\u2019s sister-in-law, who actually testified as to Heller\u2019s adultery with her. Thus, even if the Act of 1911 permitted the Commonwealth\u2019s questioning in the instant case, basic notions of fairness in the examination of witnesses forbade it.\nI dissent.\nMr. Justice Cohen joins in this dissenting opinion.\nAct of March 15, 1911, P.
