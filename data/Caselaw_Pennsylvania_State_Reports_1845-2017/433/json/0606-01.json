Plaintiff was working in a ditch on Columbia Avenue in Philadelphia when the rear wheel of ..a .bus drove partially over the ditch and struck plaintiff as he raised himself up to throw a shovelful of dirt out of the ditch. Defendant requests judgment n.o.v. on the grounds that defendant was not negligent and, in any event, plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.\nThe evidence as to defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was conflicting, and therefore the issues were for the jury.\nJudgment affirmed.",
