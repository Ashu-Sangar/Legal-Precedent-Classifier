        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThis is an appeal from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Montgomery County dismissing objections to the account of John B. McClatchy, executor of the estate of Mary E. McClatchy, deceased. This case was tried as a companion case in the court below with Me Clatchy Estate, also decided today. 433 Pa. 232, 249 A. 2d 330 (1969).\nAppellants, heirs under the will of decedent, seek to surcharge the executor for his failure to include the following items in decedent\u2019s estate:\n(1) $59,849.25 paid to the 69th Street Community House Corporation for life insurance premiums advanced on policies on the life of decedent\u2019s husband. .\n(2) Amounts paid by the estate for the executor\u2019s commission and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nI Life Insurance Premiums\nBetween 1946 and 1957, the 69th Street Community House Corporation paid life insurance premiums on policies owned by decedent on the life of her husband in the amount of $59,849.25. The executor\u2019s account disclosed that Community was reimbursed by the es.tate for the premiums paid.\nUnlike the situation which existed in the McClatchy Estate, supra, there is no evidence that there was any oral or written agreement between decedent and Community for repayment of those premiums. In order to justify this payment the executor relies exclusively upon testimony concerning a statement made by decedent\u2019s husband to an employee of Community. However, there is no evidence that in making this statement decedent\u2019s husband was acting as an agent of decedent and/or had the power to commit her or her estate to any obligation. Consequently, we are of the opinion that the payment of $59,849.25 to Community was improper, and that the executor should be surcharged for that amount.\nII Executor\u2019s Commission and Attorneys\u2019 Pees\nAppellants argue that the estate should not pay the executor\u2019s commission and attorneys\u2019 fees when the services of the executor and the attorneys were directed primarily toward proving that certain assets were not includable in the estate.\nWe reject this argument for the same reasons enunciated in our decision in the McClatchy Estate, supra. The executor\u2019s commission of $7,225 and the attorneys\u2019 fees of approximately $8,750 are reasonable and proper in light of the fact that the net balance of decedent\u2019s estate was in excess of $250,000. Furthermore, there is no evidence indicating that the executor and the attorneys claimed additional fees for the present litigation.\nWe therefore are of the opinion that appellants\u2019 objection as to the propriety of paying the executor\u2019s commission and attorneys\u2019 fees from the estate are without merit and should be dismissed.\nDecree reversed in part and affirmed in part and the case remanded to the court below to enter a decree consistent with this opinion. Costs on appellee.\nMr. Justice Musmanno did not participate in the decision of this case.",

        "text": "Concurring and Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Boberts:\nI agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion as to the executor\u2019s commission and attorneys\u2019 fees. However, I am unable to agree with the majority that the executor should be surcharged for his reimbursement to the 69th Street Community House Corporation for the life insurance premiums the latter had paid on a policy on the life of John McClatehy. The decision of this Court in the companion case, McClatchy Estate, 433 Pa. 232, 249 A. 2d 320 (1969), compels a result contrary to the one the majority now reaches. In that case, this Court concludes that there was sufficient testimony to find an agreement between John McClatchy (Mary\u2019s husband) and Community creating a legally enforceable obligation on John McClatchy\u2019s Estate to reimburse Community for tbe amount of premiums Community paid on the policy on John McClatchy\u2019s life. The same testimony which supported this finding was used by the court below to find that there was a binding agreement as to the repayment of the premiums from proceeds of the policy in issue here.\nHowever, the majority opinion somehow feels compelled to distinguish this policy because the proceeds were to go to a different estate, and concludes that Mary\u2019s estate need not reimburse Community for these premiums. This it does by concluding that \u201cthere is no evidence that in making this statement [which created the obligation] decedent\u2019s husband was acting as an agent of decedent and/or had the power to commit her or her estate to any obligation.\u201d\nIn my view decedent\u2019s husband no more needed the authority of an agent or the power to commit his wife\u2019s estate than a rich uncle needs permission to will his woebegotten nephew $>1,000,000. What happened here is quite clear. Mary McClatehy\u2019s husband wished to secure an insurance policy on his life and make her estate the beneficiary thereof. But he was unable or did not care to pay the premiums himself, and there is clear evidence that he arranged for Community to pay them with the understanding that Community would be reimbursed for all the premiums it paid on the policy. John McClatchy in effect did not commit his wife\u2019s estate to do anything. What he actually did was to agree with Community that his wife\u2019s estate would receive the proceeds of this insurance, less the amount paid by Community for premiums. The fact that the entire proceeds were first paid into the estate before the reimbursement claim was filed should not change the result. The arrangements were entirely between John McClatchy and Community and the court below properly held that under them Community was entitled to reimbursement. I would affirm the court below.\nMr. Justice O\u2019Bkien joins in this opinion.\nThe curious reasoning of the majority in this case and its companion produces a, combined result which is strange indeed. The majority acknowledges that there was an agreement for the repayment of the premiums. Since it then concludes that there is no responsibility on the part of the estate to repay the excess proceeds, it appears that Community\u2019s agreement to be reimbursed out of the proceeds is a meaningless one. The result of this disposition is twofold: it creates a cost free windfall for Mary\u2019s estate from life insurance proceeds the premiums for which were paid by neither Mary nor her husband; it leaves Community with not even a hint of where it should turn to seek the reimbursement to which it has every reason to think it is entitled. By viewing the two majority opinions side by side the impression is that no one is responsible to Community. This just should not be so.\nThus the- estate was obligated to do nothing but receive the gratuitous payment of the net proceeds of the insurance policies.",
