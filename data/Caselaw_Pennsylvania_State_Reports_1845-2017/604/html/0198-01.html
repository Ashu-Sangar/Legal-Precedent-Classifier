Officer Ortiz knew the neighborhood as a high crime area in which narcotics, and specifically heroin, regularly were sold. The area was designated by the Philadelphia Police Department as an “Operation Safe Streets” neighborhood. Officer Ortiz, a nine-year veteran of the police <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>force, and his partner, Officer Correa, were in plainclothes and driving an unmarked vehicle. Officer Ortiz saw a car parked by the sidewalk and observed Appellant standing in the street by the driver’s side door. Officer Ortiz watched Appellant hand the male driver some money and saw the driver give Appellant a small object in return. Based on what he saw on the street and what he knew, including the fact that he had made several hundred narcotics arrests of this very type, Officer Ortiz believed the men were engaged in a drug transaction. Officer Ortiz stopped Appellant and recovered from his pocket a packet of heroin. Officer Correa approached the driver and ultimately recovered two packets of heroin from his hand and an additional 14 packets from his person.</p>

The dissent relies heavily on this Court’s <em>Lawson </em>decision in support of its claim that an officer's experience is not a factor affecting probable cause. <em>See </em>Dissenting Opinion at 227, 985 A.2d at 946 ("conspicuously absent from [Lawson’s] list of ... circumstances is the subjective opinion of the police officer, standing alone ... based solely upon his or her general police training, or past observations of other transactions.”). First, we do not hold that probable cause may be based on a police officer's subjective opinion standing alone. Rather, we conclude that a police officer’s experience is a relevant factor in the probable cause inquiry as long as it has specific application to the circumstances at hand. Moreover, the dissent’s reliance on <em>Lawson </em>in this context is flawed. <em>Lawson </em>does not set out an exhaustive list of all possible factors affecting probable cause; it sets out a list of the factors present <em>in that case. </em>That <em>Lawson, </em>decided over 35 years ago, did not discuss the arresting officer's experience in drug trafficking does not mean that this Court deemed such experience irrelevant. <em>Lawson </em>sets a fundamental standard that makes this fact clear.

This personally held view, the dissent reasons, combined with the officer's prior observations of drug transactions just like this one, were "rooted in past unrelated events, and do not, in and of themselves, establish a fair probability that this particular transaction was criminal in nature, absent other surrounding indicia of criminality.” Dissenting Opinion at 238, 985 A.2d at 952. We note our disagreement with the dissent’s reasoning on two distinct grounds. To begin, it was not only Officer Ortiz’s personal experience that the neighborhood he was patrolling was one that involved frequent drug trafficking, although the officer, in light of his experience in this area, clearly held such an opinion. Instead, the area had been designated as an Operation Safe Streets neighborhood. Thus, the Philadelphia Police Department had reached the conclusion, independent of any one officer’s personal “opinion" or "perspective,” that the neighborhood was a dangerous one. Secondly, we respectfully disagree that a neighborhood’s designation as dangerous and an officer’s prior observations of drug transactions there are somehow irrelevant as "rooted in past unrelated events.” Police officers patrolling our streets and endeavoring to keep our citizens safe are wise to pay close attention to every detail of their surroundings. It is simply illogical to ignore those details, or to conclude that an officer’s experience regarding them is not a "relevant factor” informing the probable cause inquiry.</p>

Nonetheless, we note that the circumstances surrounding the transaction here — a small packet exchanged for money from a pedestrian to a driver at night on a street corner in a manner consistent with hundreds of prior drug transactions — do not constitute a substantial overlap with legitimate behavior. We conclude that the additional fact that the neighborhood in question had been specially designated by the police department is a relevant factor. Moreover, contrary to Justice Baer’s Concurring and Dissenting Opinion in this case, our conclusion does not elevate this factor above any other relevant factor.

While probable cause is a fluid concept, and requires only a showing that criminal activity <em>may </em>be reasonably inferred from a set of circumstances and need not be shown to, in fact, exist we must nonetheless remain true to its purposes, one of which is protecting citizens from arbitrary police intrusions. If we were to conclude that a police officer’s experience was a factor to be added to <em>every </em>probable cause determination, rather than serve as a lens through which to view the facts, then every time an experienced officer begins a shift, probable cause begins to be assessed against all citizens every time they fall under the watchful eye of a suspicious officer who has been on the job for a meaningful period of time. The danger of this, of course, is the potential for innocent citizens being unlawfully seized and/or searched, i.e., being searched or seized with less than probable cause.</blockquote>

An exchange of money for a small object is also associated with the purchase of a bus pass or subway token, a cigarette, cigar, candy bar, and an innumerable host of other lawful objects. <em>See </em>William E.
