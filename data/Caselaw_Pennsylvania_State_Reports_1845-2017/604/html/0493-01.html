Christopher immediately began walking away from Appellant. When Christopher was about seven feet from Appellant, Appellant fired two more shots at him. One of the bullets hit Christopher in his thigh and the other hit him in his right flank. The bullet that struck Christopher in his flank caused damage to his right kidney, liver, and chest wall. Christopher stumbled away and collapsed against a parked car. He asked Williams to help him but Williams declined.</p>

No relief would have been due Appellant even had these claims been preserved as Appellant cannot meet any of the prongs comprising the ineffectiveness standard. With respect to the failure to obtain the victim’s clothing, police have no obligation to affirmatively seek out evidence. <em>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, counsel acted reasonably by foregoing a claim alleging that the police had been negligent, which had little, if any chance of succeeding, in favor of arguing that the loss of the clothing inured to Appellant's benefit. Finally, Appellant has failed to establish that had the police secured the clothing, the outcome herein would have been different. Appellant's assertion that trial counsel was derelict in failing to argue that the police were negligent in their investigation of the shooting lacks merit because the record shows that the police conducted a full investigation once diey learned all of the facts related to the incident, including that the victim had not been shot in the location where he was found. In addition, Appellant cannot establish that he was prejudiced by the alleged negligence of the police as he has failed to identify any piece of exculpatory evidence the police failed to gather due to their alleged negligence.</p>
