He arrived at the scene within a few minutes, to find a vehicle at the top of a hillside in some brush, rotated 180 degrees. Paul A. Segida (“Appellee”), who with his brother was standing near the vehicle, acknowledged that he was the owner of the vehicle, that he had been driving, and that he had lost control of the vehicle after he started arguing with his brother. While conversing with Appellee, Officer Hillyard detected a strong odor of alcohol coming from his person. Upon further questioning, Appellee admitted that he had been drinking at one of the local clubs and had been driving home when the accident occurred. Officer Hillyard then asked Appellee to perform three field sobriety tests, all of which Appellee performed very badly. Based on the field sobriety test results, Officer Hillyard concluded that Appellee was incapable of safely driving at that time, and accordingly placed Appellee under arrest and drove him to a hospital to have his blood alcohol level tested. The test results revealed that Appellee had a very high blood alcohol level: 0.326 percent.</p>

In contrast to subsections 3802(a)(2), (b), and (c), all of which require that the offender’s blood alcohol level reach a certain specified elevation within two hours of driving, there is no time element explicitly delineated in subsection 3802(a)(1). However, to avoid absurd applications of subsection 3802(a)(1), a time element obviously must be inferred. Without the inference of some rational and reasonable temporal link between drinking and driving, then a motorist would violate the statute by driving at any time — even days or weeks — after having imbibed sufficient alcohol to be rendered incapable of safely driving.

Reliance on the plain meaning of the statutory language leads to the logical and reasonable conclusion that driving is proscribed only during the span of time when one is incapable of safely driving. <em>See </em>subsection 3802(a)(1) (“An individual may not drive ... after imbibing a sufficient amount of alcohol such that the individual is rendered incapable of safely driv<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>ing....”).

The title of Section 3802 is “Driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance,” a phrase that can only imply driving-while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance. The mischief to be remedied by the statute is certainly driving while under the influence of alcohol and thereby endangering the public, oneself, and property; and the object to be attained by the statute is the prevention of driving while under the influence of alcohol.

The necessity for the two hour time limit in subsections 3802(a)(2), (b), and (c) is grounded in the practical impossibility either of measuring blood alcohol level precisely at the time of driving or of calculating the exact blood alcohol level at the time of driving from a single blood alcohol measurement taken at some point in time after driving. <em>See Duda </em>at 1141.

With regard to <em>Williams, </em>the Commonwealth argues that the <em>en banc </em>Superior Court determined that subsection "3802(a)(1) does not contemplate the time of driving" and the elements of the offense do not include the time of driving. Commonwealth’s Brief at 24, 21. The Commonwealth cites the following footnote from <em>Williams </em>to support this argument:</p>

In addition, the Superior Court held that Appellee waived constitutionally based challenges to 75 Pa.C.S. § 3802 because they had not been raised with sufficient precision in Appellee's Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statement. <em>Segida, </em><a href="/a2d/912/0841-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="912 A.2d 841" data-case-ids="8444342" data-case-paths="/a2d/912/0841-01">912 A.2d at 845</a>.

This statute is ambiguous because the word “after” can be defined in more than one way, <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>and does not express a clear requirement of temporal concurrence of driving and incapability. One could read this statute to mean that once one imbibes to the requisite level, one may never drive again, for any subsequent driving would literally be “after” the imbibing. Such an interpretation, however, would be absurd. Clearly, this is not what “after” means here.</p>
    <p id="b167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[106,697,1157,734]]]'>“After” can mean literally any time following the event. <em>See </em>Webster’s New Universal Abridged Dictionary 34 (2d deluxe ed. 1983). This definition is appropriate when interpreting statements such as “After the Civil War, slavery was abolished.” But “after” can also require proximity, meaning “next to.” <em>See <a href="/a2d/912/0841-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="912 A.2d 841" data-case-ids="8444342" data-case-paths="/a2d/912/0841-01">id.</a> </em>If a baseball fan asks, “Who bats after Rollins?,” the answer is Victorino. In one sense, everyone in the lineup bats after Rollins — indeed, Rollins eventually bats after himself — but in this context, “after” means “next,” and that is clearly the meaning of the word “after” in this statute. The driving must be temporally proximate to imbibing to the requisite degree; once the requisite inability to drive safely passes as sobriety returns, driving is no longer proximate and one may drive without offending the statute.</p>
    <p id="b167-6" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[106,1455,1158,309]]]'>However, under § 3802(a)(1), there is no need for proof that inability coexisted with the time of driving. There is only need for proof of imbibing to the requisite degree and the temporally proximate “after” event of driving. Unlike under the prior statute, the two events need not intersect; the proof required is that driving occurred after drinking.</p>
    <p id="b167-7" data-blocks='[["BL_167.6",167,[103,1789,1159,572]],["BL_168.1",168,[286,314,1150,626]]]'>The statutory changes eliminated proof of condition at time of driving, previously an element of the offense. Rather than effectuating the legislature’s clear purpose of condemning driving after too many drinks, the prior element was too often dependent on almost whimsical expert opinion testimony. Cases such as the present one show the salient purpose of the modification to the law that eliminated that element. The officer found a one-car accident but could not tell precisely when it happened; he could make an educated guess about the time of driving, but he could not be specific. He knew the driver had been imbibing before the accident — he had physical <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>evidence, an admission, and eventually blood alcohol content test results. The officer could clearly opine the driver was incapable of safely driving at the time the officer arrived, which was after the imbibing. However, to opine that the driver was likewise incapacitated at the time of driving would require some degree of speculation, as the officer did not see the driver while he was driving. Common sense would force the conclusion that incapacity and driving coexisted, but proving the obvious was often problematic, if not impossible. The legislature eliminated this loophole by making it illegal to drink to this extent and drive thereafter; no proof the two coexisted is needed.</p>
    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[287,979,1150,417]]]'>This does not mean the prosecution’s burden is absolved. There still must be proof of incapacity, that drinking preceded the driving, and that the pre-driving imbibing caused the incapacity. All that is removed from § 3802 is the need to “relate back” to a precise time of driving. This was the very concept behind the language modification in the DUI statutes, and I respectfully dissent from the contrary interpretation espoused by my colleagues.</p>
