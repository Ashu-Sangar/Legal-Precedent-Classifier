In keeping with this noted shorthand for DOT, the body of the complaint referred to DOT throughout as “Defendant Commonwealth.” Specifically, the complaint thereafter alleged that Mrs. Piehl suffered an injury in the form of two broken ankles on March 13, 2003, when she slipped and fell while disembarking from a SEPTA bus near the corner of Allegheny and Aramingo Avenue in Philadelphia as a result of stepping onto a large uneven portion of the roadway. The complaint further alleged that the incident occurred because of the improper design, construction, deterioration and defects in the area where it appeared that repairs to the roadway had been initiated but never completed. Thus, according to the complaint, the fall and resulting injuries were the result of the negligence of “the Defendants City and Commonwealth” because of their failure to maintain the area in a safe condition.

Further, Piehls pointed out that the Attorney General, in its answer to the complaint, did not specifically deny the allegation in paragraph 4 of the complaint naming DOT as a defendant, therefore, they claimed this allegation was deemed admitted pursuant to Pa.R.C.P.

Thus, in addition to seeking the trial court’s dismissal of the Attorney General’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, Piehls requested that they be <a id="p665" href="#p665" data-label="665" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*665</a>permitted to amend the caption of their complaint to include DOT.</p>

The court declined to address whether amendment of the caption was appropriate as it did not view such issue as encompassed within the Commonwealth’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. In this regard, however, the court stated that it could not infer Piehls’ intentions regarding who should have been sued, rather, the court concluded that the suit was against the Commonwealth, as specified in the caption, and that the Commonwealth was entitled to dismissal of the suit against it based upon immunity.</p>

There, we held that plaintiffs, who initiated a wrongful death and survival action solely against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and two John Doe defendants, could not amend their complaint to include a Commonwealth agency after the statute of limitations period had run. We reasoned that because the plaintiffs only named the Commonwealth, to which the legislature has not waived sovereign immunity, and failed to name a specific Commonwealth party, to which immunity has been waived, the substitution of one for the other after the limitations period had expired would amount to the addition of a new party not merely the correction of a captioned party name.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Moreover, we found that permitting a plaintiff simply <a id="p667" href="#p667" data-label="667" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*667</a>to name the Commonwealth, as opposed to the discrete Commonwealth agency alleged to be at fault, would cause the Commonwealth significant hardship as a suing party “would be under no compulsion to act with due diligence in determining the correct party, regardless of the fact that the correct party would have neither notice of the suit nor repose from it.” <em><a href="/a2d/735/1256-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="735 A.2d 1256" data-case-ids="11543731,838597" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/1256-01,/pa/558/0170-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/735/1256-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="735 A.2d 1256" data-case-ids="11543731,838597" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/1256-01,/pa/558/0170-01">at 1259</a>.</p>
    <p id="b709-4" data-blocks='[["BL_709.5",709,[148,706,1152,1043]]]'>The court then examined its own cases regarding amendment to pleadings where the Commonwealth is named and the plaintiff seeks to amend its pleadings after the statute of limitations has run to name a discrete Commonwealth agency. Specifically, the court considered its prior decision in <em>Glover v. </em>SEPTA, <a href="/a2d/794/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="794 A.2d 410" data-case-ids="9441179" data-case-paths="/a2d/794/0410-01">794 A.2d 410</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2002). There, the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging she sustained injuries while exiting a bus in Philadelphia. The caption of the complaint named “the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office”, but did not include DOT. The body of the complaint did, on one occasion, refer to DOT as a defendant in the case. Nevertheless, the substantive allegations in the complaint did not name DOT specifically. The Attorney General, in answer to the complaint, replied that any references in the complaint made to DOT referred to a non-party and, therefore, no answer to these claims was required. Thus, the Attorney General sought dismissal of the Commonwealth on the grounds of sovereign immunity. The trial court, in <em>Glover, </em>granted the Commonwealth’s motion and the Commonwealth Court affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b709-5" data-blocks='[["BL_709.6",709,[145,1783,1153,471]],["BL_710.1",710,[284,317,1155,191]]]'>The final case that the Commonwealth Court examined was its prior decision in <em>Hall v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>110 Pa. Cmwlth. 199, <a href="/pa-commw/110/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="532 A.2d 894" data-case-ids="1364552" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/110/0199-01">532 A.2d 894</a> (1987). In <em>Hall, </em>the court permitted a plaintiff to amend the caption to their complaint to include DOT after the statute of limitations expired where the caption only named the Commonwealth and Thomas Larsen, Secretary of Transportation. The court reasoned that amendment was permissible because the naming of the Secretary was sufficient to conclude that the Secretary’s agency had <a id="p668" href="#p668" data-label="668" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*668</a>been involved in the litigation from the moment the suit was filed. Therefore, the court concluded that the omission of DOT in the caption was a technical defect that could be corrected.</p>
    <p id="b710-4" data-blocks='[["BL_710.4",710,[282,540,1157,1426]]]'>In examining these three cases, the Commonwealth Court concluded that this case was more like <em>Hall, </em>where it concluded that amendment of the caption after the statute of limitations had run was the correction of a technical defect rather than the addition of a new party. The court rejected the Commonwealth’s assertions that <em>Glover </em>and <em>Tork-Hiis </em>governed the case and required a different outcome. Specifically, the court distinguished <em>Glover </em>and <em>Tork-Hiis, </em>noting, <em>inter alia, </em>that in <em>Glover, </em>there was a single reference to DOT in the body of the complaint and that in <em>Tork-Hiis, </em>there was no reference to any Commonwealth agency in either the caption or the body of the complaint. In contrast, here, DOT was named in the body of the complaint and continually referenced, by way of Piehls’ defined term for DOT, “defendant Commonwealth”, throughout the body of the complaint. Along these same lines, the court rejected the Commonwealth’s argument that <em>Tork-Hiis </em>established a bright-line rule that the caption is the exclusive way to establish party status after the statute of limitations has run. Instead, the court concluded that where, as here, the correct party is sued (in this case by being referenced throughout the complaint) but under a wrong designation (here, by failing to name the agency of the Commonwealth in the caption), correction to the party name should be allowed. <em>Piehl, </em><a href="/a2d/930/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="930 A.2d 607" data-case-ids="8350119" data-case-paths="/a2d/930/0607-01">930 A.2d at 617</a>. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court and concluded that the amendment to the caption of the complaint requested by Piehls should have been permitted.</p>

    <p id="b711-4" data-blocks='[["BL_711.4",711,[135,562,1158,1071]]]'>In its appeal, as it did below, the Commonwealth advocates that only the caption to a complaint is relevant for purposes of determining whether a party has been sued and that the mention of a party in the body of the complaint is irrelevant.

In this regard and citing our decision in <em>Tork-Hiis, </em>the Commonwealth asserts that it and its various agencies, such as DOT, are distinct legal parties that are not interchangeable. Thus, the Commonwealth argues that Piehls’ failure to include DOT, a discrete Commonwealth agency, in the caption to its complaint prior to the running of the statute of limitations was fatal, and the Commonwealth Court erred in permitting amendment at this stage, which unfairly resulted in allowing the addition of a new party to the lawsuit after the limitations period had expired.</p>

Such a result is unwarranted and <a id="p670" href="#p670" data-label="670" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*670</a>would suggest that litigants need not follow the rules of procedure when drafting a complaint.</p>

There, we concluded that the plaintiff could not amend her complaint after the statute of limitations to change the name of the defendant from Anthony to Robert, despite the fact that there were strong indications in the complaint that the plaintiff intended to sue Robert.

Moreover, we cannot conclude that prejudice will result to the Commonwealth if amendment is permitted because the Attorney General, who is charged with representing both the Commonwealth and DOT, was aware of DOT being named in the suit and served, but, rather than enter an appearance on behalf of DOT, chose to appear solely on behalf of the Commonwealth. In addition, the Attorney General sought to have the case dismissed on a non-substantive technical ground rather than on the merits of the claims against DOT.

    <p id="b718-4" data-blocks='[["BL_718.5",718,[281,398,1155,980]]]'>I support Mr. Justice Eakin’s position favoring a bright-line rule requiring parties to name an appropriate Commonwealth defendant or defendants in the caption of a complaint when pursuing actions for money damages against a sovereign entity. The Legislature has manifested its clear intent to protect the public fisc by providing for statutory sovereign immunity and crafting only targeted immunity exceptions relative to Commonwealth agencies, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8522, and this Court has honored this intention by construing such exceptions narrowly. <em>See, e.g., Dean v. Commonwealth, Dep’t of Transp., </em><a href="/pa/561/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="561 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="93635" data-case-paths="/pa/561/0503-01">561 Pa. 503</a>, 508, <a href="/a2d/751/1130-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="751 A.2d 1130" data-case-ids="11513963,93635" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/1130-01,/pa/561/0503-01">751 A.2d 1130</a>, 1132 (2000). In the circumstances of this case, I agree with the majority that there is a fair likelihood that PennDOT was on actual notice of Appellees’ intention to proceed against it. In this arena, however, I do not support the fashioning of an evaluative scheme of determining when a party who has failed to timely name a necessary Commonwealth defendant nevertheless can proceed against the sovereign.</p>

    <p id="b718-6" data-blocks='[["BL_718.8",718,[281,1543,1154,812]]]'>I would adopt the learned Judge Simpson’s dissenting opinion from the Commonwealth Court’s disposition of this matter. <em>See Piehl v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/a2d/930/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="930 A.2d 607" data-case-ids="8350119" data-case-paths="/a2d/930/0607-01">930 A.2d 607</a> (Pa.Cmwlth. 2007) (Simpson, J., dissenting). The plaintiff has the burden of placing the proper party on notice it is being sued. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1018 (“[t]he caption of a complaint shall set forth the form of the action and the names of all the parties....”). Naming only the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the caption failed to put the Department of Transportation on notice it was the party actually being sued. The fact that the Department of Transportation was served does nothing to cure the plaintiffs’ basic failing, as an entity should not be “required to dissect original process to determine if it may be a party.” <em>Piehl, </em>at 618 (Simpson, J., dissenting). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>
