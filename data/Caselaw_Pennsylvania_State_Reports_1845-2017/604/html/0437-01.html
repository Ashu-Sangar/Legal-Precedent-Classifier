      <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>Appellee David John Lettau (“Lettau”) was charged with forgery and theft for cashing a stolen check. Lettau, a minister who is licensed in pastoral counseling, testified at trial in his own defense. Lettau explained that he met Paul Haffley when he was referred by a local social service agency to counsel Haffley after Butler County Children and Youth Services removed Haffley’s child. Lettau testified that he had met with Haffley several times at Haffley’s home and that he occasionally performed favors for Haffley. Lettau also testified that while visiting Haffley’s home, he met a woman named Sister Linda, later revealed to be Linda Krieter, who Haffley described as his cousin. Lettau explained that he soon began to counsel Sister Linda as well. According to Lettau, Haffley asked him to cash a $100 check written to someone named Linda McConnell. Lettau testified that he did not question whether the check belonged to Sister Linda because he did not know her last name. Lettau took Krieter to his bank where he cashed the check and then gave the received funds to Krieter.</p>
    <p id="b481-5" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[155,1336,1151,462]]]'>In fact, Linda McConnell has no relationship with Lettau, Haffley, or Krieter. McConnell sells dogs, and a customer sent her the check in the mail as a deposit on a puppy. It is unclear how the check came into Haffley’s or Krieter’s possession — McConnell never received it. When her customer alerted her that the check had been cashed, McConnell let her know that she had not received the check. At that point, McConnell’s customer alerted the Pennsylvania State Police that the check had been stolen.</p>

Fagley testified that in the course of his investigation he called Lettau and left messages with him, and that Lettau called him back that night. N.T., 4/26/2007, at 70. Fagley said that Lettau told him that he had taken a friend named Sister Linda to the bank to cash a check because she did not have an account there, and that he did not know Sister Linda’s last <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>name. Fagley also testified that Lettau told him that he did not know where Sister Linda lived but that she came to his church on occasion. N.T., 4/26/2007, at 71. According to Fagley, Lettau asked him what the big deal was, because McConnell had gotten her money back. Fagley also testified that Lettau refused to say where his church was located except that it was in the state of Pennsylvania and, in Fagley’s words, “that was the most amount of information I could get pertaining to that.” N.T., 4/26/2007, at 72.</p>
    <p id="b482-5" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[274,801,1155,354]]]'>Lettau testified on direct about his visits to Haffley’s residence and his previous interaction with Haffley and Krieter. Lettau explained that he cashed the check as a favor to Haffley and that he was unaware that the check did not belong to Krieter. He also testified that he gave Fagley all of this information about Haffley and Krieter when Fagley contacted him about the check. N.T., 4/26/2007, at 115.</p>
    <p id="b482-6" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[274,1182,1156,784]]]'>On cross-examination, the Commonwealth focused on Let-tau’s claim that he had cooperated with the state police investigation. When challenged about his testimony on direct that he had provided the trooper with all of the information he knew about Haffley and Krieter, Lettau insisted that he had relayed this information to police, explaining that he provided the police with contact information for Haffley and Krieter. N.T., 4/26/2007, at 119-21. When the Commonwealth asked Lettau whether he had been asked to come to the police barracks and give a statement, Lettau’s trial counsel objected based on Lettau’s right to remain silent. The objection was overruled, and the Commonwealth proceeded to question Let-tau extensively as to his level of cooperation with Fagley’s investigation, eventually eliciting Lettau’s testimony that he had cooperated with the investigation.

Fagley testified that Lettau had not been cooperative, had refused to provide relevant information about his bank, Krieter, and his church, and had refused to come to the state police barracks in order to give a statement. N.T., 4/26/2007, at 169; 4/27/2007, at 18-19. Defense counsel again objected to Fagley’s testimony as to Lettau’s refusal to come <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>to the barracks to give a statement, and moved for a mistrial based on a claim that the Commonwealth made improper use of Lettau’s exercise of his right to remain silent. N.T., 4/26/2007, at 170. The trial court heard argument on the issue and denied the mistrial. The Commonwealth continued its cross-examination of Fagley, who contradicted Lettau’s testimony regarding his cooperation with the state police. Previously, Fagley had testified that Lettau never mentioned Haffley or any visits to the Haffley residence and his contact with Krieter there. N.T., 4/26/2007, at 71-73. Instead, as Fagley explained earlier in his direct testimony, Lettau maintained that he did not know where Krieter lived but instead encountered her as a visitor to his church. N.T., 4/26/2007, at 71. At the close of trial, the jury found Lettau guilty of Forgery and Theft by Receiving Stolen Property,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and the court imposed a sentence of 15 to 30 days incarceration and $400 in fines.</p>

In order to counter this claim, the prosecution pointed out that the defendant could have taken the opportunity to testify at trial in order to explain what had happened. Because the prosecutor's comments were made in the context of countering a defense accusation that the investigation had been unfair and the defendant unfairly silenced, and were not intended to suggest that the defendant's silence should be taken as a sign of guilt, they did not violate the Fifth Amendment. <em><a href="/us/485/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="485 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="13683" data-case-paths="/us/485/0025-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/485/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="485 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="13683" data-case-paths="/us/485/0025-01">at 31</a>, <a href="/us/485/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="485 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="13683" data-case-paths="/us/485/0025-01">108 S.Ct. 864</a>.</p>
