Esther Soto, the owner of that store, was present and later told police in a recorded statement that, after the call, Appellant told his brother, Noel Montalvo, that he would kill his wife. Later that evening, Ascensio and her co-worker, Nelson Lugo (a.k.a. Manuel Santana) were seen together at a local bar. Hours later, two of Ascensio’s neighbors heard Appellant outside Ascensio’s apartment demanding entry into the premises. Additionally, those witnesses testified that they heard a window break, and heard Ascensio asking for the police to be called. Two other neighbors testified to hearing a disturbance on the porch of Ascensio’s apartment. One neighbor saw a Hispanic man banging on Ascensio’s door. Witnesses testified that, following the sound of breaking glass, they heard loud noises emanating from the apartment throughout the night.</p>
    <p id="b438-7" data-blocks='[["BL_438.6",438,[274,1563,1154,795]],["BL_439.1",439,[149,327,1150,95]]]'>The next morning, another neighbor noticed broken glass on the back porch near Ascensio’s apartment. That neighbor knocked on the door to check on Ascensio, and when he received no response, he pushed a curtain aside and looked inside the apartment. He noticed a male lying on the floor and instructed his wife to call the police. The police found the bodies of Ascensio and Lugo inside the apartment. Ascensio’s neck was slashed multiple times and her skull was fractured in multiple places, consistent with multiple blows from a blunt object. Ascensio’s neck also had several superficial cuts, and one of her eyes was punctured. Her body was found naked from the waist down, and a high-heeled shoe was placed at her crotch. Lugo had died as a result of a stab wound to the chest. Crime scene investigators collected two blood samples at Ascensio’s apartment that matched Appellant: one on a blind <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>hanging inside a broken pane of glass above the doorknob and another on a cloth bag found on a sofa bed.</p>

Appellant stated: “[W]e killed my wife.” Appellant and Noel Montalvo explained that Appellant killed Lugo and Noel Montalvo killed Ascensio. They asked Soto’s husband if they could stay, but were refused. They left forty-five (45) minutes after arriving, stating that they intended to go to Florida or the Dominican Republic. Appellant was apprehended in Miami, Florida in January of 1999.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In January of 2000, Appellant was tried before the Honorable Sheryl A. Dorney and a jury. In addition to the aforementioned blood samples, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of several witnesses to establish Appellant’s presence at the crime scene at the time of the murders. The Commonwealth further entered into evidence Esther Soto’s tape-recorded statement to police detailing her observations and Appellant’s statements that he planned to kill his wife and his admission that he and his brother had done so. On the witness stand, Soto recanted her earlier statement to police, claiming that police threatened to close her business and imprison her if she did not implicate Appellant in the murders. She testified that Appellant never stated in her presence that he would kill his wife, and that Appellant never admitted in her presence to killing Ascensio and Lugo. The Appellant’s case-in-chief consisted of calling two character witnesses, who testified to Appellant’s law-abiding reputation, and recalling Commonwealth witness Detective Michael Hose for further cross-examination.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Commonwealth argued to the jury <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>that Appellant, together with his brother, committed two brutal, premeditated, and deliberate killings. The defense argued that the Commonwealth did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt Appellant’s participation in the killings, and that the evidence at best demonstrated that Appellant was present at Ascensio’s apartment at some point that evening. After deliberations, the jury found Appellant guilty of both counts of first-degree murder. On January 21, 2000, the jury returned a verdict of death on both murders. The jury found three aggravating circumstances in the murder of Ascensio, and two aggravating circumstances in the murder of Lugo,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and determined that these aggravators outweighed the two mitigating circumstances found in each murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

On August 16, 2004, Appellant filed a motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence. On October 5, 2005, and November 9, 2005, Judge Dorney conducted an additional evidentiary hearing regarding that motion. On June 28, 2006, Judge Dorney issued an opinion and order denying all thirty-seven (37) claims raised by Appellant. Appellant thereafter appealed to this Court.

Nevertheless, the record indicates that the trial court greatly limited the Commonwealth’s use of the photograph. The trial court ruled that the Commonwealth’s witnesses could use the photograph, which was taken after Ascensio’s body had been repositioned, only to describe the condition of the body when found at the crime scene, and expressly prohibited the Commonwealth from showing the photograph to the jury. N.T., 01/20/2000, 17. Ultimately, the photograph was described by Detective Hose, who testified to the similarities and differences between the condition of Ascensio’s body as depicted in the photograph and how her body was first found at the crime scene. Certainly, the condition of Ascensio’s body was both relevant and probative. Further, given the strict limitations imposed by the trial court, Detective Hose’s description of the photograph was probative and not unduly prejudicial. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly allowed the testimony describing the photograph to the jury.</p>

      <em>Similarly, “mercy,” as a stand-alone factor, is not a characteristic of the defendant or a circumstance of the crime, and thus does not fall within the catchall mitigator or any other specific mitigator. </em>Of course, a jury may consider mercy or sympathy when weighing specific aggravating and mitigating factors, but it may not exercise its sense of mercy or sympathy in a vacuum. By the same token, appellant was entitled to present and argue any evidence that was relevant and admissible to statutory mitigators in his attempt to convince the jury to exercise its mercy or sympathy and return a life sentence.

Esther Soto’s statement that Noel Montalvo admitted killing Ascensio while Appellant dispatched Lugo does not on its own establish that Appellant’s role was minor; rather, this statement merely demonstrates that <em>Noel Montalvo’s </em>role was not minor.

Further, Detective Hose provided a foundation for his conclu<a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>sion of a “staged position.” He testified that Ascensio’s body was found half-dressed, lying on her back with her arms at her sides, her head resting upon a pillow.

Initially, Appellant argues that trial counsel failed to file a motion in limine to exclude all evidence of <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>sexual activity. Next, he asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Dr. Funke’s testimony during direct examination that she conducted a rape kit on Ascensio. Appellant also claims that counsel’s line of questioning during cross-examination ultimately resulted in Dr. Funke’s testifying on redirect that Ascensio could have been penetrated postmortem. Appellant then asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing “to object or move to strike and request a cautionary instruction” for two aspects of Esther Soto’s testimony: 1) her testimony that the prosecutor informed her that Noel Montalvo had sex with Ascensio after the murder; and 2) her testimony that she gave a statement in which she told police that Noel Montalvo said he had sex with Ascensio.

In response, the Commonwealth notes that this evidence did not implicate Appellant, only his brother Noel. Therefore, according to the Commonwealth, counsel’s actions were consistent with Appellant’s defense that Noel Montalvo had in fact committed the crimes. The trial court provides the same rationale in its post-evidentiary hearing opinion. We agree with the Commonwealth and the trial court. At the evidentiary hearing, trial counsel testified: “[T]he thrust of the defense was that my client was innocent and that his evil, bastardly brother did this; and I believe there’s some testimony somewhere else that the brother admitted to having sex with the victim. So, if that’s the case, I would have to say if evidence came in about that, it was consistent with the defense that [Appellant] didn’t do it, [Appellant] wasn’t even there.” N.T., 01/22/2004, P.M., 19-20. Because all of the testimony in question supported Appellant’s defense that Noel Montalvo was the actual perpetrator, we find that trial counsel had a rational basis for not objecting to the testimony and was not ineffective.</p>

The Commonwealth counters that Appellant suffered no prejudice from the admission of this evidence and we agree. At trial, the jury heard testimony that Appellant stated his intent to commit Ascensio’s murder in Noel Montalvo’s presence the day before the crime. The jury also heard Soto’s tape-recorded statement, which described Appellant’s and his brother’s confession and statements of their intent to flee to Florida. The jury also heard admissible testimony from Detective Herrera that Appellant was apprehended in Miami. Consequently, the properly admitted evidence demonstrating that Appellant and Noel Montalvo acted as co-conspirators and fled to Florida was sufficiently strong that there is no reasonable probability that the exclusion of Detective Herrera’s challenged testimony would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. Moreover, when considering the overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s individual guilt, including Appellant being placed at Ascensio’s apartment shortly before the murders and the presence of his blood in two locations at the crime scene, we conclude that Appellant has again failed to satisfy the prejudice prong.

Additionally, Ascensio had defensive wounds on her hands and arms that were consistent with a force from a blunt object. Dr. Funke testified further that, before she perished, Ascensio suffered a puncture wound to her eye. The doctor found a minimum of three superficial wounds on Ascensio’s neck which, in her expert opinion, were caused by a knifepoint or other sharp object merely to produce bleeding. Ascensio ultimately perished from a minimum of five deep incised wounds on the sides of her neck. These cuts completely severed both of Ascensio’s jugular veins and her carotid artery on the left side. Dr. Funke discovered that the cuts on the left side of Ascensio’s neck went so deep as to incise and fracture Ascensio’s spine. These neck wounds caused severe blood loss and death within minutes. Dr. Funke was able to conclude that all of Ascensio’s injuries occurred while she was alive and testified that all of these injuries would have been painful for Ascensio. Although Dr. Funke stated that the blows to Ascensio’s head may have caused unconsciousness, the doctor testified that it was possible Ascensio was conscious during the attack, and therefore experienced the pain of all of her injuries. In light of this testimony, we conclude that the jury’s finding of torture was supported by both sufficient evidence and the weight of the evidence.</p>

I am in a concurring posture on this claim, although I regard it as being a close one, only in light of the uncontradicted evidence that Appellant had been excluded from the victim’s apartment for approximately one month prior to the killings. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., January 13, 2000, at 455, 458-59, 461-62.</p>

Candidly, I am unable to distinguish Appellant’s treatment of various of the issues from other instances in which the Court has found claims of deficient stewardship to be waived due to inadequate development, and I have indicated my belief elsewhere that the Court has an ongoing difficulty with consistency in this area which should be specifically addressed and remedied.</p>
    <p id="b478-5" data-blocks='[["BL_478.5",478,[277,1242,1157,737]]]'>Finally, the majority invokes <em>Commonwealth v.

The scope of <em>Bomar, </em>however, has been a subject of recent discussion in the cases. <em>See Commonwealth v.

I support the majority’s decision to consider the claims of deficient stewardship presented here, at least in the first instance, solely on account of this Court’s <em>pre-Grant </em>order remanding the case for that specific purpose. It seems to me that such circumstance warrants an independent and discrete exception to <em>Gh'ant.</em>

For purposes of this issue, I follow the majority’s approach of characterizing Appellant and the victim as husband and wife. The record appears to me to be unclear as to their actual legal status — according to the Commonwealth, Appellant and the victim had been in a common-law marital relationship. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., January 13, 2000, at 457.</p>
