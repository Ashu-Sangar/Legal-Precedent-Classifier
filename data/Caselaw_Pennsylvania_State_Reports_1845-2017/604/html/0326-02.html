However, the EPA did not abolish regulation of mercury emissions from oil- and coal-fired EGUs. Rather, it shifted the responsibility for the mechanics of the regulation to the states. To accomplish this shifting to the states, the EPA promulgated the Clean Air Mercury Rule (“CAMR”). 70 Fed.Reg. 28606 (5/18/2005). CAMR was predicated on the Delisting Rule and it established a mercury emission budget for each state and required each state to develop a program to regulate the mercury emissions emanating from oil- and coal-fired EGUs. For Pennsylvania, the EPA allocated a mercury emission budget of 1.78 tons per year for the years 2010 to 2017. Starting in 2018, Pennsylvania’s mercury emission budget would fall to 0.702 tons per year.</p>

One option was to participate in a cap-and-trade system, which allowed for the states participating in that system to trade mercury emission allowances with other states.

Thus, the court determined that the Delisting Rule was unlawful and vacated it, the effect of which was that EGUs remain listed under Section 112.

Therefore, the Board did not have the authority to promulgate the PA Mercury Rule. Judge Pellegrini emphasized that his conclusion was not altered by the fact that the PA Mercury Rule was promulgated during that interim period between promulgation of the Delisting Rule and CAMR and the DC Circuit Court’s invalidation of those rules. He reasoned that because the DC Circuit Court had found that the Delisting Rule and CAMR were void <em>ab initio, </em>the EGUs must be deemed to have been always listed.

The Commonwealth states that this simply is not the case. It asserts that until the DC Circuit issued its order invalidating the Delisting Rule, mercury was indeed delisted from Section 112.

The DC Circuit did consider whether the federal CAMR, which, like our PA Mercury Rule, was predicated on the Delisting Rule and was promulgated prior to the <em>New Jersey </em>decision, retained any validity. The DC Circuit squarely answered that it did not, finding that since CAMR sprang from the Delisting Rule, it must be invalidated because the Delisting Rule had failed.

There are times when our Court will not apply a new judicial rule to those matters pending on appeal, but rather we will apply the new decision only to those matters commenced after the decision is handed down.

As this litigation was commenced after the <em>New Jersey </em>decision was hand<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>ed down, there is no question here regarding retroactive application of that decision.</p>

We cannot ignore these federalism concerns and decide the case as if the concerns identified in <em>Blackwell </em>exhaust the considerations involved. The <em>New Jersey </em>decision, and the EPA’s reaction to it, establish the federal regulatory scheme in existence, and that reality has a direct effect upon the power of the states in this area, implicating the PA Mercury Rule, which we cannot ignore.</p>

But the fact that those entities did not treat the Delisting Rule as void during that period is of no moment to this Court’s task because, during that time period, the Delisting Rule had yet to be invalidated by the DC Circuit.

The Commonwealth thusly implies that the <em>New Jersey </em>decision stands for the proposition that the Delisting Rule was and remains valid from the date of its inception until the day the <em>Neio Jersey </em>court declared it invalid. This reading of the <em>New Jersey </em>decision is untenable. As noted above, the <em>New Jersey </em>court found that CAMR was <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>invalid because, when it was enacted, it was premised on the Delisting Rule.

The Commonwealth further notes that appellees may also apply for a credit from their removal of mercury via pretreatment of coal or coal refuse, and since they have yet to do so, their harm is speculative. We will reject that argument summarily. This future possibility invoked by the Commonwealth is itself speculative. What is certain, however, is that coal-fired EGUs must effectuate an 80% reduction in mercury emissions within the next five years. Also, the Commonwealth conceded in its Application for Reinstatement of Automatic Supersedeas that appellees necessary future expenditures to be in compliance with the PA Mercury Rule will run into the tens of millions of dollars. While a future, possible credit may make it easier for Appellees to meet their 80% reduction target, that speculative credit does not make it any less certain that appellees will be spending enormous sums of money to come into compliance.</p>
