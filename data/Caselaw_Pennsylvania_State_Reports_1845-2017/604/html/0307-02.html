The Majority notes a distinction between “send a message” statements by prosecutors that address the facts of the case at hand or the defendant directly, which are <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and statements that exhort the jury to “send a message” to the judicial system or the community at large, which exceed prosecutorial license. <em>Id. </em>at 1286-88.
