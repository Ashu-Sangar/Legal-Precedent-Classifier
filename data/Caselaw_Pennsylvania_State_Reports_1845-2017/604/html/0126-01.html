On November 29, 2002, two rival gangs engaged in a gunfight at the North American Motor Inn on City Line and Belmont Avenue in Philadelphia. Appellant, who was known to some by the nickname “Jughead,” was a member of one of the gangs, and, during the gunfight, two of his fellow gang members, Michael Allen Finney and Antoine Steed, were killed. Afterward, Appellant’s gang decided to avenge the deaths of Finney and Steed; Appellant and several other gang members, including Aquil Bond (hereinafter “Bond” or “co-defendant”), Jawayne Brown, Richard Brown (Aquil Bond’s cousin), Vincent Smithwick, and two others named Damar and Lonnie, gathered at the home of Richard Brown’s girlfriend, Tammy, to formulate a plan. N.T. Trial, 5/4/05, at 93. The group decided that two members of the rival group, “Brent” and “G Bucks,” whom they believed were responsible for shooting Finney and Steed, must be killed. <em>Id. </em>at 94.

He further <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>contends that the fact that one of the guns used at the scene of the Ogden Street murder was the same gun police observed Appellant attempt to discard at 6th and Spring Garden Streets does not “tie” him to Grant’s murder, as the testimony at trial established that weapons often are transferred from person to person. <em>Id. </em>at 16. Finally, he argues that he cannot be convicted of first-degree murder as an accomplice because there is no evidence he aided or abetted Bond, and Appellant’s and Bond’s joint presence at the scene “was not in any way assisting or helping or encouraging the co-defendant Bond to engage in his murderous conduct.” <em>Id. </em>at 18.</p>

As noted above, Smithwick testified at trial that, following the murder of Finney and Steed on November 29, 2002, members of Richard Brown’s gang, including Appellant and Bond, gathered at the home of Richard Brown’s girlfriend, Tammy, and discussed their plan for retaliation. N.T. Trial, 5/4/05, at 93. Smithwick testified that, on the following day, November 30, 2002, he, Bond, and Moore went to the Firing Line Gun Store, where Moore purchased a firearm at the direction of Bond. <em>Id. </em>at 95. Smithwick further described how, on December 1, 2002, he again was at the home of Brown’s girlfriend, Tammy, when Bond and Appellant announced they were going to 42nd and Ogden Streets to kill whoever they saw “that was hanging with Brent and Malik [and] G Bucks.” <em>Id. </em>at 97. In addition, Carter testified that he observed Appellant and Bond circle the corner of 42nd and Ogden Streets in a burgundy Park Avenue twice before Bond exited the vehicle and approached a man who resembled Brent Jenkins. Upon realizing that the <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>man was not Jenkins, Bond returned to the car. Carter then saw the car circle the corner a third time, after which both Appellant and Bond exited the vehicle and the shooting began. This evidence established more than Appellant’s mere presence at the scene of the crime; it established that Appellant, over several days, engaged in a deliberate, pre-meditated plan to exact revenge on individuals believed responsible for the shootings of Finney and Steed. Thus, we find the evidence was sufficient to support Appellant’s conviction for conspiracy.</p>

Ballistics evidence established that the 30 spent cartridges from the Ogden Street area where Grant was gunned down were .357 caliber Sig Remington brand ammunition. N.T. Trial, 5/4/05, at 232. Nineteen of the recovered cartridges were attributable to the specific gun identified by serial number SP0061985, which was the gun purchased for and given to Appellant by Stokes-Steadley, and which Appellant attempted to discard when stopped by police at 6th and Spring Garden Streets on April 13, 2003. The remaining 11 cartridges were determined to have been fired from the gun identified by serial number SP0061983, the gun purchased by Moore at Bond’s request and recovered from the home of Richard Brown.

Almost immediately, Appellant’s counsel noted that the jury allegedly left a portion of the verdict slip blank, namely, the portion relating to mitigating circumstances. It was also alleged that the jury failed to complete the final page of the verdict sheet that referred to life imprisonment. By this time, the jurors had been in the jury room for approximately one minute, with no outside contact or intervention. Over defense counsel’s objection, the trial judge called the jurors back into the courtroom and advised them that they needed to return to the jury room to complete the verdict slip, specifically indicating whether or not any mitigating circumstances had been found by any individual juror. The jury completed the form, indicating that there were no mitigating circumstances. The jury also indicated “N/A” on the final page of the verdict sheet referring to a sentence of life imprisonment. Wflien the jurors were recalled to the courtroom, they were individually polled, <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>and each juror agreed no mitigating circumstances were found.</p>

Both defendants had moved for severance of the penalty phases, in part to avoid such comparisons or other irrelevant considerations from spilling over from one defendant to the other. As recounted by the majority, after these motions were denied, the district attorney ultimately argued in closing that Appellant “comes from a good family” and that the jury should “[cjontrast that to Mr. Bond to some extent because he didn’t have a mother, so maybe you can take that into account[.]” N.T., May 10, 2005, at 115-16 <em>(quoted in </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 162, 985 A.2d at 907). The majority presently rejects Appellant’s assertion that this injected an arbitrary factor into the sentencing proceedings, in part because the prosecutor “was entitled to challenge Appellant’s argument that the jury should consider his family background as a mitigating circumstance.” Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 163, 985 A.2d at 908.</p>

Particularly in the capital sentencing arena, I believe this Court should be careful to safeguard the individualized nature of the sentencing decision. <em>See Woodson v. North Carolina, </em><a href="/us/428/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="428 U.S. 280" data-case-ids="6177464" data-case-paths="/us/428/0280-01">428 U.S. 280</a>, 304, <a href="/us/428/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="428 U.S. 280" data-case-ids="6177464" data-case-paths="/us/428/0280-01">96 S.Ct. 2978</a>, 2991, <a href="/us/428/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="428 U.S. 280" data-case-ids="6177464" data-case-paths="/us/428/0280-01">49 L.Ed.2d 944</a> (1976) (plurality) (articulating that the Eighth Amendment requires a reliable, individualized process for capital sentencing); <em>cf. Commonwealth v. Hughes, </em><a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="581 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1140661" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01">581 Pa. 274</a>, 363, <a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="865 A.2d 761" data-case-ids="1140661,9035570" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01,/a2d/865/0761-01">865 A.2d 761</a>, 815 (2004) (noting that, where aggravating and mitigating circumstances are found, the selection aspect of capital sentencing entails a highly individualized weighing process). Here, the prosecutor undoubtedly sought to gain leverage against Appellant by reference to Bond’s childhood difficulties, although such difficulties had no relevance to Appellant’s character or the circumstances of the offense of <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>which Appellant was convicted. Accordingly, I would not place this Court’s imprimatur on the district attorney’s remark. Nevertheless, in the context of the penalty hearing as a whole, the comparison between the upbringings of the two co-defendants constituted only a limited portion of the Commonwealth’s extensive closing argument, and was not so severe or egregious, in my view, as to require a new sentencing hearing. On this basis, I am able to join the result reached by the majority on this claim.</p>
