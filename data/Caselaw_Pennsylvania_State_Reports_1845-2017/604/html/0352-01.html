    <p id="b400-5" data-blocks='[["BL_400.5",400,[289,456,1152,955]]]'>We consider here whether the Commonwealth Court correctly declared that Article III, Section 24 of the Pennsylvania Constitution (“Section 24”), Pa. Const. art. Ill, § 24, is not preempted by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (“FLSA” or “Act”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and that accordingly, Section 24 prohibits the Governor of the Commonwealth from paying the wages of state employees who are covered by FLSA and required to work from monies in the Commonwealth’s Treasury, but not yet appropriated by the General Assembly. For the following reasons, we conclude that this matter is justiciable; that under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const art. VI, cl. 2, Section 6 of FLSA preempts Section 24; and that Appellants/Cross-Appellees are entitled to the declaratory judgment they requested. Therefore, in the appeal at No. 60 MAP 2008, we reverse the Commonwealth Court’s Order. In the cross-appeal at No. 66 MAP 2008, we affirm the Commonwealth Court’s Order in part and dismiss the cross-appeal in part as moot.</p>

The Commonwealth’s fiscal year begins on July 1st of each calendar year and ends on June 30th of the next calendar year. 71 P.S. § 237(a). Article VIII, Section 12 of our Constitution directs the Governor to submit an annual budget for the General Assembly’s consideration at a time set by law; Article VIII, Section 13 requires the General Assembly to adopt the budget for the ensuing fiscal year and to make operating budget appropriations. Pa. Const. art. VIII, §§ 12, 13. Under Section 24, the <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>General Assembly’s budget appropriations are an essential prerequisite to expending money from the Commonwealth’s Treasury; that is, without such appropriations, state monies, for the most part, may not be spent. Section 24 provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="AgU" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[203,540,1107,352]]]'>No money shall be paid out of the treasury, except on appropriations made by law and on warrant issued by the proper officers; but cash refunds of taxes, licenses, fees, and other charges paid or collected, but not legally due, may be paid, as provided by law, without appropriation from the fund into which they were paid on warrant of the proper officer.</blockquote>
    <p id="b401-4" data-blocks='[["BL_401.5",401,[160,921,445,40]]]'>Pa. Const. art. III, § 24.</p>
    <p id="b401-5" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[156,983,1153,1046]]]'>For each fiscal year, the General Assembly enacts a general appropriations act, so that state funds are available to the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of the Commonwealth for the payment of, <em>inter alia, </em>the salaries and wages of state employees. <em>See </em>Pa. Const. art. III, § 11 (“The general appropriations bill shall embrace nothing but appropriations for the executive, legislative and judicial departments of the Commonwealth, for the public debt and for public schools. All other appropriations shall be made by separate bills, each embracing but one subject.”). <em>See, e.g., </em>General Appropriation Act of 2007 (“GAA 2007”) § 104(a) (“The following sums set forth in this act ... are specifically appropriated from the General Fund to the several hereinafter named agencies of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Departments of the Commonwealth for the payment of salaries, wages or other compensation and travel expenses ... and for payment of any other expenses as provided by law or by this act, necessary for the proper conduct of the duties, functions and activities ... set forth for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007....”).</p>

Accordingly, if the General Assembly does not enact a general appropriations act by July 1 of each year, except for those funds that have not lapsed, Section 24 prohibits money from being paid out of the State Treasury to the Commonwealth’s Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches, which consequently prevents the payment of wages to state employees.</p>
    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[270,709,1156,515]]]'>In this case, the salient facts are undisputed.

Rendell submitted a proposed budget for fiscal year 2008-2009 for the General Assembly’s consideration. The Governor also devised a plan as to what payments of wages and salaries to Commonwealth employees the State Treasury would or would not make in the event that the General Assembly did not enact a general appropriations act by June 30, 2008.</p>

The court was of the view that the contemplated imposition of liability would be meaningless, unless there is a distinct point after which wages become unpaid. <em><a href="/us/358/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="358 U.S. 207" data-case-ids="3652848" data-case-paths="/us/358/0207-01">Id.</a> </em>Referring to <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 255">29 U.S.C. § 255</a> (the statute of limitations for an action under FLSA for unpaid minimum wages and for liquidated damages), the court further observed that statutes of limitation have to start running from some point, and determined that the most logical point for accrual of a cause of action for unpaid minimum wages or liquidated damages under the Act is the day the employee’s wages are scheduled to be paid. <em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 255">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 255">at 1540</a>.

Furthermore, when the courts confront circumstances not plainly covered by the terms of a statute, suggesting that Congress did not contemplate the issue, they endeavor to give statutory language the meaning that advances the policies underlying the legislation. <em>United States v.

Indeed, that was the case in <em>O’Neil. </em>In the absence of evidence of specific Congressional intent in the Act itself on the FLSA issue placed before it, the Supreme Court resorted to a broader consideration of the legislative policies behind the Act to render its ruling. <em>O’Neil, </em><a href="/us/324/0697-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="324 U.S. 697" data-case-ids="6156456" data-case-paths="/us/324/0697-01">324 U.S. at 706-07</a>, <a href="/us/324/0697-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="324 U.S. 697" data-case-ids="6156456" data-case-paths="/us/324/0697-01">65 S.Ct. 895</a>. Thus, the absence of express language in FLSA requiring timely payment is not the end of the federal statutory construction issue, as the Executive Parties argue. For the reasons noted above, it is evident to this Court that a proper construction of the entirety of the Act and the policies behind it makes it clear that the Executive Parties’ assertion that Section 6 does not contain a prompt payment requirement is unavailing and that Section 6 of FLSA mandates that wages be paid in a timely manner when the wages are regularly due to be paid.</p>

In its analysis, the court did not inquire into the different ways that Congressional intent to preempt may be conveyed. Instead, the court simply reasoned that since the payment of wages during a budget impasse would amount to the unlawful spending of state monies, Congress could never have intended for Section 24 to be displaced by Section 6 of FLSA. In so doing, the court made two fundamental mistakes. It disregarded controlling Supreme Court jurisprudence on discerning Congress’ intent to preempt and it failed to recognize that when a state law is preempted, state law requirements or prohibitions <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>have no legal effect. Thus, the court’s method of analyzing the preemption issue was lacking, and the very premise underlying its conclusion that Section 24 is not preempted by Section 6 of FLSA, <em>ie., </em>that Congress did not intend to countenance unlawful state spending in times of a budgetary crisis, is erroneous.</p>

At the same time that Section 6 requires the prompt payment of wages to the Commonwealth’s FLSA-covered employees, Section 24 prohibits the payment of monies out of the Commonwealth’s Treasury in order to pay those wages. In these circumstances, it is impossible to comply with both Section 6 of FLSA and Section 24. Indeed, the Interagency Agreement entered by the Office of the Governor and the State Treasury Department in May of 2008, <em>see supra </em>p. 68, and the decision to furlough certain FLSA-covered employees reflected the Administration’s recognition that the respective terms of both Section 6 and Section 24 could not possibly be met, if a budget impasse came to pass, and its legitimate desire to avoid violating one provision or the other in that event.

Furthermore, since Section 24 is preempted, Section 24 is without effect in this instance and thus, ceases to have legal significance. Accordingly, we hold that the Union Parties are entitled to the declaratory judgment they sought: that Section 24 did not prohibit the Commonwealth from continuing to employ and pay all FLSA nonexempt Commonwealth employees in the event that the Pennsylvania General Assembly failed to pass a budget by July 1, 2008.</p>
