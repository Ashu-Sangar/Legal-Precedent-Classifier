Specifically, we determine whether the PCRA court properly granted Appellee a new trial on the basis that the prosecutor withheld information that could have been used to impeach the credibility of two Commonwealth witnesses, in violation of <em>Brady v.

      <em> </em>Additionally, we determine whether a conflict of interest claim raised in Appellee’s PCRA petition has been waived because Appellee failed to raise the issue on direct appeal. Upon careful review, we conclude the conflict of interest issue has been waived, and that the court’s conclusions with respect to the <em>Brady </em>issue lack sufficient factual and legal analysis. Accordingly, we vacate the order of the PCRA court, and remand for preparation of an opinion containing a more searching analysis not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>

The Commonwealth averred that there were no “deals” with these witnesses, and stated on the record that the witnesses had not been promised anything in exchange for their cooperation and anticipated testimony. The Commonwealth informed the trial court and Appellee’s counsel that it did intend to take reasonable steps to protect the safety of the witnesses, and would also accurately report the nature and extent of the witnesses’ cooperation if asked by the witnesses’ confining authorities.

She testified that when she asked Appellee where all the blood had come from, he showed her a small abrasion on his knuckle. She further testified that the quilt in which Ms. Bruzda’s body was found was the quilt missing from the back seat of the vehicle. A number of witnesses testified that they saw Appellee with Ms. Bruzda on the evening of October 23, 1978. It was established that Ms. Bruzda had been killed by repeated blows to the skull with a blunt object. Evidence was presented that Appellee had borrowed a tire iron from a friend on the evening of October 23, 1978, and that he never returned it. Kenneth Wright testified that during the time he and Appellee were incarcerated in the same facility, Appellee admitted he murdered Ms. Bruzda. Samuel Tribuiani testified that during the time he and Appellee were incarcerated in the same facility, Appellee admitted his involvement with another person in the bludgeoning murder of a young girl.

He originally told police that on the evening of October 23, 1978, he gave Ms. Bruzda and an unknown hitchhiker a ride, and never saw either of them again after he dropped them off together. At trial, he admitted this version of events was a lie. He testified that, in actuality, Ms. Bruzda had been a passenger in his car on a remote road when two vehicles forced his vehicle to stop. He testified that he had been dragged from the vehicle and beaten about the head with a club by Sharon Pearson’s brothers, who left him unconscious in a ditch by the side of the road. When he regained consciousness, Ms. Bruzda was gone. Appellee explained he had never previously revealed the truth <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>because the morning after the beating, the brothers accosted him in the parking lot of a mall and told him that if he revealed what had happened the previous night, they would kill him and his family.</p>

Appellee was represented by counsel from the Defender Association of Philadelphia during post-conviction proceedings, and on May 15, 2003, a counseled PCRA petition was filed, 190 pages in length, raising 19 separate claims of entitlement to relief. The first claim alleged that trial counsel had labored under conflicts of interest that had adversely affected their representation of Appellee at trial.

He testified that although he had wanted the jury to understand that these witnesses had “agreed to testify without being promised anything,” he was now unsure whether the credibility of Wright and Tribuiani had been essential to the verdict.

The PCRA court found that the jailhouse informants’ testimony, which established that Appellee confessed to the murder, was the “crux of the Commonwealth case” against Appellee, and that the credibility of such witnesses was, consequently, of “grave importance.” PCRA Court Findings of Fact, 10/31/2007, at No. 6. It described the Commonwealth’s withholding of impeachment evidence as “outrageous,” and concluded, “without any hesitation,” that Appellee was entitled to a new trial. PCRA Court Opinion, 7/31/2007, at 1-2. Thus, it is clear that the PCRA court believed that, had the Commonwealth disclosed the impeachment evidence to the defense, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different. A remand for the PCRA court to state expressly what is obvious from its ruling is simply unwarranted.</p>

The record further establishes that, in accordance with their request, the prosecutor made phone calls and sent letters to various state authorities seeking favorable treatment on their behalf, and sent copies of these letters to Tribuiani and Wright prior to Appel<a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>lee’s trial. Notwithstanding a pre-trial request for those communications among the jailhouse informants, the Commonwealth, and the various entities and individuals to whom the Commonwealth reached out on behalf of the jailhouse informants, the Commonwealth did not disclose any of this evidence to the defense. Then, remarkably, at Appellee’s trial the Commonwealth presented evidence that neither Tribuiani nor Wright had asked for or received any favorable treatment in exchange for their testimony. Thus, it is clear that the Commonwealth suppressed evidence that was exculpatory in that it reflected on the credibility of the Commonwealth’s witnesses. Our inquiry therefore focuses on whether Appellee was prejudiced by the Commonwealth’s failure to disclose, <em>ie., </em>whether there is a reasonable probability that if the evidence had been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Commonwealth v.

Initially, I point out that this was not an “open and shut case” for the prosecution. In fact, the police investigation into the identity of the perpetrator of Barbara Bruzda’s murder extended nearly 18 years. The victim’s body was discovered on March 20, 1979, and Appellee’s murder charges were not filed until February 20, 1997, significantly, after the prosecution obtained the statements from Tribuiani and Wright. Moreover, as acknowledged by the Majority, Op. at 579-81, 986 A.2d at 812-13, Appellee’s defense at trial was that he was not involved in the murder. Appellee testified that, on the night of the incident, the victim had been a passenger in his vehicle while he was driving on a remote road, and that Sharon Pearson’s brothers forcibly stopped Bruzda and him, dragged Appellee from the vehicle, and beat <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>him with a club until he was unconscious.

Thus, Appellee’s confessions of guilt made to Tribuiani and Wright were, as the PCRA court found, the “crux of the case” against him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Had the withheld evidence regarding the informants’ deals for favorable treatment been presented at trial, there is a reasonable probability that the jury, while balancing the equally plausible theories posited by the Commonwealth and the defense, would have been swayed to make credibility determinations in Appellee’s favor, and would have concluded that there was reasonable doubt as to Appellee’s guilt.</p>

To the contrary, if the jury had known that the jailhouse informants who testified against Appellee sought favorable treatment from the prosecution, and that the prosecutor was actively trying to arrange such treatment with the knowledge of the jailhouse informants, the jury may well have viewed Pearson’s testimony regarding the blood and missing quilt from Appellee’s vehicle as consistent with both the Commonwealth’s and Appellee’s case. More crucially, the jury could have discounted the jailhouse confessions and found that the Commonwealth failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether favorable treatment was, in fact, obtained as a result of the prosecution’s efforts to assist Tribuiani and Wright is irrelevant, as it is the motive to fabricate testimony in exchange for any promise of leniency that was relevant and should have been presented to the jury.</p>
