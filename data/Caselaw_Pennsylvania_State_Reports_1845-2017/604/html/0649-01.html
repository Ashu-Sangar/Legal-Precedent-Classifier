The POA specifically authorized Slomski to, among other things, “engage in retirement plan transactions.” On May 4, 2005, the decedent completed a Beneficiary Designation Form for his retirement plan through The Thermoclad Company. The Beneficiary Designation Form also allowed the decedent to change the beneficiaries. The decedent named his wife as the primary beneficiary with his stepdaughters, Jennifer Smith and Jacilyn Snyder (“Appel<a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>lees”), as contingent beneficiaries.

The decedent passed away on December 28, 2006. At the time of the decedent’s death, the retirement plan had a value of approximately $190,000.00. The decedent died testate leaving the estate in equal shares to Appellees, with Jennifer Smith being appointed executrix on January 5, 2007.</p>

The Superior Court characterized the changing of a beneficiary as a gift, not a retirement plan transaction, and therefore concluded that it was an unlimited gift requiring a specific designation in the POA. <em>Id. </em>at 19.
