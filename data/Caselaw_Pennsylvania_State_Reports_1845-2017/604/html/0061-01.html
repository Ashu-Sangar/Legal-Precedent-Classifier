Mother’s 8-year-old son, R.R., who also lived in the home, had already left for school. Mother reported to police that, at one point, she heard a “squeak” as Appellant sat on a recliner in the living room and, minutes later, she heard him get up from the recliner. She then heard J.A. crying. N.T. Trial, 9/19/05, at 46-47. As Mother ran to the living room, she passed Appellant, who was heading upstairs. Mother observed that A.A. was now in the playpen, holding J.A.’s head on her lap. When Mother picked up J.A., “his arm flopped backwards.” <em>Id. </em>at 147. Mother took J.A. to the emergency room, where it was determined that he had suffered a spiral fracture to the right humerous caused by sharp and severe twisting of the arm.</p>

The Texas Court of Appeals, citing <em>Iiopt, supra, </em>held that applying the 1993 amendment retroactively did not violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution because it did not increase the punishment or change the elements of the offense the state had to prove; rather, it merely removed certain restrictions on the competency of certain classes of persons as witnesses, and, thus, was simply a rule of procedure. <em>Carmell, </em><a href="/us/529/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="529 U.S. 513" data-case-ids="9508846" data-case-paths="/us/529/0513-01">529 U.S. at 520</a>, <a href="/us/529/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="529 U.S. 513" data-case-ids="9508846" data-case-paths="/us/529/0513-01">120 S.Ct. 1620</a>.

    <blockquote id="b133-4" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[152,965,1111,944]]]'>Article 38.07 is unquestionably a law “that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.” Under the law in effect at the time the acts were committed, the prosecution’s case was legally insufficient and petitioner was entitled to a judgment of acquittal, unless the State could produce both the victim’s testimony and corroborative evidence. The amended law, however, changed the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain a conviction; under the new law, petitioner could be (and was) convicted on the victim’s testimony alone, without any corroborating evidence. Under any commonsense understanding of <em>Calder’s </em>fourth category, Article 38.07 plainly fits. Requiring only the victim’s testimony to convict, rather than the victim’s testimony plus other corroborating evidence is surely “less testimony required to convict” in any straightforward sense of those words.</blockquote>

The TYHA is <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>not a sufficiency rule, as it does not address the type of evidence sufficient to support a conviction.

A.A.’s testimony, though potentially helpful, was not an essential element of the Commonwealth’s case against Appellant. Indeed, evidence consisting of the testimony of Mother and the emergency room physician, though circumstantial, arguably was sufficient to support Appellant’s conviction. The amended version of the TYHA simply <em>expanded </em>the class of persons whose out-of-court statements are admissible in court, from a victim or witness, age 12 or younger, on or with whom an offense was performed by another, to a victim or witness, age 12 or younger.

Bobadilla, </em><a href="/nw2d/709/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="709 N.W.2d 243" data-case-ids="8991982" data-case-paths="/nw2d/709/0243-01">709 N.W.2d 243</a> (Minn.2006) (holding that the question of whether statements made by a <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>young child to a child protection worker are testimonial does not hinge on whether the worker was a government agent, but rather on whether the government agent was acting to a “substantial degree” to produce statements for trial). I believe that in the absence of police interrogation, our inquiry should examine the extent to which the questioner is acting at the behest of or in conjunction with law enforcement. In this regard, an important consideration in this case is the degree of police involvement in procuring the statements from A.A.</p>

The Law requires certain individuals to report suspected abuse, including physicians. 23 Pa.C.S. § 6311(b). Once a report of suspected abuse is received, the county CYS must commence an investigation, which includes a determination of the risk of harm to the child or children if they continue to remain in the home environment, as well as a determination of the nature, extent, and cause of any abuse, and to take any action necessary to provide for the safety of the child or children. 23 Pa.C.S. § 6368. Although CYS workers may release information to the police, there is no requirement that they do so. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. §§ 6339 and 6340.</p>

After Appellant injured his seven-month old son, J.A., the infant was treated at the hospital. The treating physician, who suspected physical abuse, contacted CYS social worker Geist. Geist responded to the hospital, where he interviewed J.A.’s mother, and concluded that J.A. and his siblings, including four-year-old A.A., should be removed temporarily for their safety. The children were placed with <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>Appellant’s parents. Appellant informed Geist that A.A. caused J.A.’s injury. Acting on this information, Geist arrived at Appellant’s parents’ home to talk to A.A. on May 27, 2004, a week after the children’s removal from their parents’ care. Geist intended to obtain information regarding J.A.’s injury. Geist was causally dressed, and did not indicate that A.A.’s statements would be used in a subsequent proceeding against Appellant. He questioned her on the front porch, and asked her how she was and if she remembered what happened to J.A. She said that she did; Geist asked if J.A.’s twin caused the injury, and A.A. said no. He asked in turn whether A.A. caused the injury, whether her mother did, and whether her father did. When the questioning turned to her father, Appellant, A.A. began to act scared, and answered in the affirmative. She described Appellant as angry at the time, and demonstrated how the injury occurred. When one of Appellant’s siblings interrupted, the interview ended. Geist returned to CYS, followed statutory procedure by notifying his supervisor, and recommended that A.A. be interviewed by Dr. Ryen. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 6311. He did not report his findings to law enforcement.</p>

Because Geist was not acting as an agent of law enforcement, the primary purpose test does not apply. Rather, we should look to <em>Crawford’s </em>core class of testimonial statements to determine whether the statements at issue here qualifies as the functional equivalent of <em>“ex parte </em>in-court testimony,” <em>Crawford, </em><a href="/us/541/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="168" data-cite="541 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="5873383" data-case-paths="/us/541/0036-01">541 U.S. at 51</a>, <a href="/us/541/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="169" data-cite="541 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="5873383" data-case-paths="/us/541/0036-01">124 S.Ct. 1354</a>, and are therefore testimonial. Because we are not concerned here with statements provided in affidavits, depositions, during police interrogations, or prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial, the remaining formulation of <em>Crawford’s </em>core class of testimonial statements is the objective witness test. This test asks whether statements were made under circum<a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>stances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial. <em><a href="/us/541/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="170" data-cite="541 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="5873383" data-case-paths="/us/541/0036-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/541/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="170" data-cite="541 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="5873383" data-case-paths="/us/541/0036-01">at 52</a>, <a href="/us/541/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="171" data-cite="541 U.S. 36" data-case-ids="5873383" data-case-paths="/us/541/0036-01">124 S.Ct. 1354</a>.</p>

In contrast, the Majority concludes that the child’s statements are nontestimonial because, although Geist was acting as law enforcement, the primary purpose of his interview was to meet an ongoing emergency. I recognize that my disagreement with the Majority may appear to be a minor, nuanced point. However, I am wary of the implications of concluding that Geist was acting as an agent of law enforcement in this context. Specifically, construing the CYS worker as law enforcement because he was contacted by the hospital and was responsible for J.A.’s safety makes the admissibility of A.A.’s statements contingent on whether there was an ongoing emergency. As explained above, I do not believe that there is such a requirement under <em>Crawford.</em>
