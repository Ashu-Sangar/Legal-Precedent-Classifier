Based on this information, a contractor submitted a bid, which was accepted. During construction, the contractor discovered the firm’s specifications were wrong, which caused large cost overruns.

I depart, however, from the majority’s reasoning to the extent that it downplays the obligations of facility owners under the One Call Act. <em>See, e.g., </em>Majority Opinion at 56, 985 A.2d at 844 (“[A]ppellant maintains ... appellee was under a duty to provide it accurate information as to the location of its underground gas lines.

Such an instance exists here. Without the statutory protections of the One Call Act, contractors would have to dig and perform their services without any knowledge of what is beneath the surface. The One Call Act was enacted, in large part, to protect contractors and their employees from these potentially dangerous and fatal situations where excavating occurs without proper information from the facility owners as to what was placed beneath the surface. If facility owners do not provide accurate information as to the location of their underground facilities, contractors could, and probably will, strike or damage the facilities, which would cause harm to the contractor, the contractor’s employees and the general public. Providing accurate information is one of the public duties that the One Call Act triggers and facility owners must be held responsible for their negligent actions if, as here, such damages were foreseeable.</blockquote>

In stressing the responsibilities of excavators over facility owners, the majority discusses a scenario involving "insufficient information,” which is specifically covered by the statute, then references Section 2 of the One Call Act as requiring the excavator to employ prudent techniques such as hand-dug test holes to prevent breaches of underground facilities. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 56, 985 A.2d at 844 (citing 73 P.S. § 177(5)(i)). The difficulty with this assessment is that subsection 5(i) of Section 2 appears to address the application of prudent techniques within tolerance zones specified by facility owners. <em>See </em>73 P.S. § 177(5)(i). Thus, the statute again reinforces the dependence of excavators, in the exercise of their own responsibilities, on the careful execution of the facility owners' own obligations. Indeed, the One Call Act makes specific provision for instances in which there are known uncertainties in locating facilities, requiring the specific exercise of prudent techniques if digging is to proceed and providing for additional compensation by project owners. <em>See </em>73 P.S. § 180(15). At least by <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>implication, the same level of caution is not required where the facility owner has made a positive identification, and excavation proceeds in areas outside the tolerance zones for marked locations.</p>
