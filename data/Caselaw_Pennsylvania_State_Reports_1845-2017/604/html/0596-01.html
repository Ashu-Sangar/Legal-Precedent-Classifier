Markman’s co-workers noticed bruising around her eyes and neck, which she attributed to fights with appellant over the emails. On one occasion, Markman called Wal-Mart to speak with White, which left White scared and crying. Markman also visited the store once, looking for White, but left without incident. Markman told a friend “if she ever got her hands on [White], she was going to kill her.” N.T. Trial, 10/25/01, Vol. I, at 82. She told her probation officer,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Nicole Gutshall, she caught appellant cheating on her, and if she caught him cheating again, she would kill the girl.</p>

However, Markman became suspicious that appellant had not ended his relationship with White. Markman drove appellant in her car to a local Sheetz store, where appellant used a pay phone to call White at Wal-Mart. He falsely told White his father died, and asked her to come to console him. He told her Markman was out of town. Various Wal-Mart employees testified White received this call from appellant, and she told her co-workers appellant’s father died and she was leaving work early to console him.</p>

Then appellant and Markman subdued White and tied her hands and feet with speaker wire, shoved a large piece of red cloth in her mouth, and used another piece of cloth to tie a tight gag around her mouth. With White bound, Markman and appellant stepped outside to smoke cigarettes and discuss their next move. Upon reentering the trailer, Markman held White down while appellant strangled her with speaker wire and the crook of his arm, killing her. During the struggle, White scratched Markman’s neck. White died of <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>asphyxiation caused by strangulation and the rag stuffed into her mouth.</p>

The couple then fled to Virginia. Markman drove her car and appellant drove White’s Jeep — carrying White’s body. In Virginia, they drove to a remote piece of land owned by appellant’s mother, then placed White’s body in the trunk of an abandoned car. They discarded White’s personal effects, except for her camera, which they intended to sell.</p>
    <p id="b647-5" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[133,875,1161,1258]]]'>Appellant and Markman remained in Virginia for several days, staying with friends and appellant’s father. Appellant continued to drive White’s Jeep, which he held out as his own. While staying with Larry Overstreet and Kimberly Stultz, Markman corroborated appellant’s story that they bought the Jeep from Markman’s friend in Pennsylvania. At the Over-street residence, Markman retrieved White’s camera from the Jeep and they all took pictures of each other — Markman stated she bought the camera from the same woman who sold them the Jeep. Overstreet and Stultz recalled seeing scratches on Markman’s neck, which Markman explained were from a dog. Stultz gave Markman the phone number of a pawn shop, and the shop owner testified he gave Markman $90 and a pawn ticket for the camera. Markman asked Stultz for cleaning supplies because “the Jeep smelled bad, like somebody had a dead animal in [it].” N.T. Trial, 10/29/01, Vol. Ill, at 501. Markman also told Stultz that appellant had been seeing another woman, and if she ever met this other woman, she would “whoop her ass.” <em>Id., </em>at 494. Another friend, Nina Jo Fields, testified that during the couple’s visit to her home, Markman told her appellant had been cheating on her, but that she “[didn’t] have to worry about the damn bitch anymore, [because she] took care of it.” N.T. Trial, 10/26/01, Vol. II, at 322, 351.</p>

Deputy Brian Vaughan of the Franklin County Sheriffs office in Virginia went to the house to question appellant and <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>Markman about the Jeep and White’s whereabouts. When he saw the Jeep in the driveway, he ran the license plate number, which traced back to the Toyota Leasing Corporation.</p>
    <p id="b648-5" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[297,510,1149,421]]]'>Markman and appellant came to the door to greet Deputy Vaughan. Deputy Vaughan questioned them separately in his patrol car about the Jeep. Appellant, who was questioned first, told Deputy Vaughan he called White to ask her to console him about his dog, which had just died. Appellant said White never arrived at the trailer, and he subsequently left with Markman for Virginia. He claimed a friend loaned him the Jeep.</p>
    <p id="b648-6" data-blocks='[["BL_648.5",648,[298,962,1153,677]]]'>Subsequently, Markman voluntarily entered the patrol car and explained to Deputy Vaughan she had only seen White once, but had had several phone conversations with her. She denied knowledge of White’s whereabouts, but indicated White had a bad relationship with her parents, suggesting she had run away. Markman denied knowing how appellant acquired the Jeep, and admitted driving separate cars to Virginia. When Deputy Vaughan asked Markman if she was afraid of appellant, she said she was not; rather, she admitted she had a violent temper, and appellant often had to restrain her from attacking him. She said she provoked appellant in the past and had thrown things at him, but appellant never assaulted or threatened her.</p>
    <p id="b648-7" data-blocks='[["BL_648.6",648,[298,1679,1149,684]]]'>Following the police visit, appellant and Markman drove back to the property where they left White’s body; there they abandoned the Jeep. Despite the couple’s efforts to conceal the evidence, the police soon discovered the Jeep, as well as White’s partially-decomposed body in the trunk of the abandoned car — the body was still bound, gagged, and wrapped in the canvas tent. Appellant’s fingerprints were found on the car’s trunk lid and license plate, a compact disc recovered from the Jeep, the Jeep’s hatch, and other evidence recovered from the scene. Markman’s fingerprints were found on a potato chip bag retrieved from the Jeep, and the Jeep’s passenger door and rear hatch. Subsequent analysis revealed Markman’s DNA under White’s fingernails.</p>

Police also discovered two lengths of speaker wire, red fibers on the floor, a piece of red cloth, a steak knife, red fibers on the knife, a tent storage bag, a hammer, and a stethoscope. Police arrested appellant and Markman on October 11, 2000, exactly one week after the murder. Police retrieved White’s camera from the pawn shop and developed the film. The pictures taken at the Overstreet residence were admitted into evidence at trial; in one photograph — taken just days after appellant and Markman strangled White to death— Markman is laughing while appellant pretends to strangle her.</p>

Appellant admitted to killing White by strangling her, but claimed Markman instigated the murder to eliminate the source of one of their relationship problems and enable them to start their relationship anew. He maintained Markman directed him to tie White up and strangle her, and Markman forced compliance by hitting him with a hammer and then spinning the hammer in a threatening manner. After White died, Markman listened with a stethoscope to verify her death before -wrapping the body in the tent.</p>
    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[143,1731,1153,518]]]'>In her police statement, Markman admitted she bound and gagged White and held her down while appellant strangled her. She insisted, however, appellant devised the plan to murder White in order to steal her Jeep, and he coerced her assistance by threatening to kill her with a hunting knife if she did not obey him. Markman also asserted appellant wore down her resistance by terrorizing her the night before the murder by holding a knife to her throat and forcing her to remain naked in the trailer. Markman said she only realized White was dead when White lost control of her bladder.</p>

      <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>Appellant moved to sever his trial from Markman’s because introduction of Markman’s confession to police, which was admissible against Markman, would violate his Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness against him. The trial court denied the motion. Appellant and Markman were tried on one count each of criminal homicide, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, and abuse of a corpse, and two counts of theft by unlawful taking or disposition (pertaining to the Jeep and the camera), as well as conspiracy as to all of these offenses.</p>
    <p id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.4",650,[280,809,1158,631]]]'>Appellant and Markman each decided to advance a duress defense, trying to show they engaged in the conduct charged because they were coerced by the other through “the use of, or a threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, which a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 309(a). Upon learning Markman intended to show she acted under duress as the result of appellant’s abuse, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the severance denial, arguing he would be prejudiced by evidence of his abuse of Markman. The trial court again denied the motion, and the joint trial began.</p>

After being questioned, Markman changed her story and said appellant was helping White run away from her parents, and while Markman drove to Virginia in her car, appellant drove White to Virginia in White’s Jeep. When police asked about the scratches on her neck, Markman changed her story again and said she had gotten into a fight with Wfiiite the day she left for Virginia. After further interrogation, Markman confessed to her role in the murder, but blamed appellant for making her participate by threatening and terrorizing her. Markman said when White arrived at the trailer in response to appellant’s phone call, she stayed out of the way until she heard White cry out <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>when appellant hit her hand with a hammer. Appellant then made Markman tie White up, gag her, and blindfold her. Markman said after appellant strangled White, he made her wrap White’s body in the tent and put it in the Jeep. When asked why appellant killed White, Markman responded she believed he wanted the Jeep.</p>
    <p id="b651-5" data-blocks='[["BL_651.4",651,[139,666,1155,417]]]'>Markman was permitted to adduce evidence of abuse by appellant in her defense. Markman testified appellant physically abused her during their relationship, particularly in the months before the murder. <em>Markman, </em>at 596-97. She also alleged appellant terrorized her for the two days preceding the murder, during which time he cut her clothes off with a knife, repeatedly raped her, and threatened her if she did not do as he instructed. <em>Id., </em>at 596.</p>
    <p id="b651-6" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[134,1118,1162,904]]]'>Markman’s testimony also included details of the night of the murder. Markman claimed that when she drove appellant to the gas station, she did not know he was planning to call White, and she attempted to escape once they returned to the trailer; however, appellant violently prevented her from leaving. <em>Id. </em>Markman stated even when White was bound and gagged, she did not know appellant was going to kill her, and she was in the kitchen getting White a glass of water when appellant strangled her. <em>Id. </em>At that time, Markman testified appellant ordered her to return the gag to White’s mouth because it had slipped, and she only obeyed him because she was afraid he would kill her, too. <em>Id., </em>at 596-97. As for her statement to Officer Vaughan that appellant had never abused her, she said she was trying to protect him. When questioned about the photograph in which she was laughing while appellant pretended to strangle her, Markman stated appellant was tickling her. <em>Id., </em>at 597.</p>
    <p id="b651-7" data-blocks='[["BL_651.6",651,[133,2055,1156,312]]]'>Based on the evidence of abuse, Markman requested a jury instruction on the defense of duress.

      <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>The Commonwealth also introduced a tape of appellant’s confession, which was redacted so references to Markman were replaced with “the other person” in another voice. Due to an apparent oversight, there were two instances of non-redaction, where appellant’s references to Markman by name remained on the tape. <em>Id., </em>at 596 n. 5. The confession alleged Markman conceived of the plot to kill White, directed its execution, and forced appellant to cooperate. <em>Id., </em>at 601. Appellant said Markman wanted White dead because she was jealous. He admitted he called White to the trailer because he wanted someone to talk to, and he knew he had to lie to get her to come to the trailer. After appellant talked with White for a few minutes, Markman came out of the bedroom, playing with a hammer. According to his confession, after playing with the hammer, Markman hit him with the hammer “[j]ust enough for me to feel the pain.” Transcript of Redacted Taped Statement of Housman, 10/12/00, at 25. Markman directed appellant to tie White’s hands, and once he was finished, she tied appellant’s hands and White’s feet. After blindfolding and gagging White, Markman untied appellant and they went outside to smoke a cigarette. While they were outside, according to appellant’s confession, Markman said if appellant loved her, he would do as she told him. When they went back inside, Markman directed appellant to pull speaker wire around White’s neck, which he did because he did not “want to die that night” in the event Markman “flipped out and wanted to hit me with a ... hammer.” <em>Id., </em>at 30. Appellant confessed to devising the plan to leave the state with White’s body so they could hide it on his family’s Virginia property. Markman’s confession implicating appellant was similarly redacted at trial; incriminating references to appellant were removed and replaced with the same phrase, “the other person.”</p>

He argued he lacked the specific intent to kill White because of Markman’s threats and conduct with the hammer, his confession supported a third degree murder conviction, and the crimes not did not involve kidnapping.</p>

Markman and appellant filed separate direct appeals.

Significantly, the prosecution was not premised on circumstantial evidence or identification testimony. Rather, it was undisputed at trial that Housman placed <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>the phone call luring the victim to the trailer and that he intentionally strangled her there. His defense was merely that he was frightened into doing this. His purported “fright,” however, amounts to something short of coercion, because at trial he conceded that he was criminally liable for third-degree murder, which subsumes a malicious mental state. Thus, he did not pursue a conventional duress defense. Further, the only evidence that Housman was hit <em>and/or </em>threatened during the episode was exceptionally weak, since it derived solely from his own self-serving statement to police, brought onto the record during the prosecution’s case-in-chief. Indeed, Housman did not testify at trial to create a credibility issue under <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Young, <a href="/pa/561/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="561 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="93396" data-case-paths="/pa/561/0034-01">561 Pa. 34</a>, 87 <em>&amp; </em>n. 16, <a href="/a2d/748/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="748 A.2d 166" data-case-ids="11453899,93396" data-case-paths="/a2d/748/0166-01,/pa/561/0034-01">748 A.2d 166</a>, 194 &amp; n. 16 (1999) (reargument opinion), as did Markman.</p>

Housman’s conviction for the first-degree murder of Leslie White and the related crimes of kidnapping, theft by unlawful taking or disposition, unlawful restraint, abuse of corpse, and criminal conspiracy. I believe <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>the trial court erred in denying Appellant’s motion to sever his trial from that of his co-defendant, Beth Ann Markman, because of the prejudice that resulted to Appellant from the introduction of Markman’s evidence, and that the error was not harmless.

    <p id="b677-5" data-blocks='[["BL_677.4",677,[143,642,1154,1172]]]'>As the Majority notes, Appellant’s counsel learned pre-trial that Markman intended to offer the defense of duress and evidence in support thereof at trial, arguing that she suffered long-term physical and emotional abuse at the hands of Appellant. Appellant’s counsel filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of severance, arguing that the evidence of abuse Markman intended to introduce at trial was not legally or factually relevant to Appellant’s guilt in this capital case and would, in fact, be severely prejudicial. The evidence that counsel anticipated Markman presenting, and which counsel brought to the court’s attention, included statements from a neighbor relating that Markman described how Appellant had wrapped a telephone cord around her neck, that she saw Markman with bruises and black eyes which were attributed to Appellant, and that she observed Appellant trying to sabotage Markman’s car. Another neighbor was to testify to hearing constant fighting between Markman and Appellant, and a friend and neighbor was to relate that Markman had told her that Appellant had tortured Markman for an entire night, had taken a knife and cut her down the chin, neck, stomach, and legs, had gagged her with underwear and tied her up, and that the neighbor had seen the cuts and bruises that had resulted from these attacks.</p>

A colleague of Markman’s was to testify that Markman complained of abuse by Appellant and often came to work black and blue. Another friend was to testify that one time when Appellant got angry with Markman, he threatened to cut her brake lines, and another time stated that he wanted to kill her. Counsel further argued that the prejudicial effect of this evidence of abuse, which would not be admissible against Appellant in a <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>separate trial for the alleged murder, could not be cured by any cautionary instruction. The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration, and, as expected, Markman introduced at trial all of the foregoing evidence of Appellant’s alleged abuse of her, along with additional evidence of such abuse. Importantly, the trial court declined to instruct the jury during its charge regarding Markman’s defense of duress.</p>
    <p id="b678-4" data-blocks='[["BL_678.4",678,[283,695,1157,873]]]'>Appellant presently argues that his trial should have been severed from Markman’s because her antagonistic defense of duress, though ultimately disallowed by the trial court, permitted Markman to present substantial prejudicial evidence of his uncharged conduct that would not have been admissible if he was tried separately. Appellant asserts that, consequently, the joint trial resulted in the same jury charged with deciding his fate being subjected to days of testimony and argument of his alleged physical, verbal, and other abuse of Markman, painting him as a sadistic monster with evidence irrelevant to the murder for which he was on trial. Appellant argues that the resulting prejudice was even more acute, if possible, because the trial court ultimately refused to charge the jury on Markman’s defense of duress, therefore allowing it to hear the evidence without an instruction defining the context for which it was offered. The Majority rejects Appellant’s argument.</p>

For example, evidence of a codefendant’s wrongdoing in some circumstances erroneously could lead a jury to conclude that a defendant was guilty. When many defendants are tried, together in a complex case and they have markedly different degrees of culpability, this risk of prejudice is heightened. Evidence that is probative of a defendant’s guilt but technically admissible only against a codefendant also might present a risk of prejudice. Conversely, a defendant might suffer prejudice if essential exculpatory evidence that would be available to a defendant tried alone were unavailable in a joint trial. The risk of prejudice will vary with the facts in each case, and district courts may find prejudice in situations not discussed here. When the risk of prejudice is high, a district court is more likely to determine that separate trials are necessary, but, as we indicated in <em>Richardson v.

She also testified that she attempted to obtain a protection from abuse order against Appellant but did not follow through for fear of Appellant’s anger. Markman further testified that during a fight over Appellant’s relationship with the victim, Leslie White, Appellant pinned her against the wall, grabbed her, put wire around her throat, and threatened her.

He used the knife to cut off her clothes, ran the knife down her body, and raped her.

I disagree. If, in separate trial, the Commonwealth sought to respond to counsel’s argument that Appellant lacked the specific intent to kill because Markman coerced him with the threat of force, the Commonwealth could have fairly have done so with evidence that Appellant was not under duress when he killed the victim. It could have, for example, called Markman to refute Appellant’s argument that she coerced his compliance. It could not have paraded in witness after witness over the course of several days to testify to Appellants’ long term, abusive conduct towards Markman. As discussed above, the prejudicial impact of such evidence outweighs its probative value. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 403 ("Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.’’); <em>Commonwealth v. Wright, </em><a href="/pa/599/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="183" data-cite="599 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="3441590" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0270-01">599 Pa. 270</a>, <a href="/pa/599/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="184" data-cite="961 A.2d 119" data-case-ids="3441590,8189813" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0270-01,/a2d/961/0119-01">961 A.2d 119</a>, 151 (2008) (citing the comment to Rule 403 that "Unfair prejudice” means a tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or divert the jury's attention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.).</p>

Given the extreme prejudice to Appellant from this pervasive testimony, I am unwilling to conclude that a curative jury instruction would have cured the error. As such instruction was not even given, it is unnecessary to confront that question.</p>

Appellant further argues that he was prejudiced in the penalty phase by the trial court's decision not to sever and to allow additional evidence by Markman regarding Appellant's abuse. Appellant specifically refers to Markman's expert testimony regarding the trauma Mark-man endured from Appellant. I do not believe the Majority sufficiently addresses this argument, and, as expressed <em>infra, </em>I am skeptical that the <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>trial court's penalty phase instruction could have cured the prejudice to Appellant. As I would remand for a new guilt-phase trial, I would grant Appellant a new penalty phase proceeding.</p>
