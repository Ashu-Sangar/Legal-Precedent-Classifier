In the case <em>sub judice, </em>this Court is asked to consider both an <em>Atkins </em>claim and an Atkins-related question. The derivative claim is strictly procedural: whether appellant Edward Bracey is entitled to have a jury entertain his post-conviction <em>Atkins </em>claim, raised under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>See Ring v.

The PCRA court concluded that appellant’s <em>Atkins </em>claim, which was impeded by counsel’s inexplicable refusal to present evidence of mental retardation to the PCRA judge, was meritless, and that rendered his request for a jury trial moot. The court dismissed appellant’s serial PCRA petition. For the reasons stated herein, we hold that the jury trial claim should have been reached but, on the merits, there is no federal constitutional right to a jury trial for <em>Atkins </em>claims presented in collateral proceedings. As will be ex<a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>plained, we vacate the PCRA court’s order and remand for an evidentiary hearing and bench determination of appellant’s <em>Atkins </em>claim.</p>

The jury found no mitigating circumstances, and, accordingly, set the penalty at death. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(1)(iv).

In his brief in support of the PCRA petition, appellant asserted that there was sufficient evidence of mental retardation presented at the 1998 PCRA hearing and in the <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>supporting affidavits entered at the prior proceeding that would justify an evidentiary hearing on his <em>Atkins </em>claim.

N.T., 9/13/2006, at 14. Counsel also alleged a “fear” that “if we proceed to a court hearing in a case such as this, it would be either held against us in terms of the assertion of the 6th Amendment jury trial right, or it would be something that would be detrimental to the jury trial right.” <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>

Instead, in retroactive <em>Atkins </em>cases, the PCRA court must hold an evidentiary hearing on colorable <em>Atkins </em>claims, since evidence offered to establish organic brain damage, for a purpose other than to prove <em>Atkins </em>mental retardation, was of limited value in assessing an <em>Atkins </em>claim. <em>Miller, </em><a href="/pa/585/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="888 A.2d 624" data-case-ids="2473196,8997708" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0144-01,/a2d/888/0624-01">888 A.2d at 682-33</a>; <em>see also Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth hypothesizes that such a facially risky position suggests that appellant and his counsel have their strategic sights set on <em>de novo </em>habeas corpus review in the local federal courts, which appellant’s federal lawyers view as a more sympathetic forum in capital matters. Luring this Court into finding the <em>Atkins </em>claim waived, the Commonwealth argues, “would offer them their best long-term prospect for relief,” since “if no <em>Atkins </em>hearing is held in state court, defense counsel will argue on habeas review that defendant is entitled to such a hearing in federal court. And, since it has been decades since the federal courts have upheld a sentence of death with respect to any Philadelphia prisoner who did not consent to be executed, they will find themselves in a remarkably favorable forum for that argument.” <em>See </em>Brief of the Commonwealth at 19-20.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The Commonwealth argues that this Court should reject this illegitimate strategy, and order a bench hearing on the mental retardation claim.</p>

Indeed, this is so much the case that it lends some credence to the Commonwealth’s position that the strategy below was designed to ensure that no state court judge would pass upon the merits of the <em>Atkins </em>claim (or if it did, it would only be after the substantial delay occasioned by an incomplete record and appeal to this Court, seeking remand).</p>

Instead, it suggests that this Court overlook this logical conclusion and remand this matter so that a bench <em>Atkins </em>hearing can be held, thus ensuring that the state court serves its primary role as the initial forum for constitutional claims, and avoiding the initial federal determination of <em>Atkins </em>that appellant seems to prefer.</p>

After all, salutary Pennsylvania procedural doctrine should not be defeated by attorney manipulations or even by concerns with subsequent federal habeas corpus review. But there is more. The indeterminate procedural posture of this case is at least in part a product of the PCRA court’s apparent indecision. At the hearing, the court could have passed upon the Commonwealth’s argument that the <em>Atkins </em>jury trial issue was waived based on appellant’s belated motion; or, the court could have explicitly passed upon appellant’s request to proceed before a jury. If the court had specifically ruled on the jury trial question in the Commonwealth’s favor, the court should then have proceeded to rule upon the anticipatory defense request for interlocutory review. Explicit denial of that request, in turn, would have conveyed to appellant in unmistakable terms that, absent a request for interlocutory review in this Court, a <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>refusal to abide by the determination on the jury request and “rest” instead upon obviously inadequate “papers” would result in a waiver of any future opportunity to present additional evidence relating to <em>Atkins.</em>

Instead, notwithstanding its initial indication that the jury request was both preserved and denied, the court delayed its definitive ruling until its later opinion and allowed appellant to “rest on the papers.” This determination was at best ambiguous concerning whether appellant’s obduracy was being viewed as a waiver. In its later opinion, the court focused solely on “those papers,” inevitably rejected the <em>Atkins </em>claim on that “record,” and held that the jury issue became moot.</p>

Moreover, the court’s finding of mootness on the jury trial question does not follow at all from the finding that the <em>pre-Atkins </em>record was insufficient. Logically, the jury trial issue was distinct from, and preliminary to, the <em>Atkins </em>question. The PCRA court essentially allowed the jury trial question to go unresolved, did not explicitly put appellant to the evidentiary choice and consequent waiver he should have faced if it was unpersuaded by the jury trial claim (as it should have been under existing authority), and then passed upon what amounted to a faux <em>Atkins </em>claim that not only was meritless, but also meaningless, since appellant, who was granted a hearing, chose not to proffer any evidence targeted to <em>Atkins.</em>

Indeed, given the timeliness and serial petition restrictions of the PCRA, and the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that <em>Ring </em>is a procedural rule and does not operate retroactively, a pure <em>Ring </em>claim here would be time-barred. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(iii).

A post-conviction <em>Atkins </em>claim, however, is not a typical new rule claim. Most new rules look back to the proceeding producing the judgment of sentence, and if that proceeding is deficient under the new rule, and the new rule applies retroactively, the judgment will be undone and a new proceeding awarded. Not so with a collateral <em>Atkins </em>claim. By definition, there is no prior mental retardation/death eligibility decision, wrapped into the judgment of sentence, to be revisited under a new substantive rule. Instead, a post-conviction <em>Atkins </em>claim raises a new claim that was not contemplated, much less adjudicated, at the time of the earlier proceedings and judgment. Thus, properly under<a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>stood, the <em>Ring </em>question presented in the <em>Atkins </em>setting is whether the defendant has the procedural right to a jury at his prospective <em>Atkins </em>hearing.

Rather, death is the statutorily authorized penalty for that class of persons who are found guilty of first-degree murder, the circumstances of which involve certain aggravating factors that are found, by a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt. Certainly, these statutory aggravating factors can be offset by the finding of mitigating factors, but that does not change the bedrock fact that the Pennsylvania penalty scheme sets the maximum penalty at death for capital defendants who meet both criteria — first-degree murder and one or more of certain statutory aggravating circumstances. The statute is not written in the negative, as appellant would have it.
