    <p id="b224-6" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[288,460,1152,1322]]]'>On December 15, 2002, Appellant and at least one other person shot Walter Smith to death on the street in front of a bar in North Philadelphia. Some three months before his violent death, Mr. Smith had told police that an acquaintance of Appellant’s, Clinton Robinson, was responsible for the August 2002 murder of another person, Margaret Thomas. Appellant was arrested in May 2006, for the murder of Mr. Smith. The Commonwealth’s theory of the case was that Appellant had killed Mr. Smith in order to prevent him from testifying against Mr. Robinson. The Commonwealth relied upon physical evidence that included the following: 1) two different types of ammunition recovered from the murder scene as well as from Mr. Smith’s body, showing that Appellant had acted in concert with at least one other individual in the murder; and 2) a red baseball-type cap found at the scene that contained Appellant’s DNA on the sweatband and Mr. Smith’s DNA in blood stains on the brim. In addition, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Bryant Younger, who had heard Appellant make two statements with which he implicated himself in Mr. Smith’s murder. The defense sought to cast doubt upon the Commonwealth’s evidence largely by challenging the significance of the DNA evidence and by characterizing Mr. Younger as a “rat” who would do anything to avoid an impending life sentence for a federal drug conviction.</p>

In the case of first-degree murder, a person is guilty when the Commonwealth proves that: (1) a human being was unlawfully killed; (2) the person accused is responsible for the killing; and (3) the accused acted with specific intent to kill. An intentional killing is a killing by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing. The Commonwealth may prove that a killing was intentional solely through circumstantial evidence. The finder of fact may infer that the defendant had the specific intent to kill the victim based on the defendant’s use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim’s body.</blockquote>

The testimony of Dr. Lieberman established that Mr. Smith was the victim of a homicide who died of multiple gunshot wounds. The Commonwealth offered ample circumstantial evidence to establish that Appellant was responsible for Mr. Smith’s murder, including the following. (1) A red baseball hat found at the murder scene near the victim’s body contained Appellant’s DNA on the sweatband and Mr. Smith’s DNA in a bloodstain on the brim. Mr. Smith’s companion on the night of his murder testified that someone wearing red clothing and a baseball cap ran past her just before the shooting started, and then, following the shooting, that person, among others, ran from the scene. No spattered blood was observed near where the cap was found. The Commonwealth suggested, and the jury could have reasonably inferred, that Appellant had been wearing the hat when he shot Mr. Smith at close range, staining the brim of the hat with Mr. Smith’s spattered blood, but then Appellant lost the hat when he ran from the scene. (2) There was testimony concerning two conversations in which Appellant implicated himself in the murder. In the first conversation, Appellant acknowledged that he had shot someone outside a bar. In the second conversation, Appellant indicated that he had done something to get Clinton Robinson released from <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>custody after the latter was arrested for the murder of Ms. Thomas. (3) There was evidence that Appellant knew Mr. Robinson, whom Mr. Smith had identified to police as Ms. Thomas’s killer. The Commonwealth reasonably suggested that Appellant’s motivation in killing Mr. Smith was to prevent him from testifying against Mr. Robinson. Finally, there was ample evidence that Mr. Smith’s murder was intentional, willful, deliberate, and premeditated. Dr. Lieberman testified that Mr. Smith sustained three incapacitating injuries from three gunshots, two of which injuries were to his head, and two of which shots were fired after Mr. Smith had fallen to the ground, already in an incapacitated state. Furthermore, Dr. Lieberman also testified that one of Mr. Smith’s incapacitating injuries was caused by a bullet fired directly into his forehead at close range. Dr. Lieberman’s testimony was unquestionably sufficient to establish that the intent of the shooters was to kill Mr. Smith. We conclude that the Commonwealth established all three elements of first-degree murder.</p>

Here, the evidence established that at least two assailants suddenly converged on Mr. Smith as he was approaching his vehicle, and, with at least two firearms, shot him twelve times in numerous parts of his body, from his head and neck to his trunk and his extremities. It strains credulity to imagine that two armed assailants independently materialized, at precisely the same time and the same place and with the same intent, <em>i.e., </em>to gun-down Mr. Smith. The ballistics evidence indicated that bullets fired from two different firearms were found lodged in Mr. Smith’s neck. <em>See </em>N.T., 6/21/07, at 78. The conduct and the overt acts of the shooters constituted sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer the existence of a conspiratorial agreement.</p>
