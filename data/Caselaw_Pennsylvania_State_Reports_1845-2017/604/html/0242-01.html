Based on this information, police secured a search warrant for Jarowecki’s home, which they executed on January 20, 2005. When told that police were looking for child pornography, Jarowecki, an employee of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, claimed that he had contacted AOL himself to report that he had received a video showing an adult engaged in a sexual act with an infant. Pursuant to the search warrant, police seized two computers from Jarowecki’s residence, as well as hundreds of YHS tapes and dozens of floppy and CD-ROM disks.

He claimed that he did not choose which images to save to the disks, but instead retained all the images he received from his participation within the various groups.

Thus, the trial court graded the conviction for count 1 — the “first offense” — as a third-degree felony, and the convictions for counts 2 through 8 — the “second offense[s]” — as second-degree felonies.

Instead, Jarowecki argues Section 6312 reflects a “recidivist philosophy,” and as such should be interpreted to require that the offenses not only be separate in time, but also sequential in terms of conviction and punishment. Brief for Appellant at 9 (“Under the ‘second or subsequent’ language ... it is not merely enough that Appellant acquired the images at various times; Appellant must have been convicted under § 6312 <em>prior to </em>collecting the batch of images for which he was convicted of in this present matter.” (emphasis added)).

The Commonwealth contends that, under the plain language of the statute, enhancement under Section 6312 requires “only a prior offense” and, as “the defendant came to sentencing with convictions for multiple offenses of possession of child pornography,” counts 2 through 8 must be considered second offenses. Brief for Commonwealth at 11. It argues that the legislature could have, but did not, adopt language like that in 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9714, which it concedes clearly reflects a recidivist character. <em>Id. </em>at 12 (citing 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9714(a)(1) (imposing enhanced sentence “if at the time of the commission of the current offense the person had previously been convicted of a crime of violence”)).

We do not question the legislature’s policy determination that acts like those of which Jarowecki was convicted merit the condemnation of society and more severe punishment for repeated convictions. Nevertheless, we are duty bound only to interpret and apply the criminal statutes— strictly — and, in so doing, we must apply precedent in a coherent and consistent fashion. Here, the legislature has seen fit to draft a statute that, by its terms, and when viewed in light of long-standing caselaw from this Commonwealth, is reflective of a recidivist philosophy. Accordingly, we conclude the legislature did not intend to authorize a sentence enhancement under Section 6312(d)(2) for Jarowecki’s convictions on counts 2 through 8 based on his simultaneous conviction at count 1.

Thus, each offense, following the first, must have been committed after the defendant's conviction of the immediately preceding offense. Courts adopting this view have reasoned that habitual offender statutes are intended to warn the potential career criminal of the consequences of persistent criminal activity, and to give the offender an opportunity to reform through exposure to the restraining influences of conviction and punishment before the more severe punishment of an habitual offender statute is imposed. The offender is deemed incorrigible not so much because he or she has sinned more than once, but because the offender has demonstrated, through persistent criminal behavior, that he or she is not susceptible to the reforming influence of the conviction process.</blockquote>

    <p id="b307-6" data-blocks='[["BL_307.6",307,[132,645,1157,594]]]'>As the majority states, our objective is to effectuate legislative intent, which is most appropriately found in the plain language of the statute itself. It is the legislature’s prerogative to afford harsher punishments for multiple offenses, including those occurring after commission, but prior to conviction. However, absent clear language to the contrary, one must be convicted of a first offense prior to the commission of the second offense in order to receive an enhanced penalty. This does not imply the perpetrator is not sentenced for serial crimes, only that he does not receive the enhanced grading for sentencing purposes.</p>
    <p id="b307-7" data-blocks='[["BL_307.7",307,[129,1283,1157,527]]]'>Madame Justice Todd has appropriately provided a wealth of case law detailing Pennsylvania’s jurisprudence on this issue; the need for a prior conviction before grading enhancement is the general rule, only to be altered when the legislature so decides. Therefore, in my view, there is no need to question examine what philosophy a statute reflects. Rather, when considering grading enhancements, the question should be, “does the plain language of the statute warrant enhanced grading for multiple counts?” In this case, the language does not afford such an enhancement.</p>
