We allowed this appeal to consider whether 42 Pa.C.S. § 9765 requires that Appellant’s two convictions merge for sentencing purposes. We hold that a plain reading of Section 9765 reveals the General Assembly’s intent that crimes with different statutory elements be punished separately. As each of the two offenses here contains distinct elements, we conclude that, under Section 9765, the consecutive sentences imposed were proper. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>

The officer pulled the car over for a traffic violation. While asking the driver for his license and registration, Officer Waters noticed Appellant moving around in the left rear seat. Officer Waters instructed Appellant to place his hands on the headrest in front of him. Although Appellant initially complied, moments later, Officer Waters noticed that the Appellant was again moving. The officer ordered Appellant out of the car, at which time Officer Waters detected a strong odor of alcohol emanating from Appellant. After Appellant repeatedly ignored instructions to place his hands on the trunk of the vehicle, Officer Waters frisked Appellant and found a gun in his front pants pocket.</p>

Any other interpretation, argues Appellant, triggers constitutional concerns, specifically a violation of double jeopardy protections.</p>

Second, the <em>Jones </em>OAJC does not affirmatively state that Section 9765 applied or that it was applying the statute in that case. Third, the <em>Jones </em>OAJC noted that the statute “is silent” on the issue of whether the facts of a case are relevant to the merger analysis. <em>Jones, </em><a href="/pa/590/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="912 A.2d 815" data-case-ids="3851813,8444223" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0356-01,/a2d/912/0815-01">912 A.2d at 819</a>.

As a matter of separation of powers, I question whether the General Assembly may instruct this Court as to how to analyze statutes to determine whether the offenses they define should merge.

But, there is more to the jurisprudence of sentencing than such simple, Procrustean dictates. Although the statute allows for maximum exposure for criminal sentences as a constitutional matter, there still exists substantive review of individualized sentencing decisions. Thus, I would caution both trial courts and the Superior Court, as the frontline appeals court reviewing sentences, to be cognizant of the fact that, while the statute may put a draconian end to merger claims, it does not supplant the review for reasonableness which is independently commanded by Section 9781 of the Judicial Code. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9781(c)(2) (directing appellate court to vacate sentence and remand for re-sentencing even if sentence is within guidelines where application of guidelines “would be clearly unreasonable”). In my judgment, it is patently unreasonable to impose consecutive sentences in scenarios like these. <em>See, e.g., Jones, </em><a href="/pa/590/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="912 A.2d 815" data-case-ids="3851813,8444223" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0356-01,/a2d/912/0815-01">912 A.2d at 824</a> (concluding that sentences for burglary and criminal trespass merged because “the very same narrow facts charged proved both crimes”); <em>Comer, </em><a href="/a2d/716/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="716 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="11702953,559332" data-case-paths="/a2d/716/0593-01,/pa/552/0527-01">716 A.2d at 599</a> (holding that sentences for homicide by vehicle <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>and involuntary manslaughter merged because “[ajppellant’s act of recklessly driving his vehicle into the SEPTA bus stand supports both the general element of the ‘commission of a reckless act’ of involuntary manslaughter and the specific requirement of a Vehicle Code violation of homicide by vehicle”); <em>Commonwealth v. Anderson, </em><a href="/citations/?q=588%20Pa.%20574" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="588 Pa. 574">588 Pa. 574</a>, <a href="/a2d/650/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="650 A.2d 20" data-case-ids="11311697,475550" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/0020-01,/pa/538/0574-01">650 A.2d 20</a>, 24 (1994) (holding that sentences for aggravated assault and attempted murder merged because “one cannot kill without inflicting serious bodily injury”). We should not lose sight, as judges, of that which common sense dictates. Just as defendants are not entitled to volume discounts for multiple crimes, neither should they suffer multiple punishments for the same core conduct — such as entering a building. That is unreasonable.</p>
