As noted above, Smithwick testified at trial that, following the murder of Finney and Steed on November 29, 2002, members of Richard Brown’s gang, including Appellant and Smith, gathered at the home of Richard Brown’s girlfriend, Tammy, and discussed their plan for retaliation. N.T. Trial, 5/4/05, at 93. Smithwick testified that, on the following day, November 30, 2002, he, Appellant, and Moore went to the Firing Line Gun Store, where Moore purchased a firearm at the direction of Appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 95. Smithwick further described how, on <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>December 1, 2002, he again was at the home of Brown’s girlfriend, Tammy, when Appellant and Smith announced they were going to 42nd and Ogden Streets to Mil whoever they saw “that was hanging with Brent and Malik [and] G Bucks.” <em>Id. </em>at 97.</p>

This evidence established more than Appellant’s mere presence at the scene of the crime; it established that Appellant, over several days, engaged in a deliberate, pre-mediated plan to exact revenge on individuals believed responsible for the shootings of Finney and Steed.

In allowing Appellant’s statement to be introduced, the trial court noted that, during the penalty phase, Appellant’s sister, Asekia Barmont, testified that she had talked with Appellant about the killing of Grant, and that Appellant had expressed regret, N.T. 5/9/05, at 93-94, and that this evidence was introduced for purposes of establishing appellant’s character under the catch-all mitigator. The trial court concluded that an appellant’s lack of remorse is relevant to his character, and, thus, relevant to determination of the catch-all mitigator, and, therefore, the prosecutor was entitled to present rebuttal evidence on this issue. The trial court further determined that the prosecutor’s comment in the instant case in no way suggested to the jury that Appellant had a duty to testify, and emphasized that it specifically instructed the jury that Appellant had an absolute right under the Constitution to remain silent, and that the jury should not draw any adverse inference from the fact that Appellant did not testify during the penalty phase. <em>See </em>N.T.
