Martin, and three children by a former marriage, Alex. G., James T. and Elspatious G. His estate, which was large, was accumulated after his second marriage.\nAfter reciting the provisions of the will the opinion continues:\n\u201cAfter the execution of this will, Mr. McIntosh made valuable improvements on the Klingensmith property, devoted to the heirs of E. G. McIntosh, and thereupon executed a codicil by which he directed that the improvement so made should \u2018 be valued or appraised \u2019 at his decease, and \u2018 deducted from the money due the heir or heirs of such share.\u2019 The evidence adduced here shows them to have been worth $2,400 as of July 24, 1891. Mrs. McIntosh refused to take under the will.\n\u201c The questions submitted for decision are, whether or not (1) the first gift to Mrs. Martin was conditioned upon the widow\u2019s acceptance under the will; and if not (2) to what extent, if any, that gift is a trust fund to secure compensation to those whom the widow\u2019s election disappointed; (8) the first gift to Mrs. Martin is independent of the second; and (4) a ( valid, active trust was created in the share given to the heirs of Elspatious Gr. McIntosh, deceased; (5) part of the real estate devised to Alex. G-. McIntosh, being in Iowa where the widow takes one-half absolutely, it is insisted that the valuation placed by the testator on that real estate should be reduced to that extent for the purpose of equalization; and, (6) in the gift to 4 James Tulloch and his children,\u2019 the word \u2018 children \u2019 shall be construed as of purchase or limitation.\n\u201c (1) The two gifts made to Mrs. Martin were manifestly intended to be independent of each other and cumulative. The testator divided his estates into two parts and made independent dispositions of them. The gifts to Mrs. Martin thereout differ in their quality : the first is in remainder and the second in prassenti. The second is directed to be equalized with the shares given to her brothers out of presently available assets, whereas the first was made payable after the death of the widow. \u2018 I give and bequeath to our said daughter, Lucretia Mott Martin,\u2019 said testator, 4 certain real estate at a valuation of $46,000, and to this shall be added enough personal property to make her share equal to that of any one of the other three heirs.\u2019 It is plain that equalization was intended to be made, not by aid of the personal property bequeathed to Mrs. McIntosh and Mrs. Martin, for Mrs. Martin\u2019s interest in that was only in remainder and would not be available until Mrs. McIntosh\u2019s death, but out of the other part of the personal estate which would be presently available.\n44 (2) It will readily be conceded that the application of the expression 4 the above,\u2019 upon which the argument for conditional gift in remainder to Mrs. Martin rests, must be ascertained by reference to what follows it in the paragraph in which it is used; for without that the expression would be insensible. To what then does the expression refer ? In the first place it refers to one object, whereas there are two 4 above \u2019 \u2014 an estate for life and an estate in remainder. \u2018The above is intended, to be, and is to be taken in lieu or bar of \u2019 which of these ? Dower. Taken by whom ? No other than the widow is mentioned. It is what is given to her \u2014 a life estate, not what was given to Mrs. Martin \u2014 a remainder \u2014 that was intended to be barred. It is precisely the same as though the testator had said, if the widow accepts \u2018 the above \u2019 it shall be in lieu of dower. She had no interest in the remainder; there had been an absolute and independent gift of that to Mrs. Martin. Had Mrs. McIntosh died before her husband there can be no doubt but that Mrs. Martin would have taken the one third of the personal estate absolutely. Having survived, if she had accepted under the will, Mrs. Martin would have taken the whole on her death, or by agreement between them they could have divided it on the basis of the cash value of their respective estates \u2014 the widow taking the one third and Mrs. Martin the other two thirds absolutely. In any event, Mrs. Martin would have received exactly what testator intended she should have.\n\u201cThe suggestion that the relationship of Mrs. Martin, as the only child of the widow, can affect the question of construction has no merit. That fact might explain the expression of, but cannot create, a condition. Here there was neither an express nor implied condition attached to the gift; it was independent and absolute on its face, and extrinsic evidence is incompetent to show an intention to create such condition. It is clear that Mrs. Martin was intended to be a favored object of testator\u2019s bounty. Nothing short of express words or necessary implication would justify the inference that testator intended to coerce his widow into acceptance under his will through her affection for her daughter, for such purpose would hav-e been not only inconsistent with the spirit of the statute which gave her a right of election, but with that fair and humane dealing which he owed her as husband. But neither the language used nor the value of the gift justify such inference. The advantages of refusal were so great that there could have been no temptation even'to acceptance. The bequest here is totally unlike that in Carr\u2019s Estate, 13 i Pa. 354, which was expressly conditioned upon the widow\u2019s acceptance under the will.\n\u201c If, then, the gift to Mrs. Martin was absolute, it was accelerated by the' widow\u2019s refusal to take under the will; and she thereby became entitled to some present estate, but to what ? Certainly, as between her and the widow, the latter could no more take the whole of her third out of that portion of the personal property set apart to her by the will than out of the homestead. She must take, as though no will had been made, out of the bulk of the estate, and the other beneficiaries take the residue as constituting the whole estate, and as though the widow were dead, in the interests contemplated by testator. If the legacies be of equal grade they must abate proportionately.\n\u201c As between Mrs. Martin and her brothers, the refusal of the widow to take under the will presents a question which turns upon the application of the principle that \u2018 where a widow elects not to take under a will her substituted devises and bequests are a trust in her for the benefit of the disappointed claimants to the amount of their interest therein. A court of equity will sequester the benefit intended for the widow to secure compensation to those whom her election disappoints.\u2019 Gallagher\u2019s Appeal, 87 Pa. 200; Ferguson\u2019s Appeal, 138 Pa. 208. Are there substituted devises and bequests here out of which compensation can be made? It is clear that so far as the personal estate is concerned there are not. By her election the widow became entitled to a share in her husband\u2019s estate as though he had died intestate, and the will operates on the rest as though she were dead: Vance\u2019s Estate, 141 Pa. 201. Assuming then that her share has been taken out, what remains constitutes the whole personal estate for distribution amongst testator\u2019s children and grandchildren as provided by the will; and of this Mrs. Martin is entitled to one third and the four children of testator, including Mrs. Martin, are entitled to the other two thirds in the proportions specified in the will. The result, so far as the bequest to Mrs. McIntosh for life, and Mrs. Martin in remainder is concerned, is that Mrs. McIntosh will get the exact equivalent in cash of her life estate, and Mrs. Martin of her remainder. To illustrate: Suppose this bequest to amount to $30,000; on the principle recognized in Dates-man\u2019s Appeal, 127 Pa. 348, the cash value of the widow\u2019s life estate would be one third, or $10,000; and that of Mrs. Martin, remainder two thirds, or $20,000.\n\u201c There are then no benefits intended for the widow in suspense ; both she and Mrs. Martin get exactly what the testator intended they should have, and there can consequently be no fund available for compensation and no disappointed legatees.\n\u201c But the situation in respect to the real estate is different. The effect of the widow\u2019s election was to increase the share of Mrs. Martin in the homestead by two thirds of the rental value, and to decrease that of the devisees in the other real estate by one third, during the widow\u2019s life, and thereby to change the proportion in which testator intended they should take. The gain to Mrs. Martin represented the \u2018 benefits intended for the widow,\u2019 \u2018 her substituted devise,\u2019 and therefore a trust fund to secure compensation to those whom the widow\u2019s election disappointed.\n\u201c It is conceded that there are disappointed claimants, but are they entitled to compensation out of this fund ? It would seem clear that they are. \u2018 The principle is well settled that equity will depart from the literal provisions of a will in order to carry out a superior or preferred intent of the testator which would otherwise fail. But the object is not to produce a distribution which the court may think more equal or equitable, but to approximate as closely as possible to the scheme of the testator, which has failed by reason of intervening rights or circumstances.\u2019 It will be conceded that a \u2018 superior or preferred intent \u2019 of the testator was that his beneficiaries should take in the proportions prescribed in his will, and that these proportions have been changed by the widow\u2019s election. Mrs. Martin has gained what from the face of the will she was not intended to have, and the other devisees have lost; testator\u2019s scheme has to this extent failed. Mrs. Martin\u2019s gain is the widow\u2019s \u2018 substituted devise,\u2019 and therefore a trust fund which should be used'to secure compensation to those whom the widow\u2019s election disappointed, and thus \u2018 approximate as closely as possible to the scheme of the testator.\u2019\n\u201c With a view to save the expense of a regular proceeding in sequestration, the court suggested that the parties agree upon the cash value of this \u2018 substituted devise,\u2019 and this having been done, the amount is deducted from Mrs. Martin\u2019s share in the personal estate.\n\u201c (3) It was conceded that the legal title to the share of Elspatious G. McIntosh\u2019s heirs was vested by the will in trustees; but it is insisted that in respect of all this share, with possibly the exception of the AndersoD property, the trust was dry, and therefore executed.\n\u201c It is very clear that testator created a valid active trust in the Anderson street property. The gift to the trustees necessarily implied the collection of rents, and therefore the custody of the property and some discretion in respect to the payment of the net income.\n\u201c In respect to the rest of this share (less $10,000 cash given Robert McIntosh), the creation of an active trust is not so plainly, but is sufficiently expressed. It is conceded that the will vested in the trustees the legal title. The scheme of the trust declared gave these trustees a large discretion, and necessarily imposed on them active duties. They were \u2018 empowered,\u2019 \u2018 in case of necessity from sickness of any of the heirs \u2019 of E. G. McIntosh, deceased, or, \u2018should any of the children of\u2019 L. J. McIntosh, deceased, \u2018be desirous of a collegiate or classical education,\u2019 \u2018 to use the income of this share.\u2019 Out of what are these expenses to be paid ? The expression, \u2018 this share,\u2019 is the same as that used in the gift to the trustees, and, standing by itself, would of course include the whole \u2018 share \u2019 of the heirs of E. G. McIntosh, deceased. But its use here was evidently in a limited sense, for the testator had already specifically set apart the net rents of the Anderson street property\u2014 one half to Robert McIntosh, and the other half \u2018 for the support of the children\u2019 of L. J. McIntosh, deceased. The provision for defrayal of expenses of sickness and education immediately follows this, and was evidently intended as additional and extraordinary, and to be paid out of the income of the share given to these \u2018 heirs \u2019 of E. G. McIntosh, deceased. On no other theory of construction can the disposition of \u2018 this share \u2019 be made effectual. It will thus be seen that the income of the whole of \u2018 this share \u2019 is pledged for the defrayal of expenses which may become necessary in case of sickness of any one of the heirs of E. G. McIntosh, deceased, or the education of either of the children of L. J. McIntosh, deceased, until the youngest attains majority. An adequate reason for the creation of this trust is found in the minority of two of the heirs of the cestui que trust, either of whom may become entitled to the benefits; and an additional reason is suggested by the evident belief of the testator, whether justified by facts or not is immaterial, that the industry and sobriety of the other needed to be tested by time. The nature of the trust is such that it must continue in respect of the whole of \u2018 this share.\u2019 Who will receive the benefit, and how much will be required of the income to meet the necessary expenses of sickness or education, it is impossible to foretell. From the nature of the case there will be inequality. One may receive nothing or the whole. It will thus be seen that each cestui que trust is interested in the continuance of the trust in \u2018 this share \u2019 as a whole: Hinkle\u2019s Appeal, 116 Pa. 490. If the trust be valid as to one, it must necessarily be valid as to all. The accumulations, if any, will be simply temporary, and in the interest of judicious management: Hibbs\u2019 Est., 143 Pa. 217.\n\u201cThat this was a valid, active trust, then, seems clear. There are sufficient words used, a definite object, and ascertained subjects, and it is not inconsistent with public policy: Marshall\u2019s Est., 147 Pa. 77.\n\u201c (4) It was conceded in argument that the gift to \u2018 James T. McIntosh and his children \u2019 would, standing alone, give the latter equal rights in distribution with their father. This is the leading and operative clause, and the word \u2018 children \u2019 being of purchase must be so construed, unless a contrary intention can be gathered from the whole will. That it was used in its primary sense here is strengthened by the fact that in every other instance in which it appears it is undoubtedly used as a word of purchase, while the word \u2018 heirs \u2019 is used as a word of limitation. But counsel insist that because \u2018 this share \u2019 is elsewhere referred to as James T. McIntosh\u2019s, the word \u2018children\u2019 must be treated as a word of limitation or succession. The implication is not necessary. The leading and operative clause is, as already seen, that to \u2018 James T. McIntosh and his children,\u2019 and the natural inference is that James T. McIntosh\u2019s name was simply used by way of convenient reference. Similar use was made of the name of Alexander G. McIntosh, and yet no one intimates that he can justly claim a share. Being fathers, their selection as representatives was but natural, and could not be construed to take away benefits which had been expressly given their children.\u201d\nDistribution was decreed in accordance with the opinion.
