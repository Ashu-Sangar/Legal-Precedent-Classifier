L. 118, is constitutional. If it is, notice must be given, and the lien was rightly stricken off for want thereof.\nWhile said act may be objectionable in form, it is nevertheless in substantial compliance with section 6 of article 3 of the constitution. It not only quotes the title of the act of June 16, 1836, but it re-enacts and publishes at length so much thereof as, by its supplement of May 1, 1861, is extended and amended! It is obviously unessential that the supplement precedes the original act in the order of reference ; it is evident from the reference that the legislature had the whole subject-matter before-it and what its purpose was : Best v. Baumgardner, 122 Pa. 17.\nThe question of interference with judicial functions is sufficiently answered by the opinion of this court in Hancock\u2019s Appeal, 115 Pa. 1.\nWe see no reason for reversal of the decree striking off the lien, and the same is therefore affirmed and appeal dismissed, with costs to be paid by appellants.",

It is unessential that the supplement precedes the original act in the order of reference.\nThe act of May 18, 1887, P.

P. Karns & Co. \u201c to build and construct an addition \u201d to his house, \u201c and make repairs, etc., as designated in specifications hereto attached and made part hereof.\u201d The specifications indicated repairs as well as addition to old building. Some disputes arose between the parties as to the deficiency of the work, and it was alleged by defendant that Karns & Co. never completed their contract, but have been paid in. full. On Jan. 15, 1890, plaintiffs filed their claim for $267.38 against defendant\u2019s building, and issued a sci. fa. Defendant then moved to strike off the lien on the ground that no notice had been given as required by act of May 18, 1887, P. L. 118. The court made absolute the rule to strike off the lien, in an opinion by White, P. J., of the 40th judicial district, specially presiding.\nError assigned was above order, quoting it.\nT. C.
