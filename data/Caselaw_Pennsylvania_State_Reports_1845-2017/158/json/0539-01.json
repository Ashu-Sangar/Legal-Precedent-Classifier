The lease provided that the tenant \u201c shall pay and work out all taxes assessed against said farm.\u201d\nOn Nov. 7, 1890, plaintiffs issued a landlord\u2019s warrant and distrained the wheat. The tenant claimed the benefit of the exemption laws, demanded an appraisement, and the wheat was appraised and set aside for him Nov. 14, 1890. On the same day plaintiffs served a notice on the tenant to leave in thirty days for nonpayment of rent \u2014 the thirty days expiring Dec. 15, 1890. Plaintiffs took possession on this latter date and have held the premises ever since.\nOn Oct. 27, 1890, the treasurer of Allegheny count}\"- issued and delivered to the tax collector a warrant and a schedule of unpaid taxes assessed in Indiana township for the year 1890, including those upon said farm, to wit, $18.40 county taxes and $4.60 township taxes. Having demanded payment of the taxes from the tenant and thirty days having elapsed, the collector, on Dec. 4, 1890, leyied upon the wheat and upon other personal property, and, after ten days\u2019 notice required by law, sold the same at public sale to Hugh MeCutcheon.
