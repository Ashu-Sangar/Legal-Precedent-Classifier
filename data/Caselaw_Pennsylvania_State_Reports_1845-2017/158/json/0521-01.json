    "head_matter": "Gracie\u2019s Estate. Union Trust Co.\u2019s Appeal.\nHusband and wife \u2014 Statute of limitations.\nThe statute of limitations does not begin to run to bar the claim of a husband against his wife until the death of the wife.\nDecedents' estates \u2014 Declarations of wife as to ownership of money deposited in her name \u2014 Evidence\u2014Presumption\u2014Gift.\nA testamentary paper in the handwriting of a wife, to the effect that certain moneys deposited in her name in a bank really belonged to her husband and that she desired her husband to have the moneys, is competent evidence after the death of the wife of the ownership of the deposit, although when the paper was found the signature was torn off.\nIn addition to the testamentary paper referred to, there was in evidence declarations of the wife to the effect that the money belonged to her husband, and that she had taken charge of it because he was not much of a business man. There was no evidence that she ever claimed the deposit as her own. Held, that the evidence was sufficient to rebut any presumption of gift.\nArgued Nov. 8, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 287, Oct. T., 1893, by The Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh, guardian of Benjamin M. and Thomas R. Gracie, minor children of Emma Gracie, deceased, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., May T., 1893, No. 68, dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Thompson, JJ.\nAdjudication of administrator\u2019s account.\nThe facts appear by the following opinion of the court below by Over, J.:\n\u201c The fund for distribution arises from deposits made by the decedent in her name in the Dollar Savings Bank, Real Estate Savings Bank and the Bank of Pittsburgh. There is also in the possession of the administrator for distribution an Allegheny county riot bond, appraised at $1,040. Alex. R. Grade, the husband of the decedent, alleges that the money deposited by her was his, that the bond was purchased with his money, and claims it and the whole fund.\n\u201c The deposits in the Dollar and Real Estate Savings Banks were all made more than six years prior to the decedent\u2019s death, and it is contended that as to them the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Whilst the claimant stands in the position of a creditor of his wife\u2019s estate, McDermott v. Miners\u2019 Sav. Bk., 100 Pa. St. 288, yet the same disability, to wit, the unity of persons which prevents a wife from maintaining an action against her husband, Marsteller v. Marsteller, 93 Pa. 350, would also prevent a husband from maintaining an action against his wife. His remedy was therefore postponed until her death; the statute would not begin to run until then, and his claim is consequently not barred by it.\n\u201c For the purpose of showing that the moneys deposited in bank belonged to the claimant, he proved declarations made by his wife to different persons to the effect that it belonged to her husband, and also offered a testamentary paper in her handwriting, dated February 11, 1875, in which she provided as follows: \u2018 The money I have in my name in the Dollar Savings Bank is money belonging to my beloved husband, for it is his hard earning, therefore it is all his and I wish him to have it all. And the money I have in my name in the Real Estate Savings Bank is\u2019all his; he always gave me the money and I saved it for him and it is all his hard earnings; also the mortgage which I hold in my name against George Bauman, also is the money which my beloved husband worked hard for and gave it to me to buy the mortgage and let me have it in my name and I wish him to have it all.\u2019 This paper was signed by the decedent and witnessed by a domestic living with her at the time; but when it was found after her death her signature was torn off; for this reason it was objected to as incompetent evidence. Whilst it could not take effect as a will, there is no apparent reason, it being in the handwriting of the decedent, why it is not competent proof of her declaration. It is conceded that oral proof can be made of them and we have much better proof, to wit, written evidence. This paper, in connection with the other evidence in the case, shows very satisfactorily that all the moneys deposited in the Dollar and Real Estate Savings Banks, prior to February 11, 1875, belonged to the claimant. The only deposit made after that date in either was one of $1,267, on September 18, 1879, in the Dollar Savings Bank. The evidence, however, shows that this was a transfer from the account of George Gracie, son of the claimant, of moneys which he had deposited for his father.\n\u201c It is clear therefore that the money here for distribution arising from the deposits in these banks belonged to the claimant. If then he did not intend to make a gift of it to his wife, his claim as to these deposits must be sustained. He was for a number of years steadily employed as manager of oil refineries in the suburbs of the city, where he resided, and it was inconvenient for him to visit the banks. He gave his wages to his wife, who deposited them, and seems to have attended to all outside business for him. She gave as reasons for depositing it in her name to one witness, \u2018 Because Mr. Gracie was not much of a business man; \u2019 \u2018 that he never had time to go with it.\u2019 To another, \u2018 that Mr. Gracie had no business qualities, and she had to attend to this money and look after it, and if she didn\u2019t attend to this business that they would have nothing in no time.\u2019 There is no evidence that she ever claimed these deposits as her own, but both in her oral and written declarations she acknowledged it was his money, and in her writing expressly states that she saved it for him.\n\u201c The evidence is sufficient to rebut any presumption of gift, and is much stronger than that adduced in McDermott\u2019s Appeal, 106 Pa. 358, where a husband\u2019s claim against his wife\u2019s estate for money deposited in her name was sustained. His claim must therefore be allowed.\n\u201c The only evidence as to the Allegheny county riot bond is that of George Gracie, son of the claimant; he testified that the decedent, who was his stepmother, told him that she purchased this bond with her husband\u2019s money, and that he understood from her that it belonged to him. Whilst the evidence as to the claimant\u2019s right to it is not as satisfactory as to the deposits, yet taking it in connection with all the circumstances of the case, it seems sufficient to establish his claim.\n\u201c On the death of the decedent\u2019s father in 1872, she inherited one-fifth interest in a house and lot on Fourth avenue, and in 1875 she purchased with her husband\u2019s money the other four-fifths interest, and also a ground rent, the title being taken in her name. The net rental of this property was probably four hundred dollars per jmar. The claimant was not employed for some years prior to his wife\u2019s death, and no doubt a portion of the rents were applied to the support of the family. The deposits in the bank of Pittsburgh were all made subsequently to 1875, and probably some of the rents were included in them. The balance in this bank, however, was only $349, not sufficient to pay the expenses charged in the account for the administration of her estate. And as the fund for distribution is not sufficient to pay the amount found to be due the claimant, irrespective of his claims, for these deposits, it is not necessary to pass upon the questions raised as to them.\u201d\nThe court awarded the whole fund to claimant.\nExceptions by appellant to the adjudication were dismissed.\nPrrors assigned were dismissal of exceptions, quoting them.\nGeorge P.
