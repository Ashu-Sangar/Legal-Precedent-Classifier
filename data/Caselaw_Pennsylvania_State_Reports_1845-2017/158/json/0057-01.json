Seifert\u2019s Appeal.\nMechanic's lien \u2014 Addition and alteration \u2014 Act of May 18,1887.\nThe owner of a building took out all partitions in the second story of the old building, took off its roof and the upper story of the west wall, spliced the studding in the south, east and north walls of the old building so as to raise its upper story on a level with the upper story of the new building, put it all under one roof and fitted out the upper story of the combined structure as an opera house, and the lower floor of the new addition as a store room, leaving the remainder of the old building substantially as it had been from its first erection. Held, that the new structure was an addition or alteration within the meaning of the act of May 18, 1887, P. L. 118, requiring notice to the owner of materials furnished, or work performed.\nConstitutional Law \u2014 Act of May 18, 1887.\nThe act of May 18, 1887, P. L. 118, relating to mechanics\u2019 liens for repairs, alterations or additions, is constitutional.\nArgued Oct. 5, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 103, Oct. T., 1893, by Edward Seifert, from order of C. P. Jefferson Co., May T., 1893, No. 2, distributing fund raised by sheriff\u2019s sale of real estate under execution, B. J. Smyers v. J. B. Beam and Polly Beam.\nBefore Stekrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Thompson, JJ.\nDistribution of proceeds of sheriff\u2019s sale of real estate.\nThe auditor, John W. Walker, Esq., found that \u201cthere was erected in the spring of 1888, by one McQuqwn and J. B. Beam, then joint owners of the lot against which the mechanics\u2019 liens were filed, and from which the funds in dispute were realized by sheriff\u2019s sale, a two storied frame building 2*2x 60 feet, the lower story being used for a store room and the upper story divided into small rooms fitted up and occupied as a dwelling house. And now, quoting from the testimony of J. B. Beam with reference to above building, he says: \u2018 It was finished. After that building had been completed and we had been in business for a while, I bought McQuown out and took a deed from him. Then several years afterward \u2014 about three years \u2014in 1891, I concluded to enlarge the building. I built what I call the opera house, on the McClure lot, and attached it to the first building.\u2019 Again the witness says: \u2018 In about three years after the first building was finished, I concluded to change it at length ; \u2019 the substance of which is, he built a two storied addition 25x80 feet, on the west side of and attached to the old building; he took out all partitions in the second story of the old building, took off its roof and the upper story of the west wall, spliced the studding in .the south, east and north walls of the old building so as to raise its upper story on a level with the upper story-of the new building, put it all under one roof and fitted out the upper story of the combined structure as an opera house, and the lower floor of the new addition as a store inom, leaving the remainder of, the old building substantially as it had been from its first erection.\u201d The auditor further found : \u201c But all the liens except those of Wm. J. Bruce and Edward Seifert are so irregular that it is a very doubtful question whether or not they would hold under any circumstances ; yet as your auditor is of the opinion that this is an alteration of, and an addition to an old building, he does not feel called upon to enter into the question as to whether they would be otherwise valid or not. Your auditor finds as a fact, from the testimony of J. B. Beam, that the work was done and materials furnished in and about the alteration of and addition to an old building, and that the claims of all the mechanics and material men are governed by the act of May 18, 1887, P. L. 118, which provides as follows : \u2018 That to entitle any one to the benefits of this act, he shall give notice to the owner or reputed owner of the property, or his or her agent, at the time of furnishing the materials or performing the work in and about the repairs, alterations, or additions to any house or other building, of his intention to file a lien under the provisions of this act.\u2019 \u201d\nThe auditor further found that no notice was given by any of the mechanics\u2019 lien claimants of their intention to file their respective liens, and he disregarded their claims and distributed the balance of the funds in controversy to other judgment creditors.\nExceptions to the auditor\u2019s report by Edward Seifert were dismissed in an opinion by Clark, P. J. Exceptant thereupon appealed.\nJErrors assigned were dismissal' of exceptions, quoting them.\nCharles Corbet, W. W. Winslow, R. C. Winslow and J. E.
