Having failed to comply with the terms of the condition he had no right to use the ticket for return trip. The fact that the gateman permitted him to pass through the gate without examining and punching the ticket was no evidence that the condition was waived by the company; nor was the fact that the conductor of the sleeping car failed to notice that the ticket was unstamped, any evidence of waiver. As soon as it passed into the hands of the regular passenger conductor, he discovered that the condition as to stamping had not been complied with, and so informed the plaintiff.\nIn view of the undisputed facts there was no error in charging the jury, as requested by defendant, \u201c that under all the evidence in the case the verdict should be in favor of the defendant.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed.",
