For that reason alone plaintiff would be entitled to an affirmance of the judgment. But waiving that, there appears to be nothing in either of the specifications of error that would warrant a reversal. From the statement of claim, \u2014 supplied by the appellee, \u2014 and the charge of the learned trial judge, it appears that the suit is for balance purchase money due on sale of the coal yard lease referred to in the testimony. It also appears that said balance is represented by the note alleged to have been lost; but the court can so control the execution as to amply protect the defendants against the collection of said note by innocent holders for value. This may be done by restraining the execution until they are sufficiently indemnified by plaintiff, or until they are fully protected by the bar of the statute. According to the evidence, the note was at six months from June 3, 1887, and will therefore be barred by the statute of limitations in a few weeks.\nThe verdict was warranted by the testimony, and there appears to be nothing in the record that requires a reversal of the judgment entered thereon. The court below, on application of defendants, will see that they are properly indemnified, or otherwise protected against the outstanding note.\nJudgment affirmed, with stay of execution until leave to issue the same is granted by the court below.",

P.\nJudgment may be entered in favor of plaintiff in a suit on a promissory note, although the note is lost. In such case the court will control the execution so as to protect defendant, either by restraining the execution until he is sufficiently indemnified by plaintiff, or until he is fully protected by the bar of the statute of limitations.\nArgued Oct. 23, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 5, Oct, T., 1893, by defendants, E. Magee & Co., from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co., June T., 1890, No. 840, on verdict for plaintiff, Clarence Reisinger.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Mc-Collum, Mitchell, Dean and Thompson, JJ.\nAssumpsit for balance of purchase money due on sale of lease.\nAppellant\u2019s paper book did not contain the statement or plaintiff\u2019s points. It also omitted the charge of the court in the order required by Rule 17.\nFrom plaintiff\u2019s statement as printed in appellee\u2019s paper book it appeared that plaintiff claimed to recover a balance due on sale of lease. A note for $600 had been given for the amount by Howard, an accommodation maker, but the note had been lost.\nThe court charged in part as follows by Collier, J.:\n\u201c The first money was paid and a note was given for the balance, which has been lost. They now sue upon the original contract as if the dealings were between these parties originally, and they have a right to do that; and it is totally immaterial whether the note was protested or not, as far as the defendants, Magee & Co., are concerned. If a verdict is given against them here, there is no likelihood of their having to pay that note in the hands of an innocent party who got it before maturity. The court will protect them by compelling the plaintiff in court to file a bond of indemnity to protect the defendants.\u201d\nDefendant\u2019s points, which were refused, were as follows:\n\u201c 1. The plaintiff is not entitled to judgment under the evidence, for the reason that he has not filed a copy of the note sued on in this case with his statement of claim.\n\u201c 2. That he is not entitled to judgment, nor can he recover in this action, because he has not produced the original note nor a copy of the same on the trial of this case.\n\u201c 3. That if the jury should find for the plaintiff it can only be for the principal without interest, as there is no evidence in the case to show that a bond of indemnity was ever tendered defendant before suit was brought.\n\u201c 4. James Howard, Jr., being the maker, and E. Magee & Co. the indorsers in this lost note, there can be no recovery as against the defendants in this case.\n\u201c 5. Under the evidence in this case, the verdict should be for the defendants.\u201d\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $749.40. Defendant appealed.\nFrror assigned was that \u201c the court erred in refusing to affirm defendant\u2019s points, which were as follows,\u201d quoting points, but not answers.\nA. S. Moeser, II. F.
