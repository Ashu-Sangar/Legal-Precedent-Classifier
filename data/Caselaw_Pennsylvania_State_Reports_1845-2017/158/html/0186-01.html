The bonds referred to in the memorandum paid interest at the rate of four per cent. On the note were two receipts by the sister for interest at the rate of four per cent. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the evidence was insufficient to show ownership of the bonds in the sister or that they were held in trust; and (2) that the parties by their acts showed that the sister was to receive the same rate of interest on her note which her brother received on his investment, and that the sister’s administrator was entitled to recover only four per cent interest on the note from the brother’s estate.</p>

It was shown that for some years the testator had acted as Eliza Gilmor’s attorney in fact, and had, from time to <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>time, received into his hands a large sum of money belonging to her. On April 1, 1889, a few months before his death, he made, in her favor, a promissory note of $50,000, and below it wrote a memorandum to the effect that it was ‘ invested in government bonds at four per cent, belonging to Eliza Gilmor.’ How this can b$ construed into a declaration that all of the bonds in testator’s name belonged to Eliza Gilmor, or that he held them in trust for her, the auditor cannot see. The note was a declaration that-the testator owed Eliza $50,000 on the date thereof, and the memorandum seems to do no more than indicate where it was invested. If it had appeared that the testator had bought, with $50,000 of Eliza’s money, bonds of that par value, and had held them as hers, then her right to any increase in their value would be clear. But there was not a word of evidence to show when, with whose money or at what price the bonds had been bought. For all that the evidence shows the testator may have bought them on April 1,1889, or at any other time, using $50,000 of his sister’s money and enough of his own to make up the balance of their cost. The memorandum seems entirely consistent with such a theory, and, when taken in connection with the note, inconsistent with any other.</p>

It was rejected for much the same reason as the former claim — the auditor did not think the evidence sufficient to sustain it in any aspect in which it might be considered. As the auditor gathered from the arguments of the claimants’ counsel, there were three grounds upon which the claim might be rested : (1) That the setting aside of these securities in the wallet marked with Eliza Gilmor’s name, and containing the note and duebills above mentioned, amounted to a gift of them to her; (2) that, taken in connection with his relation to her as attorney in fact, it <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>amounted to an acknowledgment of his indebtedness to her in that amount; and (3) that it amounted to a declaration of trust on his part in her favor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[257,526,1172,1626]]]'>“ The evidence of the testator’s indebtedness to Eliza Gilmor, as shown by the report, was that she had inherited from her brothers and sisters, dying intestate, at various times from 1863 to 1879, about 133,000, and that in 1879 she had given the testator a general power of attorney for the management of her estate. Apparently it had all passed into his hands, for when she died her executor found nothing, practically, upon which to administer. This seemed sufficient to the auditor to warrant the conclusion that the testator died indebted to his sister, and the note and the duebills above referred to confirm that conclusion. But the evidence seemed by itself, without any declarations or admissions of the testator, insufficient to fix the amount of the indebtedness. These were altogether wanting, except in the notes and duebills, and in determining this question and that concerning the United States bonds, the auditor has looked upon the notes and duebills as furnishing the only safe measure of the testator’s indebtedness. It seemed incredible that the testator should have taken such pains accurately to fix and ascertain a portion of this indebtedness, and then leave the balance to be evidenced by his' sister’s name on the receptacle of certain papers. The auditor does not wish to be understood by this as admitting the testator to limit his liability by his own declaration. What he means is that without such declaration it would be impossible to fix the liability at all, and that when the placing of these securities in the marked book is contrasted with the care with which the note and duebills were prepared, it loses all force as an admission of indebtedness. If this be so, then the second ground upon which the claim is made- — -as a debt — must fail, because no indebtedness is established. The first ground also fails, for as a gift it is without consideration and void, because .unexecuted.

They are: [1) Whether the learned court below erred in refusing to award to the appellant the value of the four per cent government <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>bonds which he claimed belonged to the estate of Eliza Gilmor, deceased; (2) whether it was error to calculate interest at four per cent on the 150,000 secured by John Gilmor’s note under date of April 1, 1889; and (8) whether error was committed in the refusal to award to the appellant the amount of the mortgages and judgments found in the wallet labeled in John Gilmor’s handwriting “ Eliza Gilmor,” and designated by the learned auditor in his report as exhibit 11J.”</p>
    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.4",219,[207,784,1167,1629]],["BL_220.1",220,[277,384,1163,811]]]'>From the inventory of the personal property of John Gilmor, filed December 28, 1889, we learn that the face value of the government bonds held by him was $60,000, and that with the accrued interest and premium they were then worth $72,400. It is claimed by the appellant that although these bonds were in John Gilmor’s name, Eliza Gilmor’s money to the amount of $50,000 was used in the purchase of them, and that her estate is therefore entitled to receive from the estate of John Gilmor the sum which bonds of the face value of $50,000 were worth at the time of the inventory. It will be noticed that this claim assumes that the bonds were bought at their face value, and that there is nothing on this record which shows when they were bought or the price paid for them. In the absence of evidence on this point the fair presumption is that the amount paid was their market value at the time of the purchase. As there was no fraud or bad faith in the transaction, and it does not appear that they were bought for less than they were appraised at in December, 1889, it follows that if the claim is valid in other respects the most that can be recovered upon it is their face value, $50,000, with interest from October, 1889, and as that amount was awarded to the appellant by the learned court below, on the theory that the money invested in the bonds was a loan to John Gilmor for which he gave the note above mentioned, it seems to be unnecessary to further consider this branch of the case. But is there any merit in the claim that Eliza Gilmor was the owner of five sixths of the bonds held by her brother John ? The only evidence to support it is the memorandum made by him on his note to her for $50,000. The learned auditor, reading the memorandum in the light of the surrounding circumstances, held, with the approval of the learned court below, that it, considered in connection with the note on which it was indorsed, was not equivalent to a declaration that he bought <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>and held the bonds for her, but that it was intended simply to show how he had invested the money for which the note was given. This conclusion is consistent with the conduct of the parties, which was clearly inconsistent with the claim made by the appellant. John Gilmor paid interest on the note to Eliza Gilmor, July 1, and October 1,1889, as appears by her receipts written thereon. While they said in plain words that the money so paid and received was interest on the note, and thus recognized the <em>$50,000 </em>as a debt due from the maker to the payee, we are asked to contradict them and say that it was interest on her bonds. We cannot do this unless we regard the note with the indorsement upon it as a declaration of trust instead of an obligation for the payment of money. The memorandum is clearly insufficient to warrant an inference that John held the government bonds in trust for Eliza, or to discharge him from liability to her on the note according to its terms.</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[276,1203,1162,645]]]'>Was it error to refuse to award to the appellant interest on this note at the rate-of six per cent? The note was payable one day after its date, and the payee would, in the absence of evidence qualifying her right, be entitled to interest upon it from its maturity at the legal rate. But it is a fair implication from the receipts upon it that the parties agreed upon a rate of four per cent. It is not unnatural or unreasonable in view of their relations that the payee should be willing to accept and the maker to pay the same rate of interest that he received on his investment of the money for which he gave the note. In the adoption of this rate by the learned auditor the appellant secures the same interest he would have received if he had established his claim to the bonds.</p>
    <p id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[272,1867,1165,553]],["BL_221.1",221,[222,373,1167,606]]]'>The learned auditor was clearly right in refusing to award to the appellant the amount of the mortgages and judgments found in the wallet labeled “ Eliza Gilmor.” This wallet was in John Gilmor’s possession at the time of his death, the mortgages and judgments were in his name, and there was no evidence showing that any of Eliza’s money was invested in them. The entry upon and the entry within the wallet were relied on to support the claim that John held these securities in trust for his sister, but they furnished no adequate ground for an inference that he so held them. Aside from these entries there was nothing to suggest that she had any interest in them. The <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>theory that they belonged to her derives no support from the claim that her estate is much larger than the note and duebill. This claim is not sustained by the evidence. If it be conceded that all of Eliza’s property exclusive of her unsold interests in real estate passed into John’s hands under the power of attorney dated July 1, 1879, the appellant has no just cause to complain of the decree, because he received under it at least $25,000 more than he has shown such property was worth. The note and duebill were acknowledgments by John that he was indebted to his sister in the amounts stated in them, and we think the conclusion of the learned auditor that they furnished theyneasure of his liability was warranted by the evidence.</p>
