If a settlement or residence had been established in Plumcreek township, then the rule would have been made absolute, and the township would have been made liable. The rule, however, was discharged, and we conclude that the county failed to establish that the lunatic had had either a settlement or residence in Plumcreek township. What was this rule obtained for if it were not to fix the residence or settlement of David Hall in said township ?

Nor do we think it sufficient for the county to answer to this contention ‘ that the matter is res adjudicata,’ that the rule was discharged without prejudice, because from the very wording of the order discharging the rule, viz., ‘ without prejudice to the county as to further proceedings against the township of last settlement when ascertained,’ we would infer that the intention was to proceed against a township other than Plum-creek. Had it been the intention to still proceed against Plum-creek township and the county was not prepared to go on with the argument, the proper practice would have been to have had a continuance of the rule until some future time; and this conclusion is strengthened, we think, from the fact that over five years elapsed from the time of discharging the first rule to the granting of the one now before us.]” [1]</p>

That order was made “ without prejudice to the county as to further proceedings against the township of last settlement when ascertained.” Armed with this apparently roving commission appellant proceeded against several townships, and after failure in every instance finally made a second attack upon the appellees. In the order committing the lunatic, the court granted a rule upon the Overseers of Plumcreek Township, the appellees, to show cause why they should not pay the expenses and costs of the proceedings in lunacy. The appellees by their answer denied the liability and the settlement. The basis of <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>any liability on the part of appellees to pay the expenses and costs referred to rested upon the legal settlement or residence of the lunatic in Plumcreek township. It is manifest that in discharging the rule the court decided that the appellant had failed to establish this ground of liability, and therefore determined the questions now raised in this proceeding.

Up to the filing of the present petition, years havixxg elapsed, that determination remained unquestioned by appellant. The words “ without prejudice to the county as to further proceedings against the township of last settlement when ascertained” relate to townships other than Plumcreek. The answer in that proceeding and the discharge of the rule established this conclusion. In the answer filed by appellees in the present proceeding it is averred that the rule was dischaxged “ upoxx testimony taken and argument of said rule.” Thus it appeal’s 'after testimony taken and argument a decision upon the merits of the case was reached and the rule accordingly discharged. As to appellees, it was a final determination of the questioxx of settlement and residence, and the addition of the words ‘‘ without prejudice,” etc., did not change it.
