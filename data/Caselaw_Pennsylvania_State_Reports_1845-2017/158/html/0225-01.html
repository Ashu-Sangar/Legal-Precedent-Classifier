Subsequently, a disagreement arising between the parties, an equitable ejectment was brought by the vendor which resulted in a conditional verdict, which was to be released on payment to the vendor of a certain sum of money, he making to the vendee a good title “ agreeably to the articles of bargain and sale,” and also for twelve acres of land “ to be surveyed so as to include all the slopes, openings and sinks in the occupancy of the defendant,” and also for the undivided half of certain other twelve acres. A deed was made in accordance with the terms of the verdict, and the sum of money named in the verdict was paid into court. No mining was thereafter done or attempted on the land outside of the twenty-fou^acres until a period of thirty-seven years after the ejectment. <em>Held, </em>that the acceptance by .the parties of the verdict and deed was a final settlement between them, and that thereafter all the vendee’s rights and privileges under the agreement ceased, and he could open no mines outside of the twenty-four acres.</p>

That is an agreement by defendant to convey to said Henderson in fee simple the undivided one half part of the mineral and stone coal on the land mentioned and described in plaintiffs’ bill. And therein the defendant agreed to give to said Henderson ‘ the privilege to enter the land and open for coal at any place he may see fit at fifty dollars per acre; not to interfere with any of the buildings, spring or garden of said Cannon.’</p>

But that such is the true construction of that instrument is by no means clear. Where the article reads that Henderson was to have the right to enter the land and open for coal at any place he might see fit, did it give him a right to open at as many places as he might see fit ? [While Henderson thereby acquired an option to take as much land as he might wish for the purpose of his entry and opening, did he acquire a right to exercise that option as often as he might choose to do so?] [2] [While he doubtless had a reasonable time in which to exercise his option, could he or his assigns neglect to do so for over forty years and then exercise it?] [3] While the article of agreement gave Henderson a right to enter on said land and open for coal at fifty dollars per acre, did it give him a right to dig over the surface without paying anything ? Unless these questions can be clearly answered in favor of the plaintiffs, equity should not assume jurisdiction of this case so far as it rests on the instrument marked ‘ Exhibit B.’ In our opinion that would be a very doubtful construction of those articles of agreement.</p>

A forcible answer to this proposition is that the parties to the instruments under which plaintiffs claim (Exhibits A and B in the bill) did not leave that matter to rest upon a legal presumption, but in each instrument the rights of the parties in that respect were defined.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[216,1149,1168,1319]]]'>“ It is argued that the proposition contended for is sustained by the principle which gives a right of way of necessity to the grantee of a piece of land surrounded by other lands of the grantor. The cases are materially different in at least two particulars : (1) The proposition contended for includes a right to drill through and dig over the surface of the land in order to ascertain whether there is an3&gt;- merchantable coal under it; and (2) because it is not obviously necessary to the mining of a vein of coal, that it must be reached by an opening made on the land under which it lies. When it is borne in mind that the owner of the coal must so mine it as to do no injury to the surface beyond the privileges granted (Carlin &amp; Co. v. Chappel, <a href="/pa/101/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="101 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="500877" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0348-01">101 Pa. 348</a>), it is most improbable that the law would append to a grant of the underlying coal a right to dig over and in part to destroy the surface, in order to ascertain whether there be any coal under it. In Harris v. Ryding, 5 M. &amp; W. 60, Lord Abinger, C. B., says, that, if the owner had granted the surface, reserving the mines merely, he would have had no access through the surface, but must have reached them through other adits. And when he reserved the right of access, he did not thereby reserve the right to dig, so as to destroy the surface, or to do anything in a manner unusual or improper, so as to prejudice the surface of the land: Washburn’s Easements &amp;Serv. *476. It thus appears that the right on which plaintiffs’ prayer for relief rests is not clear, but, on the contrary, is clouded with grave doubts.</p>

The case relied on by the learned counsel for plaintiffs to show thar equity has jurisdiction in this case (Westmoreland N. Gas Co. v.

    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[230,638,1164,812]]]'>The only real question in the case arises from the clause in the agreement between Cannon and Henderson in 1844 giving the latter “ the privilege to enter the land and open for coal at any place he may see fit, at fifty dollars per acre.” Subject to the restriction expressed, that it was “ not to interfere with any of the buildings, spring or garden of the said Cannon,” it is fairly arguable that this was an unlimited and continuing right of entry and search until the coal, the subject of the grant, should be exhausted. It is however also susceptible, as the learned master indicates, of the construction that it was only a single option, and that “ Henderson having once selected the ground for his operations could not thereafter go on to other lands of Cannon and continuously and repeatedly exercise this privilege.” It is unnecessary for us to decide between these views, for the action of the parties themselves has settled the meaning beyond further dispute.</p>

The defendants paid into court the sum named in the verdict, and on September 20, 1850, Cannon filed in court a deed for the undivided half of the coal under the whole tract, and for the twelve acres including the slopes and openings, and also for the undivided half of the other twelve acres. Neither verdict nor deed, it is to be observed, followed strictly the agree<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>ment of 1844. The verdict included twelve acres in severalty, surveyed so as to cover the slopes and openings already made by the defendants, and the undivided half of twelve more, not called for in the agreement, and the deed entirely omitted the clause giving Henderson the privilege of entry and search. This result of an equitable ejectment, reached six years after the original agreement, and in view of the acts and operations of the parties in the meantime, raises a strong inference that it was meant for a compromise, adjustment, and settlement of all questions of rights between the parties. And when we add the facts found by the master, that “ since shortly after the date of the said verdict, the said Henderson and those under him have mined and removed a considerable quantity of coal, but as to the surface have confined themselves in making drifts, sinks, slopes and openings to the twenty-four acres ” and that “ no digging, mining or removing of coal was ever thereafter done or attempted on said land outside of the twenty-four acres,” until 1887, a period of thirty-seven years, the conclusion becomes irresistible that the parties accepted the verdict and the deed as a final settlement, and that thereafter all the plaintiffs’ rights and privileges under the agreement ceased.</p>

The parties having considered and agreed upon the mode of access to the coal conveyed, no implication can be allowed of any other way however convenient. Further, the right claimed is not of access to coal known to be there, but a preliminary right which can only arise by express agreement, to search and ascertain if there is coal there at all. And lastly, even if the claim were of access to the coal conveyed, the master finds that the existence of any body of mineable merchantable coal underlying the Cannon land outside the twenty-four acres, is, owing to the peculiar character of the coal and the way it lies in pots or basins, “ no more than mere conjecture.”</p>
