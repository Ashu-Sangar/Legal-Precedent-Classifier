The regular ferryman, Arlington Fields, was not on the boat at the time, and a boy was ferrying in his place. After the boat had started the boy was not able to manage it, and deceased and another passenger took the oars. When the boat was half way across the river it had drifted down the stream out of its course. Fields then put out to it in a small skiff. He took the oars, and soon afterwards an altercation took place between him and Scanlon; the men grappled and both fell out of the boat into the water; Scanlon was drowned and Fields swam to the shore.</p>

There is no provision for removal of the record into this court for revision, except in cases where a nonsuit has been entered and the motion to set aside the judgment has been denied, and exception has been taken thereto. Such refusal to set aside a judgment of nonsuit is in the nature of a demurrer to evidence, and hence it is necessary to bring the testimony on the record by a bill of exceptions.</p>

But, if the testimony were here on exception to the refusal of the court to set aside the judgment of nonsuit, and error assigned thereto, there is nothing in it that would justify a reversal of the judgment. So far as it tends to prove anything, the testimony shows that deceased came to his death as the result of a quarrel with Arlington Fields, the ferryman, and it was either an accident or the result of unlawful violence on the part of Fields, outside of the line of his duty, committed without the authority or consent of either of the appellants, and for which they are not responsible.</p>
