The obligor’s mother joined in the bond at the same time, and some months afterwards gave a written recognition of her liability on the bond. In a suit upon the bond, defendants filed an affidavit of defence in which they averred that they were induced to sign the bond by the threat of the arrest of the husband for adultery, and that the mother had signed the ratification of the bond by reason of similar threats. There was no averment that there was an agreement or promise by the obligee not to prosecute her husband, nor was there any averment that the obligors would not have signed the bond without such promise. * The affidavit did not deny that the wife was entitled to a separation, or that her husband was bound to provide for her maintenance, or that the sum named in the bond was excessive. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit of defence was insufficient to prevent judgment.</p>

Lockhart with infidelity, and with having committed adultery with parties to the plaintiff unknown, and that, pursuant to such charge, had employed detectives to follow and spy upon the said Challes P. Lockhart; that said detectives had procured from certain persons letters alleged to have been written by said Charles P. Lockhart to other females; that they had, as they alleged, procured evidence sufficient to arrest and convict him of adultery. That, having thus prepared these charges, they fixed a time and place for meeting, confronted him with the charges, and told him that they had the evidence to convict him of the charge of adultery, and demanded from him the execution of written articles of separation between him and his wife, and the execution, also, of a bond in the sum of ten thousand dollars, conditioned for the payment of one hundred dollars per month to his said wife, as the condition of his immunity from arrest and conviction on the said charge. That he, with his attorney, O. D. Thompson, listened to these charges and refused to accede to the demands, and to sign either the article of separation or the bond. That to impress him with the necessity of immediately executing the said papers, the said plaintiffs told the said Charles P. Lockhart that they had an officer in waiting in an adjoining room, which officer was pointed out and was present for the purpose indicated, to wit, to arrest the said Charles P. Lockhart in default of his execution of the said papers. That the said Charles P. Lockhart, being under duress, threatened with arrest and conviction, yet, under the advice of his counsel, refused to sign either of said papers, but re<a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>quested an adjournment of the meeting to another day. That they met again, when the same charges were repeated, the same threats made with more vindictiveness than before ; that to escape arrest and to evade a prosecution, to settle and compound the charges, and to escape conviction for the crime charged, to wit, adultery, and to settle, compound, and be freed forever from the said charge, notwithstanding the advice of his counsel, the said Charles P. Lockhart, under these circumstances, intimidated in this manner, and for the purpose of escaping the punishment as stated, signed his name to the said bond.</p>

D. Thompson, in which letter the threats already made as to the arrest and conviction of the affiant, Charles P. Lockhart, were repeated, and Charles P. Lockhart was again threatened unless the said Mary Gf. Lockhart would attach her name to or recognize and affirm the said ten thousand dollar bond. That this letter was presented to the said Mary G.

Lockhart, repeated in substance orally what he had written in the said letter; that the said Mary refused to either re-sign, acknowledge or affirm in any manner the said bond; that on the reading and explaining the letter to her by the attorney, O.
