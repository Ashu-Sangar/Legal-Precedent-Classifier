A second well was to be completed within two years, and in case of failure to complete the well within two years, the lessee was to pay a certain sum or forfeit the lease. In an action to recover the penalties for not completing either of the wells provided for in the lease, defendant filed an affidavit <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>of defence, in which he averred that from drilling wells in the vicinity it was found that there was no oil or gas in plaintiff’s farm, and that therefore no wells had been put down, and that the lease became void and of no effect. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit was insufficient to prevent judgment.
