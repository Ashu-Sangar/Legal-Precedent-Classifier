The wagon belonged to B. S. Winner, the horses to the son-in-law, W. W. Mechling; they were driven by Herbert Winner. Before leaving the house where they had been visiting they were told that it was a bad road, but that it was traveled. Notwithstanding, they determined to take this road. The road, at the point where the accident happened, and continuing on across the defective place, was only about twelve feet wide, and in consequence too narrow to allow the wagon to be turned back. On either side there was a steep bank, that on the right hand sloping upward and the one on the left sloping abruptly downward. The road itself was at this point quite steep, and the wagon was stopped near the beginning of the descent. On examination, Herbert Winner discovered that the roadbed in front had been corduroyed for a short distance with pieces of timber or “ stave bolts.” This corduroy extended from the bank on the right, a distance of four or five feet, across the roadbed. On the extreme left was a narrow pathway, somewhat higher than the level of the corduroy, and about fourteen or eighteen inches wide, serving as a sort of barrier between the traveled track of the road and the steep embankment to the left. Between the corduroy and this narrow embankment the water had washed out a ditch about fourteen inches deep, or more, on the left side of the traveled track. After examination of this part of the road Herbert Winner went back and reported <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>to those in the wagon that he thought by careful driving they could get through all right. He thought to avoid the ditch on the left by keeping the right hand wheels somewhat up the bank on the right, but in his efforts to do this the wagon slid downward, and the left front wheel coming with a sudden lurch into this ditch caused the tongue to break. This, in turn, frightened the horses causing them to run away, overturning the wagon, breaking the harness and injuring the occupants. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit and subsequently refused to take it off.</p>

The learned trial judge entered a compulsory nonsuit and this is assigned for error. The appellant, Mrs. Winner, with her son and his wife and their child, and a daughter, having been on a visit in that township, started to return to their homes in a spring wagon, to which was attached a team driven by her son. For the purpose of reaching their destination they took the road upon which the accident occurred. This road had been laid out and opened for the public at a very early day, but, having received little or no attention, was in a bad condition. Before taking it, the appellant and her associates were informed that such was its condition, although traveled to some extent. Notwithstanding, they concluded to take it. Having traveled the road for a short distance they discovered an obstruction consequent upon a corduroy construction and a ditch washed out between it and the embankment on the left. The son got out of the wagon to make an examination. After a few minutes he returned and reported to those who were in it that the place was pretty bad but that he thought he could get over it by careful driving. Mrs. Mary Mechling testified: “We came on to this place and he got out and looked at it and seen it was pretty bad, but he said he thought he could get over it by careful driving.” And on cross-examination, in response to the question, “ When your brother came back, after looking at that dangerous road, what did he say ? ” she replied, “ He said he thought he could get over by careful driving.” And again, in response to the question, “ You knew it was dangerous, everybody could see it,” she said, “ He thought he could escape it by careful driving, and he did try it carefully.” And Mr. Herbert Winner testifies : “ And we came there and I happened to look ahead and I seen it was washed very badly, and some corduroy put in there that had been in some time ; and I stopped and examined it. I came back and I says, ‘ I think by careful work we can get through this all right,’ but the bank was so steep it throwed us into the rut.” And on cross-examination he said: “ I was certain I could get through with careful driving, but still it <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>was so steep it wouldn’t let me. I expected by careful driving to keep up high enough on this bank.”</p>
    <p id="b434-4" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[267,476,1165,496]]]'>Thus with full knowledge of the danger of upsetting, and the possibility of injury resulting from it, appellant and ber associates took the risk in the hope of escaping accident by careful driving. Therefore, as she knew the condition of the road and the danger or risk which she chose to take, and as she suffered an injury while taking it, she was guilty of contributory negligence which precludes a recovery for it. This conclusion is sustained by Pittsburgh Southern Railroad Co. v. Taylor, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20Pa.%20311" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="104 Pa. 311">104 Pa. 311</a>, where the principle is fully discussed and the cases considered.</p>
