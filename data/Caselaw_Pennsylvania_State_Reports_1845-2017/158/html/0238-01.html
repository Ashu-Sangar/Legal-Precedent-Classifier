They were to be built on a brick foundation and in such manner as to withstand a steam pressure of twenty pounds to the square inch; were to be put on brick pillars, one over the other, to the number of five, at a point designated by the company apart from the other buildings. The first pan was to be completed within forty days from the date of the contract. Meehan completed the first pan and had all the material on the ground for the others within the forty days. The $1,000 was then paid him. He then proceeded with and had about completed the others.

On the 10th of December, 1892, after the pans and pan house had been demolished by the explosion, the plaintiff, the Linden Steel Company, not having been paid by Meehan, filed a lien for the value of the steel plates against the buildings and ground appurtenant thereto, of the Salt Manufacturing Company as owner, and Meehan as contractor.

The court in<a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>structed the jury, that if the plates were not furnished upon the credit of the salt company’s plant, and were not of the kind of steel provided for in Meehan’s contract with the salt company, there could be no recovery by plaintiff; but if furnished on the credit of the works, and if of the kind contracted to be furnished by Meehan, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict.

Miller, <a href="/pa/18/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="18 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="969088" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0052-01">18 Pa. 52</a>. In Linden Steel Co. v. Imperial Refining Co., <a href="/pa/146/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="146 Pa. 4" data-case-ids="827920" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0004-01">146 Pa. 4</a>, the material delivered upon the premises was sold at'sheriff’s sale on an execution against the contractor, who never completed his con tract; The lien was sustained. Although there was proof • of <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>notice to the owner by the material-man that a lien would be filed, the case did not turn on that fact. This court, in affirming the judgment,«said, “ The question was fairly left to the jury whether the plaintiff sold the steel in question to the Titusville Iron Works (the contractor) upon the faith of the building, and the verdict of the jury settles this question of fact.” In the case before us, under the instructions of the court, the jury by their verdict have found, as a fact, that the plates were of the kind specified in Meehan’s contract with the owner, and were delivered upon the credit of the building. The contract stipulated that Meehan was only to be paid the first $1,000 when the first pan was erected, and all the material for the others was delivered on the premises; having complied with this stipulation, the defendant paid him $1,000, the first installment of the price ; the plaintiffs were not bound to follow up the delivery by a supervision of the contractor, and see that he performed his contract with the owner. That was the business of the- owner, who had armed him with the contract on the credit of which he purchased the material.</p>
    <p id="b269-3" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[220,1325,1160,858]]]'>As to the second assignment, the lien is filed against the “Rough Run Manufacturing Company, known as the Rough Run Salt Works, and against the buildings and ground covered thereby, and so much other ground immediately adjacent thereto and belonging to said Rough Run Manufacturing Company as may be necessary for the ordinary and useful purposes of the same.” This is, in effect, an averment that the whole of the buildings and machinery, including the pan house, constituted one plant, the works of the Salt Manufacturing Company. The evidence indisputably established this. Then in the third specification of the lien, the land is described and each building is named, as well as the different kinds of machinery. To this is appended an accurate map of the premises, which is referred to and made part of the lien. We have decided in many cases that this is a good lien: Short v. Miller, <a href="/pa/120/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="120 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="559837" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0470-01">120 Pa. 470</a>; Short v.

But it was against <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>the works of which the pan house formed a part, and that only a small fraction of the whole subject of the lien.

These cases hold, that the lien attaches to the buildings primarily and the land only incidentally, because necessary to the enjoyment of the buildings. Therefore, when the buildings are destroyed, the subject of the lien is gone. But the subject of this lien, as we have already noticed, was the salt works; they are there yet, with the exception of the pan house, and the lien is unaffected by its destruction.</p>

There is nothing in the other assignments which calls for notice, and they have not been pressed. The judgment is affirmed, and appeal dismissed at costs of appellant.</p>
