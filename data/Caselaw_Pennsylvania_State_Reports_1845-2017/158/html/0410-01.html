Defendant pleaded surprise, and asked for a continuance. The court refused the request, saying in presence of the jury, “ Under the circumstances, this case already having been manipulated upon the list for the convenience of counsel, it is impossible to grant any further favors, and the only choice is between a general continuance and trying the case now.” <em>Held, </em>not sufficient ground for reversing a judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>
