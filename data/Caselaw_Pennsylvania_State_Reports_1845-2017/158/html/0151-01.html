There is not the slightest intimation of collusion between the accountant and the coal company, and the auditor is irresistibly led to the conclusion that, if a mistake has been made by the accountant in the amount of royalties collected by him, such mistake was mere error of judgment, free from' any taint of bad faith, not attributable to gross negligence, and is such an error as the accountant cannot be held liable for.</p>

We are satisfied with the auditor’s disposition of that part of the except-ant’s claim which seeks to charge the accountant with the rental price of the coal that was not mined. The lease required that a certain amount of coal be mined and paid for each year, but it did not provide that so much coal should be paid for whether mined or not. If the amount specified was not mined, the remedy was a suit for damages in an action of covenant. And before any unreasonable delay in bringing such a suit had transpired — if indeed, it could have been brought before Sept. 1, 1887, — this court granted an order to the administrator to sell this- coal tract, with all the rights of the Hodgson estate under the lease, including the coal in place which had not been mined, but which ought to have been mined under the terms of the contract, and a sale was so made, <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>and confirmed on the 23d day of August, 1887. We are also satisfied that the accountant ought not to be charged with interest, which the exceptants claim was due and owing from the Hilldale Coal Company on account of their delay in paying the rent or royalties that were paid. The auditor finds that this delay was, at least in part, caused by the action of the representative of one of the heirs, in notifying the company not to pay the administrator, and as the accountant never received the money, it would be inequitable to hold him liable when the loss of the use of this rent is, in some measure, attributable to the exceptants themselves.”</p>

The lessee was not absolutely bound to take out one million tons in each year, but could make up a deficiency in any one year during the following year, and if, at the end of ten years there was a deficiency, the coal not mined was forfeited to the owners of the fee. In 1887 the land was sold by order of the orphans’ court, with all the unmined coal upon it, and the proceeds were duly distributed to the parties entitled to them, including these appellants. Of course the sale must be assumed to include the coal not mined under the lease for which the present attempt to surcharge the accountant is made.
