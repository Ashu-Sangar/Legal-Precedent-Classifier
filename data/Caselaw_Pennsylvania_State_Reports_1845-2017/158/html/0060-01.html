J., of the 40th judicial district, specially presiding, it appeared that James R.

Tarr and Rose Husband and to the same ones.” Testator by previous clauses in his will had made similar devises to James R. Tarr and Rose Husband. The executors appointed by the will renounced, and letters of administration with the will annexed were issued to William G. Husband, testator’s son-in-law, and James R. Tarr, one of his sons. The administrators went into possession of the real estate, in compliance with a direction in the will requiring the executors to rent the real estate until all of testator’s debts were paid. Plaintiffs gave evidence tending to show that Melker Tarr refused to accept the devise made to him. In 1870, while the administrators were still in possession of the land, the thirty acres devised to Melker Tarr were sold by the sheriff on a judgment against him, and bought by E. J. Keenan for five dollars, under whom defendants claimed. At the time of the trial Keenan was dead, and certain of the residuary devisees of the testator were also dead.

As between Melker Tarr, the devisee in this case, and the residuary devisees, this burden would have been sustained by a simple verbal disclaimer, consistent of course with his other conduct, made to the administrators with the will annexed, who had possession and who represented all parties beneficially interested; and as there is no middle ground between acceptance and refusal, such disclaimer must have been final not only as between these parties but as to all those who claimed under them with notice. But assuming such disclaimer to have been made, were the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale and those who claimed under him concluded by it? “ The rule of caveat emptor applies to a purchaser at a judicial sale; but he is not bound to see what is not to be seen.

The devise to him is absolute on its face. There is no condition nor alternative attached to indicate an intention on the part of the testator to put him to an election. Like innumerable other wills of record, this would naturally give rise to a presumption of acceptance, because apparently beneficial to the devisee, so strong that no one would think of further inquiry.

But it was the part of common prudence, and therefore the duty (Walsh v. Stille, 2 Parsons, 17) of intending purchasers to inquire of the administrators, who were trustees in custody of the land representing all parties interested, the probable duration of their possession; and that <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>inquiry must necessarily lead to knowledge of the real status of the title; for the administrators would have been in good faith bound to furnish as full information to those who dealt with their cestuis que trust as to the cestuis que trust themselves. Even as between strangers, there is no principle better settled than that “if one suffers another to purchase and expend money on a tract of land, and knows that that other has a mistaken opinion respecting the title to it, and does not make known his claim, he shall not afterwards be permitted to set up a claim to that land against the purchaser.” Silence is a fraud when it is a duty to speak. Trustees cannot keep silence when the preservation of trust rights is involved; and it must be assumed that these trustees would have spoken. It having been then the duty of these defendants before purchasing to make inquiry of the administrators, they would have been affected with notice of the result of such inquiry so far as title was involved, whether within their original purpose or not: McKee v.
