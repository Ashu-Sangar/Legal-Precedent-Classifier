And the money I have in my name in the Real Estate Savings Bank is’all his; he always gave me the money and I saved it for him and it is all his hard earnings; also the mortgage which I hold in my name against George Bauman, also is the money which my beloved husband worked hard for and gave it to me to buy the mortgage and let me have it in my name and I wish him to have it all.’ This paper was signed by the decedent and witnessed by a domestic living with her at the time; but when it was found after her death her signature was torn off; for this reason it was objected to as incompetent evidence. Whilst it could not take effect as a will, there is no apparent reason, it being in the handwriting of the decedent, why it is not competent proof of her declaration. It is conceded that oral proof can be made of them and we have much better proof, to wit, written evidence. This paper, in connection with the other evidence in the case, shows very sat<a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>isfactorily that all the moneys deposited in the Dollar and Real Estate Savings Banks, prior to February 11, 1875, belonged to the claimant. The only deposit made after that date in either was one of $1,267, on September 18, 1879, in the Dollar Savings Bank. The evidence, however, shows that this was a transfer from the account of George Gracie, son of the claimant, of moneys which he had deposited for his father.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b547-4" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[226,725,1167,909]]]'>“ It is clear therefore that the money here for distribution arising from the deposits in these banks belonged to the claimant. If then he did not intend to make a gift of it to his wife, his claim as to these deposits must be sustained. He was for a number of years steadily employed as manager of oil refineries in the suburbs of the city, where he resided, and it was inconvenient for him to visit the banks. He gave his wages to his wife, who deposited them, and seems to have attended to all outside business for him. She gave as reasons for depositing it in her name to one witness, ‘ Because Mr. Gracie was not much of a business man; ’ ‘ that he never had time to go with it.’ To another, ‘ that Mr. Gracie had no business qualities, and she had to attend to this money and look after it, and if she didn’t attend to this business that they would have nothing in no time.’ There is no evidence that she ever claimed these deposits as her own, but both in her oral and written declarations she acknowledged it was his money, and in her writing expressly states that she saved it for him.</p>

The net rental of this property was probably four hundred dollars per jmar. The claimant was not employed for some years prior to his wife’s death, and no doubt a portion of the rents were applied to the support of the family. The deposits in the bank of Pittsburgh were all made subsequently to 1875, and probably some of the rents were included in them. The balance in this bank, however, was only $349, not sufficient to pay the expenses charged in the account for the administration of her estate. And as the fund for distribution is not sufficient to pay the amount found to be due the claimant, irrespective of his claims, for these deposits, it is not necessary to pass upon the questions raised as to them.”</p>
