For that reason alone plaintiff would be entitled to an affirmance of the judgment. But waiving that, there appears to be nothing in either of the specifications of error that would warrant a reversal. From the statement of claim, — supplied by the appellee, — and the charge of the learned trial judge, it appears that the suit is for balance purchase money due on sale of the coal yard lease referred to in the testimony. It also appears that said balance is represented by the note alleged to have been lost; but the court can so control the execution as to amply protect the defendants against the collection of said note by innocent holders for value. This may be done by restraining the execution until they are sufficiently indemnified by plaintiff, or until they are fully protected by the bar of the statute. According to the evidence, the note was at six months from June 3, 1887, and will therefore be barred by the statute of limitations in a few weeks.</p>
