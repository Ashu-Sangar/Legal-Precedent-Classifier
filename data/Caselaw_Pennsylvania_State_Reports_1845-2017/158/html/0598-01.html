After the money was paid to him he recovered and collected a judgment from the railroad company for a large amount for the damage caused by the fire. Plaintiff then brought suit to recover the money paid on the policy. Defendant filed an affidavit of defence, in which he averred that he had requested plaintiff to join in the litigation against the railroad, but that plaintiffhad refused to have anything to do with the matter, and had assured defendant that he was welcome to all he could collect from the railroad company; and that his loss was greater than the sum of the amounts paid by the insurance companies and the railroad company after deducting expenses for collection. <em>Held </em>that the affidavit was sufficient to prevent judgment.</p>

As nothing to the contrary has been intimated by the court below, that question being in no way involved in the decree discharging the rule, we are somewhat at a loss to understand why the point is so earnestly urged here. The jurisdiction of this court is appellate, not original, in actions at law; it is our duty to review judgments of the common pleas, not to make suggestions preliminary éo a hearing, as to what decrees shall there be made. We presume the learned judge of the court below, if the question be raiséd before him, will rightly decide it. Certainly we cannot pass upon it before hearing or decision by him. The only question properly before us is, does the affidavit set out sufficient to send the case to a jury? We do not think it advisable at this stage of the proceedings to inquire whether the agreement to relinquish or waive any claim by the insurance company, as averred by defendant, would constitute an estoppel. As the ease must go to trial on other disputed facts, the sufficiency of this part of the defence can be better determined when the evidence is heard. We have no doubt plaintiff could, by parol, through an authorized representative, before suit was brought against the railroad company, have waived all claim on money contingent on a successful prosecution of a suit in which it declined <em>to </em>take any risk or part. Whether there was such a waiver by one authorized to make it, and whether the defendant, in view of it, took upon himself all the labor, expense and risk of problematical litigation, which otherwise he would not have done, are questions 'on which we now, for obvious reasons, intimate no opinion.</p>
    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[285,2310,1161,93]],["BL_629.1",629,[179,384,1164,1320]]]'>But the defendant further avers that he expended a large sum of money in and about the prosecution of the suit, such as <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>counsel fees, costs, and expenses of hunting up witnesses. The plaintiff undertakes to make a deduction from its claim for its share of this expense ; defendant alleges that the deduction is not sufficient. This disptite can only be determined after hearing the evidence bearing on it. Then defendant further avers that bis actual loss was greater than the aggregate amount received by him from both the insurance companies and the railroad company; the plaintiff replies that his claim against the railroad company was for his entire loss, and the judgment in that case is conclusive as to the amount. Undoubtedly, as between him and the'railroad company, the judgment is conclusive ; but the plaintiff was no party to that suit; however significant the judgment may be as evidence in this issue, it does not necessarily follow, as between these parties, that that judgment determines the whole amount of plaintiff’s loss by the fire. His proven loss to the insurance companies, at time of payment by them, was §27,565.42; the verdict of the jury, nearly sixteen months after the fire, was only §25,081.36; deducting his alleged expenses from this amount, and adding the remainder to the amount received for insurance, makes a net sum, less than the aggregate of his alleged loss, as.first proven to the insurance companies. The defendant, on trial of this issue, may adduce fuller and more specific proof of loss than on the former trial; may offer evidence which will satisfy the jury, as it satisfied the insurance companies when they paid him, that his actual loss was §27,565.42.</p>
    <p id="b629-3" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[179,1716,1161,196]]]'>It is clear to our minds that the disputed facts mentioned can only be determined by a jury trial, therefore the decree of the court below is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed at costs of appellant.</p>
