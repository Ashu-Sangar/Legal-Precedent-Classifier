The next question which presents itself is whethei or not the Wright well was a test of the Lytle farm. This in quiry may become important upon a consideration of the lan guage of the lease itself. The Wright well was between the Lytle farm and the Elizabeth field, and distant perhaps half a mile from the former. The evidence of the experts who testified can help us but little. It is doubtless true, as some of them said, that a producing gas well is not a certain test of anything except that gas has been found at that particular spot, aside from the question of construction as to what sort of a test was meant by the terms of the lease; [it would seem clear that in a commercial sense the Wright well was a test of the Lytle farm. It gave to that farm a market value which it did not have before.] [1] Prior to that time, according to all the evidence, this farm, as well as the neighboring ones, had but little value as gas or oil territory. There was a possibility that oil or gas might be found there, and the parties developing a neighboring field were willing to make the test. It had, however, no peculiar value as gas or oil territory. The Wright well changed the situation instantly. The Lytle lease, which had been hanging in abeyance for a few days, was at once closed <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>and a bonus of one thousand dollars paid for the new lease, the terms of which were stricter and the territory less by five acres than the former one.

The substance of this testimony is that about the time the Carnegie Natural Gas Company commenced to drill on his place, that is about August 11, 1892, Lytle heard a report that this company had purchased the lease from Snee. This was a rumor in the neighborhood. So far as he can fix the date, Mr. Lytle says, ‘ I think it was after they commenced to drill there.’ That his first actual knowledge that the Carnegie Natural Gas Company had taken an assignment of the lease was on October 14, 1892, when Mr. Clemson, an officer of the company, came there to locate a second well. Down until the meeting with Mr. Clemson Mr. Snee had charge of the work, and Mr. Lytle, except for the rumor in the neighborhood, did not know any one else as connected with or undertaking the work of development. There seems no reason to doubt Mr. Lytle’s testimony in this respect. Mr. Packer called his attention to his deposition made at the time of the motion for the preliminary injunction, where, in answer to a question of Mr. Scott, as follows: ‘ Have you any knowledge or information when, if at all, any rights of the Carnegie Natural Gas Company were acquired in your land?’ to which Lytle answered: ‘ I heard when,they got the lease.’ This question and answer are somewhat obscure. They would seem to mean that Lytle was informed at some time as to what was the date of the assignment to the plaintiff company. Mr. Packer, after reading the above question and answer, asks: ‘ Q. That is when you heard of the claim of the Carnegie Natural Gas Company? A. I heard it, yes, afterwards. I did not know it to <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>be the case to any certainty.

The question most strongly urged by the counsel for plaintiff, and apparently the real question in the case, is the effect of this rescission or forfeiture, whichever it may be called, of the first lease, and the taking of the new one. It would hardly seem to admit of argument that as to John A. Snee, when he acquiesced in Lytle’s declaration that the lease of December 18th was at an end, whether Lytle was right or wrong as to the alleged ground of forfeiture, his rights under the old lease were at an end. The time for him to have asserted his rights was when Lytle confronted him with the declaration that he had not given him his test well, and that his lease was dead. When he entered into a discussion of new terms and conditions, and ended by taking a new agreement and paying an additional bonus, his actions forever closed his mouth from asserting any vigor or life in the former lease. But what effect did all this have upon his assignee, the Carnegie Natural Gas Company, who, in ignorance of what Snee was doing, were preparing to take possession, under the lease of December 18, 1891 ?

The leases assigned as a part of the same transaction showed that Snee had leased a large amount of land in the district, which they knew was undeveloped and untested for oil or gas until the Wright well was completed, August 2,1892. Neither Snee nor any one under him ever entered into possession under the lease of December 18, 1891. Snee, on the 8th of August, 1892, in accordance with a previous arrangement, and by Owings, his agent, came to the farm and made a new lease with Lytle, excluding therefrom the five acres sold to Wall.</p>

No notice was given to Lytle then, nor for a longtime thereafter, of any claim of ownership; the lease and assignment were not on record. As an act on part of Lytle made to the lessee and ostensible owner of the old lease, the new lease was an emphatic declaration of forfeiture of the old lease. Snee made this new lease on favorable terms, and then as agent or employee of the Carnegie company, without notice from any one of the assignment to the plaintiff, entered on the land for the first time and began to bore for gas.</p>
