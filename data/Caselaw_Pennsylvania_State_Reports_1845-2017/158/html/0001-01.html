It is urged by the counsel for Mrs. Gilmore’s executors, however, that Judge Watts voluntarily became a party to the proceedings and so is bound by the <em>decree; he </em>having appeared before the auditor personally and by counsel, and having excepted to the finding of the auditor. The evidence of Judge Watts’s intention in this regard seems to your auditor very unsatisfactory. Mr. Sharpe in his report nowhere speaks of Judge Watts as a party to the proceedings. He is mentioned merely as a witness called on behalf of the respondent (John C. Gilmore). * There is nothing to show that Judge Watts was ever personally present at any of the hearings before the auditor. His evidence is in the form of a deposition apparently signed Aug. 12, 1878, and sworn to before Mr. Sharpe, Oct. 14, 1873. As to his representation by counsel, the auditor states that notice of the time and place of the first meeting was given to <em>‘ </em>R. M. Henderson, the counsel for Hon. F. Watts; ’ but it does not appear that Mr. Henderson attended that or any subsequent meeting. An exception to the auditor’s report was presented by John Hays, Esq., ‘ attorney for exceptant,’ and W. J.

The right involves also the right to adduce testimony, and to cross-examine the witnesses adduced on the other side. Persons not having these rights are regarded as strangers to the cause.’ Under this definition the position of Judge Watts seems to your auditor that of one who considered himself a stranger rather than a party to the proceedings before Mr. Sharpe.</p>

Gilmore to compel him to settle accounts in the three estates in which he was administrator, and in that Judge Watts had no direct interest whatever. The finding of the auditor that Judge Watts had received from Mrs. Gilmore a sum in excess of the purchase money of the house she bought in 1848 was, if correct, a decision on a point foreign to the question at issue, and one over which he had no jurisdiction. His report shows that the sum found in Judge Watts's hands is made up, not of the money received from the estates of Ellen Shea et al., in 1859; but of a credit of $113 in 1852 which Judge Watts had not allowed, and of $300 which Mrs. Gilmore paid to him in September, 1863.

Watts had not been made party to the proceedings before the orphans’ court, nor had he, in fact, become a party. It is true that the citation was not directed to him. But did he not become a party ? It was not pretended before the auditor that Gilmore had received any portion of the estates into his hands. The whole question was, how much had been received by Mr. Watts, and how much was he entitled to apply to payment of the purchase money owing to him for the house bought in 1848. The auditor states that notice was given to B. M. Henderson, as counsel for him. Judge Watts made a deposition before the auditor setting forth that the money had been received by him and accounting for the disposition of it. A statement of his account with Mrs. Gilmore was submitted to the auditor. Surely he was cognizant of the fact that the ques<a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>tion before the auditor was, how much, if any, of the trust funds were in his hands. There is nothing to indicate that he appeared merely as a witness for Gilmore. Nothing in the proceedings before the auditor to indicate that his right to inquire into the manner in which Judge Watts had disposed of the trust fund was objected to or even questioned. Exceptions were filed by Mr. Hays, signing thereto the firm name of Henderson &amp; Hays, of which he was a member. It appears that during the period that the matter was pending before the auditor this firm was composed of E.. M. Henderson and himself, Mr. Hays. While Mr. Hays has no recollection of having been before the auditor, nor as to the person for whom the exception was filed except what appears from the paper, he is sure that he ‘ was not employed for Mr. Gilmore and could not have been employed against Judge Watts.’ The exception complains of the finding against Hon. F. Watts, and no one would have been interested in filing the same except Mr. Watts and Mr. Gilmore, the administrator. The latter would hardly complain of a finding that supported the averments in his answer. Besides, Mr. Shearer, who was attorney for Mrs. Gilmore after Mr. Penrose had ceased to act for her, is certain that Mr. Hays was concerned for Judge Watts.</p>

It is extremely improbable that he would have permitted this decree to remain unquestioned if he himself had not acquiesced in it, and this is especially so when it is remembered that he was a lawyer of exceptional ability and quick to realize the peril he would be put in unless he, in some manner, manifested his dissatisfaction with the action of the orphans’ court.</p>

This view is not supported by the facts as they appear from the proceedings before the auditor. J. C. Gilmore became indebted in judgments by reason of the purchase of a house and lot in 1848. On May 2d of that year he assigned the interest of himself and wife in the estate of Henry Woods. <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>As a matter of course this assignment did not bind Mrs. Gilmore, as the act of April 11,1848,.had already been approved, nor did it purport to be of her interests in the estates of Mary Cronon, Ellen Shea and Margaret Woods, over which the subsequent contention arose. But, conceding that the assignment was held with her assent, it was only as collateral for the payment of the bonds. If paid in full the right of Judge Watts to any portion of the estate of Henry Woods ceased. If paid in part he could, in no event, apply more of the trust estate which came into his hands than would be sufficient to pay the balance due him on the purchase money. Now, the orphans' court has jurisdiction over trust funds, and it has determined, and the decree has not been appealed from, that of these trust funds belonging to the estates of the three above named decedents, the sum of $830.10 was remaining in the hands of Judge Watts, which, with interest to March 5, 1874, amounted to $538.</p>

This is not an action on the bond given by the administrator to enforce payment by the surety, so that it is not necessary to determine what, under the circumstances of this case, the liability of Judge Watts would have been had a proceeding been instituted to recover upon it, the said bond.”</p>

It was clearly shown that this balance of the fund was in Judge Watts’s hands; that while' Gilmore was nominally administrator, Judge Watts, in fact, performed all the duties of the office ; that be was both attorney and surety for the administrator. When Gilmore was cited to account, and alleged the trust fund had not been received by him, but by his counsel, Judge Watts submitted himself to the jurisdiction, was represented before the auditor by counsel, and in his own testimony, while admitting the receipt of the money, alleged he had paid it to Mrs. Gilmore by crediting it on the purchase money due from her to him on a house and lot. She admitted that part of the sum belonging to her had been thus applied, but averred there was still a balance in his hands of $330.10, which, with interest added, <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>made tbe whole balance $538, the amount claimed before the auditor. The auditor, after full hearing, so found, his report was confirmed by the court, and no appeal taken. This litigation was in 1875 and the years immediately preceding.

It had jurisdiction over the estate of which John C. Gilmore was administrator; it was its duty to lay its hands on the assets of this estate and turn them over to those entitled to receive them. The administrator who ought to have had the money alleged Judge Watts had it; he admitted he once did have it, but alleged he had paid it to Mrs. Gilmore, the party entitled to it. The orphans’ court then undertook to determine whether any part of it was still in his possession, and found there was $330.10 of the $879.56 he had collected still in his hands. Incidentally this involved an inquiry as to how much of the money had been credited to Mrs. Gilmore on the house she had bought from him; but this was not the purpose of the inquiry; its sole purpose was the ascertainment of how much of the money of the estate he still had.</p>

The bank demurred, averring the subject-matter of litigation was not within the jurisdiction of the orphans’ court; that court overruled the demurrer, and this court on appeal affirmed the decree, holding that “ the power of the orphans’ court is only limited by the necessities of the case, and by its duty to administer equity in accordance 'with established rules. -In such case, it needs no other court to finish its work.” In that case, the bank claimed the stock as its own, by a regular transfer for a valuable consideration. Here Judge Watts did not claim the money, but only alleged he had already paid it to Mrs. Gilmore. The fact in dispute was determined against him by the orphans’ court. That is the end of the matter.</p>
