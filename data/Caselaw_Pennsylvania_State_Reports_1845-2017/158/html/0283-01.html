There is no time fixed for payment nor any covenant or condition requiring the grantees to mine. If the contention of the plaintiffs is right they may never mine any coal and the defendant might be deprived of his property without payment of the consideration. Plaintiffs claim that the consideration was contained in the price paid for the entire property, including the right to mine coal. But if the consideration was in part for this privilege, it still appears that a considerable portion of the consideration, about $250 to $300 per acre, was reserved, and at the option of plaintiffs may never become payable. It is not reasonable to suppose that the parties ever intended such result. The defendant had the power to make such an agreement, as was said in Grove v.
