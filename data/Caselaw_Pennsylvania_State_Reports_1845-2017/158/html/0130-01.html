On the day in question, there was an obstruction on the east-bound track near Point Bridge in the city of Pittsburgh, consisting of rocks and dirt which had been loosened by heavy rain during the previous night, and had slipped down off the precipitous hillside which rose above the railroad. The train upon which the deceased was riding was transferred to the west-bound track, and while moving along the base of the hill a large stone fell or bounded from the hillside against the car in which she was riding, breaking the window and instantly killing her. At the point where the accident occurred, there was a perpendicular rock cut thirty-three feet high. The stone which fell started from a point about three hundred and fifty-six feet from the track, bounded down some forty feet, and struck, again bounded twenty or thirty feet, making four bounds before it struck the train. Evidence on behalf of the railroad tended to show that the company employed a gang of men to go over the face of the hill during and after all rains, and remove any loose stone which might be found; that on the morning of the accident, anda few minutes before the train on which Miss Fleming was riding arrived, the foreman of this gang, Samuel Wright, walked over the face of the hill opposite the <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>point where the accident occurred, going from the track to the top of it, and saw “ no slips, no loose rock; ” that about two hours after the accident he again went up the hill, and when at a point distant above 850 feet from the track, measured horizontally, he found a slide about eight or ten feet long in the clay or dirt of the hill reaching to the edge of the bluff; that about forty feet below the edge of the bluff he saw an impression where a stone must have hit in its fall, and that lower down the hill he found three other marks or impressions where one had hit, the last mark being in the neighborhood of one hundred feet above the track from the point where the train was hit; that on his first inspection of the hill that morning he had passed over the spot where the first slip was afterwards found and there was no loose dirt or rock there, and the appearance of the dirt on the second visit showed the slip was recent; and that the stone which killed Miss Fleming was of a formation, found near and above the first slip, which is near the top of the hill, the stone outcropping there.</p>

This presumption necessarily arises from the contract of carriage, under which the passenger passively trusts himself to the safety of the carrier’s means of transportation, and to the skill, diligence and care of his servants ; and by which the carrier, in consideration of the fare, undertakes to carry safely, and, to do so, to furnish the best means and appliances for the purpose, and competent, skillful and diligent servants. An accident connected with them raises the presumption that they were not such, and that the carrier was guilty of negligence. But if the accident has no connection with the appliances or machinery, if it is so disconnected with the operation of the business of the carrier as not to involve the safety or sufficiency of the instrumentalities, or the negligence of his servants, no such presumption arises, and the burden of proof to show negligence is upon the plaintiff who avers it.</p>

But to throw this burden upon the carrier, it must first be shown that the injury complained of resulted from the breaking of machinery, collision, derailment of cars, or something improper or unsafe in the conduct of the business or in the appliances of transportation.”</p>
    <p id="b160-5" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[267,1142,1167,908]]]'>In the present case it is not shown that the accident was in consequence of a defect in any of the appliances or machinery used, or of the negligence of appellant’s employees in their conduct of the train. It was the result of a rock becoming detached and falling upon the train while passing a point where the hill descends precipitously to the track. From it, at the place of the accident, to the top of the hill is a distance of 456 feet. The cut for the railroad extends upward 33 feet, and above it is the natural hill. The rock which fell started at about 100 feet from the top of the hill, bounded down some 40 feet, struck, again bounded 20 or 30 feet, making four bounds before it struck the train, and caused the death of appellee’s daughter. It is clear that the fall of the rock was in no way connected with the appliances or machinery used in the operation of the road, or the acts of the employees in the conduct of the train- or in the construction of the road, and therefore there is no presumption of negligence on the part of appellants.</p>

Iii this case the accident was caused by a cow upon defendant’s track, and the opinion indicates that in the conduct of its business it was the duty of the company to fence the track or enforce the owner’s obligation to keep his cattle at home. Spear <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>v. P. W. &amp; B. R. R.

In this case Mr. Justice Williams says: “ The .person injured was a passenger; the injury occurred after the carriage had begun, and the cause of the injury was an explosion on the boat which was the vehicle or instrument of carriage, and which was under the exclusive care and control of defendant’s servants.” Gleason v. Virginia Midland R. R. Co., <a href="/us/140/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="140 U.S. 435" data-case-ids="3554572" data-case-paths="/us/140/0435-01">140 U. S. 435</a>. In this case the accident was caused by a land slide iu a cut some fifteen or twenty feet deep. In the opinion of the court it is said: “ The railroad cut is as much a part of the railroad structure as is the fill. They are both necessary and both are intended for one result, which is the production of a level track over which the trains may be propelled.' The cut is made by the company no less than the fill; and the banks are not the result of natural causes, but of the direct intervention of the company’s work. If1 it be the duty of the company (as it unquestionably is), in the erection of the fills and the necessary bridges, to so construct them that they shall be reasonably safe, and to maintain them in a reasonably safe condition, no reason can be assigned why the same duty should not exist in regard to the cuts.” Thus the cause of the accident was connected with the construction of the road.</p>
    <p id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[201,1501,1165,301]]]'>The difference between the cases cited and the present one is clear. In them the cause of the accident was connected with the means and appliances of transportation and the construction of the road, and in this it was disconnected with them. As the first two assignments of error are sustained, it is not necessary to discuss the others.</p>
