Fleming appointed in May 26, 1883, guardian of the minor children of K. McIntosh, deceased, acting as the agent of Mrs. McIntosh, administratrix, collected the assets, paid the debts, and retained the surplus, etc., and thereafter became insolvent and was discharged from his trust as guardian. In 1891, Mrs. McIntosh filed an account of her administration in which she charged herself with the assets so collected, and credited herself with the debts so paid and showed a balance for distribution, of which §4,213.37 was by decree of this court directed to be paid the Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company, guar<a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>dian succeeding said Fleming, although in fact she had never received any part of said assets. Fleming had in the meantime filed an account which did not, but afterwards filed a supplemental account which did, include this amount of the decree. To this supplemental account the guardian filed exceptions. The facts above stated having been shown, these exceptions were dismissed and the balance shown by the decree was paid by these respondents as sureties on the bond of J. K. Fleming, guardian. The administratrix now asks that the record of the balance shown by her account be satisfied, and respondents object, because the collection of assets having been made by Fleming, as her agent, were her collections, and the decree on account, still standing, is conclusive, until set aside, of her primary liability.</p>

The duty of the administratrix was to pay over, and that of the guardian to receive the surplusage of the estate in due course of administration. The guardian admittedly received all the personal assets, and having paid thereout the debts, there was no reason why the surplusage should have been paid over to the administratrix only to be returned. The fund belonged to him. The decree on his account was a judicial ascertainment of the fact that he had received and was liable for it, and necessarily of the liability of these respondents who were his sureties. The only remedy was by appeal, and this was not taken. Respondents’ payment of the amount was distinct recognition of the justice of the decree. The administratrix owed them no duty. All the objects of administration having been accomplished, her liability had ceased. The respondents were by the terms of their bond sureties for the conduct of the guardian; it was for his default they answered with full knowledge of all the facts which are now presented, and it is immaterial to them that decree of distribution stands against the administratrix on her account. The statement of account in this court is not an admission that the balance shown was actually in her hands and had not been paid over : Snyder v. Com., <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%20158" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="62 Pa. 158">62 Pa. 158</a>.

The present proceeding, having developed the fact of payment to the party legally entitled, must be treated as the equivalent of a rule to show cause, and the prayer of the petitioner granted.”</p>
