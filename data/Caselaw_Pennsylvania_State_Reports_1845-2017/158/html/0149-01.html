The commission in lunacy further found that the last place of legal residence of the lunatic was in the city of Allegheny. The court made an order committing Sefton to the insane asylum at Warren, Pennsylvania. A petition was subsequently presented in the form of a motion on behalf of Butler county for a rule on the department of public charities of Allegheny city to show cause why the city of Allegheny should not be certified as the place of residence of said Sefton.</p>
