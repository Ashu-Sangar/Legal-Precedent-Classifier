Waterhouse purchased certain lands from plaintiffs, and gave a mortgage to secure balance of purchase money. The Fredonia National Bank took a second mortgage on the same premises. In September, 1891, T. D. Collins bought and took a conveyance of the timber on the mortgaged premises from Waterhouse. The bank consented to this sale of the timber, and received the purchase money from it. Subsequently the owners of the first mortgage obtained a judgment, which was subsequently assigned to the bank. Execution was issued and the land was sold to the cashier of the bank. On Jan. 17, 1893, Collins procured the sale to be set aside, on giving bond to increase the bid at the next sale. The court also directed as follows : “ It is further ordered that if the above conditions be complied with, that on a resale the sheriff shall first offer the land, reserving the timber sold to the petitioner, and shall not sell said timber unless it be necessary to do so to satisfy liens in his hands.” On Feb. 27, 1893, the court vacated the portion of the order quoted above. On Sept. 1, 1893, the court refused to grant a rule to open the judgment and stay proceedings.</p>

This was equivalent to a releasfe of the timber from the lien of its mortgage, and it has now no right to levy upon or sell the timber under that mortgage. It is precisely analogous to the release of a portion of the mortgaged premises. Its claim against such released portion is gone, and as against an intervening purchaser cannot be revived. But Pratt and Phillips had the first lien, on the timber as well as the land, and it is claimed that the bank by purchasing their judgment acquired all their rights. This, as an ultimate right, to obtain satisfaction of the judgment, may be conceded, but it cannot be used to obtain payment of the bank’s original second mortgage out of the timber which it has <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>released from that lien.

    <p id="b72-4" data-blocks='[["BL_72.5",72,[260,581,1162,1109]]]'>Nor is the appellant limited as the appellee argues to a proceeding under the act of 22 April, 1856, sec. 9, P. L. 534. The purpose of that act was to provide a speedy and effectual process for certain clear cases of equitable rights of terre tenants and vendees, without interference with the rights of the judgment plaintiff. The latter has, says Sharswood, J., in Arna’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/65/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="65 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="430696" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0072-01">65 Pa. 72</a>, “an unquestionable judgment against all the lands of his debtor, the defendant. He has a right to proceed against any part. He cannot, in law or equity, be obliged to wait until the terre tenants have settled their equities between themselves.” It was accordingly held in that case that the plaintiff must be presented with the alternative either to levy his execution in the order directed by the court, or to accept his debt and assign his judgment to the terre tenant having an equity of subrogation. What is said in that ease, and in Phelps’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/98/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="98 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="496979" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0546-01">98 Pa. 546</a>, as to the exclusiveness of the remedy under this statute, and the application of the act of 21 March, 1806, must be limited strictly to the cases then in hand. This was expressly held in Milligan’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/104/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="104 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="452164" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0503-01">104 Pa. 503</a>, where it was said that the act of 1856 “ did not give the equity, or the right to substitution.
