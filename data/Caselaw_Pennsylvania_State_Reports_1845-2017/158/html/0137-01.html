    <p class="summary" id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.11",162,[266,846,1168,1527]]]'>“ The borough of Butler is under the borough act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320. In pursuance of said act the town council passed and the burgess duly approved, on April 3, 1887, the ordinance offered in evidence carrying into effect, in said borough, section 2, clause 9, of said act: ‘ To prohibit and otherwise regulate the running at large of horses, cattle, etc., and to authorize their seizure and sale for the benefit of the borough.’ Defendant was, on May 31, 1892, high constable, in and for said borough, duly elected and qualified. This ordinance, in its provisions, is reasonable and for the common good and not in restraint of trade, nor imposing a burden without an apparent benefit. This ‘ yellow cow ’ was, on May 31,1892, running at. large in the borough of Butler in violation of the provisions of said ordinance. Defendant found this ‘ yellow cow’ running at large in the borough of Butler in violation of the provisions of said ordinance on May 31,1892, about noon of said day, and seized and impounded her as required of him by section 2 of said ordinance. Therefore this ‘ yellow cow,’ the property of plaintiff, at the time of replevin was in the lawful custody of defendant. There can be no doubt that the defendant was an officer ‘ acting in his office under the authority of the state,’ within the provisions of the act of April 3,1779, 1 Sm. L. 470, and the writ of replevin, therefore, issued in this case, was irregular, erroneous and void: Pott v. Oldwine, <a href="/watts/7/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 173" data-case-ids="1846855" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0173-01">7 Watts, 173</a>. The plaintiff cannot set up that the seizure was illegal. His proper remedy was an action of trespass: Stiles v. Griffith, <a href="/yeates/3/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Yeates 82" data-case-ids="6771835" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0080-01">3 Yeates, 82</a>; Elkins v.

Therefore, it follows that this motion must be sustained and this <em>writ </em>quashed, and defendant awarded treble costs, under the provisions of act of April 3, 1779, supra.</p>
