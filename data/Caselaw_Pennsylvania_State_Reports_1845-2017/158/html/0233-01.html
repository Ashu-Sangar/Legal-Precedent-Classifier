Heileman, <a href="/pa/49/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="49 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="998459" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0060-01">49 Pa. 60</a>, and R. R. Co. v.

Hence the necessary corollaries of the rule were drawn in R. R. Co. v. Feller, <a href="/pa/84/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="84 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1053505" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0226-01">84 Pa. 226</a>, and Carroll v. R. R. Co., 12 W.

Co., <a href="/pa/135/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="135 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="817455" data-case-paths="/pa/135/0346-01">135 Pa. 346</a> (357), that “ If plaintiff’s own testimony had shown that he was negligent, he could not complain if the court took his case as he made it, although another witness had done better for him than he had for himself.” The point decided, however, in that case (and see also Brown v. Barnes, <a href="/pa/151/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="151 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="836668" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0562-01">151 Pa. 562</a>) was the converse proposition that where plaintiff has made out a ease for himself he cannot be nonsuited although another of his own witnesses shows his negligence.</p>

The testimony of the plaintiff upon the subject of his stop is extremely muddled and conflicting. In his first account he says that he stopped “ within about forty feet of the track and listened for the train ; ” again that he leaned forward in the buggy, “ looked both ways and listened for the whistle; ” again he repeats that he stopped, looked both ways and listened, and adds that he satisfied himself that there wasn’t any approaching train before he started, and that he “ used all the caution that any man could do.” On the other hand he says more than once that from about seventy feet back from the track and therefore necessarily from where he stopped, owing to a cut and embankment in the road, an approaching train could not be seen; and upon cross examination, he admits flatly, more than once, that he could not see down the track from where he stopped. Yet when his attention was called to the uselessness of looking where he could not see, his explanation was that until within seventy feet of the track he was where he “ could see the train without putting himself to any trouble, because he was driving <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>near the track.” This testimony was contradictory, and the net result of it by no means clear. On part of it he was plainly entitled to go to the jury, on the other part equally plainly he was not. Under these circumstances the case must go to the jury, whose province it is to reconcile conflicting statements, whether of the same or different witnesses, or to draw the line between them and say which shall prevail. Had the testimony referred to a subject as to which the burden of proof was on the plaintiff, the result might have been different, for the court is not entitled to submit evidence which will merely enable a jury to guess at a fact in favor of a party who is bound to prove it. But in cases like the present, the plaintiff is not required to disprove contributory negligence, but only to make out a case clear of it. Unless, therefore, his negligence appears affirmatively, he is entitled to go to the jury on the general presumption against it, and so likewise where the evidence is conflicting as it was here. The weight of the evidence appears to us very clearly against the plaintiff on this point, but that was for the jury and the court below.</p>
