Early in the morning of July 21,1891, plaintiff and her son were driving along the turnpike, and had reached a point near the Corks Run bridge, where the work was still in progress, when the front wheels of the wagon dropped down between the tracks into the excavation made by the removal of cobblestones, and plaintiff was thrown from the wagon and injured. Plaintiff claimed that the repairs were being made under the direction of defendant’s officers. William J. Burns, defendant’s superintendent, testified as follows: “ Q. Do you know who made those repairs ? A. The repairs were made by the Chartiers &amp; Robinson Township Turnpike Company. Q. Was that the name of the Old Turnpike Company? A. Yes, sir. Q. The repairs were made under your direction, weren’t they? A. They were made under the direction of the Turnpike Company — all those repairs. Q. All those repairs were made under the direction of the Turnpike Company ? A. Yes, sir. Q. The Turnpike Company were laying the rails to run the cars ? A. They were building a bridge there and they raised it up probably eighteen inches higher than it was before, and they had to take up the roadway to get their new construction, or bridge, or superstructure in, and they were doing all the work connected with it. Q. Who superintended and controlled that work? A. Well, I directed part of it. Q. You directed part of it? A. Yes, sir. Q. You had control of it? A. By the order of the board, yes, sir. Q. Wasn’t the work done by men employed by the Pittsburgh &amp; West End Railroad Company? A. Yes, sir. Q. Everything that was paid was paid by the Turnpike Company? A. Yes, sir. Q. But you had control of the work; superintended it? A. The engineer had the general supervision of it. Q. But it was done under your direction, as superintendent of this Passenger Railway Company ? A. Yes, sir; partially so. Q. And rails were laid for your cars to run on? A. Yes, sir. . . . Q. The men doing that work were under your control, <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>weren’t they ? A. They were under the engineer’s and mine.” He also testified that during the progress of the repairs the track was-in use by defendant company.</p>

    <p id="b445-12" data-blocks='[["BL_445.16",445,[209,1498,1167,696]]]'>It is no doubt true that it was competent for defendant company to show that the injury complained of was due to the negligence of others; but, unfortunately for it, there was evidence that the repairs, out of which the injury grew, were under the immediate charge of its officers while the railway was in actual operation by the company. The public had a right, and, it appears, was accustomed to use the tracks in common with defendant; and, if the track was put in such a condition as to render it dangerous to public travel, it was the duty of those having charge to give adequate warning. Others may have been culpably negligent; but there was certainty evidence which justified submission of the question of defendant company’s negligence to the jury. Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.</p>
