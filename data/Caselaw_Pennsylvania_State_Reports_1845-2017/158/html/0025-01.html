Defendant testified in substance that on the night in question he saw from his bedroom window some person ride out of South alley toward his stable, from the direction of Morgan street, and in a very few moments after, he saw a flash of light in his stable, as if some person was striking matches there — that he hastily dressed himself, seized his revolver,-and went around his lot and the house of Elza Spragg, .up Whiskey alley, and through the cracks in the weatherboarding of his stable, saw a man inside the stable examining his harness by the light of matches which he was striking for the purpose. That he passed around the stable coming to the double door at the north side where he found the door open, and, as he stepped to the door the person inside the stable came to the door with a set of harness on his arm— that the man meeting defendant at the door, dropped the harness and struck defendant a blow with his fist in the face and after some scuffling, the man ran up South alley toward Morgan street and directly toward an electric light standing on Morgan street where it is intersected by South alley. That he pursued the man along the alley at a distance of some 60 or 65 feet, and that when the prisoner came to the mouth of a private alley he called twice to the man to halt, and that they were then twelve or fifteen feet apart. The man not halting he fired his revolver into the air to scare him. The man then turned upon defendant, made a grab at him with his left hand and tore his shirt and scratched his breast, and the prisoner, believing that his life was in danger, shot the man, as he alleged, in self defence. That immediately after shooting, the man fell and defendant went to him, found him lying on his face — that -he put his arms around his body under his arms, raised him up and carried him some ten feet back toward his stable, leaned him against the fence and immediately ran to the house of. a neighbor and gave the alarm.</p>

All evidence therefore which bore directly on such inquiry, was relevant and admissible, even though it incidentally tended to show the commission by the deceased of a crime not part of that on trial. The two offers included in the first and second assignments of error were clearly within this principle. The presence of the deceased inside of a locked stable, near midnight, was of itself very strong evidence that he was there with some criminal intent, and what this intent was, would be made clear, if it should be shown, as was offered, that' part of a harness belonging to the prisoner had been stolen, that it had been in the possession of the deceased, and that the latter had traded it to another person with a promise to supply the missing part. Evidence to that effect was admissible. It did not come within the general rule that one crime cannot be introduced as evidence of another separate and unconnected. Such evidence, as was said in Goersen v. Com., <a href="/pa/99/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="99 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="446134" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0388-01">99 Pa. 388</a>, “ cannot be received to impeach (the prisoner’s) general character, nor merely to prove a disposition to commit crime. Yet under some circumstances evidence of another offence by the defendant may be given.

This is the usual rule as to accomplices, not as to defendants, and in a case where the prisoner was necessarily the only witness as to the actual circumstances of the shooting it put upon him a greater burden than the law imposes.</p>
