Along Carson street at this point defendant maintained and operated a double line of electric railway. On Twenty-eighth street was a steam railroad. Plaintiff claimed that at the point where he hitched his horse a car on the south track of the street railway could not pass his wagon without hitting it. Plaintiff described the accident as follows: “And I drove up there with the meat, delivered it and had the end gate closed and everything read}1- just for to take and unhook the snapper at the horse’s bridle, with an iron weight on it, and just at that the car which was on one side of the railroad track, and I was on the other <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>side — and just as I was going to unhook the snapper I motioned to it to wait until I got the snapper out, and the conductor, he motioned for him to go ahead, to the motorman; and just at that time she hit the hind wheel of the wagon, and the horse tramped on my left foot and twisted me and throwed me down in the gutter, and the horse walked over me, but the snapper went back into the bridle again. I hadn’t quite got it loose yet; it went back in the bridle and the horse walked over me, and it catched on a stopcock on the pavement, and that pulled the horse gee, and just as it pulled him gee, the wheel catched me right here across the back.”</p>

There was evidence of want of proper care in this ease, which required submission to the jury; and this was done with proper instructions. The questions of fact, upon which plaintiff’s right to recover depended, having been thus properly submitted to the jury, and by them determined in his favor, there is nothing in the record that would justify us in disturbing the judgment entered on their verdict.</p>
