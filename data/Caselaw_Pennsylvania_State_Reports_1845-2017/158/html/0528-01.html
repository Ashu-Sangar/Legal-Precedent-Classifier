The testator divided his estates into two parts and made independent dispositions of them. The gifts to Mrs. Martin thereout differ in their quality : the first is in remainder and the second in prassenti. The second is directed to be equalized with the shares given to her brothers out of presently available assets, whereas the first was made payable after the death of the widow. ‘ I give and bequeath to our said daughter, Lucretia Mott Martin,’ said testator, 4 certain real estate at a valuation of $46,000, and to this shall be added enough personal property to make her share equal to that of any one of the other three heirs.’ It is plain that equalization was intended to be made, not by aid of the personal property bequeathed to Mrs. McIntosh and Mrs. Martin, for Mrs. Martin’s interest in that was only in remainder and would not be available until Mrs. McIntosh’s death, but out of the other part of the personal estate which would be presently available.</p>

To what then does the expression refer ? In the first place it refers to one object, whereas there are two 4 above ’ — an estate for life and an estate in remainder. ‘The above is intended, to be, and is to be taken in lieu or bar of ’ which of these ? Dow<a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>er. Taken by whom ? No other than the widow is mentioned. It is what is given to her — a life estate, not what was given to Mrs. Martin — a remainder — that was intended to be barred. It is precisely the same as though the testator had said, if the widow accepts ‘ the above ’ it shall be in lieu of dower. She had no interest in the remainder; there had been an absolute and independent gift of that to Mrs. Martin. Had Mrs. McIntosh died before her husband there can be no doubt but that Mrs. Martin would have taken the one third of the personal estate absolutely. Having survived, if she had accepted under the will, Mrs. Martin would have taken the whole on her death, or by agreement between them they could have divided it on the basis of the cash value of their respective estates — the widow taking the one third and Mrs. Martin the other two thirds absolutely. In any event, Mrs. Martin would have received exactly what testator intended she should have.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[185,1177,1164,1008]]]'>“The suggestion that the relationship of Mrs. Martin, as the only child of the widow, can affect the question of construction has no merit. That fact might explain the expression of, but cannot create, a condition. Here there was neither an express nor implied condition attached to the gift; it was independent and absolute on its face, and extrinsic evidence is incompetent to show an intention to create such condition. It is clear that Mrs. Martin was intended to be a favored object of testator’s bounty. Nothing short of express words or necessary implication would justify the inference that testator intended to coerce his widow into acceptance under his will through her affection for her daughter, for such purpose would hav-e been not only inconsistent with the spirit of the statute which gave her a right of election, but with that fair and humane dealing which he owed her as husband. But neither the language used nor the value of the gift justify such inference. The advantages of refusal were so great that there could have been no temptation even'to acceptance. The bequest here is totally unlike that in Carr’s Estate, 13 <em>i </em>Pa. 354, which was expressly conditioned upon the widow’s acceptance under the will.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[188,2193,1161,197]],["BL_558.1",558,[275,364,1159,347]]]'>“ If, then, the gift to Mrs. Martin was absolute, it was accelerated by the' widow’s refusal to take under the will; and she thereby became entitled to some present estate, but to what ? Certainly, as between her and the widow, the latter could no <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>more take the whole of her third out of that portion of the personal property set apart to her by the will than out of the homestead. She must take, as though no will had been made, out of the bulk of the estate, and the other beneficiaries take the residue as constituting the whole estate, and as though the widow were dead, in the interests contemplated by testator. If the legacies be of equal grade they must abate proportionately.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[276,718,1158,1458]]]'>“ As between Mrs. Martin and her brothers, the refusal of the widow to take under the will presents a question which turns upon the application of the principle that ‘ where a widow elects not to take under a will her substituted devises and bequests are a trust in her for the benefit of the disappointed claimants to the amount of their interest therein. A court of equity will sequester the benefit intended for the widow to secure compensation to those whom her election disappoints.’ Gallagher’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/87/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="87 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="1057839" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0200-01">87 Pa. 200</a>; Ferguson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/138/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="138 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="11251420" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0208-01">138 Pa. 208</a>. Are there substituted devises and bequests here out of which compensation can be made? It is clear that so far as the personal estate is concerned there are not. By her election the widow became entitled to a share in her husband’s estate as though he had died intestate, and the will operates on the rest as though she were dead: Vance’s Estate, <a href="/pa/141/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="141 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="974887" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0201-01">141 Pa. 201</a>. Assuming then that her share has been taken out, what remains constitutes the whole personal estate for distribution amongst testator’s children and grandchildren as provided by the will; and of this Mrs. Martin is entitled to one third and the four children of testator, including Mrs. Martin, are entitled to the other two thirds in the proportions specified in the will. The result, so far as the bequest to Mrs. McIntosh for life, and Mrs. Martin in remainder is concerned, is that Mrs. McIntosh will get the exact equivalent in cash of her life estate, and Mrs. Martin of her remainder. To illustrate: Suppose this bequest to amount to $30,000; on the principle recognized in Dates-man’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/127/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="127 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="565743" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0348-01">127 Pa. 348</a>, the cash value of the widow’s life estate would be one third, or $10,000; and that of Mrs. Martin, remainder two thirds, or $20,000.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[275,2187,1158,194]]]'>“ There are then no benefits intended for the widow in suspense ; both she and Mrs. Martin get exactly what the testator intended they should have, and there can consequently be no fund available for compensation and no disappointed legatees.</p>

      <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>“ But the situation in respect to the real estate is different. The effect of the widow’s election was to increase the share of Mrs. Martin in the homestead by two thirds of the rental value, and to decrease that of the devisees in the other real estate by one third, during the widow’s life, and thereby to change the proportion in which testator intended they should take. The gain to Mrs. Martin represented the ‘ benefits intended for the widow,’ ‘ her substituted devise,’ and therefore a trust fund to secure compensation to those whom the widow’s election disappointed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b559-4" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[203,888,1163,1004]]]'>“ It is conceded that there are disappointed claimants, but are they entitled to compensation out of this fund ? It would seem clear that they are. ‘ The principle is well settled that equity will depart from the literal provisions of a will in order to carry out a superior or preferred intent of the testator which would otherwise fail. But the object is not to produce a distribution which the court may think more equal or equitable, but to approximate as closely as possible to the scheme of the testator, which has failed by reason of intervening rights or circumstances.’ It will be conceded that a ‘ superior or preferred intent ’ of the testator was that his beneficiaries should take in the proportions prescribed in his will, and that these proportions have been changed by the widow’s election. Mrs. Martin has gained what from the face of the will she was not intended to have, and the other devisees have lost; testator’s scheme has to this extent failed. Mrs. Martin’s gain is the widow’s ‘ substituted devise,’ and therefore a trust fund which should be used'to secure compensation to those whom the widow’s election disappointed, and thus <em>‘ </em>approximate as closely as possible to the scheme of the testator.’</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[256,639,1164,1778]],["BL_561.1",561,[203,387,1164,550]]]'>“ In respect to the rest of this share (less $10,000 cash given Robert McIntosh), the creation of an active trust is not so plainly, but is sufficiently expressed. It is conceded that the will vested in the trustees the legal title. The scheme of the trust declared gave these trustees a large discretion, and necessarily imposed on them active duties. They were ‘ empowered,’ ‘ in case of necessity from sickness of any of the heirs ’ of E. G. McIntosh, deceased, or, ‘should any of the children of’ L. J. McIntosh, deceased, ‘be desirous of a collegiate or classical education,’ ‘ to use the income of this share.’ Out of what are these expenses to be paid ? The expression, ‘ this share,’ is the same as that used in the gift to the trustees, and, standing by itself, would of course include the whole ‘ share ’ of the heirs of E. G. McIntosh, deceased. But its use here was evidently in a limited sense, for the testator had already specifically set apart the net rents of the Anderson street property— one half to Robert McIntosh, and the other half ‘ for the support of the children’ of L. J. McIntosh, deceased. The provision for defrayal of expenses of sickness and education immediately follows this, and was evidently intended as additional and extraordinary, and to be paid out of the income of the share given to these ‘ heirs ’ of E. G. McIntosh, deceased. On no other theory of construction can the disposition of ‘ this share ’ be made effectual. It will thus be seen that the income of the whole of ‘ this share ’ is pledged for the defrayal of expenses which may become necessary in case of sickness of any one of the heirs of E. G. McIntosh, deceased, or the education of either of the children of L. J. McIntosh, deceased, until the youngest attains majority. An adequate reason for the creation of this trust is found in the minority of two of the heirs of the cestui que trust, either of whom may become entitled to the benefits; and an additional reason is suggested by the evident belief of the testator, whether justified by facts or not is immaterial, that the industry and sobriety of the other needed to be tested by time. The nature of the trust is such that it must continue <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>in respect of the whole of ‘ this share.’ Who will receive the benefit, and how much will be required of the income to meet the necessary expenses of sickness or education, it is impossible to foretell. From the nature of the case there will be inequality. One may receive nothing or the whole. It will thus be seen that each cestui que trust is interested in the continuance of the trust in ‘ this share ’ as a whole: Hinkle’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/116/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="116 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="554353" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0490-01">116 Pa. 490</a>. If the trust be valid as to one, it must necessarily be valid as to all. The accumulations, if any, will be simply temporary, and in the interest of judicious management: Hibbs’ Est., <a href="/pa/143/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="143 Pa. 217" data-case-ids="978553" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0217-01">143 Pa. 217</a>.</p>

There are sufficient words used, a definite object, and ascertained subjects, and it is not inconsistent with public policy: Marshall’s Est., <a href="/pa/147/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="147 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="829868" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0077-01">147 Pa. 77</a>.</p>

McIntosh and his children ’ would, standing alone, give the latter equal rights in distribution with their father. This is the leading and operative clause, and the word ‘ children ’ being of purchase must be so construed, unless a contrary intention can be gathered from the whole will. That it was used in its primary sense here is strengthened by the fact that in every other instance in which it appears it is undoubtedly used as a word of purchase, while the word ‘ heirs ’ is used as a word of limitation. But counsel insist that because ‘ this share ’ is elsewhere referred to as James T. McIntosh’s, the word ‘children’ must be treated as a word of limitation or succession. The implication is not necessary. The leading and operative clause is, as already seen, that to ‘ James T. McIntosh and his children,’ and the natural inference is that James T. McIntosh’s name was simply used by way of convenient reference. Similar use was made of the name of Alexander G. McIntosh, and yet no one intimates that he can justly claim a share. Being fathers, their selection as representatives was but natural, and could not be construed to take away benefits which had been expressly given their children.”</p>
