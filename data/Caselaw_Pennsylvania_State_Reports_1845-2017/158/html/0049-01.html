They, with the assent of appellee, took them to Westmoreland county where appellant purchased them. Subsequently J. H. Cain purchased them from appellant and gave him his note, the note in suit, indorsed by appellee. On March 30th appellee wrote appellant: “ J. H. Cain (the party who was to see you a few days ago) will take the tools and machinery as per bill of sale McCarter &amp; Garrard to you, giving you ids ninety-day note indorsed by me for $513, with interest.

He called McCarter, who testifies that appellant wrote it and read it and did not read “ boiler and engine ; ” but upon cross-examination he said he signed it without reading it, and, in reply to the court, that he signed it without knowing what was in it. His partner, Garrard, testified that appellant wrote it and that the boiler and engine were not mentioned, but also says he did not read it.

As such were the facts, appellant was entitled to recover, and the learned trial judge erred in not affirming appellant’s fourth point, viz.: “That as all the evidence shows that the defendant indorsed the note in suit for the purpose of having Cain purchase the property in question as per bill of sale from McCarter &amp; Garrard to the plaintiff, with full knowledge of his own claim of title to the boiler and engine, and the plaintiff, induced thereto by defendant’s letter to him delivered for said note, property, exclusive of said boiler and engine, of a value at least equal to the face of the note, the defendant cannot set up a failure of title to said boiler and engine as a defence to this action, and the verdict must be for the plaintiff.”</p>

Appellant by the bill of sale became possessed of them as well as other property, claimed title to the same, and was induced by the acts of appellee to part with his possession of them in consideration of the note. Having done so, appellee cannot now, in a defence <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>to the note, successfully assert that it was a trick or device by which appellant was deceived into parting with the property. He remained silent as to any claim which he might have to the boiler and engine, and by his silence as well as his acts induced the appellant to change his position and to deliver up the property. Having done so he cannot be permitted to claim the amount of their value as a credit upon the note received for the property by appellant: Waters’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20Pa.%20526" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="35 Pa. 526">35 Pa. 526</a>.</p>
