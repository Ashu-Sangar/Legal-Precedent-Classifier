J., of the 10th judicial district, specially presiding, it appeared that on March 2, 1889, plaintiff was injured at a grade crossing near Ursina. He was traveling in a buggy owned and driven by Liston, who had invited plaintiff to ride home with him. Evidence for plaintiff tended to show that the crossing was a dangerous one, and that the view of the tracks was obstructed by cars; that as they approached the crossing they drove slowly and exercised proper care and caution; that they stopped and talked with a Mr. Miller fifty or seventy-five yards from the crossing, that they then looked and listened, and that when they got to the track of the railroad they again stopped and looked and listened; that no warning was given by ringing bell or blowing whistle, and as they advanced on the track they were struck by the train and seriously injured and disabled.</p>

We cannot say as a matter of law that the plaintiff is chargeable with contributory negligence, but submit it to you to determine under all the evidence whether the plaintiff stopped at a proper place, and to say whether he was guilty of contributory negligence.

Lyons that ‘he told Jerry not to try it,’ that he told David Stremmel ‘ if Liston would have listened to me this all would not have happened, that he wanted him to stop and wait until the train goes, and Liston said he can make it and went on and drove right along and didn’t stop,’ then this establishes contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, Smith, and there can be no recovery. <em>Answer: </em>We cannot say that if you <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>find the evidence of Dr. Fichtner and the others mentioned in the point to be as stated in this point that this establishes contributory negligence on part of plaintiff Smith and there can be no recovery.

    <p id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.7",110,[248,737,1160,602]]]'>As clearly appears from the testimony, this case involved the questions of defendant company’s negligence and plaintiff’s contributory negligence.

    <p id="b110-7" data-blocks='[["BL_110.8",110,[249,1346,1161,956]]]'>As to the alleged contributory negligence, it was contended that if plaintiff did stop, look and listen before attempting to cross defendant’s track, as he testified, he did not do so at the proper place. The testimony bearing on each of said questions was more or less conflicting, and it was also of such a character that inferences of fact had to be drawn therefrom. On both questions of negligence and contributory negligence the case was clearly for the jury, and the learned trial judge could riot have withdrawn it from them without invading their province and assuming the self-imposed task of drawing inferences of fact from the testimony, and determining disputed questions of fact. To have done so would have been manifest error: Railroad Co. v. Barnett, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20Pa.%20264" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="59 Pa. 264">59 Pa. 264</a>; McNeal v.

It is for you to determine from all the evidence whether he exercised proper care and caution, — whether he stopped at a proper place, where he could properly observe the tracks of the railroad to the east and west of the crossing.” Again, in answering plaintiff’s point recited in the fourth specification as to testimony showing compliance with the “ stop, look and listen ” rule, the jury were instructed that if they found from the evidence that plaintiff stopped at a proper place or places, and properly exercised his senses of sight and hearing, he would not be guilty of contributory negligence, and if they further found that the defendant company was guilty of negligence, plaintiff would be entitled to recover.</p>
