If such an appeal be regarded in the light of a certiorari, and there is nothing in the record to show an abuse of discretion by the court below, it will be dismissed by the' appellate court.\nArgued Oct. 2, 1911.\nAppeal, No. 49, Oct. T., 1911, by Pennsylvania Railroad Company, from order of C. P. Cambria Co., Dec. T., 1910, No. 459, approving bond In re Condemnation by Blandburg Water Company.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to amount of bond filed by the Blandburg Water Company in proceedings to condemn a stream supplying a reservoir owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.\nO\u2019Connor, P. J., filed the following opinion and decree:\nExceptions were filed to the amount of bond offered by the Blandburg Water Company for the approval of the court in the above-stated proceeding, and for the present we feel like sustaining the exception which goes to the sufficiency of the bond, and suggest that the court will for the present approve a proper bond in the sum of $5,000 for taking of the water, which amount we regard as sufficiently adequate unless the exceptant has acquired the right to take the water from the stream in question by reason of a user uninterrupted for a period of twenty-one years and upwards. If we were to require a bond greater in amount, we would practically decide that the exceptant had acquired a right by prescription to make use of the waters in question not permitted by law. The disputed question we leave open, and enter the following order:\nAnd now, November 10, 1910, unless bond to be approved by the court in the sum of $5,000 be filed by the Blandburg Water Company for the use of the exceptants within fifteen days from this date for taking of water, exceptions sustained] otherwise exceptions overruled when bond approved.\nThe court approved the bond filed in accordance with this decree.\nError assigned was order approving the bond.\nOctober 23, 1911:\nJohn W. Kephart, for appellant.\nJohn E. Evans, with him A. V. Barker and Chas. S. Evans, for appellee.\nThe approval of the bond in this proceeding is not the subject of review in the appellate court: Getz v. Philadelphia & Reading R. R. Co., 1 Walker, 427; Slocum\u2019s App., 12 W. N. C. 84; Twelfth St. Market Co. v. Phila., etc., R. R. Co., 142 Pa. 580; Mc-Manus\u2019s App., 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 65; Katharine Water Co.\u2019s App., 32 Pa. Superior Ct. 94."
