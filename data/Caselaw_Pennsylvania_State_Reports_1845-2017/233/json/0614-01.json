    "head_matter": "Maloney\u2019s Estate.\nExecutors and administrators \u2014 Partnership between executor and testator \u2014 Accounting for profits.\nWhere an executor, who was the partner of his testator, has the deceased partner\u2019s interest in the partnership appraised, but does not immediately sell it, and then continues the business until the expiration of the contract which was the firm\u2019s only business, when he sells the decedent\u2019s interest to his own son, and thereafter enters into a new partnership with his son to carry on a new business under an entirely new contract, and none of the estate\u2019s money is used in the new business, the executor will be charged with a share of the profits to the deceased\u2019s estate up to the formation of the new partnership, but will not be liable for any profits to the estate thereafter.\nArgued Oct. 16, 1911.\nAppeal, No. 22, Oct. T., 1911, by The Fidelity Title & Trust Company, Guardian of John J., Edward D., Anne V., and Agnes C. Maloney, Minors, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., Jan. T., 1910, No. 112, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in Estate of John Maloney, deceased.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nMiller, J., filed the following opinion:\nThe principal question is whether the accountant, who was also, the surviving partner of the decedent, should be surcharged with the profits arising out of the partnership business, which he continued to conduct without a distinct settlement of the partnership business, and if so, for what length of time.\nAt the decedent\u2019s death, October 28, 1908, he was a half partner with the accountant, whom he made his executor, in the business of selling coke, under the firm name of T. D. Maloney & Company.\nThis business was based entirely on a subcontract the partners had with one who had an original contract from the Philadelphia Gas Company. Their place of business was on the property of said gas company, the use of which was a right incidental and necessary to the coke contract.\nThe contract existing at the time of decedent\u2019s death, expired by limitation on June 1, 1909, having run some four or five years before. After the decedent\u2019s death the accountant changed the name of the firm, striking out \u201cand company,\u201d and leaving the business in his own name. He so carried the bank accounts and transacted the business until after June 1, 1909, when he took in his son as a partner, obtained a new contract similar to the former one, and operated the business under the firm name of T. D. Maloney & Son.\nHe did not close the partnership account after the death of John Maloney, nor did he as surviving partner settle the partnership affairs. After he took his son into partnership, he transferred to him the interest of the decedent for $2,000, taking his son\u2019s note; this interest the son has been, and is paying out of his share of the profits of the business. Under date of July 2, 1909, he caused an appraisement to be filed in the register\u2019s office of the estate of decedent which came into his hands, wherein it appears that the decedent\u2019s half in the firm of T. D. Maloney & Company was appraised as to capital in the sum of $2,000, and as to other assets consisting of horses, wagons and other general partnership assets, at $412.05. He mingled the assets of this partnership business after the death of his partner with his own, keeping all bank accounts in his own name. For a part of the funds which he collected and charged himself, it is admitted that interest should be added at the same rate that he was receiving interest from the banks, to wit, three per cent.\nIt was the custom of the partners to make quarterly settlements between themselves and divide or charge off their net profits; this last settlement was made as of October 1, 1908, and John Maloney received his share of the profits to that time.\nThe net profits made by the accountant after the death of the decedent are as follows:\nFor the months of October, November and December, 1908,......$1,500.05\nFor the months of January, February and\nMarch, 1909,.....\u2019 1,423.25\nFor the months of April, May and June, 1909, being the termination of the contract existing at the . time of the death of John Maloney, . . . . . . . . 2,249.09\nA total of.....$5,172.39\nAfter June, 1909, under the new contract made when he took in his son as a partner, and charged himself with the inventory value of the half interest of John Maloney, the profits to April 1, 1910, are admitted to be $13,183.23.\nIf the accountant, as surviving partner, had followed the usual and prescribed course, he would have duly settled the partnership as between himself, the surviving partner, and as the executor of the deceased partner: Williams\u2019 Est., 23 Pitts. Leg. J. 118.\nIn such settlement, conceding that the death of John Maloney dissolved the partnership, yet it was the duty of the surviving partner to obtain the fullest benefit and advantage of all decedent\u2019s contracts, which were a part of the assets of the partnership; he would not have been justified in treating the unexpired contract, the sole assets of this partnership, as.of no value to anyone but himself.\nHaving failed to adjust the partnership as surviving partner, having seen fit to conduct the business of the partnership with the partnership assets, and not having caused either the settlement of the partnership, nor an appraisement of the partnership, of the deceased partner\u2019s interest to be made and filed until July of 1909, the conduct of the business by him in this manner, during this period, must in equity be treated as a partnership business, and the estate has a right to elect, sharing in the profits during the period rather than demanding interest on the capital of the deceased partner. Accountant will be surcharged with one-half of the admitted profits under the old contract, viz.: $5,172.39, and with interest thereon from July 1, 1909.\nDuring the period from decedent\u2019s death until the termination of the contract, the survivor carried on the business practically with the partnership funds and is accountable to the estate of the deceased partner for a share of the profits: Brown\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 139.\nThe appraisement of the decedent\u2019s interest in the partnership, and the transfer thereof to his son at the appraised price, must be treated as a termination of the accountant\u2019s liability as surviving partner; the new partnership began an entirely new contract; it is immaterial that it was made between the same parties, or that its terms are similar to the old contract; as a fact it was not a part of the old partnership assets; therefore the estate is not entitled to a share in the profits after June, 1909, made by the new firm, under the new contract.\nOn exception to the adjudication, Miller, J., filed the following opinion:\nIn so far as the accountant had not put the appraised value of decedent\u2019s interest in a separate account and kept it in his individual name with his own funds, it was, strictly speaking, commingled; but in view of the fact that he did not use this fund, or any part of it, in the business of the new firm after June 1,1909, that he charged himself with it; held it for the benefit of this estate, and accounts for it, as of the time of the appraisement, no basis is furnished for the claim, that after death had dissolved the partnership, after the accountant is made to settle for profits up to the termination of the single contract, constituting this entire partnership business, he is further bound to account for profits made by the new partnership, on the new contract.\nIt is immaterial on what terms or to whom he sold the deceased partner\u2019s interest, if in the absence of fraud he obtained full value therefor; charging himself with the amount thereof relieves the estate of concern as to how he will be paid, whether he is paid at all, or whom he sees fit to take into partnership.\nIn Brown\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 139, there was a general partnership business, continued by the representatives of the deceased partner for many years, with a distinct use of the partnership funds during that period. The facts here show a partnership limited to one thing, dealing with one customer under a distinct contract that expired at a specified time, and the funds of the estate were not used by the new partnership.\nThe new contract afterwards made by the accountant had no connection with the dissolved partnership; it was not a continuance of the former partnership business with partnership funds; no right of renewal on the coke contract is shown, either in the estate, or in the surviving partner, after June 1, 1909. Certainly the law does not compel or require accountants of decedents\u2019 estates, in the absence of testamentary authority, to embark in new business ventures with trust funds.\nJanuary 2, 1912:\nNor is this the case of a tenant\u2019s right in a renewal of a lease as an asset incident to an existing lease: Johnson\u2019s App., 115 Pa. 129. Even conceding that the expectancy of renewal was an asset, and that it was accountant\u2019s duty to renew, Johnson\u2019s App., 115 Pa. 129, the exceptants furnished no evidence of the value of this expectancy in the nature of good will, or otherwise. It is not apparent that the profits made by the new partnership, under the new contract, are any evidence of the value of the expectancy of renewal.\nThe exceptions must therefore be dismissed.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nWilliam A. Jordan, with him Thos. D. Chantler and W. H. McClung, for appellants.\nIf the survivor of a partnership carries on the concern and enters into new transactions with the partnership funds, he does so at his peril, and is accountable to the estate of the deceased partner for the capital, with a share of the profits, or with interest: De Haven\u2019s App., 34 Pitts. Leg. J. 211; Hermes v. Hermes, 36 Pitts. Leg. J. 265; Heager\u2019s Est., 15 S. & R. 65; Johnson\u2019s App., 115 Pa. 129.\nThe chance or opportunity of renewal of the old contract is, in itself, a distinct asset: Johnson\u2019s App., 115 Pa. 129; Mueller\u2019s Est., 190 Pa. 601; Brady\u2019s Est., 21 Pa. Superior Ct. 397; Graeser\u2019s Est., 230 Pa. 145; Heager\u2019s Est., 15 S. & R. 65; Brown\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 139; Lindsay\u2019s Est., 210 Pa. 224; Harbster\u2019s App., 125 Pa. 1.\nW. B. Rodgers, with him D. C. Reardon, for appellee."
