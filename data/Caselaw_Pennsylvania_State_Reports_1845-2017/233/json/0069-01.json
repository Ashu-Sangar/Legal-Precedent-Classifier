        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe question presented by this appeal is whether the widow of. the testator took a fee under the following clause of his will: \u201cAnd lastly, I give and bequeath unto my beloved wife Margaret all real estate, and all personal property of whatever kind and nature they may be to have and to hold or sell and convey the same at her own will and accord and to pass titals'for the same and have the us of the proceeds thereof during her natural life. And further I do appoint my son Jacob T. Caslow as agent for my wife to act in her place and under her instructions, as he may be requested by her, and no further if he shall live that long, if he should be called away she my wife is at liberty to celect a suteable person in his place.\u201d This part of the will was preceded by a direction in relation to the payment of his debts and followed by the attestation clause. There was no gift to any other person and no disposition of a remainder.\nIt is evident that the testator\u2019s intention was to provide for his wife alone. She was the sole beneficiary under his will and the estate he gave her had all the attributes of absolute ownership. Unless he gave her a fee he died intestate as to the remainder after the expiration of a life estate. Every presumption is against such an intention. \u201cIt detracts nothing from a fee for a testator to say that his devisee shall have the sole control of the property during her lifetime,\u201d Snyder v. Baer, 144 Pa. 278; and \u201cA devise, generally or indefinitely, with power of disposition carries a fee:\u201d Witmer v. Delone, 225 Pa. 450.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

J.\nFrom the case stated it appeared that Samuel Caslow, husband of Margaret Caslow, died on March 11, 1888, seized in fee of the land in question. By his will he gave his real and personal property to his wife. The material portion of the will is quoted in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nMargaret Caslow died on March 15, 1910, leaving a will by which she authorized her executors to sell her real estate at public or private sale. The executors contracted to sell the land in question to the defendant who refused to pay the purchase money alleging that the title was not marketable.\nThe court entered judgment for plaintiffs for $3,730.50. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in entering judgment for plaintiff on case stated.\nJames St. Clair McCall, for appellant.\nJos. B. Strawbridge, for appellees."
