I will to my son Henry S. Day the real estate known as the Dr. H. W. Blachly Farm, together with two receipts I hold, one calling for Two Thousand Dollars, the other for Sixty Dollars during his natural life, \u2014 under the following conditions \u2014 by paying to his mother One Hundred and Twenty Dollars semi-annually if she thinks proper to leave the farm, and Seventy Five if she remains. At his death to be divided among his living children as follows, \u2014 Five Hundred Dollars to Mary C. Day, the remainder to be divided equally among the other children except to Arthur and Harry Forty Dollars each more than the others in lieu of two gold watches which Clinton and Howard are to have. This division is no way or manner to interfere with the legal collection of such notes as I hold against this estate.\u201d\nAt the date of the will Henry S. Day had five children, another child was born before the death of the testator, and two have been born since. The agreement of sale was executed by Henry S. Day and his five children who were living at the date of the will. It was held by the learned judge of the common pleas that the intention of the testator was that the remainder of the estate should be divided among the children of his son, Henry S. Day, who were living at the death of his son. In this conclusion we concur.\nThe words \u201cat his death\u201d refer to the death of Henry S. Day and not to the death of the testator, and fix the time for division. The words \u201cliving children\u201d and \u201cother children\u201d are descriptive of the persons who are then to take; until the time for distribution is reached, the persons entitled to shares cannot be ascertained.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
