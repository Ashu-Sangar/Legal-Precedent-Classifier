The purpose of pleading is to form a clear and distinct issue for the trial of the cause between the parties. The statement should be sufficiently explicit to enable the defendant to prepare his defense. A plaintiff cannot file a statement which avers one cause of action, and be permitted, on the trial, to prove a different cause of action. He must state the claim on which he will rely to recover so clearly and concisely that the defendant may be fully advised as to what he is called upon to meet.</p>

In an action of assumpsit by a bank, as payee, against a corporation, brought to recover on a contract guaranteeing the payment of a promissory note for $5,000, dated February 10, 1903, where the declaration avers that the money for which the note in suit was given was borrowed by the maker on February 10,1903, and that it was borrowed for the defendant company and was the consideration for the alleged guarantee, the plaintiff is not entitled, under the pleadings, to the admission of testimony offered to prove that the note in evidence was a renewal of another note of like amount between the same parties, dated May 1, 1900, on which the maker received the money which was passed to his credit on the books of the bank; that the plaintiff bank loaned the maker $5,000 on May 1, 1900, for which he gave it his note of that date and deposited with the bank certain collateral and that said loan was made for the benefit of the defendant company; that on May 4, 1900, the maker drew his check for $5,000 to the defendant’s order; that the note was renewed from time to time until February 10, 1903, when the maker made a new note to the plaintiff bank for $5,000, and withdrew a part of the collateral which he deposited with the original note and which had remained with the bank as collateral during the time of renewal and the defendant, in order to enable him to withdraw the collateral and in consideration of having received the $5,000 on May 4, 1900, made the contract on which the suit was brought.</p>

Since in such case it is manifest that if, as alleged in the offers, the loan was obtained for the defendant’s benefit, it was procured by the maker individually from the bank; and that if the defendant borrowed the $5,000 obtained by the maker from the bank it was borrowed from the maker and not from the bank and that the loan could not have been procured on the faith of, or by virtue of, the contract of <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>guarantee since the guarantee was not then in existence, and since it could not be successfully contended that the defendant received any benefit in 1903 by reason of the guarantee for the reason that the forbearance or extension of time given the maker by the renewal of his note in that year and the exchange of the collaterals were of no benefit to the defendant company, it not being liable to the plaintiff for the loan, it follows that even if the offers of evidence were admitted there could be no recovery and, therefore, a nonsuit entered by the court below will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>

The plaintiff made no offer to amend but insisted on trying its case on the statement as filed. Notwithstanding the looseness of pleading which exists at present, the plaintiff is still required to file a declaration of his cause of action which “shall consist of a concise statement of the plaintiff’s demand.” When the defendant is brought into court to answer a claim made against him, he is entitled to know the plaintiff’s cause of action that he may be prepared to meet it. The purpose of pleading is to form a clear and distinct issue for the trial of the cause between the parties. The statement should be sufficiently explicit to enable the defendant to prepare his defense. A plaintiff cannot file a statement which avers one cause of action, and be permitted, on the trial, to prove a different cause of action. He must state the claim on which he will rely to recover so clearly and concisely that the defendant may be fully advised as to what he is called upon to meet.</p>

These averments would not be sustained by the testimony contained in the offers, the exclusion of which is complained of in the assignments of error. There is no allegation in the statement that the note in suit was the renewal of a note given in 1900 or that the money for which the original note was given was borrowed at that <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>time; nor is there any allegation that the money borrowed in 1900 was paid to the defendant and was the consideration for the guarantee sued on or that on May 4, 1900, Burchinal paid to the defendant company $5,000 in consideration of which it made the contract on which the suit was brought. These were the several matters which the plaintiff proposed to prove in support of its cause of action. None of the alleged facts were averred in the statement; on the contrary, the statement distinctly avers that the money was borrowed on Feb. 10, 1903, and that the guarantee in suit was given “at the time of borrowing the said money and making the loan of $5,000 to the said C. H. Burchinal.” If the matters alleged were material to the plaintiff’s recovery, it goes without saying that they should have been averred in the statement, and if not so averred could not be proved on the trial of the cause. Prior to the offers of evidence, the defendant company had no notice of the several matters offered to be proven, and hence was not prepared to meet such proof. It had notice, by the statement, that the plaintiff’s claim rested upon the guarantee of a promissory note, dated February 10, 1903, for money borrowed that day and received by it at that time, and was prepared to defend against such claim; but it had no notice or knowledge, of what the plaintiff proposed to prove on the trial, viz.: that Burchinal had borrowed $5,000 in 1900, had given his note for it, and that the defendant had received that money as a consideration for the guarantee sued on. To admit the proof offered under the pleadings in this case would be in effect to abolish pleading and to permit parties to make proof of matters foreign to the cause of action declared on in their statement. The learned court was right in excluding the plaintiff’s offers under the pleadings in the case.</p>

It is conceded by the plaintiff bank that there was no course of dealing by which the bank was justified in assuming that the Burchi<a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>nals were authorized to execute the guarantee. In order to sustain an action on the guarantee, the plaintiff is therefore driven to the position that the defendant company received the benefit of the loan obtained by the unauthorized act of its officers. But the benefit of the loan must have been received by the defendant by reason of the unauthorized action of the company’s officers in executing the guarantee and as part of that transaction. If the corporation received the proceeds or benefit of the officers’ unauthorized act, under such circumstances, it is estopped from setting up their want of authority and is liable on the contract. A corporation will not be permitted to accept and retain the benefits of its officer’s unauthorized contract, made in its name, and repudiate his authority to make the agreement. Common honesty does not tolerate such indefensible conduct in an individual or a corporation. But where one seeks to charge a corporation on this ground by reason of its officers’ unauthorized act, the burden is upon him to show that the corporation received and retained the benefit of the act. The offers, the exclusion of which are complained of in the present case, did not go so far. The plaintiff bank did not offer to show that the loan was made in 1900 for the benefit of the company on the faith of the guarantee executed by its officers. The facts set up in the several offers of testimony contradict any such conclusion. The contract or guarantee was not made until February, 1903, nearly three years after the loan was procured. The offers show that the money was loaned in 1900 to Burchinal on his individual note, and that three days thereafter he drew and delivered to the defendant his individual check for a like amount. If it be admitted that the loan was procured by Burchinal in 1900 for the defendant’s benefit, it imposed no liability under the circumstances on the defendant to repay it to the plaintiff bank. It created no contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. The loan could not have been, and was not, made on the faith of the guarantee contract, the sub<a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>jeet of this action, which was indispensably necessary to create á liability on the part of the defendant, as at that time and for nearly three years thereafter the contract had no existence. Conceding therefore, as alleged in the offers, that the loan was obtained for the defendant company’s benefit and that it received the money in 1900, it could not have been procured on the faith of or by virtue of the contract of guarantee, but must have been obtained from the bank solely on Burchinal’s individual note and the collateral he deposited with the note. The fact, absolutely essential to a recovery in this action, viz.: the existence of the guarantee at the time the loan was made and the benefit was received by the company, was concededly wanting, and in none of the plaintiff’s offers did the bank propose to show it. It is manifest that if, in 1900, the loan was made for the defendant’s benefit, it was procured by Burchinal individually from the bank; and that if the defendant borrowed the $5,000 obtained by Burchinal from the bank it was borrowed from Burchinal and not from the bank.</p>
    <p id="b461-3" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[201,1425,1158,961]],["BL_462.1",462,[278,328,1149,264]]]'>It cannot be successfully contended that the defendant received any benefit in 1903 by reason of the guarantee. The forbearance or extension of time given Burchinal by the renewal of his note in that year and the exchange of collateral were of no benefit to the defendant company. The renewal of the note was a benefit to Burchinal, but it was a matter of perfect indifference to the defendant company as it was not liable to the plaintiff for the loan. The benefit to the guarantor which binds him in such cases is one which arises out of the officers’ unauthorized transaction, and, as suggested, no benefit came to the defendant by Burchinal’s unauthorized act in signing the company’s name to the guarantee of the renewal note in 1903. The company had not guaranteed the note of May 1,1900, nor was it interested in any of the collaterals delivered by Burchinal to the bank to secure the original loan. It was therefore immaterial to the defendant whether or not the loan procured by Burchinal in 1900 <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>was repaid to the bank. It follows that if the offers of evidence made by the plaintiff bank had been admitted, the evidence already in not being sufficient, there could have been no recovery, and, for this reason, the nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

The rule provides that when error is assigned to the rejection of evidence the specification must give a reference to the page of the paper-book or appendix where the offer and rejection of the evidence may be found; and that an assignment not according to the rule will be disregarded. There is no reference to the pages of the appendix where these several offers of evidence are to be found, and we were compelled to search the entire appendix to find them. We have repeatedly pointed out the necessity for the observance of this rule, and had our attention been called to the matter at the argument we would have been compelled to enforce the rule.
