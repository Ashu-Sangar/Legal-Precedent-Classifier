L. 53, “Relieving members of beneficial societies from individual liability for lodge indebtedness,” when it provides that “members shall not be individually liable for the payment of periodical or funeral benefits or other liabilities of the association, and the same shall be payable out of the treasury,” by the words “other liabilities,” means all liabilities properly chargeable to the treasury of the society, and contemplates obligations in addition to funeral expenses or death benefits: Pain et al. v.

If the defendant association were liable for appropriating the property of the plaintiffs to its own use, its treasury and not the funds of the individual members would have to respond in damages. But it is clear on the facts in this case that there was no such liability. When the forfeiture of the charter was declared the state council of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics did not take over the property of the defendant council, .and the reissue of the charter to the plaintiffs, after a lapse of more than six years, would not serve to vest in them, or in the lodge organized by them, the property in question; nor would it give them any peculiar right of possession therein. The plaintiffs had no right of possession other than the joint right which they enjoyed in common with the other members of the defendant council, and their secession •therefrom would not divest its property: State Council Junior Order of United American Mechanics v.

The laws of the order to which that society belongs ordain that the trustees of a local lodge shall “take charge of and hold all the property of the Council not otherwise provided for.” This evidently contemplates more than a mere passive trust. “In cases of unincorporated associations .... suits may be brought by some of the members in their own names on behalf of and as representing all:” Liederkranz Singing Society v.
