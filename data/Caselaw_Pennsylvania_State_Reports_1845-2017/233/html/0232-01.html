    <p id="b263-9" data-blocks='[["BL_263.16",263,[186,1230,1151,908]]]'>This appeal is from an order dismissing a petition for a mandamus to require the defendant’s officers to permit the relator to examine the books and records of the corporation defendant that contain the names and addresses of its stockholders. A mandamus was refused and the petition dismissed for the reason that the matter of complaint related to the internal management of a foreign corporation and the dispute was between a stockholder and the corporation. That the court was without jurisdiction is clearly settled by our decisions. In Madden v. Electric Light Co., <a href="/pa/181/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="181 Pa. 617" data-case-ids="891373" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0617-01">181 Pa. 617</a>, it was held that a Pennsylvania court will not entertain a stockholder’s bill against a foreign corporation when the matter complained of relates to the internal management of the company. This ruling has since been approved and followed in Madden v. Electric Light Co., <a href="/pa/199/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="199 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="922768" data-case-paths="/pa/199/0454-01">199 Pa. 454</a>, and McCloskey v. Snowden, <a href="/pa/212/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="212 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="941824" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0249-01">212 Pa. 249</a>.</p>
    <p id="b263-10" data-blocks='[["BL_263.17",263,[233,2147,995,43]]]'>The order is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.</p>
