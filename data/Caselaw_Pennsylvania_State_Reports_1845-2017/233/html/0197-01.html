We find that the Act of May 23, 1893, P. L. 113, sec. 3, provides in relation to the duties of chief burgess, as follows: “May veto Ordinances, etc. Every Ordinance and Resolution which shall be passed by said Council shall be presented to the Chief Burgess of such Borough. If he approve, he shall sign it, but if he shall not approve, he shall return it to said Council at the next regular meeting thereof, when said, objection shall be entered at large in the minute book, Council shall proceed to a re-consideration of such Ordinance or Resolution. If after such re-consideration, two-thirds of all the members elected to said Council, shall vote to pass such Ordinance or Resolution, it shall become and be of full force and effect, as if said Burgess had signed it.” Third. This act of May 23, 1893, we think applies to the matter now in consideration. Two-thirds of the members elect did vote to pass the ordinance over the burgess veto. This being so, it became “ of as full force and effect as if the said Chief Burgess had signed it.” To give to the burgess the power contended for the plaintiff, would make him a veritable Czar. He could prevent a street being vacated by ordinance, even if every member of coun<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>cil were in favor of such vacation. We will not adopt such a construction of the act of assembly unless driven to do so by words so unequivocal as to leave no doubt as to their meaning. But as we have said before, we think the act allowing the vacation of streets must be read in connection with said act of 1893, giving the councils a right to override the veto of the burgess, said two acts being in pari materia.</p>

The councils of Hollidaysburg certainly would have been estopped. It was their duty, or the duty of their proper officers to see that this ordinance was properly advertised. They accepted from the Pennsylvania Railroad Company the fruits produced by the ordinance. The railroad company did just what it agreed to do — put up an overhead bridge at Jones street, at a large expense of money, and paid the borough the $10,000 provided for in the ordinance in question. It would be grossly inequitable after the borough had received the benefit produced by the ordinance to allow the council to repudiate, and does not the same rule as to estoppel prevail as to Mr. Condron? He knew of the ordinance of August 28, 1905, and its passage, because he was present when it was finally enacted and voted nay. He could not fail to see the railroad company erecting the overhead bridge at Jones street. Under such circumstances is he not estopped from now coming in and claiming the aid of a court of equity? Should he not have moved more promptly if he desired to take advantage of technicalities in regard to the passage of said ordinance of August 28,1905?</p>

The case was then heard again before Judge Reed presiding specially, who entered a final decree, in which he overruled the exceptions to the findings of fact and conclusions of law, and dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill. As the case is now presented, it appears that the specifications of error are defective, in that the final decree of the court below is not assigned for error. Such an assignment is requisite: Clymer v. Roberts, <a href="/pa/220/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="220 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="1005838" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0162-01">220 Pa. 162</a>; Kenworthy v.

As we havé already held that this order was not a final decree, to which an appeal would lie, it is not therefore properly to be made the subject of an assignment of error.

    <p id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[193,1028,1150,905]]]'>The only question here involved is as to the right of the plaintiff under the circumstances to claim the benefit of a remedy which is solely equitable in its nature. The court below was of opinion that the plaintiff by his conduct, had precluded himself from applying for relief through equity. Judge Reed says, “The plaintiff stood by and saw the defendant expend $50,000 on the faith of the original ordinance in question, and he cannot now be heard to question its validity. He was a member of the body that enacted it, and the somewhat technical objection which he now raises to strike it down was as well known to him before the defendant had spent a dollar on the faith of the ordinance as it was at the time he filed this bill. He was silent then and the law will not permit him. to speak now. In these circumstances the plaintiff’s complaint does not come within the province of equitable relief.”</p>

The court below, probably through inadvertence, spoke of plaintiff as being estopped. But the doctrine of estoppel can hardly apply here, for the reason that the <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>defendant company had the same opportunity to know the facts with regard to the passage of the ordinance as the plaintiff had. It was not deceived in that respect. In Woods v. Wilson, <a href="/pa/37/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="37 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="418930" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0379-01">37 Pa. 379</a>, Mr. Justice Thompson said (p. 384) that the law of estoppel operates “only in favor of those who, after the exercise of diligence, are still ignorant of an opposing title, and against those who, aware of their own title and knowing it to be secret, are silent. When both parties are aware of their respective rights, it has no place in law or equity.” But the inexcusable delay of the plaintiff, in asserting his rights, is another matter, and the consequent injury and prejudice to the defendant company, in permitting it to expend large sums in reliance upon its contract with the borough council, may well be held to bar his right to recover in a court of equity.</p>

This form of quasi estoppel does not cut off the party’s title, nor his remedy at law; it simply bars his right to equitable relief, and leaves him to his legal actions alone. . . . The equitable remedy to which this quasi estoppel by acquiescence most frequently applies is that of injunction, preliminary or final, when sought by a proprietor to restrain a defendant from interference with easements, from committing nuisances, from trespasses, or other like acts in derogation of the plaintiff’s proprietary rights.” In 1 High on Injunctions (4th ed., 1905), sec. 643, it is said, “As in all cases of the exercise of the strong arm of equity by injunction, the right to the relief may be lost by one’s own negligence and delay in seeking protection.” As an instance of the application of the rule, the author says (sec. 618): “Where a property owner, who seeks to enjoin a railway company from using its tracks upon a <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>street in front of his premises, has permitted the company to expend large sums of money in the construction of its track, and has acquiesced in their use for a considerable number of years without objection or complaint, such acquiescence will deprive him of relief by injunction regardless of what his original equities may have been.”</p>

    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[223,1209,1150,477]]]'>In the present case there can be no question but that the interest and safety of the public require that such a dangerous grade crossing over so many tracks, should be abolished. As Mr. Justice Dean said in Penna. R. R. Co. v. Bogert, <a href="/pa/209/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="209 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="936226" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0589-01">209 Pa. 589</a> (p. 598): “The policy of the commonwealth and this court with reference to grade crossings has been frequently and in no unc'ertain terms ahnounced. It is, that the murderous grade crossing must go.”</p>
    <p id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.6",235,[224,1694,1150,261]]]'>Under the well-established principles of equity jurisprudence, as above noted, we think the court below was justified in refusing an injunction and in leaving appellant to his remedy at law. The assignments of error are all dismissed, and the decree of the court below is affirmed.</p>
