In other words, that the burden was upon the plaintiff to establish by the preponderance of the evidence that the foreman, or boss, or other person who directed him to clean the machine at the time of the accident, was a vice principal. This is clearly an erro<a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>neous view of the situation. No question relating to the duties or authority of a vice principal was involved in this case. The evidence is ample to show that appellant was employed as a laborer in and around the mill and was engaged in the performance of duties assigned to him when the injuries were sustained. The testimony also shows that a foreman, called by appellant “the boss,” directed him to clean the drill press. It is also in evidence that he had been employed as a common laborer in and around the mill for several months prior to the time of the accident. Under the facts thus established there can be no question as to the existence of the relation of employer and employee. In order to entitle appellant to recover under the facts of the present case, it is not necessary to show that he was employed by a vice principal, or that he was assigned to clean the drill press by a vice principal. It is sufficient to show that he was regularly employed to do work in and about the mill and that he was engaged at work assigned to him by a person in authority over him, not necessarily a vice principal, at the time he sustained the injuries about which complaint is made.</p>

That the appellee company had failed in the performance of this statutory duty seems to be conceded, at least the question of negligence was for the jury.</p>

This question was not raised at the trial by either party and was only adverted to in the opinion overruling the motion for a new trial. We do no't agree that as shown by the facts appellant was so clearly guilty of contributory negligence as to warrant the court in so declaring as a matter of law. It was for the jury to say, taking into consideration all the facts and cir<a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>cumstances, whether appellant had exercised due care.
