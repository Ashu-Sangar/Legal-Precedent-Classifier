After the decedent’s death the accountant changed the name of the firm, striking out “and company,” and leaving the business in his own name. He so carried the bank accounts and transacted the business until after June 1, 1909, when he took in his son as a partner, obtained a new contract similar to the former one, and operated the business under the firm name of T.

Under date of July 2, 1909, he caused an appraisement to be filed in the register’s office of the estate of decedent which came into his hands, wherein it appears that the decedent’s half in the firm of T. D. Maloney &amp; Company was appraised as to capital in the sum of $2,000, and as to other assets consisting of horses, wagons and other general partnership assets, at $412.05. He mingled the assets of this partnership business after the death of his partner with his own, keeping all bank accounts in his own name.
