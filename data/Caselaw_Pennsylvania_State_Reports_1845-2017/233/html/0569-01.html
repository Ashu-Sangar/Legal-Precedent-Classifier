For a period covering nearly eight years, the Manufacturers’ Company had entered into a number of contracts with the People’s Company, mutually beneficial, whereby the People’s Company by expending a large amount of money in the purchasing and installing of a pump station, regulators, meters and other fixtures, and by purchasing pipe and laying the same to the wells of the Manufacturers’ Company, had increased its (People’s Company) supply of gas by about 1,000,000 feet per day. Along comes the defendant, the American Natural Gas Company. It examines these contracts, and finds that they are in force, and that a legal duty rests upon the Manufacturers’ Company to continue to furnish the gas to the People’s Company. They also find that the agreement of December 31, 1904, “shall extend to and be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Manufacturers’ Natural Gas Company.” If the American Company bought with the understanding that they would carry out the contract of the Manufacturers’ Company, they are bound to do so. However, if they bought substantially all the property of the Manufacturers’ Company as a subterfuge to allow it to escape from the fulfillment of its contract, then it would be a fraud upon the rights of the People’s Company, for which in our opinion, a court in equity has the power to prevent.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b609-3" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[212,642,1150,1285]]]'>So if we apply the law as heretofore stated, the American Company is liable in equity to the same extent and in the same manner as the Manufacturers’ Company, its conscience is equally bound with that of its vendor, and the American Company only acquired what the Manufacturers’ Company could honestly transfer. It cannot be doubted that the Manufacturers’ Company could not honestly dispose of its property, for the purpose of defrauding the People’s Company out of the fruits of its contracts, to obtain which it had expended a large amount of money. And I am of the opinion that the testimony leads to the conclusion that such was its intention when it entered into the contract with the American Company. What the purpose of the American Company was in making the contract on their part, we cannot tell. If their purpose was an honest one, then they should carry out the covenants and stipulations that their vendor had made, and of which they had notice prior to the payment of the purchase money. If their purpose was dishonest, and they were acting in concert with the Manufacturers’ Company to defraud the People’s Company out of its rights, by placing the property of the Manufacturers’ Company out of reach, then a court of equity will step in and use its strong arm to prevent the perpetration of such fraud.</p>
