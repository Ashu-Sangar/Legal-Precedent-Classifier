McIntosh. This farm was originally owned by their mother, Rose McIntosh, who died intestate May 15, 1888, leaving to survive her a husband, Kenneth McIntosh, the above-named two children, and a daughter Lizzie. At the time of the mother’s death and during the period of the other facts here involved, the father lived on the farm with Edward and Addie, but the daughter Lizzie resided in New York state. Prior to the acquisition of this property by Rose McIntosh the land had been developed for oil and.gas, but the operation had been abandoned at the time of her death.</p>

Seibert for twenty acres of said farm at a one-eighth royalty; it was in the usual form, and was to run for fifteen years and as long thereafter as oil and gas should be produced in paying quantities. ' None of the children joined in the execution of this lease, but they were all of full age at that time. The lessee went upon the land and drilled two unproductive wells, and in November, 1896, when about to abandon the property, he assigned all his interests to Daniel Dierkin and Valentine Whitener for a consideration of $1,200. They,‘ ‘ as the result of the expenditure of a considerable sum of money” managed to make the wells “fair producers.” On March 19, 1898, Whitener sold his interest to Dierkin for $3,000, and the latter retained possession until July, 1907, at which time he assigned the lease to W. H. Ropp for $4,000. Ropp con<a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>tinued to operate the two wells until April 5, 1909, when he sold to C. E.

On the same day they executed a division order to the company through whose lines the oil was run, and thereafter the royalty was paid to them in equal proportions. Before that date the royalty had been paid to Kenneth McIntosh, with the knowledge of his two children, many of the payments having been made directly to Edward.</p>

However, the present action cannot prevail, because it being joint, and there being sufficient facts established to estop Edward, the right to a joint recovery being thus defeated, this action must fall.” Addie then instituted the following actions: April 20, 1909, proceeding in equity against Ropp praying for an accounting for her share of the oil, exclusive of the royalty, from July, 1907, to April, 1909; June 10, 1909, action of trespass against Dierkin to recover damages because of his operations from March 18, 1898, to July 1, 1907; January 13, 1910, action of ejectment against Blaney to recover the land and mesne profits; February 14,1910, action of trespass against Blaney to recover <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>damages because of his operations from April 5,1909, to January 8, 1910; and these are the cases before us on appeal.</p>

The Act of April 22,1874, P.

Every such case taken to the Supreme Court .... shall be heard and determined therein as cases of appeal in equity proceedings. . . .” The scheme of this act is in practical accord with established equity practice, and in cases tried thereunder all specifications of error must be to the final rulings of the court below. Where, as in the present case, exceptions have been taken to the findings and conclusions of the trial court, the assignments should in each instance show that fact and the ruling upon the exception. We have expressly so decided in equity cases: New Cumberland Borough v. Riverton Cons.

The practical effect of this estoppel, so far as these defendants are concerned, was to put Edward McIntosh in the position of a party to the lease; and when his father died and he became entitled to the full enjoyment of his estate, that circumstance merely served to feed the estoppel and strengthen the right to treat the lease as though executed by him. In addition, we have the express agreement upon the record that “Edward McIntosh, the owner of the undivided one-half of the title in remainder, ratified the lease made by the life-tenant and the lessee was in possession under him as well as under the life-tenant.”</p>

The fact that the actual operations were carried on by third parties under a lease, and not directly by Edward McIntosh, would not serve to make the defendants trespassers, or to cause them to be regarded other than as cotenants: McGowan v.

In every case of this character the measure of damage must depend largely upon the peculiar circumstances, but compensation is the usual rule where there are no facts showing intentional wrong; and as between tenants in common such compensation may be measured by the fair market value of the mineral in place, which may be figured on the basis of the royalty to be obtained for the privilege of removing such mineral, in view of all the circumstances: Forsyth v.

The tenant out of possession incurs none of the risk or expense, when the mining operations are conducted exclusively by the tenant who is in possession. Nevertheless, he is entitled to be compensated for the appropriation by his cotenant in possession for his proportion of the mineral taken by the latter. . . . Where the mineral land has never been devel<a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>oped .... the fair market value of the mineral in place, which would be the value of the privilege of removing it, in view of its special circumstances, would represent the true measure of compensation to the owner. So, too, if the land were fully developed .... and all the expenses incurred which would enable the operator to proceed at once to the taking of the mineral, the value of the mineral in place, ready to be taken, would be enhanced by these considerations, and the price of the privilege of taking it in such circumstances would also represent the measure of the compensation.” The case just cited distinguishes several of the authorities relied upon by the appellant to support her contention as to the proper measure of damage, and we feel that, on reason, the rule there laid down should be adopted in the present case; for, owing to the fugacious nature of oil and gas, and their liability to be diverted by operations upon adjoining and near-by lands, it is peculiarly necessary that cotenants should not be unduly restricted in the enjoyment of such properties.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[322,1416,1150,689]]]'>The case of Williamson v. Jones, <a href="/w-va/43/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="43 W. Va. 562" data-case-ids="8639499" data-case-paths="/w-va/43/0562-01">43 W. Va. 562</a>, cited to us by the appellant, largely rests upon statutory provisions. Crawford v. Forest Oil Co., <a href="/pa/208/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="208 Pa. 5" data-case-ids="998125" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0005-01">208 Pa. 5</a>, is readily distinguishable; there the lessee knew that the lessor had but a life estate and “that the plaintiffs did not recognize the lease . .'. . as binding on them after his death;” the defendant purchased with like knowledge, after the death of the life tenant, and entered the land knowing that it was about to deprive the plaintiffs of their rights. There was no evidence as to a proper royalty to be paid; the rule prevailing between tenants in common had no application, and the measure of damage was adopted which best applied to the special facts in that case.</p>
