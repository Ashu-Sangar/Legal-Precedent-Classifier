L. 344, sec. 1, provides that “Hereafter a married woman shall have the‘same right and power as an unmarried person to acquire, own, possess, control, use, lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of any property of any kind, real, personal or mixed and either in possession or expectancy, and may exercise the said right and power in the same manner and to the same extent as an unmarried person, but she may not mortgage <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>or convey her real estate, unless her husband join in such mortgage or conveyance.” The same provisions in substance are found in the Act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332. Under these acts, however, she could not make a valid conveyance although her husband was joined therein, unless it were separately acknowledged by her, as required by the Act of February 24, 1770, 1 Sm. L. 307: Bingler v. Bowman, <a href="/pa/194/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="194 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="912471" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0210-01">194 Pa. 210</a>. However, by the Act of April 4, 1901, P. L. 67, the acknowledgment of a married woman may be, “In the same manner and form as though said married woman were feme sole; said acknowledgment to have the same force and effect as if taken separate and apart from the husband of said married woman.” Any contract made by a married woman touching her real estate in which her husband joins is good without acknowledgment, providing it is not a mortgage or conveyance of the property: McCoy v. Niblick, <a href="/pa/221/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="221 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="956191" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0123-01">221 Pa. 123</a>. In the discussion of this case in the former opinion, to which the pending exceptions were filed, we held that a married woman may elect to reconvert, but to have this effect by implication growing out of acts in pais, those acts must be performed with the same formalities requisite to convey her separate estate, in support of which conclusion we cited 2 American and English Decisions in Equity,. p. 96, and cases there referred to. We are not convinced that this conclusion was error, although in the absence of the authority quoted and the trend of judicial decision, as evidenced in the cases referred to, we would be inclined to hold that a married woman could elect to reconvert by receiving the proceeds of real estate, especially when the proceeds so received were essentially a part of the corpus of the land, as in the case of the receipt of a royalty interest from oil. In the light, however, of the authorities to which we have referred, we would not seem to be justified in so holding. The reason for the rule laid down is possibly to be found in the fact that where an election is predicated upon an act which is essentially a sale of the real estate, which is the case where an oil lease has been given, that <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>act can only be evidenced by performance in the statutory way on the part of a married woman. The question remains, however, whether, in the light of the enabling statutes, before referred to, any of the acts on which plaintiffs seek to predicate a reconversion come within the rule as above held. An election to reconvert may arise by implication out of the acts of the parties and it is necessary that all should elect. It is not necessary, however, that all should elect at the same time, or in the same way, the question being, whether all have at some time and in some way, either expressly or by implication, elected to take the land as such, instead of the proceeds thereof.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b517-3" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[178,990,1153,1283]]]'>As to the eight sons of the decedent, C. A. McKinney, there can be no doubt, we think, that their execution of leases of the land for oil and gas purposes, reserving a royalty to themselves, and the receipt of such royalty in kind for a period of years pursuant to division orders signed by them, gave rise to an implied election to take the land as such. These leases were essentially a sale of the oil in place, they were dealing with the land as such. If, in addition to those, there was an election to take the land in its original character by the two daughters, Mrs. Harley and Mrs. Wahl, the reconversion would be complete. In the former opinion, we predicated the conclusion that no reconversion had taken place largely upon the fact that although Mrs. Wahl had joined with the others in the execution of leases of the land for oil purposes, had signed division orders and received her share of the proceeds of the oil, and although she and her husband had joined with all the other heirs in executing a right of way to the railway company and had acknowledged it, yet, there had been no separate acknowledgment by her, thus overlooking the fact that this is no longer necessary since the aforesaid act of 1901 was passed. In view of that enactment, it was not necessary that she should separately acknowledge it.</p>

It is a declaration by those signing it that it was not their intention in the execution of leases for oil and gas purposes, which had been or might be made, nor in the execution of any right of way for street car purposes or otherwise to convert the property into , land contrary to the intent of the will of their father, C. A. McKinney, deceased. Whatever effect this instrument might have on the act they were about to perform or which they might perform in the future touching the land, yet, we think it could not have the effect of changing the character of that which they had already done in years gone by so as to nullify an election already made by them or any of them and growing as a legal sequence and by implication of law out of their acts. In short, they could not, we think, by such a declaration undo the legal effect of their former acts. Its effect on the right of way then in contemplation is problematical.. Assuming that it would negative an implication of an election to reconvert on the part of those signing it, yet it would not have that effect in the case of those not joining in it, and although Mrs. Wahl is named in the body of the writing, yet, it is not signed by her and is not, therefore, a declaration of intention by her. Her execution of the right of way to the railway company stands unaffected by any declaration contained in the writing referred to and her execution of said right of way was, we think, an election in law to take the land as such. It was the conveyance of a right in or upon the land and growing out of the land and running with the land, and having in it the possibilities of duration beyond the time when conversion would take place under the will, and thus manifesting an intent on the part of those granting it to deal with the land as such beyond the time of that event. Such right of way could not be fastened on to a mere right to receive the proceeds of the sale of the land. As to Mrs. Wahl, therefore, we conclude that there was an election to reconvert when she, jointly with her husband, <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>executed and acknowledged such right of way, April 7, 1906.</p>

But, as we at that time concluded that there had been no election on the part of Mrs. Wahl, it did not seem necessary to pass on the question of an election by or on behalf of Mrs. Harley. It now becomes necessary to do so.</p>

McKinney, deceased, and is the owner of the undivided one-tenth interest in a tract of land containing eighty acres, “being the farm lately owned by her father and subject to her mother’s interest, as widow.” On the same day, the guardian presented his petition to the court setting forth that his ward was the owner of an undivided one-tenth interest in said eighty acres of land; that the widow and remaining heirs, all of age, had executed a lease of twenty-five acres of said land to I. G.

After hearing and argument on the exceptions so filed the original findings of fact and conclusions of law were modified, as set forth in the opinion filed March 22, 1909, in which opinion, also the interests of the parties, plaintiff and defendant, were found and stated and a decree in accordance therewith and setting forth said interests was duly made and filed October 2, 1909, in which decree, also, F. J. Forquer, Esq., was appointed master to divide and partition said real estate into purparts according to the shares and interests of the respective parties thereto if the same can be divided without prejudice to the interests of said parties respectively, or <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>without prejudice to or spoiling the whole; and to value the same and to ascertain the amount which shall be paid or charged thereon for owelty, or which shall be paid or secured to the parties to whom no purpart may or can be alloted in the manner now authorized by law under writs of partition. And if the master shall find that such partition can be made either of the whole of said real estate or any part thereof, then upon such valuation and partition, to award and allot the said purparts to and among the parties severally • and respectively entitled thereto, together with the sums to be charged thereon and payable as and for owelty of partition. And if the. master shall find that the said real estate cannot be conveniently divided into as many purparts as there are parties entitled, he shall award and allot the amount or sum to be paid or secured to them respectively and the times when such payments shall be made and the purparts out of which the same shall be payable, and if he shall find that the real estate or tenements cannot be divided without prejudice to or spoiling the whole then he shall value or appraise the same.” The master so appointed having duly qualified and gone upon the premises and having there met the parties, filed his report in court March 15, 1911, finding that the land described in the bill cannot be divided into purparts to accommodate all in interest without injury to or spoiling the whole and that he had appraised and valued the land described in the bill at $90.00 per acre, aggregating the sum of $6,379.20. On the report thus made the court on March 15, 1911, decreed as follows: “Now, March 15, 1911, the foregoing report of the master in equity in this case was presented in open court and on due consideration, his report of inquest and valuation thereof is now approved and confirmed and unless exceptions be filed thereto within ten days, the master is authorized to issue a citation upon all the parties in interest to appear before him, as master, to the end that the matter may be proceeded with according to law.” To the decree thus made the pending exceptions were <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>filed on part of some of the defendants on March 15, 1911.</p>

The exceptions do, however, raise, for the first time, the question that plaintiffs’ bill does not sufficiently aver the facts upon which a reconversion of the property is predicated. However this may be, the fact remains that the defendants did not raise this question as to the sufficiency of the averments of the bill in this respect until after the testimony was in, the facts found and decree made, and even if it were true that the averments in the bill were not sufficient, testimony was received of the facts upon which the plaintiffs sought to establish a reconversion, without any objection on part of defendants that the bill did not sufficiently aver the facts relied upon. We think it is now too late to raise the question, and that under the circumstances, if it were necessary to do so, the bill would even now be amendable so as to conform to the proofs in the case.</p>

The rule by which a parol sale cannot be effected by tenants in common, inter se, does not prevent them from making such sales to outside parties, but even this is not a question, as we take it, in the case under consideration. Upon the argument of the case, it was contended on part of the exceptants’ counsel that the proceedings have not been in conformity with the equity rules in such cases. We are not convinced, however, that there has been any irregularity in the record in this respect. On consideration therefore of the whole case, the exceptions are dismissed.</p>

    <p id="b525-7" data-blocks='[["BL_525.15",525,[150,2014,1149,311]]]'>We have carefully examined and considered the somewhat voluminous and complicated record in this case, and are of the opinion that the learned trial judge properly disposed of the case in his opinion of March 22, 1909, and subsequent opinions. The decree may well be affirmed on his opinions.</p>
    <p id="b525-8" data-blocks='[["BL_525.16",525,[196,2334,1103,46]],["BL_526.1",526,[327,317,1149,1445]]]'>The controlling question is whether the real estate of <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>the decedent which, by his will, had been converted into personalty, had been reconverted by the persons beneficially interested. The facts found by the chancellor, fully warranted by the evidence, justified him in finding that there had been a reconversion and that the beneficiaries had elected to hold the real estate as such. While the intention to reconvert must clearly and unmistakably appear, yet a direct election is not necessary. Any act or acts which disclose plainly an intention to hold the real estate as such is sufficient. It would be difficult to find in any other case acts of the parties which show more plainly an intention to reconvert real estate directed by a testator to be sold. The heirs and legatees, the parties beneficially interested, took control of the real estate in December, 1888, the year following the death of the testator, and leased the premises for oil purposes. Subsequently they leased for oil and gas purposes, and issued pipe-line division orders for oil procured from the leases. In April, 1906, all the interested parties made a deed, granting a right of way to a railway company across the premises. In these several acts they necessarily treated the property as real estate, and thereby clearly disclosed an election to reconvert it to real estate. The learned judge committed no error in holding that such acts on the part of the beneficiaries, covering a period of eighteen years after the death of the testator, were an election to hold the property as land and not as personalty.</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[328,1773,1149,366]]]'>The judgments entered against some of the parties after the election to reconvert bound their interest in the real estate, and the sales on the judgments passed the title of those parties to the purchasers. The learned judge correctly held that the reconversion dated from April 7,1906, and that judgments entered thereafter against the parties became a lien on the property.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[326,2148,1147,207]],["BL_527.1",527,[173,300,1146,422]]]'>There is no merit in the contention that the court below was without jurisdiction to entertain the bill for partition until the title of the parties had been determined in an action of ejectment. The question was recently before <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>this court, and it was there settled against the position of the present appellants: Cooley v.

There, as here, the question of reconversion depended upon evidence in writing disclosing the intention of the parties, and it was held that, it being a question for the court, a chancellor in a suit in equity could determine it as well as a judge sitting in a court of law trying an action of ejectment.</p>
    <p id="b527-3" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[170,734,1149,478]]]'>The question raised by the appellants as to the sufficiency of the averments in the bill must be ruled against them. The objection now made was not raised until after the testimony had been given before the chancellor, and the facts found and a decree made by him. The parties treated the bill as if it contained all the necessary averments, and produced testimony to sustain and defeat the issue thus made. It is now too late for the appellants to complain of the insufficiency of the pleadings.</p>
    <p id="b527-4" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[215,1219,455,36]]]'>The decree is affirmed.</p>
