Oil City, <a href="/pa/183/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="183 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="896095" data-case-paths="/pa/183/0611-01">183 Pa. 611</a>; and yet that is the standard of public duty which the defendant city attempts to set for the plaintiff company; and more than this, by designating what the latter must use as the latest and best safety brakes, the ordinance assumes to declare how the company shall perform this duty. In the absence of express authority conferring the power of enactment, a penal ordinance such as the present, which undertakes to enforce a higher standard than that imposed by the principles of the common law, should not be sustained; if a new and different one is to be set, the legislature should act. Aside from the strictly legal aspect, it is apparent <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>that if such minute regulation is to be attempted at all, it is far better that the matter shall be under state control; for if each municipal subdivision be permitted to prescribe the particular Mnd of safety brakes to be used by. cars passing through its territory, since there is no guarantee that the judgment of the different authorities will accord, the important development of connecting trolley lines as competitors of the railroads, which has added so much to the comfort and convenience of the traveling public, will be seriously handicapped if not practically brought to a standstill.</p>

In The Pennsylvania Railroad Company’s case, <a href="/pa/213/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="213 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="943389" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0373-01">213 Pa. 373</a>, this court squarely ruled against the validity of an ordinance of the character of the one under consideration. We there said, “The question raised on this appeal is as to the power of the borough .... to pass an ordinance .... requiring the Pennsylvania Railroad to erect, maintain and operate safety gates. ... A penalty is provided for a failure to comply with the requirements. ... In the operation of its road and in the running of its cars the judgment of the board of directors of a railroad company, in the absence of statutory provision, is supreme and exclusive. The public safety imperatively requires that thére be ho division of this great responsibility with others — not even with municipalities .... for division of it would be the shifting of it in every case of accountability for failure to properly operate the road or run the cars. But, while this is true, corresponding duties of the highest order are imposed exclusively upon those having the control and management of railroads. One of these is to adopt and use suitable and adequate means to give notice of approaching trains. . . . What particular means, however, shall be employed to protect the public .... is left to the company operating the road, the law merely <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>demanding and requiring reasonable care. . . . What is attempted by the appellee in the present case? Having no voice in the operation of the appellant’s road, it undertakes to do what the common law itself does not do. It assumes to declare how the railroad shall perform a public duty .... and would substitute its judgment for that of the board of directors as to what kind of protection shall be afforded but with no corresponding responsibility resting upon it. . . . If it. has the power to require the defendant to erect safety gates, it has the power to require the adoption from time to time of such other means as in its judgment ought to be adopted by the company for the protection of the public. . . . The power for which it contends would be practically unlimited. . . . The power which it would exercise may be a desirable one, but courts cannot recognize it unless it exists. ...” After distinguishing the cases relied upon to support the municipal authority to pass the ordinance and determining that the general welfare clause was not a sufficient warrant for that purpose, we ruled that the borough had no such express or implied power and declared its action void. On principle that case governs the present one.</p>
