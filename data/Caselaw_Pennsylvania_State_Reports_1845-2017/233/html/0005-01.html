As súeh it is his sole duty to hold and administer for the benefit of its stockholders and creditors any property or rights of action that belong to that corporation. He has authority to assert in appropriate proceedings whatever rights of action the corporation had or has against its directors or officers, who are the defendants herein. In the bill before us, however, there is no averment that any act or omission of those of the defendants who demur caused loss or injury to the Keystone Bonding Company. No claim is asserted against them on behalf <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>of the corporation. If the defendants published statements which they knew, or ought to have known, to be false, with the result that their company gained a fictitious credit at the expense of those thus encouraged to do business with it, the wrong was suffered by the latter, and not by the corporation, and gave rise to no liability on the part of the defendants that the corporation or its receiver can enforce. Each person deceived by the statements referred to in the bill, or involved in loss through being induced to deal with a corporation which may have failed to comply with the requirements of the corporation laws, sustained an injury entirely distinct from that suffered by every one else in other transactions. Those deceived by the false statements referred to in the bill have no joint action against even such of the defendants as may have been involved in the frauds perpetrated upon them, and they cannot combine their claims against the defendants in the hands of a trustee, and enforce them in the same proceeding, either in law or in equity. The receiver, who figures as the plaintiff in this case, was not appointed by the court to act as the representative of a syndicate composed of all those who, by reason of false representations made or authorized or negligently permitted by the company’s directors, or some of them, sustained losses, and he has no standing in equity to maintain a bill against the latter as partners to enforce, as a collective liability, all claims for damages in respect of the separate and distinct wrongs which the several parties, who have had dealings with the corporation, have sustained.</p>

Prior to the enactment of the national bankrupt law and insolvency act of Pennsylvania, the preference of one of its creditors by an insolvent corporation, provided there was no fraud in the contracting of the debt, <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>or in the transfer of the company’s assets in payment of it, was entirely lawful, and did not create a liability on the part of the corporation’s directors to answer to it as for a breach of trust. While the legislation referred to has declared that, under certain conditions any preference given by an insolvent corporation shall enure to the benefit of all its creditors generally, it imposes no new liability upon the directors or officers concerned in the preferential disposition of the corporate assets.</p>
