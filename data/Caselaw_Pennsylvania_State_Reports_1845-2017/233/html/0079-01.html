In its report for the year 1907, the company stated that $215,000 of its bonds were held during all the year 1907 in New York as collateral security for loans made by persons or corporations of the state of New York to individual residents of Pennsylvania. The coupons were paid for the year 1907, at the company’s office in Buffalo, New York.</p>

It is contended by the defendant that these bonds are not taxable in this state under the Act of June 8, 1891, P. L. 229, which imposes a tax of four mills upon the nominal value of all bonds “owned, held or possessed.” by residents of the state, and that it is not therefore liable <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>for the tax under sec. 4 of the Act of June 30, 1885, P. L. 193, for having failed to deduct it as directed by that act when it paid the interest on the bonds. The single question presented, as stated in the defendant’s written brief, is: “Are the bonds held in New York as collateral owned, held or possessed by any person resident, located or liable to taxation within this commonwealth?” The defendant claims that as the bonds were transferred and delivered as collateral security to residents of the state of New York, and there held during the year for which the tax is here charged, they were not owned by residents of this state. We are referred to numerous authorities in which are discussed the relative rights of the parties to a pledge or to the transfer of personal property for the purpose of collateral security and also to the definition of lexicographers of the word “ owner.” The authorities cited, however, can give us but little aid in determining the meaning of the word “owned” in the present instance. The question here is: How is it to be interpreted in the statute? So far as we are advised, as so used it has received no judicial interpretation. It is a familiar doctrine that statutes are presumed to use words in their popular sense, and that as between two meanings of a word the ordinary or popular meaning is to be preferred. If the word “ owned ” be interpreted in the sense in which it is commonly understood and used or even in its technical sense, can there be any doubt as to the ownership of the bonds in question? It is difficult to speak of the relation of the residents of this state to the bonds except as that of owners. It is true that the persons to whom they were pledged had a special property in them, as all bailees of property have in the articles held under the contract of bailment. But such special property neither in the legal nor in the ordinary acceptation of the term constituted them the owners. No one would think of speaking of the bailee of a horse for hire as the owner of the horse or of the pawnee of a watch as security for a loan as the owner of the watch or of any other bailee of property as the owner thereof. The <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>bailee has only such dominion over the property bailed as is necessary to secure his rights and to accomplish the purpose of the bailment; and the delivery of property to another by the owner for a time and for specific purpose does not make the owner any the less the owner on that account in the ordinary use and understanding of the word. To hold that the residents of New York were the owners of the bonds in the present case would be just as contrary to the commonly understood meaning of the word as to hold that the mortgagee of real estate is the owner of the real estate mortgaged, or that the lessee of real estate is the owner of the real estate leased, and yet in each of these cases the title to the real estate is in the mortgagee and lessee to the extent of effectuating the intention of the parties. There can be no question but that the bonds upon which the tax is here charged, although delivered to nonresidents for a temporary purpose, were still owned by residents of the state within the meaning of the act of 1891. In Stanford v. San Francisco, <a href="/cal/131/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="131 Cal. 34" data-case-ids="1977659" data-case-paths="/cal/131/0034-01">131 Cal. 34</a> (63 Pac. Repr. 145), where the question of the taxation of certain certificates of stocks and of certain bonds of foreign corporations pledged in New York for money borrowed by a decedent who was a resident of California was considered, it was held that such certificates of stocks and such bonds were taxable in the state of the decedent to him while living, and after his death to his estate, under the code which provided that the assessor must assess taxable property to the person by whom it was owned or claimed. In that case it was said that the shares of stocks and bonds pledged as collaterals to secure advances made thereon were assessable in the name of the pledgor, and that under that provision of the code the decedent was the owner of the shares and bonds by him pledged.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[302,2089,1152,255]]]'>, The fact that the bonds were physically out of the state cannot affect the question of their taxability.

      <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>Nor do we think, as suggested by the defendant, that the New York holders of these bonds would be taxable on them under the laws of that state. No doubt they would be taxable on the loan made by them to the Pennsylvania owners of the bonds, but the bonds were held to secure and represented that indebtedness. To tax the bonds also would be to tax the same debt twice. This certainly could not be within the contemplation of the revenue laws of New York.</p>
