And further I do appoint my son Jacob T. Caslow as agent for my wife to act in her place and under her instructions, <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>as he may be requested by her, and no further if he shall live that long, if he should be called away she my wife is at liberty to celect a suteable person in his place.” This part of the will was preceded by a direction in relation to the payment of his debts and followed by the attestation clause. There was no gift to any other person and no disposition of a remainder.</p>
    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[178,747,1154,586]]]'>It is evident that the testator’s intention was to provide for his wife alone. She was the sole beneficiary under his will and the estate he gave her had all the attributes of absolute ownership. Unless he gave her a fee he died intestate as to the remainder after the expiration of a life estate. Every presumption is against such an intention. “It detracts nothing from a fee for a testator to say that his devisee shall have the sole control of the property during her lifetime,” Snyder v. Baer, <a href="/pa/144/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="144 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="823776" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0278-01">144 Pa. 278</a>; and “A devise, generally or indefinitely, with power of disposition carries a fee:” Witmer v.
