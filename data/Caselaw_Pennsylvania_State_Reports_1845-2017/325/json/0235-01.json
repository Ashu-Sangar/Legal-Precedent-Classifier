        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis was an action for damages for personal injuries and property damage sustained in a collision between plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s motor trucks.\nOn September 1, 1934, about 8 A. M., plaintiff was operating his motor truck eastwardly on Unity Street near Paul Street in the City of Philadelphia, and at the same time defendant\u2019s driver was operating its truck in a southerly direction on Paul Street in the vicinity of Unity Street. These two vehicles collided at the intersection. Plaintiff claimed that defendant\u2019s driver failed to have his motor vehicle under control and that it was being operated at a speed which was dangerous under the circumstances. After trial the jury awarded the plaintiff $6,000. Upon defendant\u2019s motion the court below entered judgment for defendant n. o. v. Defendant had also filed a motion for a new trial which the lower court dismissed, stating however that it considered the verdict excessive. Plaintiff appealed from the entry of judgment n. o. v. and by exception, notice of questions to be argued, and by assignment of error, has asked this court to consider the question of the amount of the verdict, if it shall reverse the entry of judgment n. o. v. in favor of defendant.\n.Unity Street, on which plaintiff was driving his truck eastwardly, is 23 feet wide between curbs. Near the south sidewalk of this street, seven or eight feet from the west curbline of Paul Street, there was a sign reading: \u201cStop, Then Go When Safe.\u201d When the front of his truck reached this sign, plaintiff! stopped and looked both ways. The building on the northwest corner was set back ten feet ten inches from the curb of Paul Street, this latter street being 26 feet wide between curbs. Plaintiff\u2019s view, at the time he stopped, to the left and north was 125 feet, in which distance he saw no moving traffic, but did see a truck parked on the west side of Paul Street in front of a grocery store. This store was the second house north on Unity Street. Plaintiff said that he then put his car in first gear and \u201ceased out on to Paul Street.\u201d At that time he could see a distance of 500 feet to his left, that is, to the north. \u25a0 He then saw defendant\u2019s southbound truck, about 200 feet away and proceeding at the rate of about twenty miles an hour. Pie continued across the street in first gear, but kept watching defendant\u2019s truck. When the front of plaim tiff\u2019s truck was passing over the center of Paul Street, he saw defendant\u2019s truck coming to a point opposite the grocery store, about 40 or 45 feet from Unity Street. The speed of defendant\u2019s truck had increased to about thirty to thirty-five miles an hour and it was out about six feet from the east curb. Defendant\u2019s truck was six feet wide and as it proceeded its right side was about one foot east of the center of Paul Street. Plaintiff\u2019s truck was proceeding in low gear about eight or ten miles an hour. Believing it then to be the best means of escaping a collision with defendant\u2019s truck, plaintiff attempted to increase his speed and get across the intersection before defendant reached there. Defendant\u2019s truck, however, was, as plaintiff describes it, \u201cleaning to his [defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s] left all the time.\u201d In other words, the defendant\u2019s truck was proceeding southwardly on Paul Street, not on its driver\u2019s right-hand side but on his left-hand side. Plaintiff testified that as defendant\u2019s truck was coming close to the intersection, \u201cit looked like he increased his speed all the time.\u201d Plaintiff swerved his truck to the right. Plaintiff testified that he \u201cthought by putting on a little more speed he may come around the back of me . . . thinking when he made the turn he was coming out of Unity Street to me, I immediately turned to the right and he struck me with the front of his truck with a glancing blow and hooked me on the rear left with his right hind wheel and dragged me down Paul Street. He turned over about thirty feet south of me and between him and the curb I turned over.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was in its essentials corroborated by a passenger on his truck and by a pedestrian. Defendant\u2019s driver testified that he did not see plaintiff\u2019s truck before the crash.\nIn its opinion upon the rule for judgment n. o. v. the court below said: \u201cThere would have been no collision if plaintiff had done what he should have done, that is stop where he was. He was going very slowly \u2014 'easing into the street\u2019 \u2014 and could have stopped instantly. Instead, he chose to push forward across the street in the pathway of a car only forty feet from him. He did this thinking defendant would alter his course and pass behind him.\u201d In the light of what happened, we know now that it would have been prudent for plaintiff to have waited at the intersection until defendant\u2019s truck had passed. But plaintiff is not to be adjudged negligent because what he would have done had his judgment been faultless would have obviated the accident. We said in effect in Weinberg v. Pavitt, 304 Pa. 312, 155 A. 867, that one may be legally blameless in spite of an error of judgment where another has placed him in a situation where it is unreasonable to hold him to the exercise of cool and correct judgment. We said in Amey v. Erb, 296 Pa. 561, 565, 146 A. 141: \u201cWhere one finds himself in a position of danger which is not the result of his negligence, he is not responsible if he make a mistake of judgment in getting out.\u201d In Weiss v. Pittsburgh Ry. Co., 301 Pa. 539, 543, 152 A. 674, this court, in an opinion by the present Chief Justice, said: \u201cThe situation of danger arose after he was committed to the crossing. His acts with regard to negligence must be judged from the circumstances as they then appeared. In his position one is not required to exercise the highest or even an ordinary degree of judgment; it is a judgment arising from peril, or care under the circumstances. \u2018One placed in sudden peril without his fault is not responsible for an error of judgment\u2019: Knepp v. B. & O. R. R., 262 Pa. 421 [105 A. 636].\u201d Negligence is failure to conform to the standard of the reasonably prudent man. He who judges the quality of another\u2019s act under given circumstances has no warrant to demand that the actor\u2019s foresight should have been as unerring as the judge\u2019s hindsight. In Adams v. Gardiner, 306 Pa. 576, 160 A. 589, which case arose from a collision of two motor vehicles at a street intersection, we said: \u201cPlaintiff cannot, on the facts as they then appeared. to him, be held chargeable with knowledge that a collision was inevitable if he continued on his way. If it appeared to him that his car would reach the intersection first, as he said it so appeared and did, he had a right to assume that the defendant even though going at the rate of thirty or thirty-five miles an hour, would recognize plaintiff\u2019s superior right to the intersection and control the car as a considerate driver would under the circumstances, i. e., apply the brakes and slacken his speed. If the plaintiff after reaching the square saw that the defendant had also reached the square and was in fact \u2018picking up speed\u2019 (as the former testified) his act in quickly swinging his ear to the right was under the circumstances an act of prudence, and if defendant had shown equal prudence by turning his car to the left the collision would probably have been avoided.\u201d\nAccording to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, when defendant\u2019s truck was in front of the grocery store, about 40 or 45 feet north of the intersection, plaintiff was \u201cabout half way across at the time.\u201d Plaintiff said: \u201cI took my eye off of him for an instant to put more gas on to get out of his road and he just swung to the left of him\u201d (i. e., to the east side of the intersection). We think that plaintiff was justified in proceeding on the assumption, after considering the relation of the two cars at that time to the intersection, that defendant\u2019s driver would slow down or at least veer to his, i. e., defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s, right. We see nothing in plaintiff\u2019s conduct after he had \u201ceased out\u201d into the middle of the street that would justify declaring him guilty of negligence as a matter of law. Under the circumstances of this case, the question of his contributory negligence was for the jury.\nThere are many cases where the facts are such that a jury\u2019s finding of contributory negligence could not' be characterized as contrary to the evidence, but it is only in those cases where contributory negligence is so clearly revealed that fair and reasonable individuals could not disagree as to its existence that it may be declared judicially. This is not one of those latter cases. See Christ v. Hill Metal & Roofing Co., 314 Pa. 375, 380, 171 A. 607.\nIn discharging the rule for a new trial, the court below expressed the opinion that the verdict was excessive. We will reinstate the rule for a new trial; the court below may, when the record is again before it, make such an order in respect to this rule as it believes justice requires.\nThe judgment of the court below entering judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto is reversed. Its order discharging the rule for a new trial is reversed and that rule is reinstated.",
