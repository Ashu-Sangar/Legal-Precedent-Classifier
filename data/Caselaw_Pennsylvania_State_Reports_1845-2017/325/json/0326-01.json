The positive instructions of the court withdrawing the testimony complained of from the consideration of the jury cured all error and removed any prejudice which may have been instilled in their minds.\nThe charge that the jury\u2019s verdict must be for appellee was entirely proper. It is not disputed there was a taking of 1.32 acres of his land in such a manner that it was irregularly divided into two pieces, and there was no evidence which would warrant a finding of any special benefits to appellee in mitigation of the damages suffered. Appellee was clearly entitled to damages for the decreased market value of his land immediately after the taking, and the only matter for the jury to determine was the extent of damages suffered.\nJudgment affirmed.",
