She brought the matter to the attention of the court by a petition for a rule on Melnick to show cause why the attachment execution should not be dissolved on the ground that Melnick had agreed not to proceed against her; copies of agreements relied on, and also the interrogatories and answers of the garnishee, were attached to her petition. A rule was granted. Melnick answered with procedural objections but made no denial of his con<a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>tracts.

The effect of the order is to restrain or stay the execution; the name given by petitioner to describe the relief sought is not as significant as its legal effect. Stay of execution is common: <em>Sinking Fund Commissioners of Philadelphia v.

That this execution is against property that can be reached only by attachment, pursuant to a statute (Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 755) does not call for a different remedy; it is still an execution. <em>(Wray v. Tammany, </em><a href="/pa/13/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="13 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="964982" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0394-01">13 Pa. 394</a>; <em>Ellwanger v.

On the record as now presented, considered in relation to his former wife as defendant, Melniek stands in the position of use-plaintiff prosecuting an action by her against the garnishee, yet that is the right which he agreed he would not assert. The garnishment issued in 1929 was an orderly step in the execution; but, between the time it went out and before trial of the garnishment the rights and liabilities of the parties were changed by two of the three defendants. One of them became use-plaintiff, and, by agreeing not to proceed against the other in this execution, disqualified himself from proceeding with it against her. She is therefore entitled to the aid of the restraining arm of the court, for, if he broke his contract by going on with the execution, he would become answerable to her for the resulting breach: equity will prevent this circuity of action by now giving effect to the intention of the two parties to the contract. That there is another defendant, Rabinowitz, is <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>not material in the circumstances: compare <em>Burke v. Noble, </em><a href="/pa/48/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="48 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="422157" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0168-01">48 Pa. 168</a>, 175. Melnick’s disability to go on with the execution against his former wife necessarily enures to the benefit of the garnishee in the execution, who is said to be indebted to her.</p>

Instead of answering the petition fully the use-plaintiff filed what he called an answer “in the nature of preliminary objections to the petition of defendant ...” We are not advised that the rules of the court below provide for any but a complete answer. Under Buie 78 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the undenied averments in the petition are admitted. See <em>Gliwa v. U. S. Steel Corp., </em><a href="/pa/322/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="322 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1167864" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0225-01">322 Pa. 225</a>, 227, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20584" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="185 A. 584">185 A. 584</a>. The admission left no issue to be tried. The question is one of law: what does the paper mean? The words are: “. . . neither I nor my heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, will proceed under said judgments against Helen B. Mel-nick, reserving, however, any rights to proceed under said judgments<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> against any of the other defendants<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> therein named.” They do not reserve the right to proceed against the garnishee as one indebted to Helen Melnick; Melnick specifically agreed that he would not proceed. The execution of course remains against the defendant, Babinowitz. As to him and the garnishment against Binenstock, the proceeding continues as if Helen Melnick had never been a party: see <em>Burke v. Noble, </em><a href="/pa/48/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="48 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="422157" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0168-01">48 Pa. 168</a>, 174; <em>Bryant v.
