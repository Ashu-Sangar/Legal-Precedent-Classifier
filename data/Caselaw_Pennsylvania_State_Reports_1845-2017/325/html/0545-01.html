Section 45 provides that “The word ‘transfer,’ as used in this act, shall be taken to include the passing of property, or any interest therein, in possession or enjoyment, present or future, by distribution, by statute, descent, devise, bequest, grant, deed, bargain, sale, or gift.”</p>

More specifically, therefore, the inquiry resolves itself into the question: Is the tax imposed by the Act of 1919 a tax on the <em>transfer </em>of the bonds?</p>
    <p id="b589-7" data-blocks='[["BL_589.7",589,[190,1605,1152,746]]]'>At first blush this question would probably be answered in the affirmative because of the express use of the word “transfer” in both the title and the body of the act, and because the statute has generally been referred to as the “Transfer Inheritance Tax Act.” But in considering whether the tax imposed by the Act of 1919 is a tax upon the transfer of the bonds the problem is not one of nomenclature but of the real nature of an inheritance tax. A study of .the origin of such taxation, and of the cases construing our own legislation over a course of many years, makes it readily apparent that the inheritance tax is not one on the <em>transfer </em>of specific property, as such term is ordinarily understood, but is of an entirely different nature.</p>

      <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>The right to transmit or to receive property by will or through intestacy is not a natural right but a creature of statutory grant. Students of law agree that the State has the right to declare an escheat of <em>all </em>the property of a decedent, and therefore, as the price of allowing a legatee, devisee or heir to inherit, it may appropriate to itself any portion of the property which it chooses to exact. Whether this appropriation be designated an inheritance tax, an estate tax, a succession tax, a death duty, or otherwise howsoever, it is not, in its essence, a tax on the decedent’s property or any component part of it, or on the transaction of transferring it as in the case of a transmission of possession or title inter vivos, but an excise on the privilege of inheritance. It is really not a tax at all in the ordinary meaning of the word, but rather a distributive share of the estate which the State retains for itself. Its true nature is not changed by the fact that it is assessed and measured by the value of the property, or that it is paid by legatees and devisees in proportions allocated to their respective inheritances.</p>

L. 227, have uniformly been construed from this standpoint. Thus it has been held, for example, that a bond of the United States is properly included in the. assessed valuation of an estate for collateral inheritance tax purposes, although the State could not, under our Federal system, tax the bond itself in any manner: <em>Strode v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/52/0181-02" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="52 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1002260,1002263" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0181-02,/pa/52/0181-01">52 Pa. 181</a>. An Act of Congress provided that all bonds of the United States should be exempt from taxation by or under State or municipal authority.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court pointed out in the <em>Strode </em>case, however, that “The act (imposing the collateral inheritance tax) operates only on the <em>residue </em>of the estate after paying debts and charges, and, theoretically, that residue is always a balance in money. The administration account always exhibits a balance <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>in cash, not in specific goods, whether bonds or horses; and though an heir may take bonds or horses as cash, the account must show, and always does show, a cash balance. That is the fund taxed by this law, and not the bonds or other chattels which may have produced the fund.” The court further said that the “estate passed into the hands of the executor for administration, and is taxed in his hands <em>as an estate. </em>The law takes every decedent’s estate into custody, and administers it for' the benefit of creditors, legatees, devisees and heirs, and delivers the residue that remains, after discharging all obligations, to the distributees entitled to receive it. One of the legal obligations to which every estate that is to go to collateral kindred is subject, is this 5 per cent duty to the Commonwealth. And it is not until this work of administration is performed, that the right of succession attaches. The distributees may, indeed, consent to accept certain goods and chattels in specie without conversion, as is frequently done in settlement of estates; but such arrangement in no case affects the theory of the law, that the estate is first to be administered and then enjoyed.” The basis of this decision is that the State takes its appropriate share from the clear value of the estate for distribution, and that the nature or identity of the component parts of the estate from which such net balance results is wholly immaterial.</p>
    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[199,1774,1151,416]]]'>In <em>Oreutt’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/97/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="97 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="444784" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0179-01">97 Pa. 179</a>, 185, it was said: “The tax does not attach to the very articles of property of which the deceased died possessed.

Nevertheless the court held, in an able opinion by Sadler, President Judge of the Common Pleas of Cumberland County, that the certificate of loan was subject to the collateral inheritance tax, saying that the State “may properly provide that a portion of the estate should escheat to it and the remainder go to the heir; and the portion which the State reserves or compels the administrator or executor to pay to it, is not a tax upon the specific property, of which decedent may die seised, or which the collateral heirs, legatee or devisee may take, but a tax or duty levied upon the <em>estate as such, </em>which may remain after the debts and expenses of administration are provided for; and in construing its character it is proper to remember that it is connected with and is a part of the legislation of the Commonwealth in reference to the administration and transmission of estates of decedents.”</p>

This right or privilege is purely a creature of statutory law. It did not exist at common law, and individuals possess no natural right to such succession; the sovereign authority that gives it may demand payment for the gift. ... It follows that the State has power to take the value at death without any deductions, or the value actually received by the distributee as the measure to determine this excise payment . . . the Act of 1919 was intended as a comprehensive scheme to lodge an excise against the right of succession . . . ; though payment of the excise demanded therefor may be borne ultimately by the estate received by such distributees, the thing that gives rise to the creation of this excise is the state law of inheritance.”</p>

The appraisement to be made is not of the legacies or devises but of the whole estate of a decedent; the debts and expenses of administration are not to be deducted from any particular gift or gifts, but from the whole estate. ...

S. 115</a>, as it was in <em>Strode v.

The court said: “We think the conclusion, fairly to be drawn from the state and Federal cases, is, that the right to take property by will or descent is derived from and regulated by municipal law; that, in assessing a tax upon such right or privilege, the State may lawfully measure or fix the amount <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>of the tax by referring to the value of the property passing ; and that the incidental fact that such property is composed, in whole or in part, of Federal securities, does not invalidate the tax or the law under which it is imposed. ... So that we return to the authorities, by which it has been established that a tax upon . . . the privilege of taking under the statutes of wills and of descents, is a tax not upon United States bonds if they happen to compose ... a part of the property of a decedent, but upon rights and privileges created and regulated by the State.” To the same effect are <em>Orr v.
