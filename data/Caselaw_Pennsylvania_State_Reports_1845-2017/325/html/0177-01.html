Concerning the $50,000 item, the uncontradicted evidence is that $25,000 was contributed by the plaintiff and $25,000 by Charles C. A. Baldi, the banker. It was a joint deposit. The pass book was issued to “Baldi Virgilio A. or C. C. A.” Over three years after the deposit was made, the parties recorded on the signature card the following agreement: “I here the un<a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>dersigned establish the following conditions — during my life I must receive annually interest at the rate of 4% on this amount of $50,000 after my death the same interest is payable to my brother, C.

He claimed to have had $76,000 of bonds in this box and that they were stolen from it. The bank, acting by Charles C. A. Baldi, assumed responsibility for the bonds. They were never recovered by the bank. The documents and the uncontradicted oral evidence show that the two brothers settled their differences on September 19, 1930, when tbe memoranda relating to both deposits were signed. On that day, in discharge of its liability to plaintiff for the loss of the bonds, the bank set up an account crediting plaintiff with $76,000. The parties also made the following memorandum in the deposit book: “September 19th, 1930. On recovery of the bonds this deposit is to be returned for the bonds, thereby making this a temporary deposit until the return of the bonds, ...” This was signed by C. C. A. Baldi and by a clerk acting “for the firm.-” The plaintiff also wrote in the book, in Italian, a memoran<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>dum translated by plaintiff’s witness, Virgil B. Baldi, as follows: “I, the undersigned, establish the following conditions: During my lifetime I am to receive four per cent interest on $76,000. After my death $15,000 is payable to my brother Carmine — C. C. A. Baldi — and another $15,000 is payable to my nephew —BY MB. CLAPP: Q. Carmine, son of Vito? A. That is right. It refers to my father. Another $15,000 to my nephew Virgil, son of Carmine, referring to me, and the rest is to be dispensed according to my will. That is signed by my uncle. Q. The plaintiff in this case? A. Yes.” That book was retained by the plaintiff. A signature card was also prepared and retained by the bank and on that card the plaintiff wrote the following: “I here the undersigned establish the following conditions — during my lifetime I must receive annually interest at the rate of 4% on this amount of $76,000 — after my death $15,000 is payable to my brother, C.

Nothing could be more clearly testamentary in character.” The record does not support that conclusion. The parties were settling differences. As part of the settlement, the bank set up the credit upon certain conditions, accepted, by and therefore binding upon plaintiff. He agreed what should become of the two sums of $15,000 on his death, he was never to have the disposition of that much of the credit set up; the balance of the account the bank agreed to hold subject to such disposition as he might make by will. He cannot claim the deposit and reject the conditions under which it was obtained.</p>
