Marcus England and Edward Shawell, were indicted for the murder of Evan Lape, operator of a gasoline service station, in the perpetration of robbery and burglary. England pleaded guilty, and Shawell changed his plea from not guilty to guilty. The trial judge, sitting alone in a court having three judges, heard the testimony, and found the murder to be first degree, fixing the penalties at death. The two other judges of the court concurred. Defendants were then sentenced by the entire court, all three judges sitting. Thereafter Shawell filed a motion to withdraw his plea of guilty, which was refused. These appeals followed.</p>
    <p id="b541-8" data-blocks='[["BL_541.14",541,[194,1933,1151,369]]]'>The chief error assigned is the holding of the hearing to determine the degree and fix the penalty by one judge in the absence of a majority of the court, and the concurrence in his conclusion by the two other judges who were not present at the hearing.

They selected Lape as the victim, and parked their car near his gasoline filling station, where he lived alone. When the lights illuminating the station were extinguished, the car was driven up to it, and Lape was induced to come out of the room by being told they wanted to buy gasoline. While he was pumping gasoline into the tank, one of the appellants struck him on the side of his head above his ear with a blackjack or tape covered bludgeon about twenty inches long belonging to England. The blow fractured his skull and brought him to the ground. Appellants carried him into the house and fled, taking his wallet containing about eighty dollars and a small wooden box containing a few dollars in change. They drove to England’s house, where they hid the blackjack and divided their loot. Lape, lying on the floor in a pool of blood but still conscious when found, died two days later.</p>

      <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>The term “court” is unfortunately used in popular speech in a rather loose manner with different meanings depending upon the particular sense in which it is employed: <em>Jermynis Election Expenses, </em><a href="/pa-super/57/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="57 Pa.

It is employed, however, most frequently in speaking of the judge or judges who preside over the tribunal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It is at times exceedingly difficult to ascertain whether the legislature means one of the judges of the court or the court en banc. In construing the word “court,” as used in the Act of 1923, to determine whether it comprehends within its purport “judge” or “judges assembled,” it must be kept in mind that the general statutory rule is that one judge may preside over the court of oyer and terminer, which has the exclusive jurisdiction in this State of homicide cases. Section 1 of the Act of March 14, 1877, P. L. 77, so provides. Prior to the Act of 1877 it was the policy of this State to require two judges to sit in homicide cases: see Act of February 3, 1843, P. L. 8, section 4. Now our criminal courts need only he presided over by one judge in any case which comes within their jurisdiction, and it is reasonable to suppose that when the legislature confers upon “the court” of oyer and terminer a statutory duty or power, the reference is to a court with one judge. <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>This view is strengthened by the fact the legislature has among its membership many lawyers and the body in general is familiar with the established practice of one judge trying criminal and other cases. Since the legislature has said that one judge is competent to hold criminal court, it is our duty to follow that mandate and so construe the term “court” with reference to the number of judges required to sit, unless there is sound reason to hold otherwise.</p>

Where there is a general statutory provision conferring a power or imposing a duty upon a court, the character and nature of the power or duty, and the objects and purposes to be attained by it, may be such that the function to be performed is of a type which can only be properly carried out by all the members of the court. A court thus assembled includes all the judges or a majority who have jurisdiction to perform the particular statutory duty vested in the court. See <em>Carter’s Estate, </em>supra, at p. 527. We were there considering the power of the orphans’ court to appoint and remove a guardian. The statute conferred jurisdiction upon “the court,” and we held it must be exercised by the entire court or a majority thereof. The Carter case must be considered in relation to its facts, and cannot control in a subsequent suit a new set of facts ostensibly within its ruling but in reality not covered by it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In <em>Frick’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/277/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="277 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1079572" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0242-01">277 Pa. </a><a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a><a href="/pa/277/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="277 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1079572" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0242-01">242</a>, 252, we said: “It is a maxim, not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.

What has been the practice in the past? Nearly all our cases dealing with the term involve the power of appointment or removal of individuals either in a fiduciary or public capacity. <em>Carter’s Estate, </em>supra, concerned the removal of a guardian.' In <em>Moritz v. Luzerne County, </em><a href="/pa/283/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="283 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1090501" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0349-01">283 Pa. 349</a>, an act authorizing “the court of common pleas of each county” to employ court interpreters was construed to mean the authority must be exercised by the assembled tribunal and not by one judge.

In <em>Sterrett v. MacLean, </em><a href="/pa/293/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="293 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1111138" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0557-01">293 Pa. 557</a>, an act giving the sheriff the right to appeal “to the judge or judges of the common pleas court” from a decision of the salary board refusing to appoint an additional sheriff’s deputy at his request was held to impose the duty upon the judge or judges, if there be more than one, to hear and determine the case. The appointment and removal of public officials or fiduciaries is a power which has far reaching consequences and should be exercised by all the available judges of the tribunal assembled together. In statutes conferring such power upon “the court,” the term “court” must be interpreted to mean “court en banc” in order to make effective the intent of the legislature.</p>

The statute imposes upon “the court” the duty to hear witnesses and determine the degree of the crime after a plea of guilty by one indicted for murder. The hearing of evidence, while of great importance, is a function ordinarily performed by one judge. Determining the degree of guilt is not a trial though facts from the evidence must be found. In <em>People v. Chew Lan Ong, </em><a href="/citations/?q=75%20P.%20186" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="75 P. 186">75 Pac. 186</a>, <a href="/cal/141/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="141 Cal. 550" data-case-ids="2105863" data-case-paths="/cal/141/0550-01">141 Cal. 550</a>, where it was argued that a similar statute in California was a deprivation of the right of an accused to a jury trial, the court said: “The proceeding to determine the degree of the crime of murder after a plea of guilty is not a trial. No issue was joined upon which there could be a trial.” See also <em>Hallinger v. Davis, </em><a href="/us/146/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="146 U.S. 314" data-case-ids="3564595" data-case-paths="/us/146/0314-01">146 U. S. 314</a>, 319. The examination of witnesses and determination of the degree by the court is part of the sentencing power vested in the court.

L. 2, section 1; Act of April 29, 1929, P. L. 854, section 4; Act of June 29, 1923, P. L. 975, No. 397, section 1. While all these statutes confer the sentencing power upon “the court,” it is significant that the Act of April 29,1929, P. L. 854, section 2, permitting the imposition of life imprisonment for fourth and subsequent offenses makes it “in the discretion of the judge trying the case.”</p>
    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[268,881,1152,1073]]]'>With this practice before it, the legislature must have used the term “court” in the Act of 1923 in a similar sense. While this act imposes a grave responsibility upon the presiding judge, and one which must be performed with the greatest care, nevertheless it is a type of power which has long been exercised by one judge, and the statute must be interpreted in that light. It is noteworthy that in the comparatively recent case of <em>Com. v. </em>Garramone, <a href="/pa/307/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="307 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="1138207" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0507-01">307 Pa. 507</a>, the trial judge, sitting alone without a jury, heard the evidence, decided that the defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree and imposed the sentence of death. The question of the right of a single judge to hear and determine such cases was not directly raised, but this court reduced the death sentence to life imprisonment, and, evidently with the problem in mind, cited the Act of 1877, supra, conferring upon one judge the power to hold a court of oyer and terminer in homicide cases. That case sustains the view that the Act of 1923 does not require more than one judge to perform the duty prescribed.</p>

To avoid misunderstanding as to the manner in which the court below functioned, the three judges filed a state<a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>ment submitting what actually took place. The testimony was heard by the president judge, sitting alone. After the testimony had been transcribed and filed, the president judge studied it and concluded that both defendants were guilty of murder in the first degree and that the penalty should be death. He then prepared an opinion setting forth the reasons for his conclusions, which, along with a copy of the notes of testimony, he presented to the two other judges of the court, requesting them to read the record and check his conclusions. They did this and agreed with the conclusions reached. The president judge then added the following sentence to his opinion: “The other judges of this court concur in these conclusions.” All three judges were on the bench at the time defendants were called for sentence and the death penalty was imposed. The facts show that the decision was made solely by the judge who conducted the hearing, saw and heard the witnesses and passed upon their credibility. The mere fact that the other two judges were permitted to read the notes of testimony and to express their views as to the correctness of the conclusions reached by the presiding judge does not mean that they took part in the decision. The case had already been decided by the president judge when the record came into their hands, and it was perfectly proper for him to seek their sentiments in a matter of such grave consequence. A judge cannot participate in the decision of a case where it turns upon the credibility of the witnesses who testify at a hearing at which he was not present, but there is nothing to prevent a judge from expressing his opinion upon matters before his court, even though it may not be controlling. In <em>Com. v. </em>Addison, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dallas%20225" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="4 Dallas 225">4 Dallas 225</a>, this court said: “But we are (with the same unanimity) of opinion, that every judge has a right, and emphatically, that it is his duty, to deliver his sentiments upon every subject that occurs in court.

There defendant entered a plea of guilty, and three of the five judges of the court sat at the hearing to determine the degree of his crime. After the hearing the president judge, who had not been present during the taMng of testimony, read the transcript and deliberated with the others. The four judges together fixed the degree. The controlling fact was that a judge who was not present at the hearing and did not hear the witnesses took part in the decision of the case, wrote the opinion and pronounced sentence. This is a practice severely condemned in this State as well as in others. In the case at bar the president judge fully performed his duty under the Act of 1923 before the other judges acted, and their action was merely in an advisory or supplementary capacity and not essential to the jurisdiction exercised.</p>
    <p id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.6",550,[282,1422,1151,853]]]'>The last assignment of error remaining to be discussed relates to the refusal of the court below to grant appellant Shawell’s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty, which was presented to the court below after sentence had been imposed, and is now joined in by appellant England. The rule is well settled that a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty and to be allowed to enter a plea of not guilty is addressed to the sound discretion of the court before which the plea is entered, and unless there has been a clear abuse of that discretionary power its action will not be reversed on appeal. See <em>Com. v. DiPaul, </em><a href="/pa-super/122/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="122 Pa. Super. 53" data-case-ids="990185" data-case-paths="/pa-super/122/0053-01">122 Pa.

No valid reason exists for permitting appellants to withdraw their pleas of guilty, and the ends of justice would not be served by the granting of such permission.</p>

Obviously such an inflexible rule of construction, in total disregard of the nature of the act to be performed, would in many cases retard the administration of justice and ignore not only custom and usage long established, but also the accepted meaning placed upon the word “court” in statutes relating to the orphans’ court. It would practically nullify the statutory provisions enabling one <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>judge to hold the orphans’ court: see Act of June 7, 1917, P. L; 363, Sec. l[b] and [c]. Many statutes conferring power upon the orphans’ court use the term “court,” where it has been the established practice to conduct the hearing before one judge. No one would seriously contend that the settlement of the accounts of guardians of minors, testamentary trustees, executors and administrators, requires the presence of the entire court: Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 363, Sec. 9, [a], [b] and <em>[d]; </em>nor is it necessary for the court en banc to confirm accounts of fiduciaries: Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 447, Sec. 46[f]; audit accounts: Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, Sec. 47 [b]; or send an issue to the court of common pleas for trial by jury: Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 363, Sec. 21 [a]. Each and every one of these statutes confers the power upon “the orphans’ court,” and yet the settled usage in most cases arising under them is to have one judge preside. A literal application of the broad language in the Carter case would be unthinkable and would result in a harsh and unjustified interpretation of the term “court” as used by the legislature in these and other statutes.</p>
