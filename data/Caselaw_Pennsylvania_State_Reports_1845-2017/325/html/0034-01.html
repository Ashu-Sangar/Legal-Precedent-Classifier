The court said: “It is established that ‘where a statute merely re-enacts the provisions of an earlier one, it is to be read as part of the earlier statute, and not of the re-enacting one, if it is in conflict with another passed after the first but before the last act; and therefore it does not repeal by implication the intermediate one’ (Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, Section 194) ; or as expressed in 36 Cyc. 1084, ‘Nor does a later law, which is merely a re-enactment of a former, repeal an intermediate act which qualifies and limits the first one, but such intermediate act will be deemed to remain in force, and to qualify or modify the new act in the same manner as it did the first’; see also Lewis’s Sutherland on Statutory Construction, Section 273, and <em>Searight’s Eat., </em><a href="/pa/163/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="163 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="859034" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0210-01">163 Pa. 210</a>, 216-18.” (Id. 57.) That principle is peculiarly applicable to the construction of both the Fiscal Code and the Fiduciaries Act and their relation to each other as indicating legislative intent. These two statutes are re-enactment and revision of earlier statutes, on two subjects of legislation that stand out in our law, and continuing, by each act, a legislative policy established more than a century ago and consistently applied ever since.</p>

The contention that there was an implied repeal must be rejected. Section 1802, P.
