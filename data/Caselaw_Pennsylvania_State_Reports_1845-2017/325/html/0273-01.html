    <p id="b317-3" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[186,558,1149,914]]]'>In 1914 the complainant commenced marketing a motor oil under the name “Quaker State.” It is prepared from crude oil produced in certain sections of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, known in the trade and to the public as Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil. From 1914 “Quaker State” oil has been sold by automobile service stations and garages throughout the country. It has been extensively advertised in magazines and newspapers, also by means of outdoor signs along the highways. This oil was for some years specifically recommended by the manufacturers of Franklin motor cars for use by their owners. The business has experienced a steady growth, and at the time this case was tried, in 1935, upwards of 70,000 dealers handled the oil and the annual aggregate of sales amounted to 10,000,000 gallons, in 1930 or 1931 to a still larger gallonage.</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[185,1484,1149,695]]]'>The defendants started to market “Quaker City” motor oils in 1919 in a small way, selling directly to consumers, for the most part to operators of fleets of motor trucks. In 1920 they began the sale of their product through service stations and garages and continued to do so until the time of trial. Defendants’ oil is likewise made from Pennsylvania Crude, and although sold at a slightly lower price, according to the evidence is in no sense inferior to that of complainant. The advertisements of and the containers for the two oils are not the same. The containers for “Quaker State” are primarily green in color, those for “Quaker City” are a bright orange.</p>

The use of truthfully descriptive terms may not in any case be absolutely <em>prohibited; </em>the first trader being entitled as against another only to such protection as will prevent such other from using the term to pass off his goods as those of the original appropriator, 63 C.

This exception is best stated in the case of <em>Merriam Co. v. Saalfield, </em><a href="/f/198/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="198 F. 369" data-case-ids="6740526" data-case-paths="/f/198/0369-01">198 Fed. 369</a>, 373: “Primarily, it would seem that one might appropriate to himself for his goods any word or phrase that he chose; but this is not so, because the broader public right prevails, and one may not appropriate to his own exclusive use a word which already belongs to the public and so may be used by anyone of'the public. Hence comes the rule, first formulated in trade-mark cases, that there can be no exclusive appropriation of geographical words or words of quality. This is because such words are, or may be, aptly descriptive, and one may properly use for his own product any descriptive words, because such words are &lt;5f public or common right. It soon developed that this latter rule, literally applied in all cases, would encourage commercial fraud, and that such universal application could not be tolerated by courts of equity; hence came the ‘secondary meaning’ theory. There is nothing <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>abstruse or complicated about this theory, however difficult its application may sometimes be. It contemplates that a word or phrase originally, and in that sense primarily, incapable of exclusive appropriation with reference to an article on the market, because geographically or otherwise descriptive, might nevertheless have been used so long and so exclusively by one producer with reference to his article, that in that trade and to that branch of the purchasing public, the word or phrase had come to mean that the article was his product; in other words, had come to be, to them, his trade-mark. So it was said that the word had come to have a secondary meaning, although this phrase, ‘secondary meaning,’ seems not happily chosen, because, in the limited field, this new meaning is primary rather than secondary; that is to say, it is, in that field, the natural meaning. Here, then, is presented a conflict of right. The alleged trespassing defendant has the right to use the word, because in its primary sense or original sense the word is descriptive; but, owing to the fact that the word has come to mean, to a part of the public, something else, it follows that when the defendant approaches that same part of the public with the bare word, and with nothing else, applied to his goods, he deceives that part of the public, and hence he is required to accompany his use of the bare word with sufficient distinguishing marks normally to prevent the otherwise normally resulting fraud.” “Secondary meaning is association, nothing more. It exists only in the minds of those of the public who have seen or known or have heard of a brand of goods by some name or sign and have associated the two in their minds”: Nims, supra, p. 105, “When the word is incapable of becoming a valid trade-mark, because descriptive or geographical, yet has by use come to stand for a particular maker or vendor, its use by another in this secondary sense will be restrained as unfair and fraudulent competition, and its use in its primary or <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>common sense confined in such a way as will prevent a probable deceit by enabling one maker or vendor to sell his article as the product of another”: <em>Computing Scale Co. v.

There is nothing in'the names “Quaker State” and “Quaker City” that should confuse the purchasing public. Even the most careless observer would recognize the distinction between the two. “Quaker State” denotes to all, “Pennsylvania,” and “Quaker City” denotes “Philadelphia.” A similar situation arose over the right to use the words “Quaker City” and “Quaker Maid” as applied to candy. In that case it was said: “The defendant introduced no evidence that these trade-marks are confusing because of similarity. In other words, it did not attempt to prove that the trade has ever been confused by the marks or that purchasers have ever mistaken one for the other, or have mistaken the wares they mark, a situation which at first induces one’s mind to conclude that the ground for opposition is not tenable. Therefore, we must determine from the trade-marks themselves whether they resemble each other so closely that confusion or mistake in the mind of the public will likely occur. . . .

This confusion, however, is the result of the fact that some of the purchasers call the plaintiff’s oil by the name “Quaker” rather than “Quaker State.” The record is barren as to any confusion between the names “Quaker State” and “Quaker City.” Such being the case, the complainant contends that it now has the right to use “Quaker” exclusively as well as “Quaker State,” and asks the court to restrain all who use a trade name similar to “Quaker” as well as those who use a name similar to “Quaker State.” This argument is inapplicable to the facts in the case for one reason and possibly for two. First, there is no evidence that the complainant’s oil was called “Quaker” in 1919, when the defendant started in business. Hence it cannot be said that the defendant violated any rights of the complainant at that time. The fact that the public afterwards began to call the complainant’s product “Quaker” should not be permitted to divest the defendants of any rights already acquired. Second, this same argument was raised in <em>Loughran v. Quaker City Chocolate &amp; Confectionery Co., </em>supra, and the court dismissed it, saying (p. 826) : “But the unusual thing about the opposition of the defendant is that its complaint does not extend so much to a claimed deceptive similarity between the contesting trade-marks as it does to its claimed right, previously stated, to take out of its trade-marks the catch word ‘Quaker’ and use it in its business generally — and exclusively. The defendant maintains that it has used the word ‘Quaker’ disenjoined from the word ‘City’ and has applied it to advertising, wrapping, boxing, and selling its candies so long that its candies have become known to the public by this single word and therefore the registration of the plaintiffs’ trademark of ‘Quaker Maid,’ though accompanied with a <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>representation of a Quaker woman, would carry to the trade the idea that the plaintiffs’ candies are made by the defendant. This conclusion is only true if the defendant were entitled to the exclusive use of the word ‘Quaker.’ We cannot see what right it has to appropriate and make claim to the exclusive use of one of several trade-mark words. ‘Quaker City,’ the name by which the City of Philadelphia is popularly known, is a name freely used by a multitude of tradesmen, as an inspection of the telephone directory of that city will abundantly show. The registration of a trademark does not give the registrant a monopoly of every word in the trade-mark, however, disposed and used.” This same thought is tersely stated by Judge Jessell in <em>Cowen v. Hulton, </em>46 L. T. R. (N. S.) 897: “He has a right to the name by which he sells his paper, but not the name by which people chose to call it.” See also <em>Evening Journal Asso. v. Jersey Pub.

The average observer would either not note the difference between the phrases Quaker State and Quaker City or he would think that <em>both </em>oils were marketed by the same company and probably taken out of the subterranean caverns of Pennsylvania, which are generally known to yield oil of superior quality.

People generally now refer to the “Waldorf-Astoria” as the “Waldorf.” This one-word dominance is more pronounced when a proper noun is linked with a common noun as a designation. If some one produced and marketed cotton designated as “Missisippi Valley Cotton,” it would soon become known as “Mississippi Cotton,” and if, after it had secured a valuable reputation, another would market cotton and call it “Mississippi River Cotton,” the latter name would be well calculated to deceive purchasers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

In both cases the courts of equity administer relief without regard to the existence of a technical trade-mark.” Justice Mitchell cites the case of <em>North Cheshire &amp; Manchester Brewery Co. v.

In that case the House of Lords affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal, enjoining the defendant from taking even as a <em>second </em>or <em>subordinate </em>part of its corporate title, the name of an older corporation.

In that case the court said: “It is not necessary that the complainant, in order to succeed, should prove actual fraud by the defendant, or that any single person was deceived. It is sufficient if, in the opinion of the judge, the symbol or device or get-up used by the defendant is one which so closely resembles the symbol, device or get-up used by the complainant as to be likely to deceive the public. . . . The idea that a man has a right to use his name as a part of the name of a corporation in which he is interested, without regard to the effect of such use in the way of accomplishing deception and fraud, precisely as a natural person can use his own name, has, I think, in this state, been exploded. . . .

In other words, the manufacturer of particular goods is entitled to the reputation they have acquired, and the public is entitled to the means of distinguishing between those, and other, goods; <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>and protection is accorded against unfair dealing, whether there be a technical trademark or not.”</p>
    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[271,450,1150,696]]]'>I cannot agree with the statement in the majority opinion that the words “Quaker State Oil” did not acquire a secondary meaning until after 1919. The majority opinion concedes that plaintiff’s “Quaker State Oil” had “been marketed and nationally advertised for five years [prior to 1919] under this name.” That is surely enough to entitle plaintiff to protection against anyone using the same or a similar name after plaintiff had so nationally advertised its product. Any name, geographical or otherwise, as applied to a product, becomes an asset of the person who advertises and markets that product as soon as the public begin to associate that name with that product.</p>

It may come to signify a particular quality, e. g., Minneapolis flour, Rochester clothing. It may in time represent a special process, e. g., Budweiser beer. Finally, it may be used to designate the source or origin of a particular product, e. g., Elgin watches, Vienna bread. . . . The statement that geographical names cannot be valid trademarks is obviously too broad. . . . Why should not the person who added a new meaning to words previously signifying place, grade, or quality have the ‘exclusive right’ to use them in this acquired sense? . . . For present purposes, it is a matter of indifference whether geographical names are regarded as trademarks or trade names so long as they are as adequately protected against piracy as the Waltham mark [in <em>American Waltham Watch Co. v. U. S. Watch Co., </em>supra]. No mark, no matter how fanciful or unique, would receive greater protection. The <em>Waltham </em>case does not stand alone. In both the <em>Clenfield Starch </em>and <em>Stone Ale </em>cases, two famous English authorities, absolute injunctions were granted. In view of the broad relief given in these early cases, it is surprising that the notion should ever have developed that geographical names cannot be trade-marks.”</p>

(2) 553, successfully opposed the registration of the word “Quaker” by the Indiana Company. In that case the court said: “It appears from the record that appellee’s [Quaker State Oil Refining Company] trade-marks [“Quaker State Medium,” “QSM,” and “Quaker State”] have been in continuous use by appellee and its predecessor since July 31, 1914, . . . that appellee’s lubricating oils and greases are generally referred to by the term ‘Quaker’; that appellee had utilized practically every available means in advertising its trade-marks and its lubricating motor oils throughout the United States and Canada, . . .; that it has expended more than $2,000,000 in such advertising; and that it has sold its lubricating motor oils under its trade-marks throughout the United States and Canada.” Registration of the word or mark “Quaker” by the Quaker Oil Company of Indiana was denied on the ground that it had not shown any use of the word “Quaker” prior to the use of that word by the Quaker State Oil Refining Co. The second answer is that it is immaterial to the issue in the instant case whether the Indiana Company had used the word “Quaker” to designate its oil before the plaintiff had so used that word. The present controversy is not between the present plaintiff and the Indiana Company. If it were and the Indiana Company could show that it had used the word “Quaker” to identify the oil it advertised and marketed in a certain territory, before the present plaintiff had advertised and marketed its oil in that same <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>territory, it could justly demand the protection the plaintiff now asks for in this case against the defendant. It might well happen that two different corporations or individuals might begin to use in widely separated parts of the country the same trade name to designate the same kind of a product and at about the same time or otherwise. In such a case the right of each to its own territory would doubtless be judicially recognized. For example, in <em>American Radio Stores, Inc., v. American Radio &amp; Television Stores Corp., </em><a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.%20180" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="150 A. 180">150 Atl. 180</a> (1930), the defendant was “enjoined from using as part of its corporate name the word “American” in the territory where the complainant does business and in territory competitively contiguous thereto which is reached by the complainant’s trade and solicited by the complainant’s advertisements.” As Justice Holmes said in <em>American Waltham Watch Co. v. U. S. Watch Co. </em>(supra) : “In cases of this sort, as in so many others, what ultimately is to be worked out is a point or line between conflicting claims, each of which has meritorious grounds, and would be extended further were it not for the other.” Whatever may be the respective rights of the plaintiff and the Indiana Company, they have no bearing on the issue here, that issue being the right of the defendant to use the name “Quaker City” to designate its oil in territory admittedly commercially occupied by plaintiff’s “Quaker State Oil” before the defendant or any other company using the name “Quaker” to designate an oil had entered that territory as a competitor.</p>
