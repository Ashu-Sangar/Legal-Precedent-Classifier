The alternative was liquidation. The directors considered the problem, and finally evolved a plan intended to save the bank by contributions to be madé by certain directors and stockholders. The plan was not carried out in its entirety because some who were supposed to contribute defaulted.</p>

Q. What did you say in answer to what Mr. Abel [president] said? A. I said if the rest do I will; . . .” It was also testified that he said “I’ll go along for $9,000.</p>

The purpose was to agree upon a plan and provide for restoring the capital. Paragraph 1 provides that each party “being owner of certain securities, does hereby assign, transfer, and set over those securities unto Asher G. Abel, Trustee” upon a trust stated in the agreement. These securities, as we understand the record, were the old bank’s property which the Comptroller or his representative had determined to be insufficient as capital investments. A list describing them was made part of the agreement. To make the transfer possible, we understand (though the record leaves this to implication) that these securities became or were treated as the property of the parties to the contract of March 22nd, becoming part of the consideration moving from the bank for the obligations to be assumed by the participating directors to carry out the plan.. Other provisions need not now be stated. The next day defendant gave his note for $9,000 payable to the order of the old bank. At various times thereafter, others (though not all) gave notes, and, in some cases, for less than the $9,000 preliminarily agreed upon. These notes were discounted by the old bank;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> it gave <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>consideration by discounting them, and also by transferring tbe questioned capital investment; tbe maker’s account was credited with the proceeds and he immediately drew his own check for the same amount to the order of the bank or of Abel, as trustee. The agreement provided that each contributor should receive from the trustee a certificate of participation showing his interest in the “pooled” assets, as they are termed in the brief. Such certificates were issued and were also assigned to the bank as collateral. In this way the bank was put in funds for capital reserve account and if all had made their notes the amount contributed would have been $135,000. Instead, the total amount of notes received and discounted was $88,800. The bank continued until it was closed pursuant to the President’s Proclamation, March 4, 1933. It opened later on a restricted basis with Abel, who had been president, as conservator. He acted in that capacity until the old bank’s assets, or such of them as were desired, were sold to the new bank organized in May, 1934. Defendant remained a director of the old bank until it closed, attended meetings and participated in the conduct of its business.</p>

He was therefore interested in having as many as possible of the other directors and stockholders contribute to restore the capital. His real grievance is that the refusal of some resulted in a smaller total contribution than would have been made if all had contributed as he expected. For present purposes, we may assume that as to him there was failure of consideration, though much may be said against the assumption. It is also unnecessary to deal with the parol evidence rule discussed by counsel. We all think <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>that defendant is estopped by his conduct from March <em>22, </em>1932, to May 1, 1934, from now asserting the defense of failure of consideration, or any other suggested on his behalf. The evidence of this estoppel appears in his own testimony and in the admitted documentary evidence. To this we shall now refer in the order in which the events occurred.</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[270,725,1147,359]]]'>(a) From time to time after the date of the agreement, March 22, 1932, Abel, the trustee, credited defendant’s account in the bank with credits due to him, at the specified proportional rate on which the trustee realized from the pooled assets. As late as April, 1934, defendant drew his own check in payment of interest on the note.</p>

It is planned to increase this fund to approximately $120,000 in the near future and use this fund for the purpose of purchasing from the bank certain securities now in default and certain securities which show a decided depreciation in market value. To date securities of this nature carried on our books at $43,072.50 have been entirely eliminated from the Bank’s bond account.” The letter, after stating how it was proposed to deal Avith the situation, continues: “We shall be pleased to have your reaction on this policy as stated in the preceding paragraphs of this letter and beg to renew our previous promises — that we shall use our best endeavors to place the Bank in a position that will merit the approval of your Department.” Defendant was present at the board meeting and testified that when he signed the letter he knew “exactly how many people had given notes,” and that “not all the people mentioned in the caption of the agreement” had given notes, <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>and that the letter was written “for the purpose of showing to him [the Comptroller] that $63,000 of notes had been given.” Not a word did defendant say to the • Comptroller that would indicate that his note was not intended to be the absolute obligation it purported to be by its written terms. The minutes of the board reciting the discount of defendant’s and other directors’ notes without condition, were approved at subsequent meetings in which defendant participated.</p>

Asked why he did that, if the report did not represent the fact as respects his note, he said: “I, not knowing anything about banking, just went along with the rest. . . . Well, I stood back and looked on.” Asked whether he read the report he replied: “Surely, about as much as the rest of them did.” This examination of the condition of the bank occupied the time from May 31 to June 2 and gave opportunity for complete knowledge of the status of the transaction in which the note was given.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Asked about <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>performing Ms statutory duty as a member of the committee he said, “. . .it was sadly neglected. ...

This, too, he says he did without knowing the effect of what he signed, though he would have learned, if he had examined the record of the transaction, that some of those that he thought would sign the agreement had never done so, and had given no notes and that others had given notes in amounts less than $9,000.</p>

It was the Comptroller whom defendant and his associates were asking to stay liquidation of their bank upon the faith of their contributions. The law required the Comptroller to liquidate the bank unless the capital was made good. If they had not contributed, the bank would have been liquidated long before it was.

No conditions they might wish to impose on each other during those negotiations could encumber their contributions without notice to and assent by the Comptroller who was administering the law. It is immaterial, in this suit, that the president of the bank knew, as defendant testified, that before executing the note and the contract, defendant said he would contribute if the others did.

And such was the conduct of plaintiffs in error in this case. They had notice from the Comptroller of the Currency that $194,000 of the items counted as assets of the bank were doubtful and should be collected or charged off. This ‘was a direct warning to them,’ as the trial court said, ‘by the bank examiner and Comptroller that assets to nearly twice the amount of the capital stock were considered doubtful.’ They, notwithstanding, represented the assets to be good. Such disregard of the direction of the officers appointed by the law to examine the affairs of the bank is a violation of the law. Their directions must be observed. Their function and authority cannot be preserved otherwise and be exercised to save the banks from disaster and the public who. deal with them and support them from deception.”</p>
