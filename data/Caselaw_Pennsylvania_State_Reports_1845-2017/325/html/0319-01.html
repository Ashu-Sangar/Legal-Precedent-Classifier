    <p id="b363-3" data-blocks='[["BL_363.6",363,[202,398,1150,588]]]'>This is an action of trespass brought by a minor plaintiff, through his father, and by the father in his own right, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the minor under circumstances hereinafter described. The jury returned verdicts for plaintiffs. Defendant’s motions for a new trial and for judgment non obstante veredicto were overruled by the court below and judgments were entered in favor of the minor plaintiff and his father. The defendant abandoned its motion for a new trial, and has taken this appeal from the refusal of its motion for judgment.</p>
    <p id="b363-4" data-blocks='[["BL_363.7",363,[200,997,1153,851]]]'>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, these are the facts before us: The minor plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as plaintiff) was employed by his father. On October 9, 1934, he was driving his father’s five-ton truck on a return trip from New York City to Philadelphia. He was following at a distance of about five feet another truck belonging to his father, which likewise was being driven to Philadelphia. About 1: 00 A. M. when plaintiff reached a point on the Lincoln Highway near Morrisville, Pennsylvania, he noticed that the bright lights on his truck were not burning properly and stopped on the extreme right side of the highway facing toward Philadelphia, in front of a gasoline station. The preceding truck also came to a stop and stood about five feet in front of plaintiff’s truck.</p>
    <p id="b363-5" data-blocks='[["BL_363.8",363,[196,1869,1156,532]],["BL_364.1",364,[281,334,1149,316]]]'>Plaintiff left his truck standing on the highway in this position about three minutes,- while he entered the service station to borrow from the attendant a screw driver with which to fix his lights. As the truck stood, the motor was running and the low headlights were burning, as well as three electric lights on the rear of-the truck and a lighted kerosene lantern. The gasoline station was well lighted with electric signs and lights at the time of the accident. As plaintiff returned to his truck he stepped in front of it, — into the five-foot space <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>between the two standing trucks. At the same time defendant’s truck, also proceeding towards Philadelphia, collided with the rear end of plaintiff’s truck, pushing it forward and crushing plaintiff between his own truck and the one ahead of it. As a result plaintiff suffered severe personal injuries.</p>
    <p id="b364-4" data-blocks='[["BL_364.5",364,[281,662,1150,575]]]'>The highway at this point was twenty feet wide. A. third concrete traffic lane had been constructed for a distance of several miles, along and adjoining that side of the highway upon which plaintiff stopped his truck. This additional lane had not yet been opened to traffic, and was blocked off by low iron railings and marked with kerosene flares. Plaintiff admitted in his testimony that he had not looked to see if any traffic was approaching before stepping in front of his truck. The negligence of the driver of defendant’s truck was admitted at the trial.</p>
    <p id="b364-5" data-blocks='[["BL_364.6",364,[280,1257,1149,314]]]'>This appeal is limited to the single question whether plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, as a matter of law, in failing to look before stepping upon the highway between the standing trucks, and in stopping his truck on the highway without lighting flares to show its position.</p>
    <p id="b364-6" data-blocks='[["BL_364.7",364,[276,1583,1152,800]],["BL_365.1",365,[192,349,1150,416]]]'>Defendant argues it was plaintiff’s duty to look for possible approaching traffic before stepping in front of the truck. While it is fundamental that a pedestrian should take precaution for his own safety and look for approaching vehicles before crossing a roadway, and that one who fails to observe this duty of care is negligent, this principle has no. application to the facts of this case. The plaintiff here was not struck while attempting to cross the roadway in the path of defendant’s truck, nor did he at any time step into the path of oncoming traffic. At the time he was injured he was standing in front of his own truck, which was stopped and which was plainly visible to anyone approaching from the rear. Under these circumstances we cannot hold as a matter of law that plaintiff was under a duty <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>to anticipate that defendant’s driver would fail to see his truck and crash into it. Plaintiff could properly assume that the driver would observe the truck, under the conditions of light as shown by the testimony, and would bring his machine to a stop before colliding with it, or pass around it upon that portion of the highway which afforded ample clearance for passage of vehicular traffic.</p>
    <p id="b365-3" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[190,784,1153,1230]]]'>In view of the evidence, plaintiff was not under a duty to anticipate or guard against negligence on the part of defendant. His failure to look before stepping in front of his truck did not convict him of contributory negligence as a matter of law. As we said in <em>Wagner v. P. R. T. Co., </em><a href="/pa/252/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="252 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1021604" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0354-01">252 Pa. 354</a>, 359: “The failure to anticipate negligence which results in an injury is not negligence and will not defeat an action for the injury sustained. A party is not bound to guard against the want of ordinary care on the part of another; he has a right to presume that ordinary care will be used to protect him and his property from injury. No, one can complain of want of care in another where care is only rendered necessary by his own wrongful act: <em>Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R. Co. v.

Freihofer Baking Co., </em>supra, plaintiff’s husband, a mechanic, was killed while repairing a broken axle on a bus which was standing on a street in Camden. Although it was night the place was well illuminated by electric lights in addition to three red lights on the rear of the bus. Both decedent and the bus were plainly visible to defendant’s driver, who neverthe-. <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>less so drove Ms truck that it grazed the bus and fatally injured the husband of plaintiff. It was contended that decedent was contributorily negligent. Upon this point we said (p. 576) : “The question of contributory negligence, while debatable, was for the jury. Roberts was doing his work in the usual manner, well protected by red lights and street lights, and it cannot be declared as a matter of law that he was bound to anticipate that an autotruck would pass so near as to graze the bus or strike him even though some part of his body was outside the line of the bus. A man is not necessarily guilty of contributory negligence by being outside the line of his car, while doing some temporary work thei’eon, although it is in the street. See <em>Reisinger v. McConnell, </em><a href="/pa/265/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="265 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="1051906" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0565-01">265 Pa. 565</a>; also <em>Cecola v. 44 Cigar Co., </em><a href="/pa/253/0623-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="253 Pa. 623" data-case-ids="1024044" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0623-01">253 Pa. 623</a>; <em>Petrie v.

During the few minutes the truck stood on the highway the engine was kept running and all the lights were burning, the front head lights being on the low beam. In addition to the four lights on the rear of the truck there were lights from the gas station and the kerosene flares or torches along the edge of the newly laid traffic lane. In view thereof it is clear that the statute does not apply.</p>
