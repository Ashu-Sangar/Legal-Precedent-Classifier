    <p id="b252-11" data-blocks='[["BL_252.16",252,[283,1333,1150,206]]]'>This suit is brought by a husband to recover damages for the death of his wife in an automobile accident. He obtained a verdict and judgment in the court below, from which defendants appeal.</p>
    <p id="b252-12" data-blocks='[["BL_252.17",252,[281,1550,1152,846]]]'>The plaintiff, Thomas Landy, and his wife were guest passengers at the time of the accident, in an automobile belonging to Edward J. Crane, a resident of North Carolina, who with his wife had driven from the South, and was visiting plaintiff at his home in Philadelphia. The accident occurred at the intersection of Third and Vine Streets, in Philadelphia, at an early hour of the morning of May 21, 1932, while it was yet dark. During the preceding evening, a party consisting of Crane, his wife and sister, together with plaintiff and his wife, had driven in Crane’s automobile to Camden, where they had dinner in a restaurant. According to the evidence, each member of the party, during the evening, had also taken “about three glasses of beer apiece.” The automobile which Crane was driving was of the type known as a convertible coupé, with a rumble seat.</p>
    <p id="b253-2" data-blocks='[["BL_253.3",253,[202,343,1152,626]]]'>
      <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>On the return trip to Philadelphia Crane was driving, his sister was beside him, while Mrs. Landy, wife of plaintiff, who was fatally injured in the accident, was next to the sister, on the extreme right of the front seat. In the rumble seat of the car plaintiff sat behind his wife, Avhile beside him in the rear of the driver, was Mrs. Crane. The car proceeded over the Delaware Eiver Bridge, and in an effort to reach Delaware Avenue, Crane drove for several blocks east on Yine Street, against traffic, as Yine Street at this point is a one-way street for westbound traffic, and Avas so marked by signs at each street intersection.</p>
    <p id="b253-3" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[202,990,1151,1020]]]'>As the car traveling east on Yine Street approached the intersection of Third Street, at a speed of approximately twenty-five miles per hour, Crane sounded his horn and looked south on Third Street, but because of the darkness, could see only about twenty-five feet below the corner. He said in his testimony there was no automobile in sight. When midAvay across the intersection, his car was suddenly struck in the centre of the right side by defendants’ truck which was coming north on Third Street. Several witnesses for plaintiff testified that there were no lights on the truck, and that the horn was not sounded at the intersection. The truck was carrying thirteen thousand pounds of produce, and was traveling at the time of the accident at a speed around twenty-five miles an hour. So great was the force of the impact that the left front of defendants’ truck, and the right centre and side of the Crane car were demolished. The weather conditions at the time were clear, and the corner of Third and Yine Streets was well lighted.</p>
    <p id="b253-4" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[203,2023,1150,374]],["BL_254.1",254,[288,343,1146,97]]]'>On behalf of defendants there was testimony that the driver of the truck, upon nearing Vine Street, looked to his right, the direction from which traffic would be expected to come, but before he could turn to look in the opposite direction, the coupé collided with his truck. Their witnesses said that just prior to the accident, the coupé was being driven down Vine Street, against traffic, <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>at a speed of forty-five miles per hour. It was denied by defendants that the truck was without lights.</p>
    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[287,451,1149,521]]]'>Defendants’ negligence was admitted at bar, and the only question is whether the plaintiff, as a guest passenger in the Crane car was guilty of contributory negligence. Defendants contend that plaintiff failed in his duty of care and cannot recover because he did not remonstrate with the driver for proceeding in the wrong direction on a one-way street; and because he did not object when the driver approached and entered upon a street intersection at the speed he was driving when the accident occurred.</p>
    <p id="b254-5" data-blocks='[["BL_254.6",254,[286,993,1149,315]]]'>In order to determine here whether plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, we must first decide whether as a guest passenger he had any control of the vehicle at the time of the accident, and whether his failure to act in some way to avoid the accident convicts him of negligence.</p>
    <p id="b254-6" data-blocks='[["BL_254.7",254,[280,1320,1154,1075]],["BL_255.1",255,[206,354,1152,260]]]'>It is apparent from the evidence that plaintiff’s status in the car in which he and his wife were riding was clearly that of an invited guest. He had no actual control of the car or share in its operation. From his position in the rumble seat his opportunity to observe the street, its traffic conditions, and its one-way markings, was inferior to that of the driver of the car. To require a guest to take part in driving an automobile from a rear seat position would destroy the efficiency of the driver. Constant interference with the driver would increase rather than diminish the danger of accident. Moreover, from the testimony it affirmatively appears that plaintiff was not familiar with the operation of an automobile, not having learned to drive one. As we said, referring to the duties of a guest passenger, in <em>Becker v. Saylor, </em><a href="/pa/317/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="317 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="8846653" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0573-01">317 Pa. 573</a>, 575: “He was on the back seat and unless the circumstances were most unusual was not required to advise the driver how to operate his car. ‘In general, a passenger will not be held guilty of negligence, as a matter of law, for failing to discover <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>perils or to interfere with the driver and this is especially true of one sitting in the back seat <em>(Ferrell v. Solski, </em><a href="/pa/278/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="278 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="1080491" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0565-01">278 Pa. 565</a>), where silence with regard to the driving is generally golden’: <em>Schlossstein v.

    <p id="b255-3" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[206,626,1151,248]]]'>It is argued by defendants that the parties in the automobile were engaged in a common undertaking, and therefore plaintiff must share the responsibility for the accident. We cannot agree with that interpretation of the facts.</p>
    <p id="b255-4" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[204,896,1154,698]]]'>This is not a case where the operation of the vehicle was such that the negligence of the driver of the car may be imputed to the passenger. As Mr. Justice Maxey points out in <em>Rodgers v. Saxton, </em><a href="/pa/305/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="305 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="1134604" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0479-01">305 Pa. 479</a>, 488: “The negligence of the driver of a vehicle can be imputed to a passenger therein only when the evidence justifies a finding of the passenger’s right to a share in the control of that vehicle at the time of the negligence.” In the present case there is no evidence whatsoever that would justify the conclusion that plaintiff had any right to a “voice in the control, management or direction of the vehicle”: <em>Johnson v. Hetrick, </em><a href="/pa/300/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="300 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1125925" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0225-01">300 Pa. 225</a>, 231. Hence negligence here cannot be imputed to plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.6",255,[203,1605,1155,534]]]'>From the evidence before us our conclusion is that the position of plaintiff was merely that of a guest passenger in the car, having no part in its control, and, in the absence of known dangers, having no concern with its operation: <em>Simrell v. Eschenbach, </em><a href="/pa/303/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="303 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1130016" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0156-01">303 Pa. 156</a>; <em>Cormican v.

Moreover, there is no evidence that plaintiff had any knowledge that the driver was proceeding against traffic on a one-way street.</p>
    <p id="b255-6" data-blocks='[["BL_255.7",255,[202,2152,1154,259]],["BL_256.1",256,[280,346,1150,533]]]'>Defendants’ second point is equally without merit. They urge that plaintiff was contributorily negligent because of inaction at the time of the accident. They contend that he should have remonstrated with the driver, and objected to the manner in which he was driving the <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>car. It is true that an invited guest is not wholly without responsibilty as an occupant of a car. Where there are dangers reasonably manifest and known to the guest, and he has an opportunity to influence the situation for safety, if he sits by without warning the driver, and permits himself to be driven carelessly to his injury, or if he joins with the driver in testing danger, this is negligence which will bar recovery by him: <em>Hardie v. Barrett, </em><a href="/pa/257/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="257 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1032452" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0042-01">257 Pa. 42</a>; <em>Minnich v. Easton Trans.

Phila. Rapids Trans. Co., </em><a href="/pa/290/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="290 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="1104456" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0288-01">290 Pa. 288</a>, 296.

He is not required constantly to look out for danger.”</p>
