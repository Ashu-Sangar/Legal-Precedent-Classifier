    <p id="b373-9" data-blocks='[["BL_373.15",373,[198,1169,1151,317]]]'>The question here involved is whether the discharge of a bankrupt, upon the dismissal of objections of his trustee that the bankrupt had transferred his property in fraud of creditors, affects the right of the trustee, after the discharge, to proceed with a suit to set aside such transfers as fraudulent conveyances.</p>
    <p id="b373-10" data-blocks='[["BL_373.16",373,[198,1497,1152,749]]]'>The plaintiff, as substituted trustee in bankruptcy of William J. Knupp, instituted this proceeding in equity to avoid certain conveyances of his property made by the bankrupt prior to the filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. The bill, after reciting the conveyances in detail, alleged that they were made to the transferees without consideration, at a time when the bankrupt was insolvent, and with intent to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors. The transferees are named as defendants in the proceeding. It is averred that the defendants received and are holding the properties upon a secret trust for the benefit of the bankrupt. The bill prays that the conveyances be declared fraudulent, and the property be reconveyed to the plaintiff trustee.</p>
    <p id="b373-11" data-blocks='[["BL_373.17",373,[199,2256,1150,157]],["BL_374.1",374,[295,342,1147,89]]]'>The defendants, in their separate answers to the bill, admit the transfers, but deny fraudulent intent, the insolvency of William J. Knupp at the time of the several <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>transfers, and that they were made without a fair consideration.</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[294,452,1150,425]]]'>When the application of the bankrupt for a discharge came before the United States District Court, it was opposed by the trustee upon the ground that the transfers made by the bankrupt (identical with those alleged in the bill) were fraudulent. The District Court, after hearing testimony upon this question, overruled the trustee’s objections and granted the discharge. No appeal was taken from this order.</p>
    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.6",374,[290,888,1152,1071]]]'>On September 10,1935, prior to a consideration of the present case upon its merits, the bankrupt, who was joined as a defendant in this proceeding, was granted leave to file an amended answer to the bill. The amended answer avers the adjudication in bankruptcy, the application for discharge, the objection thereto by the trustee, and the granting of the discharge by the District Court. It asserts that the question of fraud in the transfers, having been raised and decided adversely to the trustee in the bankruptcy proceeding, is now res adjudicata with respect to the present case. The trustee thereupon filed preliminary objection to the amended answer in accordance with Equity Rule 55, and ordered the questions raised thereby upon the argument list. The court below concluded that the case was set down for hearing on bill and answer. It decided that the plea of res adjudicata was well taken, made findings of fact in favor of the defendants, and dismissed the bill. Exceptions of the trustee having been overruled, this appeal followed.</p>

The order of the bankruptcy court granting the discharge is not res adjudicata with respect to this proceeding to set aside alleged fraudulent transfers of the bankrupt’s property. This is true even though the District Court decided that the very transfers in question were not made with an intent to hinder, delay or defraud cred<a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>itors. Of this there can be no doubt. The issues involved in the two proceedings are not identical, and upon the same facts are susceptible of different determinations. The necessary elements which must be present to render a judgment obtained in a prior proceeding res ad judicata in a subsequent one have been stated many times by this Court. It was said by Mr. Justice Brown, in <em>Siegfried v. Boyd, </em><a href="/pa/237/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="237 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="988923" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0055-01">237 Pa. 55</a>, (p. 59) <em>“. </em>. .to make a matter res adjudicata there must be a concurrence of the four following conditions: (1) Identity in the thing sued for; (2) identity of the cause of action; (3) identity of persons and of parties to the action; (4) identity of the quality in the persons for or against whom the claim is made.” See also <em>Woodburn v. Pa. R. R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/294/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="294 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1113380" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0174-01">294 Pa. 174</a>; <em>West Leechburg Boro. v.

The required identity of conditions is not here present. The two proceedings' differ radically in the thing for which suit is instituted. The suit by the trustee to set aside fraudulent transfers is brought for the purpose of recovering assets which rightfully belong to the bankrupt estate. The discharge proceeding is an application by the bankrupt for a release from his provable debts. Just as the issues vary, so do the proofs which are required. In the action to set aside a fraudulent conveyance the intention of the bankrupt is relatively immaterial; in the discharge proceeding it is all important.</p>

It was error to proceed with the case as upon a hearing on bill and answer.

Therefore it was improper, under the circumstances, for the court below to make findings of fact, and they cannot stand. The plaintiff’s objection by its terms was directed to the amended answer alone, and questioned the sufficiency of the plea of res adjudicata therein contained. For that purpose the truth of the allegations contained in the amended answer was admitted and nothing more. This cannot be construed as an admission of the allegations of the original answer. This method of pleading is prescribed by our Equity Rules 48 and 55. There being no averments of new matter in the original answer, the plaintiff was under no obligation to reply to explanatory allegations contained in the amended answer: Equity Rule 52.
