She was a spinster, about 59 years old, who had made her home with her brother, a bachelor. They had made reciprocal wills. He died suddenly on the 27th or 28th of March.

As undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity necessarily shade into each other, we shall not make a separate statement of the evidence as related to each of these two ultimate facts for the existence of which appellant contends. Dr. Heffner’s father had been physician to the testatrix over a period of years, in consequence of which she had known the son from boyhood; after he reached maturity and became a physician he succeeded his father as her physician. At Christmas she was in the habit of giving him a present of $20.00. A witness, who had been a nurse in the doctor’s service testified that during the <em>8y2 </em>years in which she had been employed by him, she saw the testatrix “an average of forty times a year”; that more than once testatrix expressed her high regard for the doctor and for his young son whom she referred to as “Bobby” saying “Bobby Heffner is the same to me as a son. If the time ever comes that he needs assistance he is going to get it, whether it is now or after I am gone.” She testified that testatrix made other statements indicating appreciation of his services to her. A few days before her death she said, “I know I am going to die. I am going to remember Dr. Heffner in my will.” This witness conversed with the testatrix in the hospital on the afternoon of the day before she died and testified that she “was a little better” and appeared to be “all right.” “She answered all his questions (asked by Dr. Willis) perfectly sane.” Dr. Willis was the head of the hospital staff.</p>

I think she said she wanted to make a will and Dr. Heffner asked me to get a piece of paper and I gave it to him and I left the room.” Dr. Heffner testified that testatrix said; “Get a piece of paper and write down what I have to say.” There is evidence that Miss Elliott was first requested to leave the room by the testatrix and that the doctor then also requested her to leave. Testatrix had two nurses, a day nurse and a night nurse. During the period in which testatrix instructed the doctor what she wanted in her will the day nurse was in the adjoining room and heard nearly all the testatrix said. The doctor also testified what occurred and is corroborated by this witness as to matters which she heard while in the adjoining room. Decedent’s hearing was impaired to such extent that it was necessary to speak to her in a loud voice.

I said, ‘Lizzie, do you want to write your will?’ She said, ‘Yes, I want to write my will.’ Q. Now, just detail what took place. Tell us what took place and in what sequence as far as you can. A. She started out. She said, ‘Florence Hartman, I give $1,000 out and out.’ I said, ‘Is that all right to put that in the form of the will?’ She said, ‘Absolutely.’ She then made those other bequests and she came down to the matter of the family of Borneman. Well, she said, ‘William Borneman, should I give him $500 or what should I give?’ I said, ‘He has a large family, you and I have talked about his family and no matter what you do for him it will be appreciated.’ She said, ‘Well, give him a thousand dollars.’ I said, ‘Now, Lizzie, do you want this in the form of a will?’ She said, ‘Yes.’ I said, ‘We will have to have witnesses to the will.’ Q. What did she say with reference to any disposition to you? A. She said, ‘How about you?’ I said,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> ‘Lizzie, of course I would appreciate it if you want to remember me.’ She told me what she wanted to do as far as I was concerned. She said, ‘You have been with me during many of the crises of my life.’ I said, ‘Do you want me to put that in the will?’ and she said, ‘Yes.’ . . . Q. What, if anything, did you say to her before you got the witnesses in to sign and witness the will? A. Well, we discussed — we went over the matter of her estate. She talked about how her estate had shrunk. <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>She had some shares of the Boyer town Burial and Casket Company and she said if she had only sold out some five years or so ago she would have gotten almost double. Q. Did she say anything about the principal amount or the size of her estate? A. I don’t recall that she did. She asked me the amount as we went along to see how much of the estate would be left. Q. After this will' was written was it read over to her? A. It was read to her twice. Q. By whom? A. By myself. There is another thing.

She said that sometime “around eleven o’clock” she heard Dr. Heffner and Miss Geist talking; “I heard very distinctly what he said.” Of Miss Geist’s answers to the doctor’s questions, she testified “Her answer was not as plain to me as Dr. Heffner’s questions and answers were. ...” When Dr. Heffner mentioned the name of Irving Geist “I heard Miss Geist say no”; she heard the same reply to other names suggested by the doctor. This witness also corroborated the other nurses as to what was said when they were asked to witness the will. She testified “I heard him read what sounded like a will to Miss Geist.” It was “the same things that I had heard before.” Asked whether she heard “any conversation between Miss Geist and Dr. Heffner relating to any disposition of the estate to Dr. Heffner” the witness replied “It wasn’t very much, but I just heard the doctor say, ‘I am getting something out of it.’<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> I can’t tell you the amount, but I do remember hearing Dr. Heffner mentioning himself.

It does not appear whether this was due to the contagious character of the illness or because he thought the patient should have complete rest. One of these witnesses was the pastor of the church decedent attended. Dr. Heffner told him that she was very ill but permitted him to see her. The clergyman said her face was much swollen and that she seemed very deaf; he was in the room with her “not over twenty minutes”; he asked her whether he should pray and he understood her to assent, whereupon he did so. Another witness, Mrs. Hartman, daughter of a first cousin of the decedent, saw her on the 22nd, 27th and the 28th of March. On one of these days she found her very deaf and apparently unable to hear or understand what the witness was saying.

Appellant stresses the challenging fact that Doctor Heffner who wrote the will is the principal beneficiary. The court has given this contention very careful consideration in the light of what is said on that subject by appellant’s learned counsel. The death of decedent’s brother, almost immediately before her own, increased her estate by the amount she received under Ms will. But the evidence will not permit us to say that she was not fully conscious of the increase of her estate or that she did not have it in mind when she made her will; on the contrary the evidence impresses us as describing a sick woman who thought she would not recover and who wished to make a will and knew exactly what she wished done with her property.</p>

We think there is no ground for the suggestion that the testatrix was incompetent to make a will. So, too, there is no ground for finding that she was unduly influenced® by Dr. Heffner in making this will. Nor was she in such a condition mentally as to cast the burden of disproving undue influence upon the doctor who drew the will in the circumstances described. With the evidence in that state there is no question for the jury because, as the cases cited above show, if the jury had disregarded the evidence and made another will for her, the court would have been obliged to set aside the verdict.</p>
