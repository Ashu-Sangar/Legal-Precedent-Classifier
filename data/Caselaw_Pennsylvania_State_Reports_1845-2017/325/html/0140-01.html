The defendant, a Maryland corporation, is duly registered in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Service of the summons was made upon it in accordance with the provisions of Section 1011 of the Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, by having the sheriff of Dauphin County leave copies of the process with the Secretary of the Commonwealth.</p>

The court below discharged the rule and ordered defendant to file an affidavit of defense to the merits within fifteen days. Defendant then took this appeal.</p>

    <p id="b186-4" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[281,508,1148,1445]]]'>We find no merit in the contention of defendant that the right of action upon these contracts arose in New York. It argues that because the contracts were first signed by plaintiff in Pittsburgh and then executed by defendant in New York City, the obligation of defendant was to make the monthly payments in New York, since no other place of payment was designated in the contracts; that these contracts having been made in New York, it must be held that the breach occurred, and the right of action arose there. But, as we have seen, the parties themselves by their acts clearly indicated an intention to make Pittsburgh the place of payment. In consequence the breach of performance on the part of defendant occurred when it failed to make the payments in Allegheny County, and it is there that the right of action arose. This question was before the Superior Court in <em>Koswig v. Ellison &amp; Sons, </em><a href="/pa-super/89/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="89 Pa. Super. 208" data-case-ids="671246" data-case-paths="/pa-super/89/0208-01">89 Pa. Superior Ct. 208</a>. The Court said, adopting the opinion of the court below, (p. 213) “The sale of goods may result in á cause of action for their price, but the cause of action cannot arise until payment thereof becomes due, and <em>it then arises at the place where the money should he paid. </em>The buyer’s failure to pay for the goods according to his contract with the seller fixes the time when and place where a cause of action arises in respect to the purchase money. To these questions the locality in which the sale is agreed upon has no relation whatever.”</p>
    <p id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.6",186,[267,1965,1157,250]]]'>It follows, therefore, that the right of action upon these contracts arose in Allegheny County, and the ■ venue of the action was there properly laid.
