    <p id="b584-14" data-blocks='[["BL_584.18",584,[291,1701,1150,535]]]'>A surviving husband seeks to claim against his wife’s will, although he did not file his election so to do until three years and almost eight months after the probate of the will and the grant of letters testamentary thereon, whereas the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, Sec. 23 (b), as amended by the Act of April 2, 1925, P. L. 117, Sec. 1, and the Act of April 24, 1929, P. L. 648, Sec. 1, 20 P.S. Sec. 262, requires the election to be delivered to the executor within one year after the issuance of letters testamentary.</p>

From the decree entered the husband brings this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b585-5" data-blocks='[["BL_585.5",585,[182,456,1151,197]]]'>The circumstance which gives rise to the controversy is that the will of the deceased was signed and probated in her maiden name, Irene Broad, not in her married one of Irene Doerr.</p>
    <p id="b585-6" data-blocks='[["BL_585.6",585,[183,674,1151,911]]]'>The parties were married in 1916 and lived together in Reading, Philadelphia, and in the Township of Tinicum, Delaware County, until June 28, 1921, on which date the appellant says his wife left their home and never returned. He never saw her again. She died August 19, 1928. Her will was probated September 11, 1928, and letters testamentary were issued thereon the same day to her mother, Sarah L. Washer, who was named executrix. The advertisement of the grant of letters provided for by the 10th section of the Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, 20 P.S. Sec. 441, appeared in the publications required by the Act on September 14, 1928, and in five successive weeks thereafter. The advertisements were under the designations, “Estate of Irene Doerr or Irene Broad.” The husband did not present his election to take against the will to the executrix until May 7,1932.</p>
    <p id="b585-7" data-blocks='[["BL_585.7",585,[183,1597,1150,315]]]'>The appellant testified that he knew nothing of his wife’s whereabouts or of her death from the time they parted in 1921 until July, 1931, and that it was not until February, 1932, that he became acquainted with the fact that she had left a will. He then delayed for three months in presenting his election.</p>
    <p id="b585-8" data-blocks='[["BL_585.8",585,[182,1924,1151,313]]]'>While the parties were living in Reading, the husband was convicted of the crime of arson and sentenced to the penitentiary, where he served for two years and eight months. He says his wife also was convicted, although no proof was offered of this except his mere statement. He also said that he had been pardoned. .</p>

    <p id="b586-4" data-blocks='[["BL_586.5",586,[288,503,1149,315]]]'>The court further decided that the published notice as it was entitled, “Estate of Irene Doerr or Irene Broad” gave notice to the world that Irene Doerr was dead. There was no endeavor to conceal the fact that Irene Broad was Irene Doerr; on the contrary, notice of this was given by the advertisements.</p>
