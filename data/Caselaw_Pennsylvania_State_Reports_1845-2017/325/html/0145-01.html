The cases in other jurisdictions are not particularly helpful because of the variety of statutes under which they are decided, and because of the conflicting opinions expressed. Some states have held under statutes similar to our law, that the desertion of the husband, or the desertion and infidelity of the wife, would preclude either of them from bringing the action and entitle the member of the group next entitled to sue: See <em>Lytle v.

The trend of Pennsylvania decisions is to bar an action by those in another class while a member of a prior class is still alive. In <em>Lehigh Iron Co. v. Rupp, </em>supra, an action was brought by the parents for the death of a minor child. The deceased left a widow who had made a settlement with the tortfeasor. The court held that the right of the parents to sue did not exist while the widow still lived even though she had released her right to bring the action. In <em>Shambach v. Middlecreek Elec. Co., </em>supra, the deceased was survived by a widow and minor children. The widow instituted an action but discontinued it and executed a release to the defendant. The children brought an action in their own names. The Superior Court held that no right of action was in the children. We affirmed this ruling on appeal Per Curiam. In <em>Marsh v.

The widow had refused to prosecute the claim and there was evidence that she had attempted to assign her rights to the guardian. We held that the action was not assignable, and the right to sue was in the widow alone. Her failure to avail herself of it barred the child’s suit. In <em>Di Paolo v. </em>

The husband by his desertion (as the case comes up on demurrer to a statement of claim alleging desertion, we must take it to be a fact) has disqualified himself, not from the bringing of suit, but as a member of the class having a beneficial interest in the proceeds. The basis of recovery under the statute is the family relation, its purpose being to reimburse the family for their loss. The deserting husband is no longer a member of the family group, having by his voluntary act severed the family relation. He has no loss himself and therefore is entitled to no beneficial recovery.</p>

The defendant will thus be in all respects in the same position as if the husband had brought suit voluntarily in his own name. If there be a recovery the proceeds can be paid into court and equitable distribution made among those entitled.
