    <p id="b470-7" data-blocks='[["BL_470.12",470,[294,1103,1151,853]]]'>Appellee brought this action to recover damages resulting from oil escaping from appellant’s pipe line which entered appellee’s dyeing plant, causing injury to the machinery and to cloth in the process of dyeing. Both sides asked for permission, to inspect the other’s plant and system which was granted. Each side filed a bill for discovery with interrogatories. Appellee’s interrogatories were designed to elicit information concerning the operation of the line, the age of the pipe, and the amount of oil that escaped. Its prayer was granted. Appellant then requested answers to 27 interrogatories of its own. The court below sustained preliminary objections filed by appellee to all of these but two which related to appellee’s conduct after discovering the presence of oil in its plant and machinery. Appellant here complains of this action.</p>

Jurisdiction in discovery was given to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County by the Acts of June 16,1836, P. L. 784, and April 10, 1848, P. L. 448, and was conferred generally <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>upon the courts of common pleas throughout the State by the Act of February 14,1857, P. L. 39. It is available in actions of trespass and may be invoked by either plaintiff or defendant. See <em>Bains v. Goldey, </em><a href="/pa/35/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="35 Pa. 51" data-case-ids="990443" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0051-01">35 Pa. 51</a>; <em>Compton, Tr., v.

In the early period of the Commonwealth’s legal history it provided the only means whereby such information could be obtained, because at law a party could not obtain the production of books, records and documents which were in his opponent’s custody. This function of equity has not been usurped by the reforms in law practice under the Act of February 27, 1798, 3 Smith Laws 303, which permits the use of the subpoena duces tecum for the production of records and documents at trial: <em>Lesser v. Henry, </em><a href="/pa-super/50/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="50 Pa. Super. 440" data-case-ids="428502" data-case-paths="/pa-super/50/0440-01">50 Pa. Superior Ct. 440</a>. While the law courts are now able to assist litigants to a far greater extent in this regard, the jurisdiction of equity over bills of discovery in aid of actions at law has not for that reason been lost, although its aid is less frequently invoked: <em>Compton v. International Harvester Co., </em>supra; <em>Dock v. Dock, </em><a href="/pa/180/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="180 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="888317" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0014-01">180 Pa. 14</a>; <em>Lesser v.

S. 533</a>; Pomeroy, op. cit., supra, section 193. The legal remedy is not complete, for the circumstances in which a litigant can obtain the production of books or records prior to trial are few at law. See <em>Raub v. Van Horn, </em><a href="/pa/133/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="133 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="812888" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0573-01">133 Pa. 573</a>; <em>Compton, Tr., v.
