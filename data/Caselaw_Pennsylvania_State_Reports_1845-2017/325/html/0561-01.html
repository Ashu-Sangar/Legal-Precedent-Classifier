Whitaker, and on her death, to her two children, J. G. N. Whitaker and Anna Whitaker (now Jardine). Upon the death of J. G. N. Whitaker on January 21, 1928, Anna Jardine became and continues as the party solely entitled to the income.</p>

In 1912, through an increase in capitalization by the company, the trust estate received subscription rights equal in number to the shares held by it in the Fidelity Trust Company. These were sold at an average price of $515.87 a right. The book value of each share was $687.73! The difference between this book value and the intact value of each share of $443.32 represented earnings which had accumulated after the creation of the trust. The difference between the sale price of a right and accumulated earnings, or $72.55 per share, was capital gain.</p>

The life tenants made no claim for an apportionment of the proceeds of the rights and the adjudication awarding the proceeds to principal was confirmed absolutely. Following the death of the first life tenant, a second account was filed, stating: “This account is stated to show the amount of net income due the Estate of Mary E. Whitaker, Deceased, to the date of her death January 16,1916.” To the second account filed in 1924, again no exceptions were taken by the life tenants and it was confirmed.</p>

These were retained in the trust until 1934 when they were sold at an average price of $269.79 a share. The dispute between the remaindermen and life tenants in the court below and here centers about the proceeds of the stock rights retained by the trustees as principal or, conversely, the distribution and apportionment of the proceeds of the sale of the stock.</p>

L. 447, we have held that when an account has been audited, adjudicated and confirmed absolutely, a petition for review cannot be entertained more than five years thereafter. While this proceeding is not in form a petition for review* to now go beyond the prior adjudications after the elapse of five years, and correct an error to which the life tenants had full opportunity to object, would be an indirect method of disregarding the statutory limitation upon reviews of accounts. In <em>Stetson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/305/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="305 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1134595" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0062-01">305 Pa. 62</a>, the trustee received and sold stock rights and allocated the proceeds to principal. Accounts showing such allocation were approved by the court and confirmed absolutely without exception by the life tenant. It was held that the claim of the life tenant to these proceeds was barred after five years following the confirmation of the account. This court stated: “. . . this section of the Act of 1917 (Section 48) must be construed to mean that the party ‘alleging errors in such account, or in any adjudication of the orphans’ court, or any report’ . . . can only effectively do so ‘within five years after the final decree confirming’ the account.” See also <em>Elkins’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/325/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="325 Pa. 373" data-case-ids="1172288" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0373-01">325 Pa. 373</a>.

    <p id="b607-4" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[188,1606,1152,802]]]'>It is now argued that the quality of the proceeds placed in principal or corpus from the sale of the rights was not changed — that they were still earnings and were not included definitely in the prior adjudications. It is difficult to understand this position when we consider the finality of the action of the court below. It is true that in <em>Bullitt’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/308/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="308 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="1140308" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0413-01">308 Pa. 413</a>, we held that an adjudication was not res judicata of a sum fixed for intact value by the trustees, but none was there established by the court below, a fact clearly demonstrable from the records. Here, whatever may have been the purpose of placing the proceeds in principal, subsequent decrees have so sealed it there in its changed aspect, that to disturb it now would be to avoid the act of assembly providing for the repose of accounts.</p>

In the apportionment of a second stock dividend the court held that the first stock dividend became a part of the principal at its then value. We held, however, that the intact value of the original shares was not to be increased because of this. The action of the trustees in this case in reducing the value of the Fidelity Trust Company shares to the par value was, therefore, properly rejected by the court below.</p>

    <p id="b609-6" data-blocks='[["BL_609.6",609,[179,1109,1152,532]]]'>A considerable surplus was accumulated after the testator’s death, and as a result the stock had a book value over and above the intact value. It is admitted that this surplus value was due to earnings accumulated after the testator’s death. From 1931 to 1934, as a result of the depression, a write-down in the value of the bank’s assets was made and the depreciation charged against surplus or what might be termed the undivided profits account. It affirmatively appears in the record that this was the method used by the bank in charging the loss.</p>

There the loss not only wiped out the entire surplus earned after the death of the testator, but encroached into the surplus accumulated prior to his death and which, therefore, made up part of the intact value. Accordingly it was held that both life tenant and remaindermen must share the loss. Here the loss affected only the surplus accumulated after testator’s death; it did not touch upon the surplus accumulated prior thereto.</p>

The good faith of the corporation in this action not being impugned, under the facts what occurred was plainly a business loss. It is proper that the loss be borne by undivided profits or the surplus account. The losses occurred during the period of the last life tenancy and were charged against the most recently accumulated surplus. This succeeded in wiping out any share of the surplus to which the present life tenant, Mrs. Jardine, might have been entitled after the death of J. G. N. Whitaker. The surplus remaining was then “equitably” divided between the estates of the two deceased life tenants and Mrs. Jardine.</p>

The surplus and other items of value remain, subject to debts, reverses, losses and declines in value because of business conditions.

But the surplus has no such immunity and, but recently, this court rejected a claim that apportionment should be made when the life tenant dies so as to leave only the intact value of the stock for the remaindermen, and give undistributed surplus to the estate of the life tenant: <em>Daily’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/323/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="323 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1169592" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0042-01">323 Pa. 42</a>. To hold as is here contended would strip the succeeding life tenants for the benefit of the first. While our rules provide for an apportionment where the stock is sold, the price obtained by the sale is not always representative of the entire accumulated surplus. To award the <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>estate of the first life tenant a share in the same based on the calculations as of her death might very well deprive the succeeding life tenants of any share in this surplus notwithstanding that it may have been earned in part, at least, during the period of their estates. In distributing the surplus on a proportionate basis as the court below did, each succeeding life tenant bore his share of the burden of the loss attributable to his undistributed surplus. The award was a most equitable determination of a difficult question and one that does substantial justice to all parties.</p>

We cannot conceive of any sound reason to deny the life tenant his share in realized surplus when we consider that this court has held over and over again that our concern is always for the life tenant. To see earnings pyramided for years in surplus and the stock market value increase until the last living or a favored life tenant appears, then to liquidate the stock and give to that life tenant the earnings for these years reflected in sale price and deny them to the estates of the intermediate life tenant during which the earnings accrued, can scarcely be regarded as fair. Indeed the reason underlying the Pennsylvania rule is applicable to this very situation. The extent to which an apportionment may take place between successive life tenants must be governed by the facts in each case, and the conclusion of the court below on such facts will be adopted in this court unless there is an abuse of power.</p>
