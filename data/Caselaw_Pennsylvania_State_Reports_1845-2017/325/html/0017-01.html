Monaghan, the man whose life is alleged to have been unlawfully taken, was at the time under arrest and in the custody of officers of the law. On September 14, 1936, information was made by the coroner charging the assistant county detective and two members of the State police with Monaghan’s murder. Two days later James A. Reilly, district attorney of the county, one of the appellants, petitioned the President Judge of the judicial district to request the Attorney General to retain and employ a special attorney to represent the Commonwealth in the case in accordance with the provisions of section 907 of the Administrative Code of April 9, 1929, P. L. 177, 71 P.S. sec. 297, which reads as follows: “Special Attorneys in Criminal Cases.— When the president judge, in the district having jurisdiction of any criminal proceedings, before any court of oyer and terminer, general jail delivery, or quarter sessions, in this Commonwealth, shall request the Attorney General to do so, in writing, setting forth that, in his judgment, the ease is a proper one for the Commonwealth’s intervention, the Attorney General is hereby authorized and empowered to retain and employ a special attorney or attorneys, as he may deem necessary, properly to represent the Commonwealth in such proceedings, and to investigate charges, and prosecute the alleged offenders against the law. Any attorney, so retained and employed, shall supersede the district attorney of the county in which the case or cases may arise, and shall investigate, prepare, and bring to trial the case or cases to which he may be assigned. He shall take the oath of office required by law to be taken by district attorneys, and shall be clothed with all the powers and subject to all the liabilities imposed upon them by law. The compensation for services rendered, and necessary <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>expenses incurred by such attorney or attorneys, shall be fixed by the Attorney General.”</p>

The three judges of the courts of the county thereupon asked the Attorney General to personally conduct the prosecution of such persons as might be involved in the crime. The Governor of the Commonwealth directed the Attorney General to continue the investigation and personally to conduct the prosecution of any indictments which should be found. Whereupon the Attorney General designated himself special attorney under the section of the Act of 1929 which has been quoted, and, in that capacity, and as Attorney General, drew and signed indictments charging the district attorney and others with the murder of Monaghan. The Attorney General appeared before the grand jury and presented the evidence which his investigation had disclosed, with the result that certain individuals, including the district attorney, were indicted for murder. Thereafter this proceeding was begun challenging the right of the Attorney General to designate himself as special attorney and to supersede the district attorney. The court below, one of the judges dissenting, dismissed the writ, from which order these appeals are taken.</p>

It is further stated in the brief: “The powers and prerogatives of the <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>Attorney General ex officio are not involved. Whether he may conduct an investigation before the grand jury, whether he may appear before the grand jury in an endeavor to procure the indictment of persons charged or suspected of crime, whether he may sign a bill of indictment, or whether he may appear in court and conduct a prosecution against indicted persons, are all beside the point.” With this view we cannot agree. The Attorney General carries with him his official character and powers wherever he appears on behalf of the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b63-3" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[192,904,1151,739]]]'>The office of Attorney General is an ancient one. It came into being as a necessary adjunct in the administration of the common law of England and was transported to America in the early days of the establishment of government in the colonies as part of their English derived common law. So we learn from Colonial Records, Yol. 1, p. 188, where it appears that at a meeting of the “Councill” at Philadelphia on June 5,1686, David Lloyd presented his commission given by the Governor, bearing date April 24, 1686, “Constituting him atturney Genii for this Province and Territorys, To wch he was attested, Declaring his allegiance to ye King, fidelity to the Govr &amp; Governmet, and faithfull performance of his Office.”</p>

It seems that the <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>first record of the King appearing before Ms court represented by counsel was during the 13th century. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the King had no officials corresponding to an Attorney General and Solicitor General. These offices did not come into existence until the latter part of the 15th and the early 16th centuries. During the early period of English legal history, the King was represented by numerous attorneys. They were appointed by letters patent which set forth their duties, the area over which their authority extended and the courts in which they were to practice. These attorneys were known by various names such as “attornati regis,” “narratoreas pro rege,” men “qui secuuntur pro rege” and the King’s serjeants. During the middle ages the tendency arose to supersede these several attorneys with limited powers by a single attorney with much wider ones and to give this attorney the right to appoint deputies. This process was complete by the end of the 17th century and the two King’s attorneys, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General, became the most important law officers of his kingdom.</p>

The early records of English criminal prosecutions show that they were conducted by a private prosecutor or by the King’s serjeant. This condition existed up until the year 1637 at least. The records of these cases exhibit, however, that in the more important criminal prosecutions, particularly those involving the security of the Crown, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General were present at the trial along with the King’s serjeant and often addressed the jury at the conclusion of the trial. This situation existed until the Cromwellian Civil War at which time Blackstone says that the King’s premier serjeant was the leading lawyer of his day and took precedence over the King’s Attorney General. Following the Civil War and until quite recent times the Attorney General was the only person in England who corresponded to a public prosecutor.</p>

Speaking through Mr. Justice Linn, we observed: “Prior to the Act of May 3, 1850, P. L. 654, 16 P.S. sec. 1691, the attorney general was represented in each county by his deputy who conducted criminal prosecutions; by that statute the office of district attorney was created and that officer was charged with the performance of the duties thertofore performed by the deputy attorney general. Thereafter the prosecutor was elected instead of appointed, but the power of general supervision vested in the attorney general over the performance of a district attorney’s duties in the county was not taken away; that power remained, and it is matter of general information that the power had been exercised from time to time when necessary. In part, this supervision is now regulated by section 907 of the Administrative Code. Consideration of the historic development in this Commonwealth of the office of attorney general and the office of district attorney at once distinguishes the cases cited by appellant from other states said to hold that the legislature may not provide for temporarily displacing prosecuting attorneys.”</p>

We think this by no means follows. He is just what the act says he is, a special attorney “retained and employed” by the Attorney General to represent the Commonwealth in the particular matter or matters just as the Attorney General may retain and employ special attorneys to represent the Commonwealth in other special situations when in his judgment it is proper to do so. The person so retained and employed is the representative of the Attorney General for the time being and in the business confided to his care. The attorney so retained and employed, under the terms of the act, supersedes the district attorney only in the case or eases to which he may be assigned, not generally. <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>It is further argued that the Act of 1929, having provided for the appointment of special attorneys and specified their duties and powers, the course provided by the act is controlling and exclusive under the terms of the Act of March 21, 1806, 4 Sm. L. 826, sec. 13, 46 P.S. sec. 156, which reads: “In all cases where a remedy is provided, or duty enjoined, or anything directed to be done by any act or acts of assembly of this Commonwealth, the directions of the said acts shall be strictly pursued, and no penalty shall be inflicted, or anything done agreeably to the provisions of the common law in such cases, further than shall be necessary for carrying such act or acts into effect.” It is said that because of this statute the Attorney General may not name himself as special attorney, but must follow the Act of 1929 and appoint another. The whole line of decisions under the Act of 1806 shows that it has no bearing on the situation before us, but, if it had, the complete answer is that the Attorney General did not have to appoint himself.' In virtue of his high office without more, he could act in the manner he has. We can see no valid reason why the Attorney General should not designate himself as special prosecuting attorney if the exigency in his judgment required this to be done and if such action was necessary to qualify him to act. As heretofore pointed out, we think such designation not necessary in view of the Attorney General’s broad common law powers. These powers were in no wise curtailed by the 907th section of the Administrative Code. It may have somewhat enlarged them. It was a recognition of the common law powers which he already possessed and provided the manner of their exercise.</p>

There can be no question in this case that the district attorney should be displaced. He cannot prosecute himself. It is conceded that he may be displaced by some one whom the Attorney General may retain and employ. It is difficult to give a sound reason why the Attorney General, instead of retaining another lawyer, shall not step into the breach himself. The Act does not say that he may not do so, it simply authorizes him to name another if in his opinion that is the proper thing to do. But, as before stated, we think it was not necessary for the Attorney General to name himself as special attorney. He could act in person without assuming .the lesser role. He could under the circumstances here existing have done so without request from the president judge. We agree with what was said in <em>State ex rel. v. Robinson, </em>supra, “We have numerous instances where particular duties are expressly imposed upon the county attorney, yet it is clear that the attorney general has the right, in virtue of his office, to cooperate with or act independently of that official in all cases where the public interests justify it.” <em>Snyder’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/301/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="301 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1126384" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0276-01">301 Pa. 276</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%2033" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="152 A. 33">152 A. 33</a>, called to our attention in appellants’ brief has no bearing on the controversy now before us; that was a disbarment proceeding against a lawyer who happened to be district attorney.

Furthermore, the Attorney General is here acting under the direct command of the Governor, who is charged with the people’s mandate (Constitution, Art.
