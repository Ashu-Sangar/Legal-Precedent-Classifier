    <p id="b597-10" data-blocks='[["BL_597.12",597,[177,1324,1154,750]]]'>At the audit of the account of the administrator c. t. a. eight persons, decedent’s sister, brother, nephews and nieces claimed, as beneficiaries under eight trusts, certain bonds which decedent had caused to be registered in his name as trustee for them respectively. The learned court below held that, in declaring the trusts, his intention was testamentary and that they were revoked by his will. Distribution was ordered accordingly. The five appeals raise the same question. The parties agree on the law but differ about its application. Testator died August 9, 1934, leaving a widow and without issue. His personal property was inventoried at approximately $410,000. The bonds in dispute, about $160,000 par, were included in the inventory.</p>

Tunnell, as owner of the bonds or of the money used to purchase them, was competent to create trusts inter vivos. It cannot be said that the evidence of one transaction is typical of all the rest; for some of them there is more <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>evidence than for others; some depend on the registration alone. The use of the words trust and trustee are not in themselves sufficient: <em>Wilbur Trust Co. v.

As to some, it was assumed in the court below “that it was the testator’s intention to treat all of the bonds in exactly the same-manner, and that there probably were other memoranda to explain the other bonds, which have not been found, due no doubt, to the careless manner in which the testator kept his records,” the administrator having testified that he found decedent’s papers “in a terrible state of disorder.”</p>

All the bonds were found after his death in decedent’s safe deposit box to which he alone had access. Claimants called a witness who had been treasurer of a trust company through which some of the registrations were <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>made. He testified that at various times between 1923 and 1930 Tunnell “would very often stop at my desk and have a conversation with me and ask advice on various things,” among them “securities he intended to place in his name in trust”; that “he wished those securities he was purchasing to go to his nephews, nieces and relatives.” Asked “When were they to go to these nephews and nieces?” the witness replied “When he passed on — if anything should happen to him. ... If anything happens to me, I want these bonds to go to my nieces, nephews and relatives. Q. Did you understand that he meant if he died? A. Yes.” Another witness, also called on behalf of claimants, testified that he was employed by the Federal Reserve Bank, that he examined the bank’s records “for registration of bonds, both Treasury and Land Bank bonds in the name of George A. Tunnell, decedent, in trust for various parties.” He testified that under the applicable regulations Tunnell “would have had the right ... to have had other bonds transferred to any designated person without the consent or joinder of beneficiary named on them.” He received all of the income and paid none of it to any of the claimants. While notice was not essential<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> it may be remarked that none of them was notified that decedent had caused the bonds to be registered in trust. The letter to the Philadelphia National Bank quoted above (another like it relates to other bonds) shows that he retained such dominion over the bonds in those trusts that no right vested in the beneficiary. While a trust inter vivos does not fail because a settlor declares that he<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> holds the property in trust, with power to revoke<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and to receive the income during his life,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> it is well set-<a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>tied that<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> “where the settlor declares himself trustee and reserves not only a beneficial life estate and a power to revoke and modify the trust but also power to deal with the property as he likes as long as he lives, the intended trust is testamentary”: Section 57(3), Restatement, Trusts; see also comment on Sub-section (3).</p>
