Plaintiff had a store in Philadelphia in which she sold cigars, candy, and soft drinks. On April 19, 1934, the defendant, with which she had business dealings for several years, delivered to her four cases of carbonated beverages, including ginger ale in 30-ounce bottles. Plaintiff removed the bottles from the cases in which they were delivered and placed them standing on the concrete floor alongside the ice box in her store. On April 20, 1934, a customer came for ginger ale. Plaintiff served him and then replaced the bottle in the ice box. After she did so, she turned around and her dress “caught” (as she testified) one of the 30-ounce bottles of ginger ale standing on the floor and tipped it over. According to plaintiff’s testimony, the bottle then “exploded,” though a little later in her testimony she refers to the bottle as having “broken.” She said: “After it [the bottle] broke, the farthest piece was about eight feet [away].” Plaintiff’s description of the injuries caused her by the exploded or broken bottle is meagre. She testified: “I went to put my foot down and I couldn’t walk.” Another witness testified that he called at plaintiff’s store shortly after the occurrence in question and found <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>tlie plaintiff “holding a rag to her leg” and she asked the witness to go to a drug store “for some medicine.” Plaintiff apparently expected the inference to be drawn that some of the broken glass lacerated her leg. The broken pieces of bottle were “cleaned up and put in the rubbish.” No part of the bottle was produced in court.</p>
    <p id="b261-3" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[206,716,1152,316]]]'>The negligence pleaded was: (1) excessive pressure of gas in the 30-ounce glass bottle, (2) weakness in the glass bottle, and (3) failure to provide a wire mesh around the bottle. After trial, the court directed a verdict for the defendant. A new trial was asked for and refused. Plaintiff appealed.</p>
    <p id="b261-4" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[207,1042,1151,809]]]'>The court below in its opinion said: “The plaintiff made no attempt whatever to prove excessive pressure, made no attempt to prove a weakness in the bottle, but did attempt by some hypothetical questions to establish negligence in that the defendant failed to encase the bottle of ginger ale in wire mesh. . . . Nowhere in the record is there any evidence that the defendant failed to employ the usual or customary practice in bottling its water.” The court correctly held that “the burden was on the plaintiff to establish this fact, and the further fact that the other practice [if followed by defendant] was more dangerous than the customary method.” The court also held that “it was the act of the plaintiff in upsetting the bottle on the concrete floor which was the efficient proximate cause of its breaking.”</p>

From the fact of the “explosion” or breaking of the bottle under the circumstances presented by the record, no inference of defendant’s negligence could properly be drawn. When plaintiff carelessly or inadvertently knocked over the 30-ounce bottle, her act contributed some of the force which produced the “explosion” or breaking of the bottle. There is no evidence that the force contained in the liquid contents of the bottle was sufficient in itself to produce the “explosion.” In fact, <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>the inference is the other way. The bottle standing on the floor since the day before, did not “explode” until plaintiff herself toppled it over. She cannot successfully contend that the defendant should have anticipated that its bottles of carbonated ginger ale would be toppled over on concrete floors and therefore should have made the bottles so strong, either by the addition of mesh or otherwise, as to prevent an “explosion” or breaking of the bottle and the scattering of fragments of glass in the event the bottle should be subjected to such treatment.</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[272,942,1156,1453]]]'>Plaintiff did not show that the defendant failed to follow the common usage of the bottling business in securing bottles sufficiently strong! Usage is a factor in the measurement of due care. A plaintiff seeking recovery in cases like this or in analogous cases must show either that the defendant did something which is so obviously dangerous to life and limb as to be at once recognized as such by all reasonably intelligent persons or that the precautions and safeguards customarily used in the conduct of a similar business had not been taken by the defendant. See <em>MacDougall v. Pa. Power &amp; Light Co., </em><a href="/pa/311/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="311 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="1146245" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0387-01">311 Pa. 387</a>, 397, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20589" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="166 A. 589">166 A. 589</a>. There is no proof here that the charge of carbonated liquid which the bottle contained was an obviously dangerous one. Neither is there any proof that the defendant in bottling this beverage failed to conform to that standard of care prescribed by the common usage of the business. Plaintiff called as for cross-examination the Vice-President and Treasurer of the defendant company. The substance of his testimony was that the defendant in bottling the beverages it sold employed the usual and customary method, that the bottles the company buys are guaranteed “to test at 300 pounds pressure,” and that there is “32 pounds pressure in the bottle,” and that “when it gets into normal temperature” it would be “about 64 pounds [to the square inch].”</p>

      <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>The first assignment of error relates to the refusal of a new trial and the second and third assignments relate to the directed verdict. They are overruled. The fourth assignment of error is based on the refusal of the trial judge to permit a witness called by plaintiff to answer a hypothetical question. The witness identified himself as a “teacher of biological sciences.” The question stated the facts that plaintiff’s skirt “tipped over” the bottle of ginger ale, that “the bottle exploded” and “parts of the bottle flew and were found at various distances . . . some eight feet from where she had been.” He was then asked if he could “form an opinion as to the cause of the breaking of the bottle.” The court excluded this question. Wigmore on Evidence, 2nd edition, Yol. 1, sec. 682, page 1091, says: “The court may well interfere to prevent [hypothetical] questions which are under the circumstances practically valueless, and are either intended or fairly likely to mislead the jury.” He states as one of the forms of “the abuse of this sort” of hypothetical question, a “method which calls certain facts having a bearing particularly favorable for the questioner’s side or particularly unfavorable to the opponent’s.” The question stated in the assignment included no fact <em>as to the force with which the bottle was toppled over. </em>This omission was not due to any unfairness on the part of the questioner, for there was no evidence produced as to the degree of this force and apparently none available. In the absence of such evidence on this undoubted factor in the occurrence, the court was justified in refusing to permit the witness to give his opinion as to the cause “of the breaking of the bottle.” For him to have answered: “The weakness of the glass or the excessiveness of the pressure,” would have been misleading to the jury (if the case had gone to the jury) and unfair to the defendant. Even empty bottles when upset on hard floors break and their fragments are sometimes scattered over several feet. It is a propensity of shattered glass to scatter. It takes <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>some force to break glass, and the breaking itself releases certain pent up forces in the glass. It is also a rule in respect to hypothetical questions that “the tribunal will not listen to conclusions or opinions from persons who possess no more skill than the tribunal itself in drawing inferences from the premises”: Wig-more, sec. 679. Without questioning the skill, along certain lines, of the witness who described himself as above stated, and who further replied affirmatively to a question as to whether or not he was “familiar with the chemical and physical forces involved in a bottle of ginger ale,” we think it is obvious that, under the state of the record, the witness was no better qualified than was the tribunal itself to draw an inference as to the cause of the breaking of the bottle. In the absence of evidence that the bottle was “tilted” so gently or harmlessly on the floor as to make the tilting no factor in the breaking, the witness’s opinion as to what caused the bottle’s breaking would have been a mere conjecture. Such opinions are inadmissable. “No matter how skilled or experienced the witness may be, he will not be permitted to guess or to state a judgment based on mere conjecture”: 22 C. J., sec. 735, page 640; <em>Pittsburgh Gas Engine Co. v. S. S. Elec. Mfg. Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/43/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="43 Pa. Super. 485" data-case-ids="415213" data-case-paths="/pa-super/43/0485-01">43 Pa. Superior Ct. 485</a>. When a 30-ounce bottle is toppled over on a concrete floor and breaks, the obvious conclusion is that the toppling over was the cause of its breaking. For an “expert” to be permitted to assign any <em>other cause, </em>without first eliminating the apparently causal factor, would be to make his testimony a mere matter of guesswork. On the admissibility of a hypothetical question, “the only true criterion is: On this subject can a jury from <em>this person </em>receive appreciable help? In other words, the test is a relative one, depending on the particular subject and the particular witness with reference to that subject”: Wigmore, sec. 1923. As the record stood, the witness’s opinion on the question asked <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>him could have been of no appreciable help to the jury.

    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[204,848,1154,1020]]]'>The 8th assignment of error is based on the refusal of the court below to permit the expert witness to answer the following question: “If a bottle containing a charged beverage is covered by wicker or wire mesh, what would be the effect of that covering, if a bottle breaks or explodes?” The tribunal was as competent as was the witness to answer the question, if it was a proper one. Furthermore, the question was irrelevant and immaterial. The absence of wire mesh on the bottle was not sufficient to convict defendant of negligence. “The law does not exact a degree of care in guarding any article which will make the great majority of the possessors of that article chargeable with habitual or continuous negligence. Due care in any case is the care usually exercised by men of ordinary prudence in like cases and under like circumstances.

All plaintiff proved was that a standing 30-ounce ginger ale bottle when tipped over by her dress coming in contact with it, broke and fragments of glass were scattered about. There is no doubt that the expansive power of the gas in the bottle put some force behind the glass fragments but the obvious inference is that the <em>breaking </em>of the bottle was due to its violent contact with the concrete floor.

W. 497</a>, cited by appellant, the evidence was that a customer, in due course of business, purchased a bottle of beer from a storekeeper and carried it from the grocery store into the butcher shop and placed it upon a counter, where a few minutes later, it exploded and injured plaintiff’s wife. Respondent in that case claimed that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied and the court so held. In <em>Riecke v. Anheuser-Busch, </em><a href="/mo-app/206/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="206 Mo. App. 246" data-case-ids="1794825" data-case-paths="/mo-app/206/0246-01">206 Mo.

W. 631</a>, also cited by appellant, the plaintiff was injured while upon a tour of inspection of defendant’s plant when a bottle filled with liquid and being handled by one of defendant’s employees, exploded. The St. Louis Court of Appeals held that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied. The facts in that case are obviously distinguishable from the facts in the case at bar.</p>
