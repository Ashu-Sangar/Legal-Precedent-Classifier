The plea of payment acknowledges or admits the plaintiff’s cause of action. The Rule of Court before referred to further provides that when a general or short plea is entered or any plea not specifically stating the items of defence, in any action whatever, the plaintiff may', in like manner, enter a rule on the defendant to file a bill of particulars, and on failure to comply within twenty days after notice thereof, no evidence shall be admitted of fraud, want of consideration, particular payment, or other special matter of defence. The plaintiff ruled the defendant to file his bill of particulars of his defence. The defendant neglected to comply with that rule. The consequence is that he is not permitted to give in evidence any fraud, want of consideration, particular payments, set-off, defalcation, or other special matter of defence. This rule of court upon the defendant, and his neglect to file his bill of particulars thereunder produces this result. It operates upon the pleas of payment with leave and set-off, and the plea of payment admits the plaintiff’s cause of action. In law, payment means, sometimes, any good reason shown why payment should not be made, as want of consideration, or fraud, or anything which in law or equity would discharge the party from making payment. But so far as that defence under the plea of payment is concerned, it is excluded by reason of the failure to file the bill of particulars. The other kinds of payment would be actual payment in money, or such an arrangement between the parties that the plaintiff would accept it as a payment, by reason of a settlement made, in which the plaintiff agreed that it might be accepted in reduction of his own demand.</p>

We have to look, as a matter of course, both at the pleadings and the evidence in the case, and under the pleadings in this case and the evidence given under those pleas, we think that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, because no actual payment in money has been <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>shown, or attempted to be shown; and no actual settlement has been shown between the parties, in which this amount was treated as- a payment.] 10</p>

The matter must receive a reasonable construction.

Dobson, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 118" data-case-ids="1854583" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0118-01">3 W. &amp; S. 118</a>; Hartman v.

We are of opinion that, if from misapprehension, whether on the part of court or counsel, the plea of non-assumpsit was not added when the other plea [of nonassumpsit infra sex anuos] was offered, the only effect it could have had would have been to change the form of the charge to ,the jury without affecting the verdict; and that, if offered for the first time when the jury were being charged, there was no error in omitting special instructions thereon under the evidence offered in the trial of this particular case. The plea of payment with leave, etc., in default of notice of the special matter, was without effect. The statute of limitations had no application to the facts, and there was no evidence of set-off. Practically there was left only the plea of payment, and practically the cause of action set forth in the narr and bill is, that defendant sold the land of John P. Rhoads for $1,100, and took the security in his own name, which he fraudulently refused to collect in order that he himself might profit by the high rate of interest; and for this, plaintiff claimed to recover damages.
