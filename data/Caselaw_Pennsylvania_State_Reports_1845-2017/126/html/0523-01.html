The reasons given by the attorney of D. II. Wilson &amp; Co. for tlie instructions be gave to the sheriff, are entirely satisfactory. But aside from this, it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of any other than an innocent motive for these instructions. It is admitted that the only judgments anywhere against tlie defendant are those in favor of tlie present contestants. The entire proceeds of sale amounted to but <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>1274.85. The property sold, as has been seen, was the same that had been set aside to the defendant as exempt from levy and sale under a previous execution. If there was any other property levied upon, it does not appear what it was, and judging from the amount realized by the sale, the value of the other property, if any, must have been very trifling. Now this exempt property was safe to the defendant against all the world except D. H. Wilson &amp; Co. There was therefore no necessity to cover it up and no motive for collusion.</p>

The fieri facias issued upon the judgment of D. H. Wilson &amp; Co., came into the sheriff’s hands October 2, 1886; the writ of the Stroudsburg Bank, October 20th, thereafter.

The sheriff, thereupon, without the knowledge of Burnett, made a memorandum upon the writ, in .the words following: “ To hold till further orders from Burnett, attorney.” The sheriff testifies as follows: “ I do not know that Mr. .Burnett used the word ‘ hold.’ I did not take any memorandum of this conversation. Mr. Burnett called my attention to this indorsement in lead pencil a few days ago; he asked me how I came to make this indorsement on the writ. I think I told him among other things that I thought Thomas Miller had given me instructions to stay the writ; my reason for saying so was that the matter was stale and I did not just think.

The property levied upon and sold consisted wholly of that which had been set aside under a previous writ issued by the bank on their judgment; there were no other judgments, and it does not appear that there were, in fact, any labor claims; there was therefore no motive for any fraudulent action or collusion.</p>
    <p id="b554-6" data-blocks='[["BL_554.6",554,[256,1033,1187,662]]]'>The execution of D. H. Wilson &amp; Co. having been first issued would ordinarily, therefore, be first entitled; but, unfortunately, there was no levy made upon that writ. The levy was made upon the writ of the bank only, and upon that writ the personal property was sold. In McClelland v. Slingluff, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 134" data-case-ids="481821" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0134-01">7 W. &amp; S. 134</a>, it was held that in such ease the sheriff must apply the money to the writ upon which the levy and sale were made, and not to the first writ, upon -which no levy was indorsed or attached. The money made when this is the case, says Mr. Justice Rogers, belongs to the second execution creditor on whose writ the goods were levied and sold, leaving the first execution creditor to an action against the sheriff for redress. To the same effect is Schuylkill Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/30/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="30 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="415606" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0358-01">30 Pa. 358</a>.</p>
