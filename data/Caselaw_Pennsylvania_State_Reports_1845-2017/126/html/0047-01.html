The case was then sent back to him under an order of court allowing the plaintiffs and defendants “ To take additional testimony before the master as to the character and purposes of the masonic associations referred to in the master’s report.” Under this reference there have been put in evidence before the master the constitution of the Ancient York Masons, the constitution of the Free and Accepted Masons, and the constitution of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania, being the new lodge formed under the union of the two other Grand Lodges.</p>

The testimony of these witnesses shows beyond any doubt that the ancient landmarks that govern the masonic fraternity are one and the same, and that there is no difference in them whatsoever ; they are the same for all masonic organizations.</p>

This connection with a National Grand Lodge was severed, according to the evidence, in 1881, and there then stood nothing in the way of a union between these two bodies, the Ancient York Masons and the Free and Accepted Masons, so far as the master has been able to understand the masonic rules and laws which have been brought to his attention.</p>

Another of the witnesses, Mr. Cassey, admits the same thing, with this qualification, that in order to be legal, according to masonic, law, such union must have had the unanimous consent of sub- ■ ordinate lodges, and failing that unanimous consent it lacked that element of legality. Mr. Cassey’s testimony was this : ■“ Q. What provision would be required to make those articles legal ? A. They would have had to first repeal all edicts issued against each other; then, I think, it would have been <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>legal to have met in convention.

The master finds that the objection to the legality of the union, viz., that the “clandestine” masons were not <em>first </em>“healed” before the union, is not sustained by the evidence, and that the objection itself is not within the scope of the reference.</p>
