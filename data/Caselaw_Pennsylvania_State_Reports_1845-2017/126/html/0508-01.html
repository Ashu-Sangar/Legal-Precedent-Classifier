She has been paid the annuity bequeathed in the codicil and no further payment will be due on that account until May 18, 1889. But she has received nothing on account of the annuity of o£50 bequeathed to her by the will, to be paid in quarterly instalments. As to that, she is entitled to receive the sum of twelve and one half pounds sterling every quarter year commencing on May 18, 1887, one year from testator’s death, and to recover interest on the delayed payments.</p>
