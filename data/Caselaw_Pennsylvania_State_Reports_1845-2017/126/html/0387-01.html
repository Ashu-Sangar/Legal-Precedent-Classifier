      <em>(a) </em>In an action for personal injuries plaintiff proved that the employees in defendant’s machine shop, when operating lathes to turn crank-shafts oí a lighter weight, used anything they saw fit as a counter-balance, <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>and that a piece of iron weighing 40 pounds, so used but improperly-secured, had flown off and struck and injured him.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b412-4" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[301,470,1182,257]]]'>(6) Plaintiff also proved that in turning crank-shafts of a heavier weight, an appliance particularly devised for a counter-balance was used, but failed to prove that such an appliance was generally used in turning shafts of the lighter weight. It also appeared that plaintiff had been an apprentice in the shop for four years, knew how these lathes were operated, but no complaint had been made to defendant thereof.</p>

The piece of iron was a waste piece, used on the lathe as a counter-balance.</p>

He knew his employee was running .a lathe, and turning a crank-shaft upon it; that he used a counter-balance in so doing, and that he was allowed to select anything he saw fit for that purpose ; but neither he nor any one else in the shop ever gave notice that the articles used as counter-balances were <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>dangerous.

    <p id="b413-9" data-blocks='[["BL_413.9",413,[166,1353,1191,1025]]]'>An examination of this case fails to satisfy us that the learned court below committed any error in nonsuiting 'the plaintiff. If there was any negligence in the case it was that of the foreman of the lathe in not properly securing the counter-balance. The piece of iron which was used was as safe as any other piece of iron, had it been properly secured. The plaintiff’s own testimony showed that it was the business of the foreman to secure it. There was no evidence to show that any superior kind of counter-balance was in general use. The fact that the defendant company had another kind in use for a larger machine, did not prove anything. Especially, it did not show that they had any reason to suppose the one which caused the accident was not safe when properly fastened. It is often easy to see after an accident has occurred how it might have been avoided. But an employer is not an insurer of the safety of his employees. If he furnishes machinery and tools for the use of the latter which are reasonably safe, it is all the law requires, and he is not bound, under the peril of being mulcted in damages for an accident, to employ every new device or improvement the moment it is invented. This is familiar law.</p>
