    <p id="b602-6" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[254,1111,1189,561]]]'>1. The defendants in the first suit were Julia B. Keith and Jennie J.

Nor was there any competent evidence showing that either of the defendants in the present suit was privy in estate with either of the defendants in the first suit. In fact there was no competent evidence of any title to the property, now in question, in either of the defendants. And it is submitted that before they could be permitted to set up a record as an estoppel to defeat a suit in rem, it was incumbent on them to show their interest in the property by the production of their title papers.</p>

In the first case the suit was for the recovery of an assessment bill given by the' city to her employee, for work done in 1874, while the cause of action in the second case was another assessment bill given by the city to her employee for another job of work done at a widely different place, aiid some five years after the first. The fact that the two jobs were done under the same contract can make no difference, as there is no connection between the assessment bills and the contract, and the suits are not in any way based upon the contract.</p>

What alone is decisive of the case is, that the issues in the two cases were widely and essentially different. The point submitted to the jury and decided in the first case was that <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>the locality of a lot of ground, on the northwest corner of Leamy and Indiana streets was rural in 1874, in the sense that it was not then city and ripe for city treatment; while the issue in the second case was whether another' locality, which was widely and essentially different from the first, was some five years after the date of inquiry in the first case, rural, in the sense that it was n ot ripe for city treatment. The issue arising in the second case could not by any possibility have been decided in the first case, and, therefore was not res judicata, even if the parties had been the same.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[128,858,1184,964]]]'>4. The resolution of May 18, 1872, is silent as to the mode of assessment. It specified no time when the work should be done or the assessment made. It simply gave authority to do the woik. The manner of doing it and the mode of assessment were provided for by general ordinances. It therefore follows that until an assessment is made no injury can be done the property owner. And if at that time, which is the proper time o f inquiry: Philadelphia v. Rule, <a href="/pa/93/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="93 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="442064" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0015-01">93 Pa. 15</a>, the property has ceased to be rural, the property owners cannot complain, if, in making the assessment the foot-front rule is applied; and if, as in this case, they have received a special and peculiar benefit in the enhancement of the value of their property, honesty and good conscience demand that they should pay for it. Furthermore, as the property owners in this case were instrumental in bringing about the improvement in question, they are not only morally, but legally estopped - from contesting the legality of the assessment: Bidwell v.

This municipal claim having been filed, and the scire facias issued against certain parties as the administrator and heirs-at-law of Julia B. Keith, deceased, it would not be required of the defendants to show that they were the administrator and heirs, for that was part of the plaintiff’s case.

As the jurisdiction of the court, hi which the matter now at issue is alleged to have been adjudicated, is conceded, and the identity of the parties, by privity of estate, is established, the question, upon which the whole case turns, is the identity of the matter in dispute.</p>
    <p id="b604-5" data-blocks='[["BL_604.5",604,[262,647,1191,1082]]]'>It is undoubtedly true that the record which was offered would show that certain property, adjacent to the property in question, both together constituting -a larger lot known as the Dower Farm and belonging to the same owner, was adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be rural property and therefore not liable to a lien for paving done inJjNjf^ccording to the foot-front rule of assessment. But the paving in that case was done in JB74, whilst in this case it was done in J.878, and it is contended on the part of the plaintiffs that the record of the defendants’ recovery on a claim for paving in 1874, can have no conclusive effect on the trial of a scire facias for paving done four years later. On the part of the defendants, however, it is argued, that in such a ease as this, the character and condition of the property is to be inquired of - as of the date of the ordiv nance authorizing the improvement, and not of the date when the improvement was made; .and, that as the paving of 1874 and that of 1878 was done under the same ordinance, in front of different portions of the same property, the question now at issue is necessarily the same which was passed upon in the trial of the former action, and that the matter in issue has therefore-passed in rem adjudicatam.</p>
    <p id="b604-6" data-blocks='[["BL_604.6",604,[261,1738,1193,663]],["BL_605.1",605,[140,378,1186,769]]]'>We cannot accept this view of the case. The ordinance of 1872 laid down no rule for the assessment of the benefits resulting to the abutting property; it simply authorized and directed the Department of Highways “ to enter into a contract with a competent paver or pavers, who shall be selected by a majority of the owners of property fronting on -Indiana street, from Kensington avenue to Front street, for the paving thereof with rubble pavement,” with conditions, etc., “ that the contractor or contractors shall collect the cost of said paving from the property owners ” fronting thereon, respectively. The' assessments according to the foot-front rule were not made under this ordinance, but would seem to have been authorized by the general ordinances of the city, enacted May 3, 1855, and <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>June 12, 1868. Bu't these general ordinances, providing for the assessment of benefits according to the foot-front rule, cannot have any application to farm lands or rural property, although the same be situated within the city limits: Washington Ave., <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Pa.%20353" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="69 Pa. 353">69 Pa. 353</a>; Seely v.

Whilst perhaps all property within the limits of a borough or city may be assessed, according to some reasonable rule, for special and peculiar benefits conferred by local improvements, it is now well settled that the foot-front rule .can only be applied to the built-up portions of the city, or to property ripe for city treatment. Sewerage, sidewalks, paved and lighted streets, fire protection and other city improvements, are not essential to the ordinary enjoyrnents of farm lands, and to impose the expense thereof on a large frontage of such property would amount in many cases to confiscation,.</p>

It is the common; benefit received or about to be received which justifies an ' apportionment of the expense, and the built-up or improved condition and small size of city lots, which renders this rule of assessment a reasonable one.</p>
