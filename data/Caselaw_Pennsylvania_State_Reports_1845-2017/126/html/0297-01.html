The evidence discloses the fact that this husband lias been absent, and his absence unaccounted for, for a period far exceeding seven years. The rule is now well settled, for most judicial purposes, that the presumption of life, with respect to persons of whom no account can be given, ends at the expiration of seven years from the time they were last <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>known to be living: Best on Presumptions, § 140; 2 Greenl.

    <p class="summary" id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.5",324,[252,659,1193,1276]]]'>The other important question raised by the exceptions involves the right to partition at all; because it is alleged on the part of the exceptant, Daniel Welch, through his counsel, that there is not such a holding in common of the property described in the petition and writ of partition, that the law requires, in order to permit partition to be made. It is true that the authorities declare that an adverse holding of the property by any one, for a period of time however short, before the institution of the proceedings in partition, will be effectual to defeat the proceedings. The proceeding in partition turns entirely upon the point of all the parties holding the land together at the time the proceedings are begun: Law v. Patterson, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 184" data-case-ids="1852607" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0184-01">1 W. &amp; S. 184</a>; Long-well v.

And in all of the cases referred to, it appears that such was the character of the possession, at the time when the proceedings in partition were instituted. It also appears that from an examination of those cases, that they were in the common law courts, brought under the statute investing the common law courts with powers of proceeding in partition, and not in the Orphans’ Court, which has jurisdiction in the case in hand.</p>

There is nothing on the record by which his right to partition is raised, until exceptions were filed by his counsel to the return of the sheriff and the inquest held, when it was presented for confirmation..</p>

We cannot try that question of title, if, on an inspection of the record, and the testimony in the case, taken in support of the exceptions, it should appear that there is such claim of title as should be passed upon by a jury. Such a claim of title must necessarily be settled by an action of ejectment before proceedings in partition could be had.</p>

Daniel Welch is not a competent witness for this purpose, and aside from his testimony, there is no testimony which could be at all submitted to a jury sitting in an action of ejectment, upon the question of title under the statute of limitations. No verdict could be sustained upon this testimony, which would find that he was entitled to hold the land by reason of the statute of limitations, and adverse holding for twenty-one years.] 6</p>

But it is manifest from the testimony that, even after that time, those two brothers — one of them living on the old homestead with his mother and one of his sisters, and Daniel living upon the part which Mr. McCloskey ran off and designated on the draft as the Daniel Welch part — did not recognize this line of division, or use the property after it was made, with any reference to a division. The whole property was farmed after that date as it had been before. The crops were stored in the barn upon the old homestead, and the family of Daniel Welch, and his mother and the sister, living with Franklin Welch, <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>received and derived their maintenance and support from the whole property in common. Aside from this division line being run, I cannot find any act of Daniel Welch, which, in my opinion, would be sufficient to put the other heirs of George Welch upon notice as to his claim to that portion of the estate of George Welch which he now claims.</p>

Maria and Franklin never made any division of the property between them. Daniel Welch, prior to 1871, erected a small dwelling house and some other buildings upon that portion of - the estate which he now claims as his. He resided there for some time, and then moved to a property known as the Bloom property, removing with him nearly all of his furniture, if not all of it, and continued at the Bloom property for the period of one year. Tins was in 1871, or thereabouts. He then returned to the property in question, and has continued to reside upon it from that time to the present.</p>

There is some evidence of taxes having been paid in 1881 and years subsequent by Daniel Welch, but the amounts are small, and presumably they were paid out of the funds arising from the property itself.</p>

For why should the court suspend proceedings in partition, and compel the parties to go into the court of common law with their action of ejectment to determine a question of alleged title, which, upon a mere inspection of the testimony, as it appears, is not sufficient to justify submitting to a jury. From all of the authorities to which we have been referred, and all which we have been able to find, it appears that the possession which was held to defeat the proceedings in partition was an actual and exclusive possession. The possession of Daniel Welch lacks, even when his own testimony is considered, this essential element of exclusiveness.</p>

Having gone into possession with Franklin Welch, by the permission of his sister Maria, to whom the undivided one half part was devised, he could not deny her title, unless he would do so by such act of declaration or adverse holding as is sufficient to challenge her notice, and to put her upon her guard against his claim.
