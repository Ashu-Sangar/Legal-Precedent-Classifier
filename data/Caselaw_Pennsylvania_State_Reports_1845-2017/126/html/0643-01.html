Irvine. If he occupied it as owner, and in hostility to the rights of Guy C. Irvine, for the full time of twenty-one years before Mr. Douglas took possession, then he has a good title, and the verdict should be in his favor. On the other hand, if the evidence satisfies you that his occupancy was under Guy C. Irvine, that is, by his permission, then George W. Irvine would acquire no title by the statute of limitations.

The defendant’s offer to prove that at the time of the entry and survey, William Irvine, one of the devisees, was there on the premises and in possession and declared his ownership, was competent to show the intention of the entry and a declaration of dominion over the land; to require evidence of exclusive possession was manifest error.</p>

Again ; the part of the charge of the court in these words: “We say to you, that the statute commenced running in the lifetime of Guy C.

Under the finding of the jury that the plaintiff’s possession was adverse, the fact that the devisees of Guy C. Irvine, children of George W. Irvine, were already in possession, did not relieve them from a strict compliance with the act. That one may have such possession as will make title even as against the right of one dwelling in his household, is shown by the case of Moreland v. Moreland, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20Pa.%20578" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="121 Pa. 578">121 Pa. 578</a>.</p>

The offer embraced in the second assignment of error, was to show that when the executors made the survey, this lad “was on the premises and in possession and declared he owned the land.” If a minor child, residing at home, can by such declarations prevent his father from acquiring title under the statute, the only children a man can afford to rear are mutes. When the statute has commenced to run against a man in his lifetime, he cannot stop it by devising bis claim of right to the minor children of the adverse possessor; no subsequent disability will stop it: Lynch v.

Irvine’s possession commenced either in May or June 1865, and continued until the defendant entered on or about August 16, 1886, a period of over 21 years. Hence, the only controverted question before the jury was the character of that possession whether adverse or subservient to Guy C. Irvine’s title, and upon this question the possession by Nichols, before the possession on which George W. Irvine relied, could shed no light. Nor was the jury misled by the court, hi the nse of the language referred to in the fourth assignment of error, because the court assumed just what the defendant’s counsel were themselves assuming, to wit: that the statute had begun to run and <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>was interrupted by Guy C.

This is well illustrated by the fourth specification, where complaint is made that the learned judge instructed the jury that, “We say to you that the statute commenced running in the lifetime of Guy C. Irvine, audit would continue notwithstanding the minority of George W. Irvine’s children.” An examination of the charge shows that the learned judge used this language in reference to the question that he was discussing and which he submitted to the jury, viz.: whether George W. Irvine was holding and occupying the land adversely to Guy C. Irvine and in his own right as owner, and by the instruction complained of he intended, and it must have been so understood by the jury, that if he was so holding adversely, the statute commenced to run in the lifetime of Guy C.

As regards the first, it is sufficient to say that the survey made by the executors of Guy C. Irvine in 1869, was not such an entry as would toll the statute. It was not followed up by an ejectment within one year, as required by the act of April 13, 1859, P. L. 603. The verdict of the jury establishes the fact that the statute commenced to run in the lifetime of Guy C. Trvine. When the statute has commenced to run, no subsequent disability will stop it: Lynch v. Cox, <a href="/pa/23/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="23 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="974010" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0265-01">23 Pa. 265</a>; Henry v. Carson, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20Pa.%20307" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="59 Pa. 307">59 Pa. 307</a>. It is therefore clear that the alleged entry, to have been of any avail, should have been followed up by an ejectment within one year thereafter, even though the parties in whose interest the entry was made were minors. The fact that the latter were living with their father on the premises, is not material. They had no legal possession of the premises. Their possession was the possession of their father. The court <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>in rejecting the offer of evidence referred to in the second assignment, granted permission to the defendant to prove that William Irvine, one of the devisees under the will of Guy C. Irvine, was in the exclusive possession of the land. This of course could not be done, as he was a mere boy living with his father. It would be a singular circumstance if this boy could break the continuity of his father’s adverse possession by a declaration of this kind.</p>
