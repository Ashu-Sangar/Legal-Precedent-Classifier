Her claim was resisted by the heirs upon the ground that she was not living with the decedent at the time of his death, and did not then, and had not for seven years or more prior thereto, sustained a family relation to him, and consequently was not entitled to the $300 claimed.</p>

During the lat-ter part of this cohabitation, they became estranged and quarrelsome with each other, and he threatening and dangerously aggressive towards her. The evidence clearly discloses that he kicked her on two different occasions, the result of the one was a black and blue leg from the knee to the hip.

    <p id="b368-5" data-blocks='[["BL_368.6",368,[256,406,1187,1226]]]'>John C. Nye, a widower aged seventy years, and Elizabeth Reigel, a widow aged thirty years, were married in the summer of 1878, and dwelt together as husband and wife until the fall of 1879, when she left his home and moved into her own house about ten miles distant, where she resided until his death in November, 1886. A short time after the separation she commenced suit against him under the desertion statutes, which upon full hearing and investigation by the court of Quarter Sessions, resulted in a dismissal of her complaint. After that there was no communication between them, and no effort on her part to assert the rights or to discharge the duties of a wife. That she had deliberately resolved upon a permanent separation from Nye and his family is evident from what she said to Wm. Schlappig the morning she left. Nye was unwilling that she should leave, and tried to persuade her to remain with him. No angry or unkind words passed between .tliem on that occasion. While in his presence she made no complaint of misconduct on Ms part, and did not assign any reason for her determination to depart from his home. The testimony of the witnesses who were present and who describe the conversation and conduct of the husband and wife, stamps the separation as a wilful and malicious desertion on her part, and there is nothing shown of her subsequent behavior to deprive it of that character.</p>

It was not created for a wife who abandons her husband without reasonable cause and for seven years before his death refuses to perform her marital duties.

    <p id="AQl" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[187,1068,1190,1332]]]'>It remains to inquire, if Mrs. Nye had reasonable cause for abandoning her husband. As we have seen, her departure from his home was deliberate and without complaint or explanation to him. It is incumbent on her, therefore, to show conduct on his part which justified her in severing the family relation. This she has undertaken to do, and the evidence on which she relies for her justification is before us. Tt shows but one act of personal violence, and the single witness of that was her son, who was then but ten years old. Adam Reicliard testified that he was frequently at Nye’s house, and that he once, while they were quarreling, heard Nye threaten to strike her with a salt box. This is all of threat or violence which the evidence discloses. Mrs. Nye’s declarations to third persons in the absence of her husband, were not competent to affect him, and in view of the time when and the circumstances under which they were made were not admissible as a part of the res gestse. It is probable, however, that those declarations were all made with reference to the one act described by her son, and the provocation of that, according to his recollection, was her refusal to sleep with her husband, and this was conceded in her statement to Kauffman, together with an admission that she struck him in the face. There is no conflict in the evidence, and no question of the credibility of witnesses involved in the case. From the facts disclosed by the legal testimony it is our duty to decide whether a justification of the abandonment is shown.</p>

Richards, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Grant%20391" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Grant 391">1 Gr. 391</a>, may be so severe and attended with such corresponding circumstances of atrocity, as might, under a fair and liberal construction of the act, justify a divorce. But no single act of cruelty, however severe, that comes short of endangering life, is sufficient to justify a divorce.” A single act of indignity will not be sufficient, nor indignities provoked by the complaining party, unless where the retaliation is excessive. It is not-every coarse and ungallant act, even though it amounts to a technical assault, that authorizes a severance of the marriage bond. It was well said by Chief Justice Lowkie, in Richards v. Richards, <a href="/pa/37/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="37 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="418942" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0225-01">37 Pa. 225</a>: “It is not all unlawful and barbarous acts that are made grounds of divorce. We do not divorce savages and barbarians because they act as such towards each other.” The question with which we have to deal is not one of sentiment or chivalry, but of law and its faithful administration, and we have no hesitation in declaring that under our decisions and the evidence in this case Mrs. Nye is not entitled to the exemption of $300 out of the estate of her deceased husband, or to the fees of her • witnesses in prosecuting her claim for it.
