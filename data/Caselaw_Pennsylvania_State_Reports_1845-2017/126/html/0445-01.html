It is well settled that notice of a special meeting of a corporation must be given to each person entitled to be present; and further, that when there is no method of giving notice prescribed by law, or by the by-laws or regulations of the corporation, personal notice is required: 1 Potter on Corporations, §§ 830, 837, 342; Pike Co. v.

No notice whatever was received by Mr. McAllister, and that defect not being cured by his presence without notice, the settlement made or attempted to be made by the members, can have no binding effect. Nor was there such subsequent ratification by the board as would be binding. No minutes of the special meeting were recorded, none were afterwards read or adopted. The fact that Mr. McAllister was afterwards told of the action of his fellow-directors, he not protesting, would not amount to ratification. Nothing but an official ratification at a legal meeting would avail to bind the board.</p>

The facts show that there was one essential element lacking to constitute an estoppel. In order to successfully set up an estoppel, it must appear that the party setting it up was induced by the acts or representations of the other party to act to his injury. The defendant has not shown that he sustained any injury. Moreover, the claim he assigned to them was for money deposited by him as treasurer, which was the very money he was bound in law to turn over or pay to the board, or to his successor in office, and not his own money. Had he assigned to them his private and individual bank account, it is possible a different question might <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>have been presented. But when they received the dividend, they but received their own. It amounted to no more than his paying to them so much on account of his indebtedness to them, which but reduced the amount of the indebtedness. If I am correct in this conclusion, it must follow, not only that there was no ratification .of the contract, but no estoppel by the acts of the plaintiffs, and no consideration for the contract if it was within the power of the directors to make, even if made regularly and legally.</p>

Moreover, the report of the State Board of Charities for the year 1886, p. 151, shows that there were then eighteen counties in the state in which an almshouse had not been erected.

The defendant gave no consideration for this settlement; the money in the defunct bank belonged to the county, and he merely gave up the evidence of the deposit. Had this alleged settlement been made by a regular or legal meeting of the directors, and in an orderly manner, we would have had the question before us of the power of the directors to make the settlement and give away what did not belong to them, viz., $1,345.29 of the money of the county of Erie. The meeting, however, was not a formal legal meeting of the board. There were but two members present and the third had received no notice of it.

One or more of the directors, without authority from the board, can make no contract binding upon the district, cannot change a contract, can do no act fixing the district for a liability. He may be personally responsible to those who suffer from his unauthorized acts, as any other citizen would be.” The directors of the poor, no more than a board of school directors, can perform no official act, can bind the county by no contract, <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>except when acting as a board, and they can only act as a board when lawfully convened as such.
