There, in the absence of any stipulation on part of the landlord to keep the premises let in repair, it was not competent for the tenant to sot up as a defence in an action for rent, the ordinary repairs which he had made to the leased property. Blair’s contention is, that it was part of the contract of lease with his co-tenants that he should make repairs and appropriate rent to the payment. Even a promise to pay for the repairs after having been made, was held obligatory upon a landlord: Cornell v. Vanartsdalen, <a href="/pa/4/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="401885" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0364-01">4 Pa. 364</a>.</p>

He objects only as to those items which appear to have been in whole or in part expended upon property occupied by the defendant, or which on their face give no indication on what realty they were put. The items objected to aggregate $74.30, of this sum $16.51, or two ninths, is the amount that Blair wishes to set off against the demand of the plaintiff.</p>

That this is a proper credit was noted in case of Hitner v. Ege, arising in this borough many years since.
