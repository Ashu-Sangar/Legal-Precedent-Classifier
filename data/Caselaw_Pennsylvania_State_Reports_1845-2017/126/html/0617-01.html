    <p class="summary" id="b642-7" data-blocks='[["BL_642.7",642,[243,927,1193,670]]]'>The defendant was a licensed hotel keeper in Smethport, and on October 22, 1885, was absent in Buffalo, N. Y. His regular bar-keeper was also absent, and the bar was left in charge of the hotel porter, George Squires. On that day, Pardon Wright was in Smethport and drank at Taylor’s hotel. There was cumulative testimony to show that Wright was a person of known intemperate habits. The defendant, however, testified that he did not know this fact, and the porter, Squires, testified that he did not know Wright at all, and did not sell to any one who was intoxicated. There was also testimony that Wright had drunk liquor at another hotel in Smethport and that he carried a bottle of some kind of liquor and drank from it that day.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b642-8" data-blocks='[["BL_642.8",642,[239,1601,1191,411]]]'>After he left Smethport, Wright went to his home about 3£ miles distant. Soon after he reached home he went to his barn, and thence to his hay-mow. He was next found upon the floor of his barn, severely injured by a fall from the mow. He was removed to his house, and helped to bed. The following day he died. There was testimony from which the defendant contended that the direct cause of his death was excessive hypodermic injections of morphia administered by Ms physician.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[158,502,1182,720]]]'>Answer: We cannot affirm this point in just the language in which it is clothed. To affirm it just as it stands would be, as we understand it, in effect, to make the whole legislation upon this question nugatory and of no account whatever, because we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that in nine cases out of ten of this character the person who purchases the liquor purchases it in more than one place. It could hardly be the law that a man could furnish liquor to a person until he was in an extreme state of intoxication, and great injury arise to some one thereby, and avoid the effect of the legislation upon the subject by simply saying that the plaintiff may have purchased a drink or drinks of some other person that mingled with the liquor which he drank of the defendant. But we answer this point in this way:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b643-6" data-blocks='[["BL_643.6",643,[159,1231,1182,458]]]'>In answer to this point we say to you that if you believe from the evidence that the defendant sold whiskey to the deceased, Wright, knowing that he was a person of intemperate habits or that he was intoxicated at the time of the sale, whatever his habits may have been, and that his death followed from and was caused by bis intoxication, you may find that the act of the defendant was the proximate cause, although you should believe from the evidence that the deceased got whiskey from other persons on that day.1</p>

You will recollect there is evidencie that Wright had a bottle of whiskey that afternoon, and some evidence that he drank at the Rockwell <em>House; </em>there is also evidence by the bar-tenders and others at the Rockwell House that they did not sell him liquor, but refused to do so. You <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>will judge of the credibility of the witnesses who have testified upon this, as upon all other questions in the case. We say to you that if you believe from the evidence that Wright was a person of known intemperate habits, and that the defendant by his agents or employees, so knowing, intentionally sold him intoxicating drinks on the afternoon in question, that this sale was the proximate cause of his death, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff; or, if you find that Taylor by his employees or agents sold Wright intoxicating drinks while intoxicated, and knowing him to be intoxicated at the time, whatever his habits may have been, and his death resulted therefrom, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover. If you do not find one or both of these assumptions to be true, your verdict would be for the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b644-5" data-blocks='[["BL_644.5",644,[258,1073,1187,865]]]'>If Mr. Taylor has sold intoxicating drinks unlawfully to persons to whom he could not sell under the authority conferred upon him by his license, and therefore has caused injury and damage, he cannot complain if called upon to make good the injury so far as he can do so by the payment of money. The defendant had no right by his license to sell liquor to a person while drunk, or to a person of known intemperate habits, and if he did so intentionally sell, it was a violation of the law, and if it caused death or injury to another he would be liable to respond in damages for the injury. The act of assembly provides that “ any person furnishing intoxicating drinks to any person, in violation of any existing law, or the provisions of this act, shall be held civilly responsible for any injury to persons or property in consequence of such furnishing, and any one aggrieved may recover full damages against such person so furnishing, by action on the case in any court having jurisdiction in such cases in this commonwealth.”</p>

In such case, it would be impossible for the jury to say which particular glass of liquor was the proximate cause of his death. Each glass did its share of the work. We do not see, therefore, any error in the answer of the court to the defendant’s third point. As was well said by the learned judge: “ To affirm it just as it stands would be, as we understand it, in effect to make the whole legislation upon this question <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>nugatory and of no account whatever, because we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that in nine cases out of ten of this character the person who purchases the liquor, purchases it in more than one place.” Nor do we think it was error in the court below to repeat to the'jury the language of Justice W oodward in Fink v. Garman, <a href="/pa/40/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="40 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="478837" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0095-01">40 Pa. 95</a>.
