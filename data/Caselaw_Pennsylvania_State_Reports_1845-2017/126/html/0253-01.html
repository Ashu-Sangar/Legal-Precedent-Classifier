Where a person has suffered an injury by the commission of a crime, his personal loss is likely to appear of more importance to him than the injury to the state, and the cases are, therefore, very numerous in which the injured party has agreed not to prosecute the offender for a money consideration. All such contracts are void: National Bank of Oxford v. Kirk, <a href="/pa/90/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="90 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="1065576" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0049-01">90 Pa. 49</a>; Bredin’s App., <a href="/pa/92/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="92 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="491030" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0241-01">92 Pa. 241</a>; Pearce v.

Moreover, there was no mutuality in this contract. The plaintiff was at liberty, if Shloss failed to make any of the payments, to renounce the contract and to bring her prosecution for fornication and bastardy. Shloss paid $1,600, then failed to pay ; consequently the plaintiff was released from the contract and it was at an end. The contract, therefore, after the failure of Shloss to pay, was not binding on the plaintiff, and ceased to be mutual if it ever was mutual: Bodine v. Glading, <a href="/pa/21/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="21 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="411509" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0050-01">21 Pa. 50</a>; Wilson v.

The plaintiff contends that the settlement in the present case was in strict accordance with the law and that the note was given for a good and legal consideration. Section 9, act of March 31, 1860, permits the settlement of any misdemeanor committed to the injury and damage of the complainant, and for which there is a remedy by action, if the offence be not charged to have been done with intent to commit a felony and not being an infamous crime. Fornication and bastardy does work actual injury and damage to the mother, but, as she is particeps criminis, it may be said that it is damnum absque injuria. She has a remedy, however, against the father, after conviction and sentence, for the money the court may sentence him to pay to her, and if the sheriff suffer him to escape after sentence she may sue the sheriff and his sureties.</p>

L. 227, after indictment found by the grand jury, the attorney general could not lawfully enter a nolle prosequi except in cases of assault and battery, fornication and bastardy, on agreement between the parties, or in prosecutions for keeping tippling houses, without the consent of the court. In Maurer v. Mitchell, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 69" data-case-ids="12168932" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0069-01">9 W. &amp; S. 69</a>, decided under that act, a contract of compromise made before indictment had been found, by which the reputed father agreed to pay a stipulated sum for the lying-in expenses and for bringing up the child, was held not to be founded on such an illegal consideration as would avoid it. Since the act of 1860, it has been the practice in this district to allow a settlement of a prosecution for fornication and bastardy to be • made between the mother and the putative father, and a nolle prosequi to be entered: Stumpf’s App., <a href="/pa/116/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="116 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="554373" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0033-01">116 Pa. 33</a>; Geier v.

The duty to perform a positive promise, which is not contrary to law or public policy, or obtained by fraud, imposition, undue influence or mistake, is certainly an obligation in morals, and if so, it is a sufficient consideration for an express promise: Bentley v.

But it is also true that ever since the year 1819, the public policy of this commonwealth as indicated by its public laws has not only permitted but favored the settlement of just such cases as this, by the voluntary agreement of the parties. We have several times held that contracts between the reputed father and mother of the child, for the settlement of claims founded upon fornication and bastardy, are not illegal and will be enforced. A noted instance of this kind was the case of Maurer v. Mitchell, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 69" data-case-ids="12168932" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0069-01">9 W. &amp; S. 69</a>, in which Chief Justice Gibson said, speaking of the act of 1819: “Thus the offence, like assault and battery with which it was associated in that statute, became little more than a private wrong; and when the legislature authorized the parties to treat it as such between themselves, the contract certainly became legal so far as they were individually concerned.” This act certainly continued in force until 1860, and, as the criminal code enacted in that year also sanctioned the settlement of misdemeanors, an unbroken practice has prevailed in all parts of the state, for a great many years, of settling cases of this kind by the voluntary agreement of the parties. In view of this long continued practice añd of the judicial and legislative sanction which it has received, and in view also of the fact that the chief subject matter of the contract is the support of the child, we cannot say that such contracts are opposed to the public policy of the state. As there is no other reason for refusing the enforcement of this particular agreement we think it should prevail.</p>
