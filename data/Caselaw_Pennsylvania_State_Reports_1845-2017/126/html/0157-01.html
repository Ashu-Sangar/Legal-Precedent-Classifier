The relator further represents that the city of Titusville is not now, and never has been, a city of the first, second or third class, as designated by law, and that therefore the license fee due by him is $300 and not $500.</p>

While it is true that by the terms of § 1, act of May 23, 1874, cities of the commonwealth having less than ten thousand inhabitants were not included in the general classification of cities, yet it is manifest from the terms of § 57 of the same act that it was in the contemplation of the legislature that cities then existing with a less population than ten thousand might, by accepting the provisions of that act, become cities of the third class, and as sucli governed by the provisions of said act. In Reading City v. Savage, <a href="/pa/124/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="124 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="563054" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0328-01">124 Pa. 328</a>, the Supreme Co ail, referring to the last mentioned section of this act, said: “ This portion of the act had universal application over all parts of the state, and is clearly a general law. Into this class it was made competent for any city having the requisite population, and also, for any city having less than ten thousand inhabitants, and all of which had been previously incorporated, to come, so as to be governed by those provisions of the act of 1874, which related to the government of cities of the third class, by pursuing the directions of the 57th section.” The <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>language of this section and the interpretation given to it in the opinion quoted, makes it clear that the city of Titusville, in accepting and adopting the provisions óf the act of 1874, became a city of the third class under that act; and while it may be questionable whether the classification of the act of May, 1887, was adopted with reference to the classification of the act of May 23, 1874, we incline to the opinion that the license fee due from persons licensed to sell liquor at retail in cities of the first, second and third classes, 'as classified by the act of 1874, are required to pay a license fee of $500, and therefore, that the relator is not entitled to the relief sought in this proceeding.</p>
