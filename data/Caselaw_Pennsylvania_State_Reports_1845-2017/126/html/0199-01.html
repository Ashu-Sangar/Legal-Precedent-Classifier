Besides, it was improper for the district attorney to be present when a vote was being taken on the bill. While there can be no objection to the district attorney being present during the examination of the witnesses, for the purpose of directing the order of the testimony and eliciting the material facts, after the evidence has been presented, it is, in our opinion, his duty to withdraw and leave the jury to its unbiased deliberations. His presence for the prosecution during the vote upon the bill would necessarily hamper the jury in the exercise of a free and untrammeled judgment. The practice is thus stated by Justice Field, of the U. S. Supreme Court, in a charge delivered to a California grand jury: “ The district attorney has the right to be present at the taking of testimony before you, for the purpose of giving information or advice touching any matter cognizable by you, and may interrogate his witnesses before you, but he has no right to be present pending your deliberations on ’ the evidence. It is proper to keep in mind the fact that the only valid basis on which the institution of grand juries rests, is, that they are an independent and impartial tribunal between the prosecutor and the accused, and it is the duty of the courts to <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>refuse to tolerate any practice which conflicts with this independence and impartialityWhart.

After it was discovered that Summerson was improperly withdrawn from the jury, we recommitted the bill to the grand jury, who returned it without changing their finding. This, we think, will not cure the former irregularity. That we have the power to quash the finding of a grand jury for irregularities and for matters dehors the record, will appear from the following authorities. In Brown v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/73/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="73 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1032346" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0321-01">73 Pa. 321</a>, it was held that the array of grand jurors should have been set aside and the indictment quashed, because the jury wheel was not properly sealed. In Commonwealth v. Bartilson, <a href="/pa/85/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="85 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="440528" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0482-01">85 Pa. 482</a>, Justice Paxson, says: “ We do not deny the power of the court to quash an indictment for matters not apparent on its face. This is sometimes done for defects in the process for drawing and summoning the grand jury.” In Jillard v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/26/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="26 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="977212" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0169-01">26 Pa. 169</a>, Justice Woodwabd says: “The irregularities of the indictment were not pleadable in bar of the indictment; at most, it was ground only for a motion to quash ; ” recognizing the power of the court to quash.

While we might concede (although as stated by Tilghman, C. J., in Ritchie v. Holbrooke, 7 S. &amp; R. 458, it has been a vexata questio,) that the affidavit of jurors should not be received to impeach their finding, yet we are not prepared to go to the extent of deciding that the testimony of a district attorney cannot be received for the purpose of showing that he was present when the grand jury acted upon a bill. He is not a member of the grand jury, and the rule does not apply. But whether his evidence was admissible or not, the district attorney was frank enough to admit to the court that he was present when the vote was taken on the bill. We think the reasons are sufficient to require us to quash the bill of indictment.</p>

Whilst the district attorney appears to have acted in good faith, he admits that he was mistaken in supposing that the court had given any such instructions. It appears also that the district attorney remained in the room with the grand jury, not only whilst the witnesses were examined on this bill, but during their deliberations upon it and whilst the vote was being taken upon the question whether or not the bill should be returned a true bill. The defendants’ contention is that this action of the district attorney was good ground for quashing the indictment, and the learned judge of the court below, being of this opinion, sustained the motion to quash and entered a decree to .that effect.</p>

It is for the jury alone to consider the evidence and to apply it to the case in hand; any attempt on the part of the district attorney to influence their action or to give effect to the evidence adduced, is in the highest degree improper and impertinent. Indeed, it is the better practice, and the jurors have an undoubted right to require, that he should retire from the room during their deliberations upon the evidence and when the vote is taken whether or not an indictment shall be found or a presentment made. In the absence, however, of any participation in the deliberations of the jury or effort on his part to influence their finding, we do not think that the mere presence of the commonwealth’s officer in the jury room would he good ground for quashing a hill; no ease has been called to our attention which carries the rule to this extent.</p>

Summerson was a competent juror, and having been sworn was entitled to sit. The district attorney seems to have been misled by a suggestion of Farwell, the prosecutor, who, coming out of the court room, said to Brown that Summerson should withdraw from the grand jury before the consideration of, or a vote upon this bill. The district attorney, supposing that the court had so ordered, told Mr. Summerson to retire, which he did. Although this appears to have been done in good faith, as far as the district attorney was concerned, it was done rashly, without proper consideration and wholly without authority. But we are relieved from deciding what was the legal effect of the withdrawal of this juror; for, when the bill was returned, the matter was called to the attention of the court, and ifc was at once inferred back to the grand jury, and then, in the absence of the district attorney, upon a re-examination of the witnesses, and in the presence and hearing of Mr. Summerson and of the entire jury, the vote was retaken and the bill was <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>again returned a true bill.

Now this statement of the district attorney was clearly right, and it was one which it was his privilege to make.
