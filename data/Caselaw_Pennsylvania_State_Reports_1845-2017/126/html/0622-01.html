Downs, aged between 7 and 8 years, the son of the plaintiff, fell through a hole in a platform erected by the owner of a store building on the west side of Mechanic street, in the city of Bradford. Mechanic street had been ordained as a street, June 27,1881. A sidewalk had been built on the opposite side of the street prior to the accident, but on the west side of the street there was no other sidewalk than said platform, which was in a bad condition. The plaintiff admitted that he knew the platform was in a bad condition, and it did not appear that he had informed his son or forbidden his playing on or about the platform. The plaintiff also testified that at the time of the accident he was on the opposite side of Mechanic street, about 50 or 55 feet from his son; that he saw him go along on the platform and probably he went 4 or 5 feet after he saw him, before he fell. The fact of the injury and the nature thereof was proved, and that the child died on March 14, 1885, from the effects, as the plaintiff claimed and introduced testimony to show, of the injury. The defendant introduced testimony to show that with proper care and treatment the child would have recovered.</p>

The uncontradieted evidence in the case showing that the defendant, prior to the accident, had never built or caused to be built a sidewalk over that portion of the street where the injury is alleged to have occurred, and the plaintiff having failed to show actual notice to the defendant of any dangerous obstruction in said street, or the existence of any such obstruction for so long a time as would imply notice of the same to the defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action, and your verdict must be for the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b649-6" data-blocks='[["BL_649.6",649,[148,885,1183,975]]]'>Answer: We refuse this point. The question of whether there was a dangerous place in the street for sufficient length of time to visit the defendant with constructive notice, is for the jury. Now you will bear in mind that the defendant cannot be held liable in this case, without notice of the dangerous place in the street, if it was in the public street, either actual or constructive. You understand readily what actual notice is. If any of the proper officials of the city had actual notice, then the city had notice. If this place was within the bounds of the street which had been adopted by the city, and over which they were exercising control, and there was a dangerous place there so long that they ought to have known it, by the care and diligence of the officers, that would be constructive notice. Hence we refuse this point, and leave it for you to gay whether there was a dangerous place there, and whether it was within a street, and whether it had been there so long that tbe city ought to have known it. We think there is no evidence of actual notice here, that we recollect, but that is for you, of a dangerous place at this point.3</p>

[As we view the evidence there was not a sidewalk constructed and managed there by the defendant; but, if there was a dangerous place in this platform, or whether it was by the Cross building where the accident is alleged, to have occurred, that had existed there so long after the city had adopted this street and taken charge of it that they ought to have known it, then it was the duty of the city to have removed it or to have fixed it so that <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>it would be safe. So that it is not material whether it was a sidewalk or not, under the evidence in this ease, if it was an obstruction or a dangerous place in the street, and had existed so long that the city ought to have known it, if they had been looking about and using care; then the city wtiuld be liable whether in fact the corporate officers knew of this place or not.] 8 Hence you see it becomes important for you to determine whether this was within the line of the street, and whether a dangerous place existed there, and whether the boy received the injury there in the manner described, and you should consider all tlxe evidence on this point, and determine whether that was the injury that caused the trouble with the boy’s knee, and which caused all this nursing and.expense and injury to the hoy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b651-4" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[143,1093,1189,923]]]'>The ordinance was adopted in June, 1881, and there doesn’t seem to he any question, as we recollect the evidence, but that is for you, that the city had charge of that street from that on, and there is some evidence that we admitted, under objection, that they bad performed some work on the street before that. We hardly think that there is enough evidence to warrant the jury in finding that that was a public street without the ordinance, prior to the adoption of the ordinance, but the ordinance was adopted, and [it seems to be uncontradicted, as we recollect the evidence, that they took charge of this street in June, 1881, and the accident did not happen till the September following. Would not this be time enough in a place like the city of Bradford for the city officers, if they had been doing tbeir duty, to have discovered the dangerous place, if there was one there, and remedied it ? Had they constructive notice; did a dangerous place exist there so long that it was their business to know it? If it did, you treat it as though they did know it and had actual notice.] 9</p>

[Now did Mr. Downs know there was a dangerous place in that walk? Did he know as much about it as the city officers knew or ought to have known ? If he did, and there was a place there that was dangerous and he knew it, and he did not restrain his infant child of tender years — so young that we have instructed you that you should not impute negligence to the child — if he did not restrain him or keep him away from there, or attempt to, then we say under the law that he is guilty of contributory negligence, but if he did not know it was dangerous the law would be otherwise.

The injury appears not to have been considered very serious at <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>the time ; at least, no complaint was made to the city authorities until the commencement of this suit. The injury occurred on September 8, 1881; the suit was not commenced until February 2, 1885. The injury which tbe boy sustained resulted in his death about four years thereafter. This fact was alleged by the plaintiff and has been found by the jury. Under such circumstances the case has not nnrch to commend it. The delay of about four years in giving notice of tlie accident, or making any claim therefor, certainly placed the city at a great disadvantage, and left the municipality practically at the mercy of the plaintiff, whose claim rests upon his own testimony and that of his wife. Our duty, however, is to dispose of the case as we find it, and revise the rulings of the court below upon the law.</p>

The first declaration contained two counts, in each of which damages are claimed for the loss of the boy’s services by reason of his injury. In the amended declaration, damages are claimed for the loss of his services occasioned by his death. This would seem to enlarge the cause of action somewhat, yet it is more seeming than real, as the first narr alleged the injuries to be permanent, involving a total loss of services. We cannot say that the amendment of the narr was not allowable.</p>
    <p id="b653-6" data-blocks='[["BL_653.7",653,[150,1708,1181,461]]]'>There is no merit in the second specification, which alleges error in excluding the boy’s declarations, made some time after the accident. They were not part of the res gestas: and, as the action was by the father for the loss of services, we do not see how his rights can be affected by the declarations of the son. It is true the plaintiff claims by reason of the injury to the boy, but his legal rights are independent of that fact, and cannot be defeated by anything the son can say or do.

The defendant might have been <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>entitled to a more specific instruction had it been asked for. The point was as follows : “If the jury believe the child alleged to have been injured did not have such care, attention and medical treatment as a prudent person would bestow upon a child so injured, then the plaintiff is guilty of negligence, and your verdict must be for the defendant.” As the case stood under the pleadings the learned judge would have been justified in refusing this point. The lack of proper treatment would have been no answer to the claim for the original injury, however it might have been as to the count claiming damages for the death of the boy. Hence it was not error in the learned judge to say in answer to the point: “ Answered in the negative. The facts assumed in this point will not entirely' defeat a recovery, but may properly reduce the amount thereof; this is for the jury to determine.” Had the defendant desired an instruction bearing only upon the amended count in the declaration, the point should have been differently framed. As presented to the court we see no error in the answer of the learned judge.</p>
