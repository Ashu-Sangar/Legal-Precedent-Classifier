Desiring to dispose of a country place she owned in her own right, she consulted with a Mr. Strong of New York, her husband’s friend and business associate, and at his suggestion her brother-in-law, John W. Griswold, was asked to see a real estate broker and have the place offered for sale. In the spring of 1882, Mr. Griswold called upon one Everly, a real estate broker, and placed the property in his hands for sale. Mr. Everly advertised the property for sale in the city papers, describing it as a “ country seat of seven acres ” near to Darby station. Mr. Gebbie saw the advertisement and called upon Mr. Everly who showed him photographs and gave him a printed circular in which the property was described in eloquent terms and said <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>to consist “of nearly seven acres of land.” At the interview with Air. Everiy, Air. Gebbie asked as to the price of the property and was told to go and see it. Accordingly Mr. and Mrs. Gebbie visited Darby and there met John W. Griswold, who showed them over the place, and in a conversation, hereinafter given, told of its acreage*' A few days afterward an offer of §24,000 for the place gp^ft stood was made and accepted. The price was subsequently inade §23,000, by the omission of a carriage from the purchase, and on Alay 16,1882, a contract was signed by which the defendant agreed to sell the property, known as Maple Terrace, including certain articles of personalty, for the price last stated. This contract did not mention the acreage of the place. On June 15,1882, the defendant met the plaintiffs for the first time, when she executed and delivered her deed to AlaryAnn Gebbie, and received §12,000 of the purchase money and a mortgage for the balance. The deed then delivered described the property by courses and distances but did not disclose its acreage. The vendees immediately went into possession.</p>

Mr. Strong had an office here, but his residence was in New York,, and did not find it convenient to attend to the business himself. He therefore assented readily to John Griswold’s idea, and gave him a more general authority, because he said, “ Employ two or three brokers if necessary,” and from that time forth he dismissed the same from his mind, or at least took no further steps in regard to it, as Mrs. Griswold had, as she declares, dismissed it from her mind.</p>

At the same time, when a man is employed to do a thing, it is generally implied, or may be so, that he is to do what is requisite to render Ms employment effectual, and, without stating any proposition of law, [it is a question for the jury to consider whether, if a man is told to select a real estate agent and to employ Mm to sell a piece of property, that does or does not carry with it the duty to give a description of the property to the person so employed.] <em>2 </em>To some extent it would seem to be so, because he must necessarily say where the property is situated, as, for instance, whether it is in the town or the country. It would not do to call upon a broker, and say, “ I want you to sell a house,” without saying where the house was. Some description, therefore, must be given, and the doubt is as to the extent. I suppose it is a matter of inference or for consideration by the' jury, whether a person who is authorized to select a broker and employs Mm to sell a house, may not state the number of stories, whether it is of brick or stone, and give him some general idea, because otherwise the broker would be comparatively uninformed of what might be material for him to know, in negotiating the sale. I do not say that this would be necessary, because, after the broker had been told where the buildings were, he might look for himself; but on the other hand, I certainly do not mean to tell the jury that a right to give some description of the property might not exist. Mr. John Griswold certainly interpreted his authority in the largest sense.</p>

Men habitually praise what they are going to sell.

What followed was that the Gebbies agreed to give $24,000, which was subsequently reduced to $28,000 by the withdrawal of a carriage.] 3</p>

Second: Did Mr. Griswold state what he did not know to be true, and what was, in fact, false, without having any reasonable ground for believing it ? Third : Was this statement credited and believed by the purchasers ? Did it influence them in buying, and induce them to give a larger sum than they otherwise would have consented to pay?

In the present case, the plaintiffs proved only an erroneous statement by the plaintiffs’ agent. There was no direct proof of deceitful intent, and there was nothing in the circumstances to indicate anything but mistake ; consequently, the defendant was entitled to a binding instruction. The plaintiffs themselves Lived upon the lands for five years after their purchase, and repeatedly stated to their visiting friends, according to their own testimony, that “ the estate is seven acres and ratlier more.” The burden was upon the plaintiffs to do more than prove the fact of a mistaken statement by defendant’s agent: Kreiter v.

Actions for deceit naturally fall into three classes, and a <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>different rule of law is applicable to each class: (1) Those in which the representation is as to the credit or financial standing of a person. (2) Those in which the representation is as to the quality of an article offered for sale. (3) Those in which the representation is as to a matter of fact, susceptible of knowledge and from its very nature presumed to be within the knowledge of the party making the statement. It is from cases of the first class the defendant deduces the rule of law she would apply in this case: Dilworth v. Bradner, <a href="/pa/85/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="85 Pa. 238" data-case-ids="440473" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0238-01">85 Pa. 238</a>; Duff v.

In cases under this class, the representation is at best, but the statement of an opinion. If, therefore, a man truthfully states his opinion, he has given all that is required, and an inquiry into'the grounds on which it is based is not pertinent.</p>
    <p id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[265,1018,1196,917]]]'>2. In the second class of cases, the representation may be said to be a mixed matter of fact and opinion. In many of these cases, the law affords another ample remedy in an action of assumpsit on the warranty expressed or implied, and, such a remedy being open, the law will be slow to allow the plaintiff to pursue the more obnoxious action of tort; in other words, the statement will be considered to be a warranty, rather than a misleading representation. The law in this class of cases has lately been elaborately considered and definitely settled in Erie City Iron Works v. Barber, <a href="/pa/102/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="102 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="502668" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0156-01">102 Pa. 156</a>; s. c. <a href="/citations/?q=106%20Pa.%20126" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="106 Pa. 126">106 Pa. 126</a>; s. c. <a href="/pa/118/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="118 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="556763" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0006-01">118 Pa. 6</a>.

The present action, belonging to the third class of cases referred to, could have been rested on less direct evidence of fraud than that actually presented, and should be governed by a less strict rule of law than was applied to the facts by the court below.- -.The fraud here consists in the reckless assertion that that is true of which the party knows nothing, and in deceiving the other party thereby; and even the actual belief of the party in the truth of that which he asserts, is immaterial, unless he had some apparently good reason for his belief, or <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>unless his representations related to matters of opinion : and it is not necessary to show, in such case, that the defendant knew his representations to be untrue:.

Thus he drops out entirely the first branch of the rule, did the party state what he knew to be false, because there was no evidence nor was it charged that Griswold had made a deliberate and intentional misstatement. The gravamen of the case was that he had, with a recklessness equivalent to fraud, made a positive statement of a material fact, when he had no knowledge on the subject. Plaintiff had proved that the statement was made, and was in fact untrue. Defendant had given evidence as to her innocence of the misrepresentations, but John Griswold had not been called to state his knowledge or belief, or explain his representations. In this state of the evidence, the judge submitted to the jury whether Griswold had any reasonable ground for believing his statement to be true, or, in other words, could the jury find from the circumstances, as shown by the evidence, any ground to suppose that Griswold did so believe. The language was a fair statement of so much of the general rule as applied to the evidence then before the jury. As it is well stated by the learned judge in his opinion on the rule for a new trial, “ Had John Griswold been put on the stand, to vindicate his good faith and state the grounds of his belief, or show how he came to believe in the absence of information.....it might have been proper to instruct the jury that whether the causes which influenced his mind were or were not reasonable, or such as they could approve, still if he acted in good faith and expressed a sincere opinion, he should not be found guilty of fraud. But as the case actually stood, such an instruction would have tended to mislead, by raising an issue for which there was no foundation in the evidence.”</p>

In support of this view, it is said that plaintiff has only proved an erroneous statement, with no direct proof of deceitful intent. But plaintiff had proved the statement, its falsity, and the circumstances under which it was made, tending to show a reckless assertion in entire ignorance of the fact. What more was necessary to make out a prima facie case, or could ordinarily <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>'be proved? Fraud and intent to deceive do not proclaim themselves openly, nor can they usually be proved by direct evidence. A man who is shown to have made a false statement, from the consequences of which he will be relieved if he honestly believed it to be true, even on insufficient grounds, should at least be charged with the burden of showing that he did have such belief.</p>

    <p id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.6",389,[168,1340,1182,1125]]]'>The point that the plaintiff in error was not liable for the statements of her agent, John Griswold, is not tenable. The general rule that a principal is responsible for the misrepresentations of his agent within his authority, is beyond question, and the better opinion is that as to third parties affected by his acts or words, it is the apparent scope of his authority, and not his actual instructions, that must govern. That is the basis on which the business of the world in the present day is transacted, and the rule should be enforced in a liberal spirit, with regard to the actual habits of the community. That an agent who is empowered to engage a real estate broker to make sale of a country seat, is thereby authorized to give the broker a description of the place, including its acreage, is so clear, tMt the learned judge would have been justified in submitting the point to the jury in terms much stronger against the defendant below than he did. But the question does not really arise, as there was testimony not only that the defendant knew of the preparation of the circular by her agent, but also that she had herself given it to parties who inquired about the property. Under this evidence the jury could hardly fail to find that whether it was within the agent’s original authority or not, she had ratified his action.</p>

The evidence of the value of the land by the acre is objected to, because the place is claimed to have been sold as a whole. But there was evidence that in arriving at a price, the quantity of the land was one of the elements of the calculation, and upon this view of the case, which was plaintiff’s contention, the value per acre was certainly relevant. .</p>

Even her agent, John Griswold, who made the trouble, may not have had any actual intent to deceive, but he was shown to have made an apparently reckless statement of a fact of which he had no knowledge. An explanation from him might have turned the verdict, and it is the plaintiff in error’s misfortune that he was not called at the trial, to make such explanation if he had it to make. The case, as a whole, was a very close case, in which the jury might have found for either party without being demonstrably wrong, but if they did in fact make a mistake, it was for the learned judge who tried the cause to correct it, not for us. There was no error of law in the trial, and beyond that we are not authorized to look.</p>
