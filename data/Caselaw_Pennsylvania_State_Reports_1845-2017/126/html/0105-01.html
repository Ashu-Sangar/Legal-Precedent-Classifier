Hence the law concludes that the widow’s estate must be treated as if she had accepted the terms of the will: Crozier’s App., <a href="/pa/90/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="90 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1065662" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0384-01">90 Pa. 384</a>.</p>

L. 537, the widow’s share of the fund now before us is nothing; for the will provides that she shall have “ the equal one third part of all my estate.....during her natural life.” The testator has disposed of the one third part of his estate during the life of his widow, and out “ of the estate thus devised ” he has given some small legacies payable after his wife’s decease. As to the rest or residue of bis estate, he has made no provision, and the administrator of the widow claims that as to this residue the testator died intestate, whereby she, or now her estate, is entitled to the share given a widow under the intestate laws, where there are no children, to wit, one half the personal estate. We conclude, however, that so far as the widow is concerned, the decedent did not die intestate as to any part of his estate. She is to have “the equal ono third part of all my estate both real and personal during her natural life,” and no more.</p>
