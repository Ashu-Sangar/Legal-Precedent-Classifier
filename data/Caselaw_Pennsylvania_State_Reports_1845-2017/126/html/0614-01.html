    <p class="summary" id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.5",640,[277,564,1184,103]]]'>After argument, the court, Bkow, P. J., filed the following opinion:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b640-6" data-blocks='[["BL_640.6",640,[269,669,1191,824]]]'>The defendants, road commissioners of Pine Grove township, are charged with unlawfully, wilfully and negligently refusing to lay out and return for a public road a certain road or locality described in the indictment. The duties of the road commissioners of the several townships of Warren county, as prescribed by § 6, act of April 9, 1844, P. L. 281, is to take general charge and supervision of all the roads in their respective townships, and thus far their duty is a positive one, and wholly without condition or qualification. It is their further duty to lay out roads at the request in writing of the citizens of the township, but this duty is upon the condition, “if they shall deem the same necessary.” The laying out of a public road under the act is essentially discretionary, made so by the express words used. Being so, we think it cannot properly be said that there is a legal right to demand a road, or a legal duty to supply one.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b640-7" data-blocks='[["BL_640.7",640,[259,1502,1191,602]]]'>The indictment, it is true, alleges that the defendants deemed said road necessary for the public accommodation, but it appears to us that, the only evidence that can be given to show that defendants deemed the road asked for as necessary, is their official action laying out the road, and that the fact alleged in the indictment that they refused and neglected to lay out and return the road, must be taken as conclusive of their official opinion that no necessity exists for their action. We are of the opinion that if all the facts set forth in the indictment were proved, they would not justify the conviction of the defendants, and hence the motion to quash is made absolute.</p>

    <p id="b641-5" data-blocks='[["BL_641.6",641,[170,557,1185,873]]]'>We think the opinion of the learned judge below fully vindicates his action in quashing the bill of indictment. The defendants, as commissioners of roads and highways in the township of Pine Grove, were clothed with the general charge and supervision of all the roads and bridges in the said township, and with the duty to lay out and alter the roads, at the request in writing of the citizens thereof if they should deem the same necessary, and to make return thereof to the court. The indictment is for their refusal to lay out the road in question in obedience to the request in writing of a number of the citizens of this township. The refusal of the defendants to lay out this road is conclusive of the fact that they do not deem it necessary. That the commissioners have a discretion in this matter, is too plain to need argument; that they have exercised this discretion, is equally clear. If we concede that their discretion was not wisely exercised, they cannot be punished for their error by indictment and conviction as criminals.</p>
    <p id="b641-6" data-blocks='[["BL_641.7",641,[941,1438,362,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
