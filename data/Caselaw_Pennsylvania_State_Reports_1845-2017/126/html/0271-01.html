Cornell and Harry Cornell, by their attorney, Mr. G. R. Bedford, presented their petition, under the act of June 24, 1885, P. L. 152, alleging that the .title to certain real estate was in them,' and that they were in possession thereof; that Asher L. Davenport and A. Byron Davenport claimed ownership of the lands under a commissioner’s sale of 583 acres of land assessed in the name of Daniel Seabert and “sold for taxes; praying for a rule upon the said Asher L. and A. Byron Davenport to bring tbeir action of ejectment within <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>ninety days after said rule should be made absolute, or show cause, etc. A rule to show cause was granted, and on January 6, 1888, the defendants filed an answer denying the averments of the petition-and asserting that both title and possession of the premises claimed by the petitioners were in the respondents.</p>

L. 152, and the only question of importance raised by the petition and the answer thereto seems to be tins: Are the petitioners in possession of the premises “ by occupancy, lease, coverture, or otherwise ?.” If this question be answered in the affirmative by the evidence, then the plaintiffs are entitled to have granted a rule on the defendants to bring their action of ejectment within ninety days from the time tire rule shall be made absolute. If the evidence does not establish such a possession in the plaintiffs as the act defines, then they are not éntitled to have the order which they ask for.</p>

It follows, therefore, that the questions intended to be raised are not properly before us. They may perhaps arise hereafter on writ of error to final judgment in the action of ejectment, in case the same is brought either within the time required by the act or after-wards, and the judgment is adverse to plaintiffs in error, but, inasmuch as there is nothing properly before us, at present, we forbear to express any opinion on the subject.</p>
