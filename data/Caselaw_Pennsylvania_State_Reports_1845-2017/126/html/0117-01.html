The parties may have regarded this as possible, but we doubt if they regarded the exhaustion of so large a body of land as probable. If they had considered that a sufficient reason for treating the coal royalties as capital, the interest upon which only should go to the life tenant, it seems to us that they would have guarded against the contingency by providing expressly for an accumulation and investment of the royalties. At all events the argument based on this bare possibility is more than offset by the argument in favor of the construction based on the possibility that the interest on the coal royalties, together with the income from other sources, would not'be sufficient to enable the life tenant to carry out her agreement to properly support, maintain, and educate her children during their minority.</p>

But under the doctrine of the later eases, Hope’s App., 2 Cent. E. 43, and Fairchild v. Fairchild, 7 Cent. R. 873, it is impossible to treat the purchase money going under these instruments to an administrator as “income,” unless, as in the case of a will, the intention to give the thing itself is clear, or, in the language of Mr. Justice Clark, in McClintock v. Dana'; the intention “being established,” the “technical character of the rental becomes unimportant.”</p>

But while the intention is as much to be sought for in a deed as in a will, yet in the former, legal and technical terms must be given their proper and established meaning. In the first instance, therefore, the instrument, under which the fund for distribution arises, must be regarded as a conveyance or sale, <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>executed by the trustees under the power to sell, and the fund itself the purchase money. The deed of November, 1881, clearly grants the power to lease, as something distinct from the power to sell. The former power is to be exercised without reference fib Mrs. Lee; the latter only under given circumstances and with her written consent. And that the donors recognized the distinction between a lease proper and a sale, or its now constructive equivalent, a coal-lease, is shown by their express reference to the latter as such equivalent “sale or coal-lease.” By no canon of construction can the limitation as to circumstances and consent be referred back so as to qualify the first granted and absolute power to lease.</p>
    <p id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[249,967,1191,717]]]'>3. It is true, that under the English cases, rents, under a coal lease executed by executors or trustees under powers given either by will or deed, go to a life tenant, just as the rents of an opened mine would do. But it must be remembered that the logic of the English cases is, that, these instruments being leases, the royalties or returns made for the coal taken are rents and therefore constitute income, and go to the heir and not to the administrator. Whereas, the logic of the Pennsylvania cases is; that these instruments are not leases, but sales, and the rents and returns for'the coal taken are purchase money. It is therefore difficult to see how in this state, that which is declared to be purchase money, arising under a sale and going to an administrator, can at the same time be called rent, or income, and go either to the heir or tenant for life.</p>
    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.6",148,[242,1693,1192,718]],["BL_149.1",149,[184,355,1180,256]]]'>4. All the cases relied on in Pennsylvania, were not merely cases or wills, but were cases in which the person claiming the fund was the only direct and certain object of the testator’s bounty; as, for instance, a son, to whom a share of the residuary estate had been devised, or an only child, etc., and where the remainders over were either to an ascertained person or to an unascertained clasá. But there are direct considerations apparent on the face of the deed and the surrounding circumstances, as they appear upon this record, which show that the purchase money, or the. price of the coal, was not to go to Mrs. Lee. In the first place, she was not the donor’s direct, or even remote, object of bounty. She was to take under the deed something less than she had had before its execution, and she was to assume out of what she was to get under that deed, the support <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>of these children. Her husband gave up his curtesy estate, but not to her. With him, as with her, the only common object of bounty was the children. It was for their support, maintenance and education, that both parents united in giving up their respective estates in this land.</p>
    <p id="b149-5" data-blocks='[["BL_149.5",149,[182,616,1182,934]]]'>5. A construction that would give the corpus of this estate to the wife, free from the husband’s curtesy, and leave the children nothing, must be radically wrong. The elder of the children, at the time of the execution of this trust deed, was not five years old. In the sixteen years before her majority, at least $160,000 would have gone to the mother. It is certainly possible, and indeed very probable, that within that period all the coal could be exhausted or paid for in advance, and nothing left for the support and education of the children. It is no answer to this to say that the deed might have contained an express trust for an accumulation or an express limitation of the mother’s right, for the reason that the technical terms in the deed, as we have endeavored to show, simply are those of a sale, and the only trusts to the mother are for the income and not for the purchase money; and this legal intent and effect of the instrument can only be avoided or overturned by a supposed intention to treat as income, that which is certainly and cleai'ly, under the later cases in Pennsylvania, nothing but purchase money.</p>

    <p id="b149-7" data-blocks='[["BL_149.7",149,[178,1662,1181,820]]]'>1. It is a great mistake to imagine that the doctrine that the grant of a right to take coal to any extent is a grant of an interest in the land, is of recent recognition in this state. The question first came before this court in Caldwell v. Fulton, <a href="/pa/31/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="31 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="985056" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0475-01">31 Pa. 475</a>; again, in Harlan v. Leh. Coal &amp; N. Co., <a href="/pa/35/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="35 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="990429" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0287-01">35 Pa. 287</a>; likewise in Stoughton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/88/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="88 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1061199" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0198-01">88 Pa. 198</a>. See also Justice Woodward’s opinion in Funk v. Haldeman, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20Pa.%20243" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="53 Pa. 243">53 Pa. 243</a>, quoting Bainbridge on Mines, 246. There is nothing new therefore in Hope’s App., 2 Cent. R. 43, and Fairchild v. Fairchild, 7 Cent. R. 873. In addition to the cases cited by the appellant against us, we furnish another, viz.: Duff’s App., 12 Cent. R. 544, s. c. 21 W. N. 491, which wont so far as to decide that royalty under a mining lease is not rent, but part of the corpus of the land. Of course the cases mentioned are each and all to be viewed in the light of the surrounding facts or conditions affecting the subject.</p>

This doctrine, however, does not prevent the owner, where the rights of no mortgagee intervene, from treating and disposing of that which is taken from the land as being divested of its characteristics of realty and partaking of the nature of personalty. As against a mortgagee, the owner’s intention will not avail to deprive the former of his lien security upon all that stands in place as part of the land; but as against the remainder-man, such intention must prevail, because it is solely by the will of the owner that he is a remainder-man. So, also, with respect to the reversioner : the will of the owner, as manifested during his lifetime, by opening mines, may divest the thing mined of its character of realty during the existence 'of the life tenancy, giving its proceeds to the holder of the latter. As before remarked, each of the cases referred to, wherein the nature of a lease of minerals, or of the rentals therefrom, have been determined, must be viewed in the light of surrounding facts.</p>
    <p id="b150-5" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[244,1229,1192,1083]]]'>3. The intention of a deed is as much the governing rule of construction as in a will, and the construction of this- deed, with respect to the coal-rentals, must come within the operation of the same principles that obtained in Eley’s Appeal, Wentz’s Appeal, McClintock v. Dana, and Shoemaker’s Appeal. We find on examination that the powers granted to the trustees are the same, viz., to lease the coal and to pay over the income of the estate to certain cestuis que trust. In these cases the grant of power to the trustee to lease the coal is held as being tantamount to the testator having leased it himself in his lifetime. That this court regards the like powers in a will and deed as expressing a like intent, is evident from its reasoning in Eley’s Appeal, supra, in which Justice Stebjrett cites Daly v. Beckett, 24 Beav. 114, and quotes the language of the master of the rolls, applying it to the case in hand. The circumstances of that case are in almost perfect analogy to this one, in whatever aspect we regard it. . It is a deed creating the trust, using like language respecting the income, the like power to lease coal being granted, and the like circumstances, as to the coal, existing, even to that of a small portion of one of the veins being already under lease.</p>

It is also to be remembered that, as to the children, Mrs. Lee was the absolute owner of the property, having the right <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>to pass the inheritance by will to other than her own offspring. She voluntarily took on herself the obligation to maintain and educate them during their minority. Had she not executed this deed, and had leased the coal, her absolute right to the whole of the rentals would have been unquestioned. So, also, if she had leased it before executing the deed. It certainly cannot be supposed that she would voluntarily give up this possible source of income, and, after granting such powér as to enable the coal to be leased, at the same time intend that she .could not avail herself of its proceeds to the same extent as if she had leased it herself. On the contrary, it appears from the surrounding facts specified in the agreement, and it likewise appears all through the provisions of the deed, that the grantors looked to the coal-rentals from future leases of the same as a source of income for her enjoyment, she simply stipulating that she would educate and support her children during their minority, and securing her covenant out of the same source of income.</p>
