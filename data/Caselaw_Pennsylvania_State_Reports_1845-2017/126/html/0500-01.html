Morgan was on terms of intimate friendship with him, and during all that time made his home at the house of said Morgan as a boarder, and was indebted to him for his boarding, and being so indebted, urged and entreated the said George P. Morgan to permit him to build at the actual cost thereof a house upon his lot, the lot of George P. Morgan described in the petition, and that thus he would be able to pay him what he owed him for his hoarding. The said Mountney represented that one John Geesey was indebted to him in a large sum of money: <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>that he was a contractor and builder and that he could the more easily obtain payment of his debt by employing said Geesey to build the said house. George P. Morgan consented and the house was built by said Mountney, or by said Geesey, his debtor, for him, and although the building was not entirely completed at the death of George P. Morgan, yet soon after his death, and whilst it was still not completed, the respondents, Amelia S. Morgan and Nannie B. Morgan, entered into possession thereof, in the month of February, 1874, and the said Mountney, continuing to make his home in the family after the death of George P. Morgan, as a boarder, removed to the said house with them, where still thereafter he continued to board with them until the fall of 1879.</p>

It was accordingly agreed between them that he should continue to board with her in satisfaction of whatever balance might be due, at the rate of twenty dollars per month for boarding, two dollars per month for washing and a reasonable allowance for mending his clothes, and on these terms he continued to board with her and she continued to wash his clothes and mend them, and so furnished and labored for him for the benefit of her daughter, Nannie B.

    <p class="summary" id="b527-5" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[181,459,1183,667]]]'>On April 27, 1874, Amelia S. Morgan, administratrix of George P. Morgan, late of Altoona, deceased, presented her petition in this court, setting forth that the personal estate of the decedent was insufficient for the payment of his debts, and praying for an order authorizing her to mortgage certain real estate in the city of Altoona for the purpose of raising money to discharge the indebtedness. On the same day the court ordered a decree on her petition, authorizing her to mortgage the real estate described therein, on such terms as she might deem expedient for payment of decedent’s debts. She at that date averred an indebtedness on part of the decedent to Ed. Mountney in $2,299.19, which was about the only indebtedness of her intestate, so far as appears from her petition.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b527-6" data-blocks='[["BL_527.6",527,[178,1136,1178,562]]]'>On July 28, 1874, she executed a mortgage to Mountney to secure payment of this debt, and Mountney, on December 14, 1874, assigned the mortgage to J. Levan Metzgar. Default having been made in payment, on September 4, 1876, a scire facias was directed to issue, but the administratrix appeared by attorney and waived the issuing and service of writ. On December 27, 1876, the defendant pleaded “ never indebted and payment,” etc. The case was referred to arbitrators under the compulsory arbitration act, and an award had in favor of plaintiff for $2,440.16. The award was not appealed from within 20 days and became a judgment.</p>

Before sale was had, however, on March 24, 1879, on petition and affidavit filed, she moved in the Court of Common Pleas to strike off the judgment entered on the award of arbitrators. The court awarded a rule to show cause. On August 28, 1879, the guardian of Nannie B. Morgan, a minor child of decedent, presented his petition and affidavit, praying to be made a party defendant to the judgment, and he was given leave to interplead. After full hearing and argument on this rule, the court, on August 25, 1880, in opinion filed, discharged it.</p>

(2) That Mountney and his assignee, Metzgar, be restrained by injunction from proceeding to collect it. Preliminary injunction was awarded, and on a motion to continue the same after argument, the court dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill. From this decree the administratrix and guardian, on May 19, 1883, took an appeal to the Supreme Co.urt.

The Supreme Court sustained this objection so far as Nannie B. Morgan, the minor child, was concerned, and in their opinion in effect decide : (1) That Nannie B. Morgan not having been heard on a motion to approve and confirm the mortgage, a court of equity should hear her on such motion, and if her objections are sustained by proper proof, should interfere to protect her estate from execution on a judgment obtained on the mortgage. (2) That there is nothing in the way of an application by the mortgagee to the Orphans’ Court for an approval and confirmation of the mortgage, after notice to all parties interested, and that after hearing on such motion, an adjustment of the equities of the parties could be had. Then comes this motion to approve and confirm the mortgage.</p>

It is alleged that the amount of money specified in the mortgage as having been loaned to the administratrix by Ed. Mountney, is considerably larger than she received. Under the evidence she must be treated as having received whatever amount the estate of her husband was indebted to Mountney. She, in her petition for the order to mortgage, and in the mortgage, distinctly says this amount was $2,299.19.</p>

Mountney boarded with George P. Morgan several years before his death; he built a house for Morgan, for which he was to be paid just what it cost him ; this cost, according to Mountney’s own statement, was $2,808.85. Wliat amount ought to have been credited to Morgan for boarding ? The minor child alleges a large amount, covering nearly the amount of Mountney’s charge for the building, was due and owing. Mountney admits something was owing, but alleges the amount was comparatively small. The testimony on this point is far from definite. From Mountney’s own statement the board bill was not taken into account when the amount due to him from the estate was determined on. Very clearly it ought to have been; as it was not, the amount must be ascertained as nearly as possible and allowed now. All the testimony shows that $20 per month in view of the circumstances would be a reasonable rate of payment.</p>

We do not believe that it was as large as the cost of the house, but it is not unreasonable that it should have equalled three years’ boarding. Mountney admits he was there three years before Morgan’s death. In his testimony first given, where it was alleged in the testimony of Mrs. Morgan that he had not paid, and payment was not exacted because of his promise to build the house, which he did build, he does not contradict her nor attempt to offer any evidence of payment of any part of the board bill.</p>

The question to be considered is, what ought in good conscience to be done upon the facts of this case ? If this question was to be settled upon the claims of Mountney, the mortgagee, to the consideration of a chancellor it should be dismissed, for the testimony shows him to have acted in bad faith, and to be entitled at the date of this application to little, if anything, from the estate which the appellant represents. If the bills for board and washing which he owes to the estate and to Mrs. Morgan, -were fairly settled and applied on the debt due for the building of the house, it is doubtful whether there would be any of it left. But the equities are to be settled between Metzgar, the assignee of the mortgage, and the appellant. <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>The assignment of the mortgage by Mountney to Metzgar was made on December 14, 1874, and it passed such right as the assignor then had. A purchaser of a non-negotiable instrument is bound to make inquiry of the maker before purchasing, and is fixed with notice of any defence by way of payment, or growing out of the original equities, which inquiry would have brought to his notice. If Metzgar had inquired of Mrs. Morgan before his purchase, he would have learned of the agreement of Mountney to apply his board bills upon the debt represented by the mortgage as payment pro tanto, and of the agreement that his accruing bills should be applied in like manner. He would also have learned that Mountney had continued to board with her up to that date, and that his bills, though not indorsed upon the mortgage, were a payment upon it. As these facts could have been learned by inquiry, Metzgar must be treated as having knowledge of them when he took an assignment of the mortgage, and the equities between him and the appellant must be settled on that basis.</p>
    <p id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[138,1283,1182,344]]]'>The court below found that Mountney was indebted for three years’ bills unpaid at the date of Morgan’s death. The same testimony shows with equal clearness that- the bills accruing after that were to be applied to the same debt. The computation should be made, therefore, to the date of the mortgage, instead of to the death of Morgan, and would make the amount then due as follows :—</p>

He must take it, therefore, subject to such payment. The mortgage is therefore ratified, on petition of the assignee, for $1,310.29, subject to an indorsement as of December 14, 1874, of the sum of $104 paid at that date.</p>
