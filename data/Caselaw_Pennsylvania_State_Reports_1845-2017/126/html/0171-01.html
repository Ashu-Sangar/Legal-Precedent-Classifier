The burden of proof was upon the defendants to show that he might have received other employment had he sought it.] 3 The plaintiff’s case was concluded when he proved the breach of the contract, if you believe that he has successfully proven the breach of the contract. If the defendants had offered evidence showing that employment had been offered to the plaintiff, or that he could have obtained employment and refused it, for the time intervening between the time of his discharge and the time for which he alleges they contracted to employ him, that would have been a matter that I would have had to submit to you for your consideration.

He avers that he stood ready and willing at all times during the period stated to perform his duty, according to the nature and terms of his employment, but his services were refused: his claim is for damages upon the footing of his contract, that is to saj*-, according to the rate of compensation agreed upon. The defendants • deny the existence of such a contract; they allege that the plaintiff was employed at the rate of $70 per month, but for no determinate period; that'his withdrawal from the defendants’service was voluntary; that Steckel was incompetent, and failed to discharge the duties which he undertook to perform, and that the defendants were justified upon either- or all of these grounds in discharging' him from their employment.

The learned judge of the court below declined so to instinct the jury, saying that the burden of proof was upon the defendants, and that as it was not shown the plaintiff either failed to seek employment or refused it when offered, or that he might have obtained employment had he made a proper effort, the point of law suggested had no application to the case. “ There is no evidence; in this cause,” said the learned judge in his general charge, “ which you can take into consideration in mitigation of damages, excepting the testimony showing that Mr. Steckel was employed during a part of the nine months and for which he received a hundred dollars,” etc. “ The burden of proof was upon the defendants to show that he might have received other employment had he sought it,” etc. The answer to this point, and this portion of the charge, to the same effect, are the only matters embraced in the several assignments of error.</p>
