These dwellings were rented from time to time by Crosland, and occupied by his tenants. As early as 1875, Crosland discovered that instead of the drain being used for drainage of surface water, only, as agreed upon between him and Brown, it was used as a sewer or drain for Brown’s cesspool, and also as a drain for Brown’s neighbors. The Pennsylvania Diamond Drill Company, whose shop was on the rear of Crosland’s lot first made complaint, and in 1878, threatened to remove their works or to withhold the rent, unless the nuisance created by this cess-pool sewage coming down by their shop, <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>was abated. The tenants of the dwellings also made complaint, and on May 26, 1880, after Crosland had exhausted every remedy known to him, to disinfect his dwellings and make.them habitable, and after having verbally notified Brown, he served a written notice on Brown to cut off and remove his drain or sewer altogether. Brown paid no attention to these notices.</p>

The result of this was, that the water or sewage thereafter oozed or was forced up on the street at the point where Crosland had disconnected the pipe. It remained in this condition until August 25, 1881, when the borough, at the instance and in pursuance of notice from Brown, first appeared on the scene. On that day, Crosland being absent, the chief burgess, Joseph Derr, and supervisor Dewald, took possession of the drain, opened it up at the point where Crosland had disconnected it, put in new pipe re-connecting it with Crosland’s property. Two days after, August 25, 1881, Crosland again cut off the connection at the curb-stone, and plugged the pipes. Nothing further was attempted by defendant until October 17, 1881, when employees of the borough dug up the drain and re-connected the saíne with Crosland’s premises. Crosland was present and resisted the invasion of his rights, as he claimed the proceeding to be, when he was arrested by the police and conveyed to the common “ lock-up.”</p>

You have heard the same thing from all those witnesses, showing the bad condition of the street, and the odor that some of them testify to, proceeding from the matter upon the street, as to which there is no difference of opinion.

We find that the borough did, as I have already said, on the 2Sd of August, 1881, proceed there and’ re-open the drain; that after it had been closed again on the 25th of August, they again went there on the 17th of October, and there is no dispute that they again opened the drain. They had to put in new pipe to make the connection which had existed before. It was at this time that the difficulty took place between the borough authorities and Mr. Crosland, which resulted in his being arrested and taken to the lock-up and detained there, according to the officer who arrested him, some twenty minutes. In Crosland’s absence, the hole which had been dug in the street for the purpose of connecting the pipe again, was filled up, and he proceeded on the next morning to again plug it up. It would seem from the testimony on both sides that the overflow of water on the street resulted from the closing or cutting off of the flow of water through the pipes through Mr. Crosland’s premises.</p>

No doubt that is the general rule of law. It has been held, however, in a controversy very similar to this, Elliott v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/75/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="75 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1036793" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0347-01">75 Pa. 347</a>, for the alleged unlawful act of its public officer in making an arrest in connection with <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>the running off of a horse, that where a city only authorizes a lawful act, to be done in a lawful manner, it is not responsible for the acts of its officers outside of their authority. If there was anything illegal in the arrest of Mr. Crosland, he would have a personal action against the party who illegally arrested him. It would be a personal action, not for an injury to real estate. He could have an action in a different form for any injury done to his real estate. 1 do not think it is very material to dwell upon that. Mr. Shaw’s evidence was, that he was instructed by the borough officers (of course the borough would be bound by anything done in pursuance of its own instruction), that, if Mr. Crosland interfered with the men in making the connection of the pipes, he should arrest him. There is nothing in that that would authorize an illegal arrest, so as to make the borough responsible for that illegal arrest. It might very well mean, a legal arrest. If there was anything illegal in it, the officer, the person who did it, would be the party liable, if any damages were sustained, for the illegal arrest. These are the rules of law which govern cases of this kind.</p>

It is the thing done, and not the way it is done. I therefore cannot see, it is not made plain, how he could set up a claim against the borough for the condition of the street, when that was brought about in consequence of his own act, in trying to cut off the water from his own premises.] 1</p>

It is not claimed that his property was entered, that his house was entered, or that any actual damage was done to his real estate.

In such case, if the borough could not restore the street to the condition it was in prior to the creation of the nuisance, it would result that they would have to devise some means to abate it, perhaps at very large expense, every time a citizen saw proper to create a public nuisance on the street.

When the borough forcibly re-connected 'the drain-pipe, if that act can be justified, it practically to that extent confiscated his property for that purpose. If a public nuisance existed on the street, as alleged, the borough had the right, and it was their duty to abate it; but to abate it in a legal manner, and it could not legally, forcibly, seize private property, as it did in this case, for that purpose. True it is, it may require both property and money to carry out its plans and make im<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>provements, but if so, it must acquire both in the manner pointed out by law, as other people do.

    <p id="b544-6" data-blocks='[["BL_544.6",544,[246,867,1189,811]]]'>1. In view of § 4, act of February 19, 1828, P. L. 100, incorporating the borough of Pottsville, and of § 7, of the amendatory act of April 4, 1831, P. L. 439, there can be no doubt of the right of the borough to remove a nuisance and improve a street. When the authorities discovered that this nuisance resulted from a disconnected drain, they had the direct cause thereof, and were not bound to seek the remote cause; for, to reach that would have taken them on private property where they had no right. To abate the nuisance required the reconstruction of the severed drain-pipe, which, as far as the borough was concerned, was the natural water course, and became such by the act of the plaintiff himself. He cannot visit the evil effects of his own act upon the borough, and for the injury done by Brown and others he must seek redress against them, and not against the borough: Martin v. Riddle, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Pa.%20415" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="26 Pa. 415">26 Pa. 415</a>.</p>

R. 594, the pipes of the gas company became leaky, and the gas escaping from them was dangerous to the lives and health of the inhabitants of the town. The town council directed the high constable to break connection between the gas well and the distributing pipes where they entered the town. The gas company obtained an injunction restraining the proposed action of the borough, the application of the borough authorities was denied and they appealed. This court, in a per curiam opinion, said: “We think the learned judge erred in refusing to dissolve this preliminary injunction. If the final hearing shall establish, what appears now to be presumptively shown, that there is a dangerous and offensive nuisance in the.public streets of said borough, the municipality has power to prohibit its continuance.”</p>

      <em>We </em>will not enter into any extended discussion of the case, but will briefly state the grounds for the judgment we now enter. As the jury received binding instructions to find for the defendant, the testimony adduced by the plaintiff, with all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, must be taken as establishing the true theory of the case on the facts.</p>
    <p id="b545-7" data-blocks='[["BL_545.8",545,[150,917,1187,1133]]]'>We assume, therefore, that Crosland gave to Col. Brown the right to conduct the surface water only from his premises through this drain into the Schuylkill river; that after the drain pipes were put down he turned into it the foul matter which came from his cess-pool and privy vaults, and that he sold a similar privilege to others; that thereby the drain instead of being used to conduct the surface and mountain water, as originally intended, was converted into a common sewer which caused the plaintiff’s house to be untenantable and it is believed unhealthy, and thus became a nuisance which the plaintiff claimed the right to abate. There is testimony also that the privilege given to Brown was experimental merely; if it should prove unsatisfactory, Crosland says, he had the right at any time to terminate it. The privilege must be treated, therefore, as a mere license which it was in Crosland’s power to revoke at his pleasure. It must be assumed also that the persons who were employed to adjust these pipes, and who reconstructed the sewer so as to again throw its contents upon the plaintiff’s premises, were acting under authority from the borough and were directed to do just what was done, and that the borough was responsible for these acts. There is abundant testimony to justify this inference, no matter what the facts may have been.</p>

Nor had Crosland anything to do with the drain, beyond yielding his assent that it might be laid in his <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>lots, to lead from the street to the river, and to conduct the surface water. It conferred only a limited right.</p>
    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[253,466,1195,1122]]]'>When a person who is entitled to a limited right exercises it in excess, so as to produce a nuisance, it may be abated to the extent of the excess: Barclay v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/25/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="25 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="975789" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0503-01">25 Pa. 503</a>; Taggart v.

But if the nuisance cannot be abated without obstructing the right altogether, the exercise of the right may be entirely stopped, until means have been taken to reduce it within its proper limits: Wood on Nuisances, 804; Addison on Torts, 269; Cawkwell v. Russell, 26 L. J. Exch. 34; Beard v. Murphy, <a href="/vt/37/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="37 Vt. 99" data-case-ids="4432037" data-case-paths="/vt/37/0099-01">37 Vt. 99</a>. If Brown abused the privileges which had been given him, by using these pipes as a channel for noxious and offensive matter, instead of surface water, and thereby created a nuisance, Crosland had an undoubted right, after due notice, to go either upon the premises of Brown, or on his own premises, and abate the nuisance by stopping up the drain, thereby preventing even the surface water from flowing therein, until Brown reduced his use thereof within the proper limits. Of course a person who undertakes to abate a nuisance, proceeds at his peril; he takes the risk of being able to show that the thing complained of was in fact a nuisance. If he errs in judgment, he is answerable in damages, and if a breach of the peace is involved, he is liable to indictment for the result.</p>
    <p id="b546-6" data-blocks='[["BL_546.6",546,[243,1605,1197,819]],["BL_547.1",547,[144,351,1185,407]]]'>But, creating no breach of the peace, he had á right to abate this nuisance. The noxious matter which passed through the drain under the road, came from Brown’s premises; it was his (Brown’s) duty to convey it to the river, or to some other place where it would not become offensive and injurious to the public, and when he received notice that the drain was obstructed, it was his duty to stop the flow. It was not an unlawful obstruction of the drain which caused the public nuisance, it was the continued use of the drain by Brown after he knew it was obstructed, that caused the overflow into and upon the highway, and for this Brown was responsible. Brown’s recourse, if he had any, was upon Crosland; he had no right to discharge the sewer into the street. The borough authorities of Pottsville had no more right to open up the sewer through Crosland’s property than Brown had; their attempt to do so was wholly without authority, and in denial of the <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>legal rights of Crosland, who had a clear right in a lawful and peaceable manner to protect his property against the unlawful use of this drain by Brown, and against the unlawful acts of any other person who might come to aid in perpetrating this wrong upon him. Brown was the offending party and the officers of the borough should have given their attention to him; they should have obliged him to abate the public nuisance which he had set up and was steadily maintaining.</p>

When it comes to be tried again, and the evidence on both sides is submitted to the jury, the case may be presented in an entirely different light.
