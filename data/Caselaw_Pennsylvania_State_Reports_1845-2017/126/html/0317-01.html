On September 21st, Dr. Keyser, an eye specialist of Philadelphia was called, examined the eye, and approved of the treatment to that date.

You have heard his testimony and his explanation of the paper which it is alleged he <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>read. It is urged further by the defendant that Dr. Keyser’s testimony, when viewed impartially, bears out the same view as to the dangerous character of this drug and its probable misuse by Dr. Smith. The plaintiff alleges that the whole testimony shows that the eye received the best treatment known to the medical profession, and it is urged by the plaintiff that the treatment which Dr. Smith administered was approved by the other physicians as satisfactory and proper treatment; that he used only a small percentage of this drug in water; that Dr. Keyser, eminent as a specialist in diseases of the eye, approved and concurred in this treatment, and that the physicians treated the case according to their best skill and judgment after they were called in. If the weight of the testimony satisfies you that Dr. Smith by his treatment, either by imprudent neglect of the proper remedies or by their excessive use, lost the sight of his eye, or that he lost it by the neglect or improper treatment of other physicians subsequently, the plaintiff cannot recover, and your verdict must be for the defendant, because the policy expressly stipulates that the external injury shall “wholly and alone, independently of all other causes,” occasion the disability.</p>

The notice was not mailed until October 1st following the injury, twenty-seven days after the accident; and the defendant asks us to say that the plaintiff failed, in this particular, to comply with the- stipulations of his policy, and therefore he cannot recover. Unquestionably if the plaintiff did not give immediate written notice Of the accident and injury he cannot recover; this is a condition precedent to any recovery. But we cannot undertake to say to you, as a matter of law, that„the written notice mailed on October 1st was not an immediate notice under the circumstances, on a reasonable construction of this provision.] 1</p>

Then the eye became worse and he put himself under the care of a skilful physician, yet for days he suffered intense pain. During this time he was sleepless and suffering, and in no condition to give notice to the association; but, as soon as he recovered sufficiently to attend to business and had a proper conception of the injury, though yet unable to write himself, he called in the agent of the association, Mr. Gifford, and dictated to him the written notice in evidence here, which he mailed to the association. The defendant alleges that Dr. Smith was able bo sit up in the house for a wqek after the accident, and that he was then able to give notice himself, or to call in some one else to write the notice for him, as he afterwards did ; that if the injury was serious enough to cause him to send to Altoona for a physician, a specialist, and serious enough to cause him afterward to send to Philadelphia for another physician, also a specialist, there was nothing to hinder him from sending the written notice himself or directing some one else to do so; yet he deferred this until the almost complete recovery of his physical vigor afterwards, when it was too late for the association to investigate the original cause of the injury or observe the method of treatment, as was their right and as they would have had an opportunity to do, if they had received the notice as required by the policy.</p>

Does the weight of the evidence, the burden being on the plaintiff, show that under all the circumstances the plaintiff’s written notice was as immediate as he could, under the circumstances, give ? Undoubtedly if he had been blinded at once by a blow from a whip-lash, he would have known at the time that he had a claim under the policy and it would have been his duty, very shortly thereafter, to have given written notice. Twenty-seven days, in such a case, would not have been immediate in any reasonable view of it; but whether, under the alleged facts here, it was immediate, such as with due diligence he could have given, is for you. If the plaintiff has failed to satisfy you by the <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>weight of the evidence that he gave, under the circumstances, immediate notice in writing of his accident and injury, he cannot recover. On the other hand, if the weight of the evidence satisfies you that he was injured through external, violent and accidental means which, “ wholly and alone, independently of all other causes,” occasioned the loss of his eye, and that he gave immediate written notice to the association, then you will find for the plaintiff a sum not exceeding $1,250, on which you will allow interest from sixty days after the' proofs of loss were furnished.</p>

He was a physician, and while riding in his buggy, engaged in his professional duties, by some accident his eye was struck by the lash of his whip. It was not at first thought to be dangerous, at least to the extent of losing his eyesight, and for some days’ the plaintiff treated the injured eye himself. It was not long before he was confined to his room and called in other medical aid. He testified that it was not until the fifteenth of the following October that he became convinced that he would lose the use of his eye. He gave a formal notice in writing to the company of the accident on October 1st and claimed for said loss. The contention of the defendant is that the notice should have been given immediately after the accident, and the court below was asked to so instruct the jury. This the learned judge refused to do, saying : “ Unquestionably, if the plaintiff did not give immediate written notice of the accident and injury he cannot recover. This is a condition precedent to any recovery. But we cannot undertake to say to you, as a matter of law, that the written notice mailed on October 1st was not an immediate notice under the circumstances, on a reasonable construction of this provision.”</p>

It is in such sense that the parties to the contract probably understood it. The plaint<a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>iff was not claiming for weekly benefits. Had he clone so,., there would have been more force in the defendant’s position that he should have given notice of the accident immediately after its occurrence on September 4th. His claim, however, was: for the loss of his eye, and it is difficult to see how he could with any propriety make such a claim until he had actually lost it, or it had become clear that he would lose it. How could he have truthfully made such a claim on the fifth of September ? And had he done so and his eyesight been restored, the probability is the defendant company would have criticised his claim even more closely than it has done now.</p>
    <p id="b349-5" data-blocks='[["BL_349.5",349,[184,921,1190,716]]]'>■ In the case of Lyon v. Railway Passenger Assurance Company, <a href="/iowa/46/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="46 Iowa 631" data-case-ids="2333283" data-case-paths="/iowa/46/0631-01">46 Ia. 631</a>, the insured was injured whilst traveling on a railway train. Pie brought suit to recover a weekly allowance. By the terms of the policy he was required to give “ immediate notice to the company at Hartford, Connecticut.” The injury was received on September 27th and notice was sent to the company at Hartford on October 28th following, thirty-one; days afterwards. During this time he was under medical treatment for eight or nine days at one place, when he returned to his home and came under the treatment of other physicians. The court held that under all the circumstances it was not error in the court below to refuse to instruct, as a matter of law, that the notice was not given in proper time. The question was left to be determined by the jury as one of fact.</p>
    <p id="b349-6" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[184,1643,1186,772]],["BL_350.1",350,[249,354,1184,86]]]'>It is true the delay in such cases may be so great as to justify the court in ruling it as a question of law. There was no such delay in the case in hand, however. The word “immediate,” in the contract, must be construed to mean within a reasonable time thereafter, under all the facts and circumstances of the case, and what is a reasonable time must be decided by the jury, unless, as before observed, the delay has been so great that the court may rule it as a question of law. A person might be so injured as to be physically unable to give notice for weeks. Hence it is that such questions are referred to the jury to say whether under all the circumstances there has been an unreasonable delay in giving notice. In the present case we are not required to go so far as the court did in the Iowa case. I see no reason which requires notice to be given of the loss of an eye, until the eye is destroyed, any <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>more than that in a life policy a man should give notice of his death before he dies.</p>

I do not find the proofs in the paper book. If admitted for the purpose of showing that such proofs had been made in compliance with the policy, they were competent. If offered and read to the jury as prima facie evidence of the plaintiff’s claim, their admission would have been error: Commonwealth Ins. Co. v. Sennett, <a href="/pa/41/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="41 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="480030" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0161-01">41 Pa. 161</a>; Lycoming Ins. Co. v.

I do not understand this to have been the case. If it was, it has not been sufficiently pointed out to us.</p>
