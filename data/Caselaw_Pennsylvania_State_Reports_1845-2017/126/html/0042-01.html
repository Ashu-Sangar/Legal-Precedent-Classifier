    <p class="summary" id="b66-14" data-blocks='[["BL_66.15",66,[252,1916,1189,509]],["BL_67.1",67,[187,364,1182,98]]]'>In 1883, William PI. Kern, the plaintiff, owned a lot on Spring Garden street in Philadelphia, which he had placed in the hands of Charles E. I-Iall, a real estate agent, for sale. In December, 1883, Louis M. Simpson, the defendant, approached Plall on the subject of buying the lot, and on January 7, 1884, he gave to Hall the following offer in writing, to wit: - “$6,000. Eirst mortgage six per cent. Bankers and Merchants Telegraph Company bonds for lot Spring Garden west of Thirty-seventh street, fifty by one hundred and twenty, and back strip. To be accepted this week. . L.‘ M. Simpson, Janu<a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>ary 7tli, 1884.” At the same time a letter was given to Hall directing where inquiry could be made respecting the bonds.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[184,466,1186,876]]]'>The plaintiff testified that he never read this letter. Simpson’s offer was accepted and a deed for the property was executed to the defendant, who delivered to the plaintiff six $1,000 bonds of the Bankers and Merchants Telegraph Company. These bonds were part of an issue of $10,000,000 made by the telegraph company and covering their entire property. There was an issue of other bonds, however, known as divisional bonds, issued by companies of the same name, and covering local lines leased by the parent company. These bonds were prior in mortgage lien to the $10,000,000 issue. The bonds accepted by the plaintiff were known on the street and called by the president of the company, general mortgage bonds. The other bonds were known as first mortgage bonds and were sometimes called divisional bonds. The testimony showed that various sales of the general mortgage bonds were made in the spring of 1881 at prices varying from seventy-five to eighty-five per cent. They subsequently became worthless.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b67-6" data-blocks='[["BL_67.6",67,[181,1347,1183,564]]]'>The plaintiff testified that about three months after the sale of the lot he went to the defendant’s office and said to him: “Mr. Simpson, 1 have discovered that those are not the bonds that you agreed to give me, and I prefer to have my lot back again; they are not the bonds that 1 had agreed to take.” He says, “ I can’t give you the lot because I have transferred it. The bonds that you have got are a better bond than the bonds that J was to give you.” He says, “ Those bonds (¡over the entire property of the company; the other only covered a portion of the company’s property.” He says, “ I have transferred the property.”</p>

He and a gentleman, whose name 1 cannot tell you, called on me to know whether or not I could not negotiate $400,000 of these bonds, and he would make it an interest to me to do so, which I declined to have anything to do with.</p>

It'was before July because I collected, six months’ interest after I had the interview with Mr. Simpson. There was one coupon which was paid on these bonds on the first day of July. I think I deposited the coupons, and they were collected in New York.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.5",68,[260,608,1187,146]]]'>Q. Has anything ever been paid since? A. No, sir; .there has been no value to the bonds, I think, since then. They have been selling at seven or eight cents on the dollar.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b68-9" data-blocks='[["BL_68.8",68,[256,1124,1188,448]]]'>This is an action on the case for deceit, making certain false and fraudulent representations in connection with the sale of real estate with an intent to defraud the plaintiff. Of course, the gist of such an action is the intent to defraud. As was said by Judge Gibson in a leading case on the subject, “ A constructive deceit is a new thing under the sun.” There can be no such thing as a constructive deceit. It is either deceit, or it is not; and if a deceit, the vital element is that of an intention to defraud.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b68-10" data-blocks='[["BL_68.9",68,[251,1593,1188,826]],["BL_69.1",69,[188,356,1185,604]]]'>Keeping that principle of law in' mind as the ruling principle of this cause, the evidence shows simply this: that the plaintiff had a lot of ground in West Philadelphia to sell; he employed as his agent a person named Plall, who brought to the plaintiff the slip of paper which the plaintiff received. It was signed, apparently, by L. M. Simpson, and was, on its face, a proposition to exchange $6,000 first mortgage bonds of the Bankers and Merchants Telegraph Company for the lot of ground. It is also undoubtedly in evidence that at the same time the plaintiff was given a further communication, which he says he never read, and which also was from the defendant upon the same subject-matter. The plaintiff never had any conversation with the defendant, and there is no testimony in the case of any further declaration, or pretence, or acts by the defendant, from which anything can be inferred or proven as to his intent. The only other instance in which the defendant appeared, was <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>subsequently, when the plaintiff had executed a deed ready for delivery. Then the defendant comes to the office of the plaintiff, and presents to him the six bonds which are in evidence, which are indorsed in legible characters, and the nature of which is proclaimed by their indorsement. He hands them to the plaintiff, a man of intelligence, who was thereby enabled to advise himself fully of exactly what the bonds were. He received them, and he delivered the deed ; and whatever right of action lie may have had for deceit culminated then. IJp to that point all the acts were done, all the declarations made, which constituted, if they constituted at all, a deceit which was actionable.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b69-5" data-blocks='[["BL_69.5",69,[189,979,1182,1140]]]'>I do not see in all this testimony a scintilla of evidence from which an intent to defraud can be found. That which the defendant gave he gave openly. Its character was proclaimed by the indorsement; and this plaintiff was enabled fully to advise himself of everything relating to these bonds. Moreover, there is no evidence of any declaration by the defendant at any time prior, or subsequent, to the delivery of the deed, which shows that lie did not believe that those bonds were first mortgage bonds, which, in fact, by the evidence in tills case, they were to some extent; because the evidence is that divisional bonds were a first mortgage bond upon certain of the property, and did not cover other of the property, and that the bonds delivered were second mortgage bonds as to some of the property, and first mortgage bonds as to other of the property. We therefore have a'case in which there was nothing done by the defendant which could have deceived a person who was put upon his guard at all points as to what he was receiving. As to Mr. Simpson’s declaration subsequent to the consummation of this transaction, to my mind it does nothing more than show, taking it to be true in every respect, that be did believe that he was giving this plainti ff a better security than that which the plaintiff thought he ought to receive.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b69-6" data-blocks='[["BL_69.6",69,[189,2119,1180,311]],["BL_70.1",70,[251,343,1188,398]]]'>Now, there is an absence of testimony in this case to which a judge cannot close his eyes. Mr. Hall was in court; the person to whom this defendant made every declaration that was made respecting this transaction. Ho was called at the end of the proceedings yesterday and was withdrawn from the stand. Presumably he is in court now. He was the agent of this <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>plaintiff. There is no evidence that he was the agent of the defendant. He has full knowledge of anything which the defendant said. He is not called. The presumption, therefore, is that nothing was said by the defendant to this agent which would show an intent to defraud. On the other hand, the legal presumption is, that if there were any declarations made, they were such as would have shown the entire integrity of the defendant’s conduct.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b70-4" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[251,758,1182,199]]]'>I may also say that I do not see any proof of damage in this case. There is no competent proof to show that these bonds, at the time they were delivered, were not worth as much as what are termed the first mortgage bonds.</p>
