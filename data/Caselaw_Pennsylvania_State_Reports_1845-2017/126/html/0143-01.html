And therefore it is, that it becomes necessary to have a due regard to, and make just allowance for the advantages, which may have resulted to the landowner in consequence of the making of the railroad by the corporation taking the land, and to compensate in money for the damages which have not been compensated for by said advantages. The damages therefore which a jury may find in any given case is the amount of money required to fully compensate the landowner, where he has not been already compensated, either wholly or in part by advantages, after having made a fair and just comparison of said advantages and disadvantages. The advantages to be considered are such only as are special, and the advantages such as are actual, to the property claimed by the landowner to have been injured or destroyed by the location of the road. The general appreciation of property in the neighborhood consequent to the construction of the defendant’s road, is not to be considered in comparison of the advantages and disadvantages resulting to this plaintiff. The landowner whose lands have been taken is as fairly entitled to the benefit of this general appreciation in value, as his neighbor whose land has not been taken and whose enjoyment of his property has not been disturbed. The general increase of value resulting from the growth of public improvements accrues to the public benefit, and the particular landowner is not to be charged therewith. The question in this case is, whether the construction of the defendant’s road has advanced the market value of his property, specially and beyond the more general appreciation of property in the neighborhood. The disadvantages to be considered are such as are actual to the plaintiff’s property; the inconvenience arising from a division of the property, or from increased difficulty of access; the burden of increased fencing; the injury done to his buildings by interfering with the drainage from cellars, and, generally, all such matters as, owing to the particular location of the road and not resulting from negligence on part of the corporation, may affect the convenient use and future enjoyment of the <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>plaintiff’s property. These disadvantages are to ho considered in comparison with the advantages, only as they affect the market value of the land, because the rulo as to the measure of damages is, “that jurors are to consider the matter just as if they were called on to value the injury at the moment when compensation could first be demanded; they are to value the injury to the property, without reference to the person of the owner, or the actual state of his business; and, in doing that, the only safe rule is to inquire what would the property, unaffected by the obstruction, have sold for at the time the injury was committed? What would it have sold for as affected by the injury ? The difference is the true measure of compensation.” “ It is the business of the viewers, in the first instance, and on an appeal, of the jury, to balance the advantages that are special against the disadvantages that are actual, and, with the aid of the testimony laid before them, to find out as well as they can, how much less the land would fetch in the market by reason of the road, and that sum which will represent what has really been taken away from the owner should he given back in damages.” This is the rule of law for the measurement of the plaintiff’s damages. Consider and weigh the testimony of the witnesses in the case, and from a careful consideration of the whole evidence determine whether the plaintiff’s property alleged by him to have been injured, would sell for as much in the market after the construction of the defendant's road, as it would have done before said construction; and if you find from the evidence that it would, then your verdict should be for the defendant; but if you should find from the evidence that it would sell for less after than before the construction of said road, find for the plaintiff the difference.</p>

That under the constitution and laws of Pennsylvania, land actually taken by a railroad for its own purposes must be justly compensated for, and a comparison of advantages and disadvantages is only required in determining the question of damages to the remainder of the tract upon which the railroad has been located; and, in determining that question, only such advantages as are peculiar to the property and not such as are common <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>to the neighboring properties are to be considered; a general appreciation of land resulting from the construction of a railroad, cannot be considered by the jury.</p>

Whether land be actually taken and appropriated, or only injured by the locacation of a railroad, or taken in part and injured as to the remainder, the rule is the same, namely, “ to inquire, what the property, unaffected by the obstruction, would have sold for at the time the injury was committed; what would it have sold for as affected by the injury; the difference is the true measure of compensation.” For further instruction the jury is referred to the general charge.1</p>

The jury should consider the amount and value of the land taken, the additional burden of fencing required, and, in ascertaining the value of the land actually taken, they should consider its location, its abutment on a public road, its nearness to the built up portion of Shippensburg, its fitness for building lots, and the facility the public road or street furnished, prior to the construction of the railroad, for converting it into building lots; and its value, for that purpose, is the measure of value for the land actually taken, and not its value as land used for farming purposes exclusively.</p>

The jury ought not to consider any possible use to which the property of the plaintiff can be put in the future, but only such as there is strong reason to believe that it will be put to. They should therefore disregard all the evidence bearing upon the possibility of using the property for a furnace, manufactory, or other special business, and if the jury believe that, prior to the construction of the Harrisburg and Potomac Railroad upon the property of the plaintiff, he had equal or better facilities for using his property for a lumber or coal yard, or for warehouse and forwarding, or any other special business requiring' railroad facilities, by reason of the immediate proximity of the <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>Cumberland Valley Railroad to bis property, and that its freight depot, switches, sidings, etc., were opposite his property, then they should disregard all evidence on part of defendant, as to special use of the plaintiff’s property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[239,566,1186,666]]]'>Answer: We affirm this point with this qualification: the possible use of the land for a furnace is entitled to no weight, but there may be other special business not so remote or speculative, that might be considered in connection with the plaintiff’s land, and the railroad facilities, as fairly to enhance the value of the plaintiff's property. The latter part of the point is correct, if the defendant’s road afforded no railroad facilities greater than existed before its construction, for any special business, then the testimony relating thereto is without weight; but we submit the evidence to the jury for them to determine whether greater facilities were afforded, or not, for special business, and refer them for further instructions to the general charge.3</p>
