If, instead of seeking to have it ojjened, the defendants saw fit to pay it, the loss of remedy was their own act. One may be relieved from the effect of his own act, if it were induced by fraud, accident or mistake. This extends to taking off an entry of satisfaction: Murphy v.

A fraudulent device to conclude the debtor would be sufficient; and this, the Supreme Court there say, might be inferred from the fact that the satisfying of the old judgment and the giving of the new were simultaneous, or nearly so. This strongly implies that something more than the existence of usury, in the first judgment, is necessary; .for to what end should an inference of fraud be drawn, if a conceded fact were sufficient?</p>

In the latter, the plaintiff needs the machinery of the law to enforce his demand; but if the defendant seeks to change the record of the former, he is the actor and must show good cause. In the latter case, he can rest on his right to deduct and retain the excess of interest; but in the former, as from a legal standpoint he has paid the interest, he must have equitable ground for going behind his act. If to serve his own ends, he induces the plaintiff to accept payment in notes rather than money, and procures the judgment thus paid to be satisfied and is in no way overreached, the fact that he might have avoided his promise be<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>fore satisfaction was entered, is not such an equity as should disturb the status quo.</p>
