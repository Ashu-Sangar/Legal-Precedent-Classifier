The defendants claim that' the title and the right of possession is in them. Plaintiffs opened their case by putting in evidence the admission that the title was originally in Madison P. Myers as to a portion of the land, and in Harriet Myers as to the other portion; that Madison F. Myers died leaving a will, and that the interests claimed by the plaintiffs were devised by him to them.

As a defence to this, the defendants put in evidence an act of assembly passed in April, 1864, which expressly provided that the guardians of these two plaintiffs, who were then minors, should have power to sell and dispose of, from time to time, at public or private sale, in such parcels and upon such terms as they or any guardian thereafter appointed for them, might think proper, all the estate, right, title and interest in the said minors, or either of them, in any lands, tenements and hereditaments, situate in the said county of Luzerne, and to demise, lease or mine-let any coal or other minerals in or under such lauds, tenements and hereditaments in which said minors had an undivided interest, for such price, or prices, or terms, and upon such rents, as the other owners of the said real estate shall sell or lease at, and to join with the other parties owning the remaining undivided interest in the same, in the execution, acknowledgment and delivery to the purchaser or purchasers, lessee or lessees, of good and sufficient deeds of conveyance in fee simple, or lease for years for the same; and all such deed or deeds of conveyance, or lease, shall be good and effectual, etc.</p>

Our opinion upon that qrrestion has not changed; and even if it had, we would still be bound by the decision of the Supreme Court until that is overruled. With regard to the second objection, the object of the bond was to insure the faithful application of the rents that might accrue from the lease, and being executed before any rents had accrued under the lease, we think it was a substantial compliance with the act of assembly, and that the objection upon that ground is not tenable. With regard to the third and fourth objections to this evidence of the defendants’ title,,we say that the construction of the act under which this lease was made, is for the court. [We are at present of opinion that in the use of the terms, lease, and, demise, the legislature intended them, not in their strict technical sense, bnt in the sense in which they were understood when applied to any transfer of an interest or right in coal in place. Strictly and technically, this was not a lease, but a sale of the coal in place. But whatever it was, it was a form of conveyance, then as now, commonly known as a lease, and by any fair construction of the act must be held to have been within the power of the guardians to make. For, while this act of assembly must be construed strictly, that does not imply that an unfriendly construction shall be given to it, so as to defeat the very purpose which was had in view when it was passed. Furthermore, the guardians were by the act of assembly given the power to sell all the estate, right, title, etc., of the minors, not merely in the surface but in the land. This would include the power to sell the coal separately,' or to demise it by perpetual lease, or its equivalent. If there had been simply given the power to sell, there might have arisen the question whether or not the guardians would have the right to lease the coal, and it was probably in order to remove any doubt upon that question that there was, in addition, given the power to lease the coal. Therefore, the power to lease, techni<a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>cally speaking, although expressly given, did not impair then-right to sell, given in the preceding clause of the act; so that if the case rested here, the defendant’s defence would be complete and perfect under this lease pursuant to the act of assembly.] »</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[152,595,1188,1598]]]'>But in rebuttal of this defence, the plaintiffs set up two grounds upon which they claim the defence is not a good one. in the first place, they contend that there was a conspiracy to defraud the other heirs, entered into between Philip T. Myers, one of the co-owners with the plaintiffs, and David Morgan, one of the lessees, whereby the former was to get a larger sum for his interest than the others were to get for theirs. In other-words the plaintiffs undertake to show that this lease is void as to these plaintiffs because of this fraud in fact, actual fraud. We speak of it thus, as distinguished from legal fraud, which we shall consider hereafter. Whether the result in the preceding case in equity, was a conclusive adjudication of this question or not, we take it that the court, now as then, is compelled to say whether or not there is sufficient evidence of actual fraud to vitiate or invalidate this lease. This is the duty of the court sitting here in the trial of an action which has many features of a proceeding in equity. [If there is not sufficient evidence of actual fraud to warrant the court in decreeing a cancellation or rescission of that lease, then there would not be sufficient evidence of fraud to warrant a recovery against the defendants as against that lease. In the case to -which we have referred, this question of fraud came up before this court and before the Supreme Court. And whether or not that question was fairly raised by the pleadings, there was nevertheless an expression of opinion by the court in that case which is in our opinion to be followed in this case. It was there held that there was not sufficient evidence of actual fraud to warrant a cancellation of the lease; and if there was not sufficient evidence there, then, clearly, the same evidence would not justify a recovery against the defendants upon the grounds of actual fraud as against this lease.] 11</p>

Myers was leased upon. And there is testimony here to show, and I believe that testimony, so far as this particular fact is» concerned, is uncontradicted, that before the lease was executed by Philip T. Myers, he was paid $4,000, extra, as a bonus. There was considerable testimony in explanation of why it was paid. We are nevertheless of opinion that this payment by the lessees to Philip T.

In the act in question, the power given to the guardian was, to sell or lease for such price or terms, and upon such rents as the other owners of the said real estate shall sell or lease at. The other owners were the plaintiffs’ mother and their brother and sisters, who were of full age. The purpose of the provision which directed that the guardians, whether selling or leasing, should do so upon equal terms with these other owners, was a very wise one. Strictly and faithfully carried out, that condition was likely to secure to the minors a full consideration for their interests. Can it be possible that that essential clause is simply directory, and not intended to limit the authority conferred upon the guardians, or that it can be evaded or rendered nugatory by so simple a device as a collateral and perhaps secret agreement between the lessee or purchaser, and one or more of the adult co-tenants, to give him or them an additional sum for joining in the lease? We think not. Under that view of the facts of this case, best sustained by the evidence, and, indeed, most favorable to the defendant, the sum of $4,000 paid to Philip T. Myers, was virtually part of the consideration for his finally joining in the lease, although demanded by him. in violation of his previous agreement, and <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>paid to him by the lessees under the pressure of these circumstances in which they had placed themselves acting on the faith of that agreement. But these peculiar circumstances and the honesty of the motives of the lessees were matters which did not concern the plaintiffs, or the authority of their guardians, for they were bound by no previous agreement. The question virtually affecting the validity of the guardians’ action is: What were the terms finally agreed upon by the other owners ? If, when the lease came to be executed, the defendants were from any cause induced to pay to one of the. adult owners an extra sum. as a consideration for his joining in the lease, they thereby fixed the standard below which the guardians were not authorized to fall, in stipulating for the rent or sum to be paid for the interest of their wards.”</p>

The evidence shows that F. B. Myers became of age on June 10, 1866, and that W. P. Myers became of age on September 5, 1868. The evidence is uncontradicted that for a long period of years they received the rents as they fell due under this lease. There is also testimony that they joined in petitions and other proceedings in which this lease was recognized. There is no particular dispute as to these facts from which the defendants claim there was a ratification or affirmance of the lease after the plaintiffs became of age. [But it was not enough to show simply that they had done acts which would be in ratification or affirmance of the lease. It was incumbent to show that these acts were done with knowledge of the essential facts upon which their right to repudiate the lease rested. If these acts were done in ignorance of the essential facts upon which this right rested, then they would not amount to a ratification or affirmance of the lease. If, however, they were done with the knowledge of these essential facts, then the plaintiffs were presumed to know their rights under the law to repudiate the lease, and having gone on and received the rents with such knowledge, they <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>would be held to have ratified, or affirmed it, to have made it a valid and binding contract upon them. If the case rested right here, there would be a question of fact, and, as we think, the only question of fact to be submitted to the jury; namely, whether or not these acts testified to and about which there is no particular dispute, were done by the plaintiffs with knowledge of the essential fact upon which their right to repudiate the lease rested, after they became of age. Upon this question of fact there is a conflict of evidence, and if this were the first case in which it had arisen it would be a question for your decision, under all of the testimony. But it appears that in 1881, the plaintiffs filed a bill on the equity side of this court for a rescission or cancellation of this lease, upon the ground that it was executed without legal authority'; and that case was fully tried, first, before the master, afterwards before the court, and afterwards heard in the Supreme Court, and after a full hearing the bill was dismissed. Now the question arises, whether or not that was such an adjudication upon this question as to be conclusive upon the party. And we are of opinion that it was* It was not simply an incidental question which arose in the trial of that case. It was a question which was put in issue by the pleadings, and upon which there was precisely the same testimony which has been introduced here.] For example, in the bill w'e find that in the 4th paragraph it is there stated, “ That your orators upon becoming of age were induced to accept the moneys which had accumulated as their share of the rents arising from said lease, in ignorance of their rights and without information as to the facts,” and in the answer -it is averred that “ each received, when becoming of legal age, the money which accumulated as each of their shares of the rents arising from said lease, without protest, and so have continued' until the bringing of this suit to receive the same, quarterly, without protest, a length of time exceeding thirteen years, since the youngest of these two plaintiffs became of age, during all of which time they were in possession, or had the knowledge of every fact and circumstance which now is theirs, and were all the time surrounded with every opportunity to ascertain their rights.” So that we may say that that question was distinctly raised by the pleadings, and in our opinion was adjudicated in that case; and that adjudica<a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>tion is conclusive between tlie parties and cannot be reopened in any subsequent suit.</p>

It is admitted that the land was in possession of plaintiffs’ father, Madison Myers, as owner, at his death in 1859, and that plaintiffs are devisees under his will of undivided interests in the land.</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[238,611,1189,654]]]'>' Defendants hold possession under a lease from the devisees of Madison Myers in 1864, all the other devisees being then sui juris and joining in the lease, and plaintiffs, then infants, being-parties to the lease through their guardians, acting under the authority of a special act of assembly approved April 15, 1864, P. L. 433. Th*e defendants also, under the plea of former recovery, gave evidence that the title, as between the present parties, was res adjudicata. The learned judge presiding at the trial sustained this view as to every point in the case except the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, and as to this, he held the lease still in force, as a matter of law, and therefore peremptorily directed a verdict for the defendants.</p>

Points, or requests for charge, are statements of the rules or particular portions of the law, which counsel deem applicable to the special facts of the case. Their use is, first, to direct the attention of the judge to the view of the law'which the parties desire him to take, and secondly, thereby to have the jury instructed upon the principles which they ought to apply in making up their verdict, after they have ascertained the facts. While points may be submitted even in cases like the present, and are often useful as suggestions and condensed arguments, yet where upon the whole case the judge conceives it his duty to give the jury a binding 'instruction, the answers to points become mere dissertations on the law, useless to the jury, unnecessarily burdensome to the judge, and complicating to the record when presented for consideration here,. It is frequently satisfactory to the jury as well as the parties, and assists our labor if the case comes here, for the judge to indicate, in a general way, the grounds of his action, but .it is the better practice to decline to answer points in detail, as no longer necessary. The correctness of the direction to the jury to find in one way or another, depends on the facts admitted or estab<a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>lislied, and if the conclusion is right on the facts, no error is committed though the reasons assigned are insufficient or even incorrect.</p>

    <p id="b623-6" data-blocks='[["BL_623.7",623,[155,976,1184,769]]]'>To September Term 1881, the plaintiffs filed a bill in equity against the defendants, setting up their title under their father’s will; their minority in 1864; the making of the lease now in question; their acceptance of the accumulated royalty under the lease, upon coming of age, in ignorance of the facts and their rights; their information and belief that the lease was not made in pursuance of the act; an averment that their guardians were not authorized to make the lease; and concluding with a prayer that the lease be declared void, and ordered to be surrendered for cancellation. An answer was filed by defendants, setting up the act of 1864 ; maintaining the validity of the lease ; and averring acts of ratification by the complainants, for a series of thirteen and sixteen years respectively, after coming of age. Evidence was taken upon both sides, and an elaborate report was made by a master, finding,</p>
    <p id="b623-7" data-blocks='[["BL_623.8",623,[157,1752,1183,98]]]'>1. That the act of 1864 was constitutional, and conferred full legal authority upon the guardians to make a lease.</p>
    <p id="b623-8" data-blocks='[["BL_623.9",623,[157,1856,1184,140]]]'>2. That the lease in question was not made strictly in pursuance of the terms imposed by the statute, and had therefore been voidable.</p>

Complainants then took an appeal to this court, of January Term 1885, No. 460, and assigned, among other things, that the court erred, “ 3, in <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>deciding that the lease was valid; 4, in declaring the special act constitutional; and 5, in affirming the master’s report.”</p>
    <p id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[244,461,1191,613]]]'>The decree was affirmed by this court, in a brief opinion, per curiam, referring to the absence of fraud (which alone could do away with the force of the acts of ratification), and continuing “ The court, in an able and satisfactory opinion, overrules all exceptions to the report. The reasons in that opinion contained, vindicate the conclusion at which it arrived.” The scope of the opinion thus indorsed, has already been noted, and in view of that, and of the errors alleged in it, which were thus held not to be errors, it is impossible to maintain, as is now sought to be done, that the decree of this court only determined that the bill must fail on technical grounds, for want of jurisdiction in equity.</p>
    <p id="b624-6" data-blocks='[["BL_624.6",624,[243,1082,1188,252]]]'>The learned judge at the trial held that this former adjudication concluded the plaintiffs in the present action, and I have been thus particular in setting out the proceedings in detail, because of the earnest and determined effort of counsel to get away from the force of this ruling.</p>
    <p id="b624-7" data-blocks='[["BL_624.7",624,[242,1341,1189,453]]]'>The binding effect of a former adjudication depends upon the identity of the rights involved, not of the evidence, or of the arguments used. An examination of the causes of action shows not only that every right involved in the present case was necessarily involved in the former, but even that nearly every point made now in support of those rights, was in fact argued and considered then. The only exceptions are the repugnance of the act of 1864 to the constitution of the United States, and the termination of the lease.</p>
    <p id="b624-8" data-blocks='[["BL_624.8",624,[240,1807,1195,612]]]'>In regard to the former, it would be sufficient to say that the point might have been made, and therefore is concluded, whether actually made or not. But in fact the constitutionality of the act was not material then or now, as the complainants, with full knowledge of what had been done in their name, ratified, confirmed; and accepted the benefits of it, for years after coming of age, and whether it was done with or without authority, they were held to be estopped from disputing its validity. We do not think there is the slightest basis for objection to the act under the constitutions either of this state' or of the United States, but we forbear to discuss this aspect of the case because entirely immaterial.</p>

      <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>With regard to the continuance of the lease, it appears that the term of twenty years for which it was first to run, expired during the pendency of the proceeding in equity, and no doubt the court might have considered this question, though not specifically set up in the original bill, had application been made by stipplemental petition, or even under the prayer for further relief. As it is not clear, however, that the court did actually have its attention directed to this point, we will add here that the cases of Lewis v. Effinger, <a href="/pa/30/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="30 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="415614" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0281-01">30 Pa. 281</a>, and Effinger v.

    <p id="b625-4" data-blocks='[["BL_625.5",625,[144,925,1181,238]]]'>The fifth specification of error involves a point of practice which it may be well to notice. Upon defendants offering the lease in evidence, plaintiffs asked the purpose of the offer, and excepted to the ruling of the court that the paper showed for itself what it was offered for.</p>
    <p id="b625-5" data-blocks='[["BL_625.6",625,[143,1183,1181,552]]]'>There is no absolute rule that a party offering a writing can be called upon to state formally the purpose of the offer. Generally the other party has a right to examine the paper before it is passed upon. by the judge, though there may be exceptional cases where even this right would be suspended for a time, if the peculiar exigency of the case demanded it. On view of the paper, counsel may call for a statement of the purpose for which it is offered, but how formally this statement is to be made, in how much detail, etc., are matters necessarily within the discretion of the presiding judge, and this court will not reverse unless there is a manifest abuse of such discretion.</p>
    <p id="b625-6" data-blocks='[["BL_625.7",625,[136,1753,1188,672]]]'>The right to an offer of what a witness is (jailed to prove, stands upon a somewhat different basis. There can be no inspection of his testimony beforehand, and it may be not only irrelevant but highly improper, and the opposite party has a right to guard against possible danger in this way.

Barr, <a href="/pa/7/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="7 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="957857" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0024-01">7 Pa. 24</a>, and of Sharswood, J., in Morgan v.

      <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>The offer in the present ease was of the lease which purported. to pass the title under which plaintiffs claimed, to the parties under whom defendants claimed. It went directly to the very substance of the issue, and the learned judge was quite justified in saying “ the paper shows for itself, and is sufficient of what it is offered for.”</p>
