Wait, <a href="/binn/1/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Binn. 219" data-case-ids="1787961" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0219-01">1 Binn. 219</a>, that while proceedings are de novo in the Court of Common Pleas, on an appeal from a justice of the peace, that the cause of action must remain the same; that the plaintiff cannot shift his ground as to his cause of action. It seems, therefore, to the court, that it is not competent in this case, now, on the last count filed, to proceed to the trial of a question growing out of an alleged contract to maintain a fence along the right of way of the defendant company through the land of the plaintiff in this action, which was commenced before a justice of the peace for the killing of a horse. A justice of the peace has not jurisdiction, in this state, of a cause of action growing out of neglect of the defendant cotnpany in injuring or killing his property along the track. An action for such a cause must be maintained in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b463-6" data-blocks='[["BL_463.6",463,[163,1540,1185,720]]]'>It might be properly said by the court, that if the plaintiff had a right of action growing out of a contract, still the killing of a horse would not be an element of the measure of damages. If the defendant company were bound to keep up plaintiff’s fence, the plaintiff could not sit by and permit his property to stray on to the railroad company’s property, and sue for their value from time to time, as they were killed. The plaintiff has the right to compel the defendant to keep up the fence or to keep it up himself, upon default of the defendant so to maintain, and to make the defendant liable for whatever the cost was, if he has any right. The killing of a horse by the cars of the defendant, is not one of the elements entering into the damage to which the plaintiff would be entitled, for maintaining the fence along the right of way.</p>

It was brought to recover damages against the defendant company for killing a horse. Upon appeal to the Common Pleas it expanded into a breach of contract for not maintaining a fence along the right of way or road of the company. While it is true that, upon an appeal from the judgment of a justice of the peace, the case is tried de novo, it is also true the cause of action must remain the same.
