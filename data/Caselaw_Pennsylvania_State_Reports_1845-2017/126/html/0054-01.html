Mr. McFadden that same morning started down the road for the purpose of coming to Wilkes-Barre. On his way down a short distance, which has been described to you by the witnesses, above what is called the White House road, he found his horse standing in the road, and upon examination found the dead body of Bernard McClure under the wheel. He made no further examination at that time, apparently, but returned to his work, and having got his superintendent they again returned to this scene. They then found, about 500 feet below where McClure lay, the body of Flanigan, he also being dead, having been shot. The money that had been in the wagon was gone. The horse had been shot. The physicians have described to you the wounds which McClure received. They have also produced two bullets which were taken out of his body. They have described the third wound in the head, and have testified that either one of these would have been fatal.

According to his own testimony, he held the gun while Bevivino took the satchel containing the money. According to his own testimony, he went with Bevivino to the place where it was hid, and on two subsequent occasions went to the same place and took a portion of the money. Now, gentlemen of the jury, we say to you that if this testimony be believed — it is his own — then his acts if unexplained, would make him a principal, notwithstanding you were not satisfied that any of the shots fired by him caused the death of Bernard McClure.</p>

Both Napalillo and the defendant agree in saying that the plan of murdering and robbing McClure was suggested to Napalillo. .Both of these witnesses — that is Napalillo and the defendant — agree that Napalillo declined to have anything to do with it. Napalillo testifies, however, in effect that not only Bevivino, but also the defendant approached him for the purpose of inducing him to join the conspiracy, and made certain threats as to what would be done in case he should betray them. On the part of the defendant, he testifies that he never gave his assent to the undertaking, but that always when he gave a definite answer to Bevivino, it was to the effect that he could not do it. You will endeavor to reconcile the testimony of .the witnesses if possible. You are to take into consideration in weighing their testimony, the interest which they may have in the case. You are to consider in the defendant’s case the interest which he has in your verdict. You will consider in Napalillo’s case whether or not he is testifying as he does in order to shield himself from punishment. You are to take into consideration the manner of the testimony, the impression which the witnesses make upon your mind, as to being truthful and candid, or otherwise; and it is for you to decide what is the truth with regard to any disputed question of fact. For if the testimony be believed, and there be no reasonable doubt in your mind as to its truthfulness, that the defendant did make to Napalillo the proposition which he says defendant did, and accompanied it with threats which he says he did, that would be entirely inconsistent with the theory of the defendant upon the trial, that he was coerced into this by fear of Bevivino.</p>

Because, if they were not such as to produce in his mind fear that the result threatened would be carried out, then he could not set them up as a defence for his act.....</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-6" data-blocks='[["BL_89.5",89,[183,981,1181,496]]]'>I call your attention, now, to the testimony with regard to the confession which is alleged to have been made to Captain Linden after the defendant had been arrested. In many particulars the confession as narrated by Captain Linden, and as reduced to writing, is not different from the testimony given by the defendant upon the stand. There are, however, some important particulars in which they do materially differ, and therefore it becomes our duty to lay down the law to you with regard to the reception of confessions of persons accused of crime.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-7" data-blocks='[["BL_89.6",89,[180,1497,1183,921]],["BL_90.1",90,[232,353,1191,2059]],["BL_91.1",91,[202,367,1184,665]]]'>Where a man freely and voluntarily — -that is, without fear or hope of benefit — makes, and intelligently makes, a statement, of course it is evidence of a very high nature. But in order to warrant the admission in evidence of the confession of a person accused of a crime, it must appear, in the first instance, that it was free and voluntary, and was not wrung from him by fear, or by hope that he would be bettered or advantaged thereby. That is, the inducement for the confession must not be the promise made to him, or hope held out to him, that it would be better for him to confess, by any person having authority. According to the evidence of Captain Linden, the defendant was in the company of his under officer, Thayer, and while in his company, Thayer made statements to the defendant as to the propriety of his making a confession to Captain Linden, and as to the advantage which would accrue to him if he did make such a confession, which, if they had been the inducement for the confession, would have required us to reject it from evidence. A promise by an officer to a person in charge, that it would be better <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>for Mm in the end to confess and tell what he knows, is such a promise as prevents the reception of the confession in evidence. But in order to warrant the rejection of a confession upon the ground that it was induced by a promise, it must appear that the promise was the inducement to the making of the confession. If, therefore, the promise ' or inducement which had been held out by Thayer, was not the inducement which led the defendant to make the confession, then it would be admissible in evidence. Upon this question there is a conflict of evidence. In the first instance, it was the duty of the court to decide as to its admissibility, and, acting within the province committed to us, we decided that it-was admissible, and it was read in your hearing. But the defendant says that after he had returned from Thayer’s room, Captain Linden then made promises to him as to what would be the advantage to him if he told all that he knew. On the other hand you have the testimony of Captain Linden to the effect that he then cautioned him that he could make no promises to him, and that if he told him anything he must tell him the truth, and with the knowledge that he would use it against Mm. Now, if this had the effect of removing from the defendant’s mind the hope wMch may have been born there by what Thayer had said, then we cannot say that this wás not a free and voluntary confession. It is for you to determine, then, whether the confession made to Captain Linden was a free and voluntary one, under the instructions we have given to you upon this question of law, or whether it was induced by the hope that he would be advantaged by making it, and that this hope was caused by promises held out by the officer in charge. In case you should find that it was not a free and voluntary confession, then you will reject it from consideration. This applies, however, only to what was said to Captain Linden, and to what was done with regard to the confession itself. It would not operate to the rejection of the testimony as to what he and Captain Linden did after they got to Wilkes-Barre that night, with regard to finding the property which had been hidden in the woods above Miner’s Mills. That would be evidence in any view of the case. In case you should decide that this confession was free and voluntary, then you will remember the testimony as to what took place the night that <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>they had the first interview, and also what was reduced to writing the next day. You are, in view of the discrepancy between that and the testimony, in some particulars, given here upon the stand by the defendant, to consider whether or not it is correctly reported. Have the statements made by the defendant at that time been correctly, accurately reported ? Has anything been omitted from that statement which would tend to qualify it or put a different light upon it ? Has anything been interjected into that statement which was not said by the defendant ? In deciding this question, you are to consider all of the circumstances. You are to consider also the testimony as to the care with which it was prepared — the care exercised not only by the officers but by the defendant himself.</p>

That was before the telegraph and the press brought to every man’s door the news of every event and every crime, within a few hours of its occurrence, with full details of everything connected therewith. All this is now changed; within twenty-four hours of the commission of this murder, it is safe to say that by means of the wire and the press, the details of it. had been read by nearly every intelligent man, not only in Luzerne county, but in the <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>state, and that but few persons had not formed some opinion in regard to it. The law upon this subject has necessarily advanced with the changed circumstances ; it has merely kept abreast of the times, and adapted itself to what the common judgment and common sense of the people see is essential to the proper administration of the criminal law. To return now to the old rule, would exclude from the jury box in many instances every man of average intelligence.</p>
    <p id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[236,768,1189,877]]]'>We find no error in admitting in evidence the testimony of Captain Linden in regard to the defendant’s confession,"nor to the admission of the confession itself. His testimony was competent and rebutted any allegation of undue influence in obtaining it. He said to the defendant: “ If you have anything to tell me, in God’s name tell me the truth; if not, tell me nothing. You have a right to keep your mouth shut. I tell you now, as your lawyer would tell you, I can make you no promise ; I cannot even ask you to tell me a word; but I tell you now, anything you say to me I shall use against you. It is my duty to do so. Now, if you feel like telling me anything, go ahead; but tell me nothing or tell me the whole God’s truth.” In view of this we regard what Thayer said to the defendant as unimportant; and as between the witness and the defendant, we are not surprised the jury believed the former, who was a reputable, disinterested witness, while the latter was testifying with a halter around his neck.</p>
    <p id="b96-6" data-blocks='[["BL_96.6",96,[232,1651,1192,819]]]'>Most of the remaining assignments are made up of extracts from the charge of the court. They are isolated from the charge, but whether we take the charge as a whole or in sections it is free from error. The question whether the defendant was acting under duress or threats on the part of Bevivino was submitted to the jury under proper instructions as to its effect upon the degree of guilt. This appears from that portion of the charge referred to in the ninth assignment, which is as follows : “ But in case you should find as a matter of fact that the shots were not inflicted by the defendant, then you will inquire whether or not the acts which he performed there were coerced by fear of Bevivino; whether that explanation which has been given by the defendant is such as would show that he had not the power to form the wilful, deliberate, and premeditated intent to take the life of McClure.” We need not pursue this branch of the case further.</p>

      <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>There remains but to notice the sixteenth and last assignment, which alleges that “ the record does not show that the prisoner was asked whether he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be pronounced against him.” The record shows that the defendant was asked if he had anything to say why sentence should not be passed upon him. As no sentence was possible but that of death we think there was no omission. The rule is thus stated by Blackstone, vol. 4, p. 376: For when, upon a capital charge, the jury have brought in their verdict of guilty, in the presence of the prisoner, he is either immediately, or at a convenient time soon after, asked by the court if he has anything to offer why judgment should not be awarded against him.”</p>
    <p id="b97-5" data-blocks='[["BL_97.5",97,[174,1046,1191,720]]]'>This defendant has had ail the advantages which our humane system of laws afford; with no claim except that of common humanity, he was assigned, without cost to himself, able counsel to defend him, who have performed that duty with zeal and ability, not only without fee or reward, hut without the hope or expectation of any; his case was tried before an impartial jury by a learned and able court, not only without error, but with conspicuous care and impartiality, and after a verdict of guilty he has had his case reviewed in the highest court in the state. He was allowed to he heard here in forma pauperis, to save him the cost of printing the testimony. It was his misfortune that a chain of testimony, in addition to his own confession, pointed to him with terrible distinctness as one of the perpetrators of a cold-blooded, mercenary murder.</p>
