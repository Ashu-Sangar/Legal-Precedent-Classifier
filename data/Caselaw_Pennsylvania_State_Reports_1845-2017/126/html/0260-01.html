There is no other method of ascertaining the age of a tree with accuracy, and in all cases where it becomes important to decide upon the age, growth and probable diameter of a tree at any given time, it is customary to count off from each side of the tree, beginning at the outside, the number of growths formed since the date in question. The growths that are left after deducting the number thus counted off, will give the age and size of the tree at the required date.</p>

They also showed the diameter of tlie trees as they were found in 1885. They then asked the referee to ñnd that all the trees shown to have been twenty-four years of age and upwards in 1867 must of necessity have been timber trees at that time. In other words, the referee was asked to adopt a formula or rule which would enable him to work out the problem of tlie diameter of the trees in 1867, by a mathematical calculation, rather than by an actual count. This the referee declined to do, and perhaps correctly, for the reason that the plan which he was asked to adopt, assumed as a fact, that the growth of each year had been equal and uniform. Why the witnesses were not asked to make the actual count, and thus be prepared to testify with certainty upon the vital question involved in the case, we are at a loss to understand. The truth and justice of the case require that the referee and the court shall be informed on this subject, and the means for furnishing this information are shown by the evidence to exist and to be readily obtainable. The finding of the referee on this subject is as follows: “ And that from said measurements made in July, 1886, from stumps of timber trees cut in February, 1885, the diameter of trees at the making of contract between Gil<a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>bert Shiffer and John A. Broadhead on the 18th day of October, 1867, cannot be ascertained and found as a conclusion of fact by the referee.” To dispose of this case without a definite finding as to the main and almost the only question involved in it, and that too, when the evidence upon that question is within easy reach, would be unjudicial, if not absurd.</p>

Under the acts referred to, unaffected by subsequent legislation, justices of the peace could not take acknowledgments or receive proof of the execution of any instruments other than “ all bargains aud sales, deeds <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>and conveyances of lands, tenements and hereditaments,” nor of such deeds executed by married women, where the grantor and the witnesses to the same were dead. Where a deed is recorded without a proper probate, it is no evidence of notice to a subsequent purchaser: Simon v.

In his first report, the referee had not found a fact which the court had questioned, but he refused to find a material fact, giving as his reason his inability to find the same from the evidence. The court simply said, perhaps this is so, but justice requires, in order that the case may be disposed of upon its merits, that you take additional evidence and find and report the fact, aiid for that purpose we commit the report back to you. The court had power so to do under § 1, act of June 22, 1871, P. L. 1363.</p>

L. 422, deeds proved by one or more of the subscribing witnesses before one of the judges of the Supreme Court, or before one of the justices of the Court of Common Pleas where the lands lie, and recorded before the proving and recording of the deed under which a subsequent purchaser shall claim, shall be valid; and under the act of September 30, 1791, 3 Sm. L. 59, justices of the peace have the power to receive the proof of deeds in the same manner as the justices of the Court of Common Pleas have under the act of 1775. By the terms of § 4, act of March 18, 1775, 1 Sm. L. 424, the fact of the death of the grantor, or of the subscribing witnesses, or that the same cannot be had, is set forth in the certificate, only when proof is made by any person not a grantor or subscribing witness.</p>

The supplementary act of June 22, 1871, P. L. 1363, referring to the provision for filing exceptions, etc., declares “It shall be the duty of the Court of Common Pleas to hear and decide upon all exceptions so filed <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>to the report of the referee, reserving to the court, however, the power of committing the report again to the referee should justice require it.” The power thus reserved, is an ample warrant for such action of the court as is complained of in the first specification. Indeed, the exercise of that power is sometimes necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice.</p>

In his second report (conclusions of fact, paragraph nine), the learned referee finds as follows, viz.: “ 9. That of the said forty-nine thousand and seventy-one feet of white pine timber in the log, mentioned in the last before conclusion of fact bio. 8, there were sixty-nine trees, ten inches and upwards in diameter at the top of a log twelve feet long, first cut from the stump, which together would make thirteen thousand feet of lumber, the market value of which in the stump was three dollars and fifty cents per thousand, or forty-seven dollars and twenty-five cents. And that there were of the same forty-nine thousand and seventy-one feet of white pine timber in the log, three hundred and fourteen other trees, measuring less than ten inches in diameter at the top of a log twelve feet long, first cut from the stump, which would make thirty-six thousand and seventy-one feet of lumber, the market value of winch in the stump was three dollars and fifty cents per thousand feet, or one hundred and twenty-four dollars and fifty cents. And that the said diameter above given is the diameter of the several trees mentioned as it existed and was in 1867 when the said written contract between Gilbert Shiffer and John A. Broadhead was entered into, ascertained from actual measurement of the stumps of the same trees cut in 1885, deducting from the whole number of annual rings formed, seventeen of the outer rings, and then measuring the diameter of the inner portion remaining, such latter measure-<a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>meat giving and being the diameter taken and received by the referee as the true diameter, in 1867, of the trees in controversy, cut in 1885.”</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[274,510,1194,1024]]]'>These facts, in connection with other findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of plaintiff, would have logically resulted in an award in his favor, if it had not been for the learned referee’s last conclusion of law, wherein he in substance held that plaintiff was not entitled to recover in the present form of action. The reason for that legal conclusion, in the referee’s own language, is as follows, to wit: “That as the defendants’ right of entry on the Broadhead tract to cut and remove that portion of the white pine timber which in thp tree would measure ten inches in diameter at the top of a log twelve feet long, first cut from the butt, was not determined at the time of the entry thereon by them, as claimed in this case, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover against defendants in this action.” The referee accordingly reported in favor of defendants and against plaintiff “no cause of action.” .To this, among other things, plaintiff excepted. The exceptions were all overruled by the court and judgment' entered in accordance with the report of the referee. This action of the court in ordering judgment for defendants, etc., constitutes the third and last specification of error.</p>
    <p id="b294-6" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[267,1544,1192,870]],["BL_295.1",295,[141,341,1180,303]]]'>As we have already seen, the learned referee found, inter alia, in substance, that in 1885, on the lot referred to in the agreement of 1867 as “ the Broadhead lot,” the defendants cut certain trees, which, under said agreement, they had a right to cut; and during the same time they cut on said lot certain other trees, which, under said agreement or otherwise, they had no right to cut; but, inasmuch as they had a right to enter on the premises for the purpose of cutting and removing the first-mentioned trees, he concluded, as matter of law, that they were not liable in this action of trespass, etc., for cutting and removing the last mentioned trees. That conclusion, we think, is a non sequitur. It is true they had a right of entry on the premises at the time the cutting was done, but it was not a right of entry for all purposes. It was solely for the purpose of cutting and removing such trees as, under the agreement, they had a right to cut, and nothing else. In cutting and removing other trees which they had no right, and <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>must have known they had no right to cut, they became trespassers as to such unauthorized and illegal acts, and as such they were liable in this action. The extent, or rather the basis of their liability is fixed by the finding of the referee as to the value of the timber cut by them without authority so to do. The third specification is sustained.</p>
