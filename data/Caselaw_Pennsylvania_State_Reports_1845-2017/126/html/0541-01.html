Emerick, who died in 1848, was sold in parcels, the interest of his widow being either charged upon the parcel sold or secured by the mortgage of the purchaser. On the death of the widow, December 11, 1886, the sum of $8,000, the principal set apart to secure the widow’s interest, became distributable to the parties entitled thereto. The controversy in this case arose over the share of said principal to which Wilhelmina E. Bladen, a deceased daughter of Peter K. Emerick, would be entitled were she alive. This share, being the one fourth of the fund, had been paid over to J. L. Hutchinson, administrator of Wilhelmina E.

He died in March, 1843, intestate, leaving a widow, Ann Emerick, and four children, Edgar, Augustus K., Catharine A. and Wilhelmina, the three last being minors. His real estate, in several parcels, was afterwards sold under proceedings in partition, and the interest of the widow, as to two of said parcels, was secured by the mortgage of the purchaser, and as to the remaining parcels was charged upon the land. The widow died December 11, 1886, and the principal of the sum set apart for her interest was thereupon divisible among the parties by law entitled. The principal, amounting to a little over #8,000, was collected by Daniel M. Bowen, Esq., who had been appointed their attorney in fact for that purpose by the surviving children of Peter K. Emerick. He paid to these children three fourths of the sum so collected, and the remaining fourth to the administrator of the estate of Wilhelmina, the deceased child. The children of Peter K.

But it contains an admission which the auditing judge believes is self-destructive. It concedes that the proceeds of sale of these properties became cash in the hands of the distributees to whom they were paid, and that only the fund retained to secure the widow, which was indivisible, until set free by her death, was insusceptible of possession and therefore could not be distinguished from the real <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>estate, whose place it took. A fallacy hides somewhere in the proposition, which admits that the price of real estate sold after the owner’s death, belongs to the same persons to whom the owner gave the real estate, or who took it from him by descent, but asserts that if any part of that price is withheld in order to secure the accidental interest of a life tenant, which latter may fall in, in a day or a month thereafter, such part is liable to be diverted from those persons or some of them, and to go in a totally different direction. The error is in the assumption that the cash proceeds and the secured moneys do not together constitute one fund, each part of which retains its character of real estate, or drops it at the same moment with every other part. It is not answering this, to say that the reserved fund cannot be reduced into manual possession; neither can the money represented by a promissory note which is not yet due; yet in both cases, the interest of the owner has a present value, which is as absolute and almost as ascertainable as if it were in cash, and in both cases that interest may be the subject of a valid sale.</p>

The cash, produced by the realty sale, passed to the guardian of the decedent as real estate, but became money in his hands, on the same principle that money impressed with the character of realty is reconverted when received by a party who is sui juris, and has its absolute control, or, to put i't into other words, when the fund and its use are united in the same person. This principle was established by McCune’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20450" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="52 Pa. 450">52 Pa. 450</a>, and Kami’s Est., <a href="/pa/69/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="69 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="1026467" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0219-01">69 Pa. 219</a>. It is objected that the interest of the widow is quasi real estate. But the character which for her protection the property may bear as to her, ought not to determine the character it sustains towards the heirs. The capital of her interest vested in the heirs along ivith the rest of the purchase money, and it vested in them as the cash did, in possession, only its enjoyment being postponed. As was said in Reish v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20Pa.%20526" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="106 Pa. 526">106 Pa. 526</a>, “ the enjoyment of real estate is not the exact equivalent of possession; ” in other words, a man may be entitled to the possession of property without its present enjoyment. The share of the minor daughter so far vested in her guardian, that it could have been sold under an order. of the court, and, by the same authority, <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>the interest of the widow could have been commuted for money by the guardian, if for any reason that had been desirable. The guardian would then have received the principal of the fund which had been set apart for the widow’s security. Assume that this is not so, and that the character of the interest in the hands of the widow fixed the character in which the fund went to the heirs, a conversion nevertheless was worked when the right to the fund passed by a second transmission to the child of this decedent. There must be a point at which the identity of moneys, or of securities representing moneys, which by a legal fiction are characterized as real estate, is to be deemed lost; and the cases have marked that point, at a second transmission of the fund, or the right to the fund, which is the same thing. It does not matter that the fund has not been touched by the owner, as by reason of his incapacity from non-age; the law converts it as fully as he might himself have converted it, if capable. If the cases hitherto, have treated only of a fund of actual cash, and not of securities representing cash, or of a vested right to cash payable in the future, it has been, no doubt, because it was never supposed that any distinction existed between these species of property.</p>

The point of the argument was that the fund in hand was real estate up to the death of the grandchild, because neither the daughter nor the grandson had the power to transmute it, and it vested as real estate in the present claimants as heirs. It could so vest only because it had originally vested in Wilhelmina Bladen, the daughter from whom they derive title. She was the heir also to the cash proceeds, which came to her as real estate. If the guardian could use those proceeds Cor her benefit, and if the right to such user made them money, why could he not use for the same purpose, if necessary, the reserve fund, by selling or mortgaging her share therein, and why would not his right to do so make that interest money ? Suppose that the cash proceeds had been exhausted in the support of the minor; <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>would the court have permitted her to starve, by prohibiting the guardian from raising money upon the mortgage which was expressly payable to the minor after the widow’s death, on the ground that until she reached her majority the mortgage was real estate ? Or would it assign, as another reason for its prohibition, that the heirs were interested in its continuing as real estate ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[271,727,1189,1544]]]'>The argument of the heirs practically puts the title to the fund in abeyance for twenty-four years, by vesting it in possession only after the death of the second minor. The precise question involved was met and answered in Hay’s App., <a href="/pa/52/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="52 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="1002282" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0449-01">52 Pa. 449</a>. There the title to the proceeds of sale passed as real estate to the two children, but without possession, because the father had the income for life. The children died in the lifetime of the father, and their interest was held to pass as personalty. The two cases are parallel. The principal of a fund comes as real estate to children, but the possession in enjoyment is deferred, and before the time for enjoyment is reached the children die. Yet the opinion in the case cited is, that the fund becomes personal estate while in the technical ownership of the children. The same case answers another question, which was propounded by the heirs. In the mortgage given by one of the purchasers, the mortgagor agreed after the widow’s death to pay “ the principal sum to the parties legally entitled to receive the same, being the heirs and legal representatives of Péter K. Emerick, deceased.” The court in Hay’s Appeal say: “ Who are the heirs ? They are those upon whom the law casts the inheritance at the death of the ancestor.” The ancestor here was Peter K. Emerick, and his heir at his death was Wilhelmina Bladen. The principal of the mortgage was payable therefore to her, and at her death to her personal representatives. But it was urged, this mortgage fund must have continued to be real estate, because the guardian was not obliged to account for it, and because in McCune’s Appeal and Kann’s Estate, supra, he did not charge himself with such a' fund. A fund is therefore either real estate or personalty, as the guardian happens to be a good or indifferent book-keeper.</p>

It cannot retain its original character forever.....The distribution of the estate of a decedent among persons who never gave value for it, and who have no title to it whatever, except that which is founded upon the law and its policy, involves no principle of justice, and stands entirely uninfluenced by its dictates. The necessity of a perfect conversion at some period being apparent, and neither justice nor policy requiring that a fiction should be substituted for the fact, the proper time for it is when the money has vested in the party entitled to it, after the actual conversion.” This case was cited by the heirs, apparently to show that the conversion could not take place before the widow’s death, and, therefore, only those who were heirs at her death could take the fund.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b571-7" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[99,1338,1183,717]]]'>Exactly what Judge Lewis meant when he said that the time for conversion is “ when the money has vested in the party entitled to it <em>after </em>the actual conversion ” is not perhaps clear; but it certainly cannot help these claimants, for they rest their title on the ground that no conversion has yet taken place, and they are therefore not a “party entitled after conversion.” The thing decided was clear: it was that the proceeds of sale went to the minor as realty, and in his hands became money; and the proper time, therefore, for conversion was when the money vested in the party who was entitled before the conversion. The decision says in so many words, that a sale works an actual conversion, although the proceeds may be distributable as realty; and that legal conversion takes place when the proceeds have vested in the heir as land.</p>

At the risk of a second repetition he holds that an actual, as distinguished from a legal conversion, was effected as to <em>all </em>the lands of the original decedent, when the lands were sold.

All the proceeds immediately vested in the heirs, subject to the life interest of the widow in one third. Of course that one third could not be used by the heirs until her death, but it did not cease to be money, because it had been set apart temporarily, and it was not prevented from vesting, because it could not be presently enjoyed.

Under the act of March 29,1832, § 48, the money was paid to the husband on his giving security that it should be forthcoming at his death. The wife died, leaving children, and two of these died during the lifetime of the father. The money never was in their possession, any more than the money in the present case was in the possession of Wilhelmina Bladen. The cases are identical, except that the intervening interest that prevented present possession there, was the use by the father of the money in lieu of curtesy, and here it is the use by the mother in lieu of dower. Yet the court held that the money became personalty on the passage of the right to it to the children, and on their death it passed as personalty to the father. “ On the death of Mrs. Hay,” says Strong, J., “the right to the money became vested in her three children, though the time of enjoyment was postponed until the death of their father. Two of these having died in the lifetime of their father, in their minority, and without issue, their shares descended to their father. For it descended as personalty, which it actually was. The provision in the act of assembly extended no farther than to regulate the first descent. ”</p>

The exceptionally able argument of the learned counsel for appellants, has failed to convince us, as it failed to convince the court below, that there is any difference in principle between those cases and the present. It is not necessary that we should go over the argument in detail, as that has been very satisfactorily done in the opinion <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>of the learned auditing judge, to which we refer for the answer to the several points made.</p>
    <p id="b575-5" data-blocks='[["BL_575.5",575,[160,460,1187,1641]]]'>To that opinion I will only add that the general error of the argument is in assuming that the proceeds of the sale in partition are real estate, and require a positive act of reconversion to get them back into their character as money. It is not uncommon to say that the proceeds of real estate remain realty, etc., but the expression is not accurate. The money never is real estate, in law any more than in fact, but for certain purposes, and within certain limits, it is treated <em>as if </em>it was real estate. The purpose is to preserve the inheritable quality of the estate, so that the title may not be diverted from the previous owner, and the limit is the first devolution. The whole doctrine is the creation of equity for a specific purpose, and when that purpose is accomplished the rule ceases to operate. So far therefore from the money actually becoming real estate, and requiring a positive act of reconversion to restore it to its natural character of money, it never is real estate, and is only treated as such within a limit, which all the cases agree, is the first transmission. To quote again from Hay’s Appeal, “it descended as personalty, which it actually was. The provision in the act of assembly extended no farther than to regulate the first descent, and prevent the fund from passing directly from the wife to the husband. After it had vested in the heirs ” (and it is to be remembered that in that case as in this, it never did vest in possession) “ it was no longer real estate for any purpose.” And in the language of Shabswood, J., in Foster’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=74%20Pa.%20897" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="74 Pa. 897">74 Pa. 897</a>, “ conversion is altogether a doctrine of equity. It is admitted only for the accomplishment of equitable results. It may be termed an equitable fiction, and the legal maxim, In fictione juris semper subsistit esquitas, has redoubled force in application to it. It follows, of necessity, that it is limited to its end.....When the ourpose of conversion is attained, conversion ends.”</p>
