About five o’clock on the morning of December 15, 1884, when it was still dark, he was seen upon the seat at the right side of the locomotive cab, while the train was going west. When next seen, he was lying on the floor of the cab on his back, face upwards, with his head near the feet of the brakeman, and his skull fractured.</p>

On this siding, the evening before, there was a box car, some 275 feet from the switch. On the following morning, this car was near the switch, at the east end of the car, at a point where the rails of the side track were four feet eight inches from the rails of the main track. There was no evidence as to how the car came to be in this position.</p>

I have been employed about seven years as a fireman. Q. You may state if you visited this locality at the instance of the plaintiff in this case the other day ? A. I did; I was up there and looked over the ground. Q. State if you examined the siding there? A. I did. Q. You may state if you are acquainted with a device called a safety-switch? A. I am. Q. Explain to the jury what that device is for ? A. A safety-switch is for cars thrown in on a side track; in case they get away, or anything of the sort, they would run off the track without running on to the main line. Q. What causes the moving of cars on the siding on to the main track ? A. There are different causes; the wind will move a car occasionally; an engine or tram backing in or pulling in, will move cars.</p>
