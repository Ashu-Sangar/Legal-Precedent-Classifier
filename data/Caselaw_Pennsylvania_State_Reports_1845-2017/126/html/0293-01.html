He rode one mule which he directed by means of the halter strap passed through its mouth, and led the other by a chain fastened to its halter. He testified as to the accident as follows :</p>

I rode the one mule and led the other one in the hand with the halter; T went on down about near 300 yards, and the one mule which T had in my hand got to playing; I hadn’t worked them very hard, a few days before, and he got to playing, rearing up that way around, and he started oif on a run, and I was not thinking of him starting off, and he jerked away with the chain and jerked me off; I had hold of the T and he jerked me off and they started both on after I was off. Q. Started on where ? A. Down to the watering place. Q. What is the watering-place — a spring? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you ever water the mules there before ? A. I think I watered them once there ; I aint sure, but I think I watered them once there. Q. What occurred then after you were thrown oif? A. I started on down following them up, and I didn’t just run; l took my time and went on down, and about the time they were ready to come over, there was an engine came, and one of them made it across, one of them came across, and the other one didn’t make it; the engine struck him before he got across. Q. Where was the mule when the engine struck it ? A. Right at the edge of the crossing. Q. On the road ? A. No, sir; right on the railroad. Q. But it was on the line of the public road? A. Yes, sir.</p>

Under the facts of the case, as shown by plaintiff’s witness, the mule was a trespasser upon the track of defendant’s road, and the case seems to us to be ruled pointedly by the case of North Penn.

The mule was killed upon the track by one of defendant’s locomotives, it was loose, and for the purposes of this case, must be regarded as straying upon the track. The alleged negligence of the company consisted in not ringing the bell or sounding the whistle as the engine approached the crossing near which the mule was killed. If it was the duty of the engineer to blow the whistle as notice to the mule, 1 do not see why the mule should not be held to the rule, to “ stop, look and listen.” To apply rules to dumb animals which were intended only for reasonable beings brings us dangerously near to the realm of absurdity.</p>
