He knew nothing thereof until Ms brothers, Moses Thompson, the defendant, and Dr. Thompson, called upon him to see if he would take an interest in the purchase, they stating the price to be paid. John I. Thompson inquired of Moses Thompson as to the character of the title to Martha Furnace property. Moses Thompson represented to Mm that the Curtins had had it so many years without any interference, that the title was good beyond a doubt.” If this finding is material in the case, it is not justified by the testimony, in the way it is stated, and is calculated to leave an impression on the'mind which an attentive reading of the testimony ought not to make.] 3</p>

The answer, while not admittmg all of the facts in the bill, does proffer a readiness and willingness to make a conveyance and a tender of a deed, for all the land and the “ ore reservations ” upon the John Thompson tract outside of the interference with the Gover and Wilson surveys, or the lands of the Centre Furnace Company.

Every averment necessary to entitle the plaintiff in equity to the relief sought, must be contained in the stating part of the bill, and may not be supplied by inference or reference to some other part of the bill: Wright v. Dame, <a href="/mass/39/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="22 Pick. 55" data-case-ids="2045848" data-case-paths="/mass/39/0055-01">22 Pick. 55</a> : Brinkerhoff v.

The same rule prevails in the authorities and decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. The rule is, that a party is not allowed to state one case in a bill or answer, and make out a different one by proof : the allegata and probata must agree; the latter must support the former: Boone v. Chiles, <a href="/us/35/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="10 Pet. 177" data-case-ids="5615703" data-case-paths="/us/35/0177-01">10 Pet. 177</a>; Foster v.

There must be sufficient equity apparent on face of the bill to warrant granting the relief prayed for, and material facts relied on must be so distinctly stated as to be put in issue: Harding v. Handy, <a href="/us/24/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="11 Wheat. 103" data-case-ids="1428691" data-case-paths="/us/24/0103-01">11 Wheat. 103</a>.

So, also, it has been held that a party cannot give evidence of an affirmative defence of estoppel, unless he has pleaded it: Delphi v. Startsman, 2 West. R. 249 (Ind.). Before an estoppel can be relied on, the facts constituting it must be pleaded; and where there was no such plea, it was error to give an instruction upon the theory that it was allowable for the jury to find an estoppel: Dist. of Burlington v. Bank, <a href="/iowa/68/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="68 Iowa 343" data-case-ids="2048577" data-case-paths="/iowa/68/0343-01">68 la. 343</a>. Rule XVII. of the Supreme Court Equity Practice directs, that “The bill shall be divided into paragraphs consecutively numbered, and shall contain a succinct statement of the facts upon which the plaintiff asks relief,” etc. In the case of Winebrenner v. Colder, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20251" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="43 Pa. 251">43 Pa. 251</a>, the <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>court, criticising the bill then before it, says: “ The bill should be a simple statement of the essential facts of the case.” Three years afterwards the Rules of Equity Practice were adopted, and few if any cases have arisen in which this question is passed upon. If we look «into the text books, we find the same rule. In 1 Daniel’s Chan. Pr. 326, it is said: “ Care, however, must be taken in framing the bill that everything which is intended to be proved, be stated upon the face of it, otherwise, evidence cannot be admitted to prove it. And again, it is a fundamental maxim both in this court and in courts of law, that no proof can be admitted of any matter' which is not noticed in the pleadings: ” 1 Daniel’s Chan. Pr. 852, 853. The degree of certainty required in bills in equity in our courts may be gathered from a few cases reported from the lower courts. The averments of fraud in a bill in equity must be certain and specific : Ludlow, J., in Baird v. Hamm, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Phila.%20436" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="7 Phila. 436">7 Phila. 436</a>. The rule of practice is clear and invariable, that it is not only necessary that the substance of the case made by each party should be proved, but it must be substantially the same case as that which he has stated in the record: Woods v. McMillan, 15 P. L. J. 363; Hollenbaek’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=45%20Leg.%20Int.%20394" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="45 Leg. Int. 394">45 Leg. Int. 394</a>.</p>

As will be seen from the authorities cited, he ought not to have regarded the testimony upon that point, as that was not the issue made by the averments in the bill and answer. The error lies in this that he decrees that the defendant shall convey to the plaintiff the ore on the parts of the Gover and Wilson surveys interfered with by the John Thompson survey. The written contract he admits does not require this, but he bases his decree wholly upon the ground of equitable estoppel. The bill filed does not place it upon that ground, but does rest only upon the written agreement of November 16, 1857, without any intimation that the plaintiff seeks this particular John Thompson survey, or the ore thereunder, in any other right, or under any other assertion of title than that it was withiix <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>the terms of the agreement and a part of the Martha Furnace-property. To sustain the decree to that length, would boto take away what is otherwise the defendant’s property, with- - out notice of the nature of the plaintiff’s right or claim of title • thereto and with no opportunity to defend against the same.] 6</p>

The application of the principle to the facts of any particular case, is, however, much more difficult of ascertainment, as in the very nature of things the facts in no two cases are precisely the same. The courts of some of the states distinguish in the application of the principle ; also, between controversies affecting personal property and real estate. What is this doctrine as declared by the courts ? It is, that one having knowledge of facts on which he intends to rely, to exempt him from an obligation about to be entered into with another, of which the other is ignorant and can only learn through him, is bound to. disclose that knowledge:' United States v. Bank of Metropolis, 15 Bet. B77. Silence works no estoppel unless it has misled another to his injury: Bailroad Co. v. Dubois, <a href="/us/79/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="12 Wall. 47" data-case-ids="5653684" data-case-paths="/us/79/0047-01">12 Wall. 47</a> Mill v. Epley, 81 Fa. 334; Beaupland v. McKeen, 28 Ba. 124. Bositive acts tending to mislead one ignorant of the truth and which do mislead him to his injury, are grounds of estoppel, though the party estopped were ignorant of his rights: Chapman v.

[An examination into the facts in those cases where estoppel has been grounded on silence will, we think, disclose that it was held, or if not distinctly held, it was apparent, that the silence was in relation to facts of which the injured party had no means of obtaining knowledge, except through and by him who held it witlrin his breast and failed to reveal it. Under such circumstances, it is not difficult to understand why the courts say that silence is a fraud. But if both parties have equal means of ascertaining the facts by examination of the records as to title, by ascertaining the true ■ boundaries of the land by lines run on the ground, or other equally accessible and ascertainable matters, silence upon such matters surely cannot be held to be a fraud.] 7 In dealing with real property, it is well to bear in mind that we have upon our statute books the statute of frauds, the chief purpose of which is to regulate the methods of transmitting title and to protect the owners thereof against unfounded claims. The exceptions that have been made by the courts to the statutory rule, are all based upon the principle of fraud; and this doctrine of equitable estoppel is antagonistic to the statute, unless it is applied and restricted to cases where the acts and matters or silence are essentially fraudulent. I think that- while it is true that the owner of real property may by Ms acts in pais preclude himself from asserting his legal title, yet the doctrine ought to be sparingly applied and only on the disclosure of clear and satisfactory grounds of equity and justice. The statute of frauds was intended for the security of titles, and its beneficial effects ought not to be swept away by parol testimony, except of the clearest and most convincing character. I do not think tliis is stating a new limitation upon the doctrine of estoppel, but is the distinct .result of an attentive study of the cases on that subject, from Commonwealth v.

The main question is: is the defendant estopped from asserting his title under the Cover and Wilson surveys to the strip of land in dispute, either by reason of acts or silence, in misrepresenting or not disclosing his claim thereto. It is manifest that in order to have this effect they must have some distinct and clear' connection with the making of the contract of partition November 16, 1857, and that there must have been then some fraud intended in keeping silent or making the representations, or doing the acts complained of. On part of the plaintiff it is earnestly contended that the facts are sufficient; that in 1850 the defendant discovered the western lines of his Cover and Wilson surveys when he had Mr. Trcziyulny upon the lines. This much is true, but it does not appear by the testimony that he then discovered the interference, or know where the eastern line of the John Thompson survey was.] 8 According to the plain reading of the testimony, Curtins &amp; Company had ceased taking ore from every part of the John Thompson tract, two years or more before that. John Curtin says : “ I think the last work we did was in 1847, when we stopped the furnace.” [The next fact upon which defendant is sought to be estopped is, that in 1854, while the negotiations were going on with the Curtins &amp; Co., the plaintiff asked his brother about the title to the property. From the reading of the testimony, this was clearly a time, whether long or short, it is hard to say, before the contract of March 17, 1854, was signed. How this conversation made early in the year 1854, can be connected with the purchase by the plaintiff from defendant in 1857, I cannot understand. The defendant himself evidently believed what he said, for upon his belief he was willing to and did contract to buy from the Curtins the Martha Furnace property, and this declaration could not, it seems to me, have contained the element of fraudulent intent essential, unless we can conceive of the defendant planning this purchase in 1854, in order to entrap his brother in 1857. But what totally destroys this theory is, that it could not have had reference to the present controversy, or if it did have, it was provided for at some one’s instance that the Cur-tins would convey by general warranty deed this John Thompson tract, the benefit of which was lost by plaintiff accepting <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>along with defendant a deed without this warranty made and delivered in 1865.] 9</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b400-5" data-blocks='[["BL_400.5",400,[232,454,1195,1440]]]'>[After the purchase of this property in March, 1854, the plaintiff himself testifies that a survey of the lands was made by one Abram Elder. Who for? Certainly for their joint benefit. The plaintiff shows clearly that both plaintiff and defendant had drafts of that survey, and that a large draft was made, of which the others were copies ; and the reason for this is apparent when we remember that the plaintiff removed to the Martha Furnace, and the great body of this land was in the Bald Eagle Valley, and it was necessary to have a draft in order not only to find the lands, but to guard against trespassing. It is clear, then, that prior to November, 1857, a survey had been made of the lands; both parties had equal facilities of ascertaining the boundaries of the lands and their locations; the plaintiff himself was with Mr. Elder as chain carrier, certainly most of the time. If the interference between the Gover and Wilson with the John Thompson survey was discovered then, the plaintiff had the same means of ascertaining it that the defendant had. If he did not then discover it, there is no evidence that the defendant did, except inferentially. Here then, we have a case, assuming now that the evidence makes it clear that the defendant knew of the interference between these surveys, where the silence set up as the grounds of an equitable estoppel relate to a matter, the method of finding out which was equally open to both. It was not a thing laid away and hidden out of sight, within the defendant’s control and only to be ascertained by his disclosing it, or divulging the secret sources of his knowledge. Surely mere sileuce under such circumstances does not rise to the force and effect of fraud.]10</p>

The plaintiff alleges that he did not know of this interference. The defendant swears it was often talked about between them. These men are both of high character and reputation; their testimony so far as anything appears in this case, is of equal weight and entitled to equal consideration ; and, under the well established doctrine that where the testimony is equally balanced, the bill must fail.] 11</p>

Under the evidence, this was all he was bound to do.
