Benson, of Waterford township, Erie Co., Pa., died in March, 1885, leaving a widow and a family of children, and owning a farm of about 70 acres of improved land. This farm was incumbered by the lien of three judgments, as follows: the first, in favor of William Benson, amounting witli interest and costs to $2,072.65: the second, in favor of Theo. W. Barton, amounting with interest and costs to $560.58; the third, in favor of -William Benson, amounting witli interest and costs to $1,782.37, making a total of liens against the real estate of the decedent, $4,865.60. The real estate of the decedent was worth not more than $3,000.</p>

On the day fixed for the sale the defendant, Benson, <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>attended the sale and the plaintiff, Barton, sent his agent W. L. Kelly, who was Barton’s brother-in-law to attend in his interest. The only other persons present were Leon Benson, a son of decedent, and W. I. Port, who acted for the administratrix in making the sale. The defendant there agreed with Kelly, that if he, Kelly, would not bid the property up to an amount sufficient to cover Barton’s lien, he, Benson, would pay Barton’s judgment in full, as he would have to do so in order to protect his lien that was subsequent to Barton’s. In pursuance of this agreement Kelly refrained from bidding the property up to the sum of $3,000, enough to cover Barton’s judgment, and the farm was struck off to Benson for $1,859, in pursuance of the agreement; thereafter the sale was confirmed to him and deed made in pursuance thereof. Barton assigned his judgment to Benson, so that he, being then the only lien creditor, was in a position to receipt his bid, after payment of expenses, to the administratrix without the payment of the money and the expense of an auditor to make distribution, and did so receipt for $1,456.52, to apply on his liens.</p>

    <p id="b457-7" data-blocks='[["BL_457.8",457,[164,815,1183,1286]]]'>The court below correctly held that the contract declared upon was against public policy, and therefore void. It is true a somewhat similar contract was sustained in Maffet v. Iiams, <a href="/pa/103/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="103 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="449156" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0266-01">103 Pa. 266</a>. In that case, however, it appeared affirmatively that the agreement was known and assented to by the defendant in the execution and all the lien creditors who were or could be affected by it. 11n the case in hand, the defendant was dead and he could not of course assent or dissent. But his heirs stood in his shoes, and there was no evidence that they ever knew of the arrangement. It is true, it was alleged that the property was not worth the liens and no one could have been injured. We cannot sustain the agreement upon this narrow ground. The allegation may be true, but it would introduce an uncertain element into judicial sales, were we to sustain such an agreement upon the ground that the property was not worth the liens. As a general rule the defendant in an execution, or those who stand in his place, have an interest in making the property bring its full value. Hence an agreement by which persons are debarred from bidding must have the sanction of the defendant. In Slingluff v. Eckel, <a href="/pa/24/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="24 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="9505072" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0472-01">24 Pa. 472</a>, it was held that an agreement at sheriff’s sale of real estate to pay the judgment of another, if the latter would not bid, the former being permitted to purchase the property at the sale, was fraudulent as to the debtor or his creditors, and could not be enforced by suit.</p>
    <p id="b457-8" data-blocks='[["BL_457.9",457,[935,2110,364,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
