There is also a special rule of said court that “accounts of executors, administrators, guardians and trustees shall be published by the register of wills once a week, for four successive weeks immediately before the term at which they shall be presented for confirmation, in the paper designated by the court for the publication of legal notices, in addition to the papers now required by law, and <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>there shall be allowed and paid by the register of wills the sum of sixty-two and one half cents in each estate for such additional publication.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[274,530,1204,1389]]]'>The plaintiff is publisher of the Luzerne Legal Register, and claims pay from the defendant, who is register of wills, for the publication of notices of the presentation of fifty accounts of executors and administrators. The act of March 15, 1832, § 30, P. L. 143, requires the register to publish these notices in at least two newspapers; it does not say that he must not publish in more. So also, the same act declares that the Orphans’ Court shall not confirm an account unless notice, as aforesaid, shall have been given, but does not declare that the account shall be confirmed without additional notice, notwithstanding the court may be of opinion that such additional notice is necessary. We have no doubt that, even in the absence of the last mentioned rule, the register would be liable for any additional publication ordered by him beyond those expressly required by the act of 1832, and would be entitled to charge the cost of the same to the several estates, unless it could be shown that he had been guilty of an abuse of discretion. And the advantages of publication of- the notice of the time when the accounts of executors and administrators will ■be presented for confirmation, in the paper in which all other legal notices are published, are so great and so manifest as to leave no room for argument that it would be an abuse of discretion. But, inasmuch as the parties by their agreement have made the case to turn on the power of the Orphans’ Court to establish the rule in question, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the facts of the case stated in the absence of the rule would raise an implied assumpsit.</p>
