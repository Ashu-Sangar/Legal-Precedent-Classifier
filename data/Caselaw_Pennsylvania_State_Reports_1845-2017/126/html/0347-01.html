It is in evidence and not contradicted, that defendant’s order was accepted by The Aldine Press, June 16, 1886, and that a duplicate of the order with the acceptance stamped upon it was mailed the same day to the proper address of the defendant. That it was received by the defendant by due course of mail, is presumed and not denied. Yet, not until the 21st of August following was any attempt made to countermand the order, and then not upon the ground that it had been altered, or that the defendant had been duped into signing it, but upon the claim that The Aldine Press had agreed to supply another party with one of its publications for the year 1887.</p>
