His estate consisted of personalty, and the only claim against it was one presented on behalf of L. C. Paine &amp; Co. Testimony was adduced that L. C. Paine, doing business as L. C. Paine &amp; Co., was engaged in a wholesale meat and provision trade; that the decedent had general charge of the business, handled the cash and was the chief bookkeeper.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[191,776,1185,354]]]'>Certain entries in the business books in the hand-writing of the decedent were offered in evidence, with explanations of the items by another of the bookkeepers, as evidence tending to show that on August 13, 1886, when the decedent had suddenly quit the firm’s employment, he had taken $1,066.67 of the firm’s money, to which he was not entitled. The offer was objected to, but admitted under exception.1</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b127-6" data-blocks='[["BL_127.6",127,[189,1191,1186,767]]]'>The court, Rtioxjc, P. J., having heard the testimony, adjudged: That Roberts took $1,066.67, or any other sum of money belonging to L. C. Paine &amp; Co., is shown only by his own entries made in the books of L. C. Paine &amp; Co., while he was in the employ of the firm. So much is admitted by both parties. Roberts’ counsel contends that the whole entry made at the same time is to be admitted as true, while counsel for Mr. Paine contends that while the whole entry is to be admitted, yet only so much is to be taken as true as appears from all the facts and circumstances to be true. The general rule is well stated in the language of Brightly’s Digest, title Evidence, thus, “the whole of a defendant’s admission must be taken together, unless there be circumstances that render improbable what he says in avoidance of a conceded fact: ” Newman v. Bradley, 1 Dali. 240.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b127-7" data-blocks='[["BL_127.7",127,[189,1967,1188,508]]]'>The probability or improbability of the circumstances alleged in excuse or exoneration for taking the money is the criterion to judge from. What are the probabilities ? The entries are very vague. They do not allege any agreement with Mr. Paine. They were not entered up in the regular course of business either from month to month or from year to year. They are lumped just at a time when the clerk leaped from his place. Roberts was employed at a salary of $100 a month, and that he allowed so large a sum as he took, to remain with his employer for so long a time, without interest, seems unreasonable.</p>

This allowance is made on an average yearly profit of over $20,000 from 1881 and 1885 inclusive.” And under date of August 13, 1886, he says:</p>

In the one case the share of profits due him was $800 per year and in the other case it was $400 per year. The manner,of taking the money is also suspicious. We accept his admissions of taking the money as true, and say that his declarations of being entitled to it are too vague and suspicious to be entitled to our belief, ■ If he had a right to the money it is unfortunate that he has left no better evidence of it. We therefore allow L. C. Paine &amp; Co. $1,066.67, with interest from 13th of August, 1886.</p>

    <p id="b129-5" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[174,412,1183,1029]]]'>The assignments of error which allege that the court erred in receiving the books of L. C. Paine &amp; Co. in evidence, are of little importance. The mere admission of incompetent evidence by the Orphans’ Court, or an auditor, is not of itself sufficient to justify a reversal. It must appear that the court or the auditor has been influenced by such testimony. In the present case, we have no doubt the learned judge below attached very considerable weight to the evidence furnished by the books of L. C. Paine &amp; Co. Indeed, he could hardly have reached the conclusions he did without relying upon the books to some extent. We are of opinion that they were competent and that the conclusions drawn therefrom are fully justified by the facts. The entries were made by James S. Roberts, against whose estate this claim is made. He had at that time the sole charge of the business, and his own entries show that when he loft the employ of Paine &amp; Co., in an abrupt manner, on August 18,1886, he took with him the sum of §1,066.67 of the money of L. C. Paine &amp; Co. to which he had no right, to state it in the mildest form. It is only proper that his estate should be compelled to restore the money thus taken.</p>
