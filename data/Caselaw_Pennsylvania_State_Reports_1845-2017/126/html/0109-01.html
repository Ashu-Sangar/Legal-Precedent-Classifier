The obligor was to devise his farm to the appellant, subject to certain stipulations not specified, yet in such way that the appellant should realize his full share thereof as heir, and the aforesaid sum of $3,000. An examination of the case satisfies us that this has been done; and that the condition of the bond has been fulfilled. The appellant gets his $3,000 and his share of his father’s estate. It is true he refused to accept the devise and allowed the farm to be sold. It also appears there were some “ stipulations ” in the will which reduced his share, or his “ heirship ” tó less than he may have anticipated.
