        "text": "Per Curiam:\nThis was a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner is a convict now undergoing sentence in the Western Penitentiary. The record of his trial and conviction in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Elk county, has been brought up by a writ of certiorari, from which we learn that four separate indictments were returned against him, numbered respectively 12, 18, 14 and 15 of November Sessions 1884; that as to the first indictment, No. 12, a nolle prosequi was entered by leave of court; that to No. 13 he pleaded guilty but was not sentenced; that to No. 14 he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to an imprisonment of four years; and that to No. 15 he pleaded \u25a0 guilty and was sentenced to an imprisonment of four years, to be computed from the expiration of sentence on No. 12. The four years having now fully expired, of the sentence on No. 14, the prisoner prays for this writ of habeas corpus in order that he may be discharged from further confinement, the warden of the penitentiary refusing to discharge him.\nIt is very evident there was a clerical error in recording the sentence on bill No. 15. There was not, and could not have been, a sentence upon bill No. 12, as a nolle prosequi had been entered thereon. We cannot discharge a prisoner, self-convicted of high crimes, upon such a bald technicality as this. At most, it was a mere slip or misprision of the clerk of the court below in recording the sentence. We therefore decline to allow the writ of habeas corpus, but we do so without prejudice to the petitioner\u2019s right to apply for such writ to the court of Elle county. We also order the record brought here upon the certiorari to be returned to the Court of Quarter Sessions, with leave to that court to amend its record as to justice shall be right.\nPetition dismissed.",

A convict in the penitentiary will not be discharged by the Supreme Court on writ of habeas corpus, where the records of his conviction show that the ground of his alleged illegal detention arose from the slip or misprision of the clerk in recording his sentence.\n2. In such case, the writ will be refused and the petition dismissed, without prejudice, however, to the petitioner\u2019s right to apply for such writ to the court in which he was convicted, and the records will be remitted with leave to that court to amend the same as justice may require.\nBefore Paxson, C.

That to this indictment your petitioner entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine of one dollar to the commonwealth and the costs of prosecution, and to undergo an imprisonment in the Western Penitentiary, by solitary confinement at labor, for the period of four years, to be computed from the expiration of the sentence in No. 12 November Sessions 1884, and to stand committed until sentence was complied with.\nThat your petitioner has been confined in the Western Penitentiary for the full period of four years, and that said period of four years was fully completed on November 19,1888.
