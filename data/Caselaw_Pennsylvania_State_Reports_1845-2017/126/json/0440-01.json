    "head_matter": "CHARLES L. HAWES v. JOHN L. O\u2019REILLY.\nERROR TO THE COURT OE COMMON PLEAS OE ERIE COUNTY.\nArgued May 3, 1889\nDecided May 13, 1889.\n1. In an action of trespass vi et armis for an assault and battery causing injury to the plaintiff, expenses incurred for medical aid, nursing, loss of earnings, etc., which were the natural results of the injury, may be recovered as damages.\n2. While in such action it may be more regular to set out such elements of damage in the narr, yet where the cause has been tried properly on its merits, a reversal will not be ordered because of the absence of such averments.\n3. \u201cThe first and second assignments are not in accordance with the rules. The third is assigned in such manner as to be insensible, unless we treat it as .part of the first and second assignments, which probably was the intention. If we consolidate the three assignments, we learn that some one was asked the question, \u2018 What was his bill ? \u2019 Whose bill is not stated.\u201d\nBefore Paxsox, CL J., Sterkett, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, J -T.\nNo. 895 January Term 1889, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 88 February Term 1888, C. P.\nOn December 10, 1884, John F. O\u2019Reilly issued a writ of capias in trespass vi et armis against Charles L. Hawes to recover damages for an assault and battery, and on January 5, 1885, filed a declaration averring:\n\u201cFor that the said defendant heretofore, to wit, on or about the 18th day of November, A. r>. 1884, in the city of Erie, in the county aforesaid, with force of arms made an assault upon the said plaintiff, and beat, wounded and ill-treated him, whereby and by means whereof the said plaintiff was cut, bruised and wounded on divers places on his head, limbs and body, and both bones of his left leg below the knee and near the ankle joint were fractured and broken, and the flesh of said leg at and near the point of said fracture was bruised and lacerated, and other wrongs to the said plaintiff did, against the peace and dignity of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and to the damage of the said plaintiff of five hundred ($500) dollars, and therefore he brings this suit.\u201d\nThe defendant pleaded, not guilty.\nAt the trial on December 7, 1888, the plaintiff introduced testimony showing, in substance, that he and the defendant becoming involved in a discussion, the defendant became angry, and threw the plaintiff out of his hotel, breaking his leg. The defendant, on his part, introduced testimony showing in substance that the plaintiff was a guest at his hotel; that lie became intoxicated, and was abusive, uncivil and insulting to the employees and guests of the house; that his conduct was such that defendant had ordered him to leave the house, and upon his refusal, had put him out, using no more force than necessary ; and that after plaintiff was put out, in attempting to turn round, he fell and in falling broke his leg.\nCertain offers of testimony on the part of the plaintiff were objected to by defendant and admitted. These offers are shown in the assignments of error.\nAt the conclusion of the case on the testimony, the court, Gunnison, P. J., after reviewing the evidence, and submitting to the jury the questions of fact as to how the injury was inflicted and who was responsible therefor, further instructed them:\n[If you find for the plaintiff you will assess the damages, and you can take into consideration the pain and suffering-occasioned to the plaintiff and the loss of earnings from the time of the occurrence until the beginning of this action, the 10th of December, from the 18th of November until the 10th of December.] 5 [And the testimony as to what he was earning; he says that he was earning $60 a month; take that into consideration from the 18th of November until the 10th of December; and take into consideration the amount of his bill at the hospital and his physician\u2019s bill for that time; not for the full time that he was at the hospital, but up to the 10th of December. That is the time he brought his action.] 6 He cannot recover for injury that he might sustain after the bringing of the action. The bringing of the action fixes the rights of the parties at that time as far as that was concerned. And if you find that the putting of the plaintiff out, although accompanied with unnecessary violence, was not done maliciously or wantonly, you would not be justified in giving any damages as a punishment to Mr. Hawes, \u2014 what are called punitive damages. [But if you find it was wanton and vindictive and malicious, and cruelly done, then you would have a right to give damages, which would be given to the plaintiff as a punishment to the defendant for having done it in that manner.] 7\nThe jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $500. A rule for a new trial having been discharged and judgment entered on the verdict, the defendant took this writ, assigning as error:\n5-7. The portions of the charge included in [ ] 5 t0 7\n1-4. The admission of plaintiff\u2019s offers, the specifications being as follows:\n1. The court erred in overruling the objection of the defendant to the following question and answer, and in admitting the evidence.\nQ. What were your expenses at tlie hospital ?\nObjected to, that there is no such allegation in the declaration ; that it is special damage and not the direct result of the assault and battery set out in the declaration, but which resulted as they say in consequence of the assault and battery, and of which there is no notice given in the declaration and which therefore cannot be proper.\nBy the court: We haven\u2019t any question as to the expenses consequent on the injury being competent. The objection is overruled: exception.1\n2. The court erred in overruling the objection of the defendant to the following question and admitting the evidence :\nQ. What was his bill ?\nObjected to, as before, as incompetent under the declaration and defendant objects to any expenses of this character.\nBy the court: Overruled; exception.3\n8. The court erred in admitting the following evidence :\nA. One hundred dollars.\nQ. How long were you incapacitated from earning anything?\nObjected to, as entirely incompetent under the pleadings; that it is not alleged.\nBy the court: The question In my mind is whether you can recover for any loss of time after the commencement of this action of trespass; if it was an action on the case it would be different. In this form of action the plaintiff may recover for the direct and natural damage sustained by him up to the time of bringing the action, and the loss of time up to that is direct and consequential. The objection is overruled ; exception.3\n4. The court erred in overruling the objection of defendant to the following question:\nQ. What were you earning at that time ? A. About $60 a month.\nObjected to as incompetent and irrelevant under the pleadings.\n\u25a0 By the court: Objection overruled, evidence admitted; exception.4\nMr. S. M. Brainerd, for the plaintiff in error.\nMr. J. Boss Thompson and Mr. S. P. Cfould, for the defendant in error.\nObserve, that in. none of these specifications of error is the name of the witness given, nor a reference to the page of the testimony where the offer and its connection may be found. See Battles v. Sliney, post, 400."
