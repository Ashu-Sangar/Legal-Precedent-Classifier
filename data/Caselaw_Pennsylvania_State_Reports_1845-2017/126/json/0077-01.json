    "head_matter": "APPEAL OF JOHN BEARMER ET AL. [Estate of Margaret Bearmer, Deceased.]\nFROM THE DECREE OF THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT OF LUZERNE COUNT y.\nArgued April 15, 1889\nDecided April 29, 1889.\n(\u0430) On an appeal to the Orphans\u2019 Court from the decree of the register refusing to admit a testamentary paper to probate and granting letters of administration, no issue was asked for by either party.\n(\u0431) The Orphans\u2019 Court upon the testimony adduced, found that the testamentary paper was the last will of the deceased, and decreed that it should be admitted to probate and letters testamentary issued thereon: from this decree an. appeal was then taken to tills court.\n1. In such case, as there was nothing before the Supreme Court but a question of fact upon which the Orphans\u2019 Court had passed, and the finding of that court having been based upon sufficient evidence, its decree would be affirmed and the appeal dismissed.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Steerett, Green, Williams and Mitchell, JJ.\nNo. 85 January Term 1889, Sup. Ct.\nOn February 16,1888, John Bearmer and George Bearmer, sons of Margaret Bearmer, deceased, filed a caveat to the probate of a paper alleged to be tlie last will of their mother. A bond was filed and a citation Issued. Testimony was taken before the register, who subsequently made a decree refusing to admit tbe alleged will to probate and granting letters of administration to Jolin and George Bearmer. Mary Mills, a daughter of the decedent and a beneficiary under tbe alleged will, tben took an appeal to tbe Orphans\u2019 Court, but no demand for an issue was made at any stage of tbe proceedings.\nFrom tlie evidence taken before the register, certified to tbe Orphans\u2019 Court by the agreement of tlie parties, and from the additional evidence adduced in tbe Orphans\u2019 Court, it appeared that the decedent died on January 17,1888, at 9:25 A. M.; that she left surviving ber four children, John and George Bearmer; Annie, the wife of Joseph Everett, and Mary, the wife of William H. Mills. Joseph Everett prepared the will, by which small devises and legacies were given to the sons, and the remainder of the estate to Mrs. Mary Mills. Mrs. Hoffman, a sister of the decedent and a subscribing witness to the will, testified that decedent had \u201c her mind to the last minute ; \u201d that \u201c in writing her signature she made a long stroke down and it did not look nice and her daughter Annie rubbed it out and I held her hand while she wrote it.\u201d\nAnnie Everett testified: \u201c Mother wanted me to tell my husband to write a will and I took it home and I told my husband what she wanted written. Mother and I were alone at the time she told me what she wanted in the will. She told me to tell my husband to give John Bearmer 30 by 25 feet of land and $100; there is a house on that land, some part of it is on it; 30 by 25 feet to George Bearmer and $100; and the home and the lot to Mary Mills, that is, the lot where she lives. She asked me if I was willing to give my share to Mary, my sister, and I said yes.\u201d The witness further testified that her mother was of sound mind when she signed the paper.\nDr. Edward Gumpert, a subscribing witness, testified that he attended the decedent in her last illness ; that about 8 o\u2019clock on the morning she died she had got a will made and requested him to sign as a witness: \u201c I told her I will read the will to her, and if she has heard it and no objection made, she might sign it. I read the will, and finishing, she said, \u2018 So shall it be.\u2019 T found her signature on it and I asked her, \u2018you should have waited till I come.\u2019 She answered me, \u2018 this is my signature.\u2019 She says particularly, \u2018 I could not die unless this sore is taken from my heart.\u2019 Her mind was completely clear. She interrupted me and got several phrases repeated from the will which convinced me that she was completely interested in the matter. Her physical condition was in such a state that she could converse about the matter. At her request I signed as a witness.\u201d\nThe court, Rhone, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nAs no one demanded an issue before the register he had no occasion to send the case to the Common Pleas, but on demand should have sent the case to this court. As the register chose to enter a decree, the parties had a right to appeal to this court, and it is our duty to take testimony now as if the case had been sent to us by order of tbe register: Wickersham s Appeal, 75 Pa. 334. Having taken the testimony and carefully considered it, we are obliged to reverse the decree of the register, because we have no doubt whatever the will in question was duly executed and the witnesses thereto were competent and honest.\nLet a formal decree be drawn declaring the will in question to have been duly executed and proven, and that the register make formal decree of probate, also revoking the letters of administration granted and appellees to pay the costs.\nA formal decree having been entered, John and George Bearmer took this appeal, specifying that the court erred [inter alia] :\n1. In directing probate to be made of a paper which was not the last will and testament of Margaret Bearmer, deceased, and in revoking the letters of administration on her estate, granted by the register.\n2. In summarily setting aside the exercise of a sound legal discretion by the register on a question of fact submitted to him, without awarding an issue.\n5. In not dismissing the appeal from the register\u2019s decree, there being no application made for an issue by the appellant on any disputed facts difficult to determine.\nMr. Michael Cannon, for the appellants.\nMr. J. Gr. Miller, for the appellee."
