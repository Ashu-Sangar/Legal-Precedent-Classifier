Harrison, Sr., died in 1932, leaving a will executed in 1926, the validity of which was sustained by us in <em>Harrison’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/316/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="316 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="1158982" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0015-01">316 Pa. 15</a>. He left all of his property to his son, Charles Harrison, Jr., but in a letter of even date with the execution of the will he requested the son to divide the estate equally with his sister, Mrs. John C. Brydon, according to the following directions, “I desire and expect that she shall be given $9,000 of the bonds of the Splint Fuel Company, regardless of their value; and that in determining what I have herein spoken of as the one-half of my estate you shall have $9,000, your own choice of any other part of my estate; and that you shall give her the furniture purchased and owned by me in the said John C. Brydon residence in Maryland at a valuation of $12,500; and that you, in carrying out this desire of mine, shall have $12,500 to be chosen by you from any other part of my estate. Upon these exceptions I have expressed my desire that you shall pay to her not exceeding one-half of the remainder of my estate.” In his first and final account as executor of his father’s estate, Charles Harrison, Jr., charged himself with the bonds referred to in the letter at $9,000 and with the furniture at $12,500. To this account his sister filed exceptions, claiming that the values stated were far in excess of actual value and not conclusive, in computing her share in the distribution of the estate as directed in the letter above quoted. The exceptions were sustained, but no final decree of distribution was entered. Thereupon, Charles Harrison, Jr., took an appeal to this Court. While retaining the appeal, we ordered the record remitted so that a <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>valuation might be made of property not yet appraised, and for the entry of a final decree of distribution. The record, completed in compliance with our order, is again before us. Distribution has been decreed between testator’s son and daughter, in equal shares of the actual appraised value, as of his death, of all of testator’s estate without regard to the values fixed by him on the bonds and furniture in the letter to his son and executor.</p>
    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[122,794,1153,1454]]]'>The distribution as decreed was erroneous. While the letter was not a part of the will, and was not probated as such, testator’s son, in view of his acceptance of the trust imposed upon him thereby, is bound to carry out its terms. This he remains willing to do. The intention of the testator is clear and must control. The furniture mentioned in the letter originally belonged to testator’s daughter and her husband and furnished their home in Maryland. When sold at execution for their joint debt testator bought it for $17,500 and left it in his daughter’s possession. Subsequently she sold a part of it for $3,500. An additional part was sold to pay storage charges in Baltimore. What remained was later removed to Scranton and used there by the daughter until it was sold after testator’s death under a landlord’s warrant for rent she owed. Although finding that it was “impossible to trace the value of this property through all these changing locations and circumstances” the court below estimated its value at $3,000 at testator’s death and so included it in arriving at the net value of the estate for distribution. The Splint Fuel Company bonds, originally bought by testator at the instance of his son-in-law, Mr. Brydon, were already in default in 1926 when testator mentioned them in his letter to his son. When he died they were entirely worthless. For this reason the court ignored them in allocating the shares on distribution.</p>
    <p id="b591-6" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[122,2264,1153,153]],["BL_592.1",592,[273,345,1155,1504]]]'>The net i*esult of the decree was to divide the actual value of the estate at testator’s- death equally between his son and daughter, deducting from the latter’s share <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>$3,000, the estimated value of the testator’s furniture when sold to pay her rent in Scranton. We think such distribution would be in complete disregard of the unmistakable directions of the testator. Regardless of subsequent decline, the testator has himself fixed the amounts to be charged against the daughter’s share in his estate. His Splint Fuel Company bonds, of the face value of $9,000, were to be given her at face “regardless of their value.” Similarly she was to take the furniture “at a valuation of $12,500.” It is contended by appellee that these provisions created demonstrative legacies in the amounts stated, payable primarily out of the items of property mentioned, but not restricted to them if their values be less. We do not think so. The gifts to the daughter are not of money in the sums named, but of the property designated, to be valued at fixed amounts merely in computing what corresponding share is to be taken by the son. That ultimate equality will not prevail is of no moment. For his own reasons testator provided that the daughter should have the bonds and furniture and that the son should select for himself property of the value of $21,500 prior to equal division of the remainder. Obviously testator intended by these provisions, manifestly equitable, to first secure to his son a sum equivalent to the fund expended in his daughter’s behalf and that of her husband during his lifetime. Only by such means could they be placed upon a parity in the distribution of his property.</p>

This result is brought about in the face of the first imperative provision of the will, reading as follows: “. . . expend whatever of my estate comes into your hands in such way as will be satisfactory and beneficial to your sister, Nellie H. Brydon; . . . give her from time to time as she may need it, or as she may ask it, so much and such part of the estate you receive under my will as will contribute to her maintenance and support, the maintenance, and care and education of her children, an amount not exceeding the one-half of the estate you receive. ...”</p>

W. 786</a>, the facts are in their legal signification much like the facts in the case at bar. There the testator had stated in his will that he desired that all his property should be divided equally between his wife and his daughter and then added, “to be divided between them as hereinafter indicated.” He then set apart to his wife certain property and set apart to his daughter certain property. Included in the property set apart to his <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>daughter was what was known as the “ J ones Place,” of the value, testator thought, of $14,329.83.

She brought suit to establish an interest of one-half of such loss, in the widow’s share. The court held that <em>since it was the intention of the testator to provide equally for his wife and daughter, the devises should he considered demonstrative rather than specific, </em>and the daughter was entitled to the relief asked.

Enc. Law, p. 15. The testator in executing this will evidently intended to make equal provision for the wife and daughter, and that his estate should be equally divided between them, and that one should not receive more than the other. In executing such intent he undertook to set aside to each certain described property upon which he placed a valuation, evidently having in mind the paramount idea that quantity and value was the controlling motive in making the division, rather than the gift of the thing devised. If the testator intended that the wife and daughter should share equally in his estate according to the value of his property, and in the pursuit of this intent he sets aside to each certain property, indicating what he believes to be an equal division, and, by reason of facts not known to the testator at the time of executing the will, the title to the property set aside to either devisee should fail, then to so hold the mention of the property that should go to each to be a specific devise would defeat the express intention of the testator to provide equally for both: <em>Armorer v.

The designation of the bonds or household goods at stated valuations was for the purpose mei'ely of indicating the most convenient means by which to discharge the legacy, or as a means of describing the amount of value of the gift, and equalizing the shares of his two children: <em>Wallis v.

It is manifest that he did not intend that her share in his estate should be limited to the bonds and household goods. Certainly, it cannot be successfully contended that the daughter was obliged to receive these worthless bonds and remaining household goods in satisfaction of her one-half share in her father’s estate. To so hold would practically disinherit his daughter and defeat the testator’s primary purpose and intention that his two children should each receive one-half of his estate: <em>Cooper’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/4/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="4 Pa. 88" data-case-ids="401904" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0088-01">4 Pa. 88</a>.” In <em>Coopers Estate, </em>thus cited by Judge Boose, this court refused to interpret a will in such a manner that two daughters would get everything and the other children nothing, “thus defeating the primary intent of the testator” (as the court said). The primary intent of the testator in the instant case to make equal distribution between his two children <em>is </em>defeated by the decision of the majority in this case.</p>

How this interpretation can be reconciled with the testator’s clearly expressed intent that after his death Mrs. Brydon should have “an amount not exceeding one-half of the estate” for the support and maintenance of herself and the support and maintenance and education of her children^ is, to me, inexplicable, for the interpretation leaves- Mrs. Brydon nothing but waste paper and a little furniture of negligible value for her “support and maintenance” and “the support, maintenance and education <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>of her children.” In my judgment, this entire record negatives the following statement in the majority opinion: “Obviously testator intended by these provisions [referring to the “bonds” and furniture], manifestly equitable, to first secure to his son a sum equivalent to the fund expended in his daughter’s behalf and that of her husband during his lifetime. Only by such means could they be placed upon a parity in the distribution of his property.” The daughter had nothing whatever to do with her father’s purchase of these bonds which, like many other bonds, ultimately proved to be worthless. These bonds belonged as early as 1910 to the bank of which testator was president. The bank was reorganized in 1910 and the testator purchased them from the old bank and had them in his possession for sixteen years at the time he made his will. At that time he believed them worth par (as appellant admits), though there had been a default in their interest payments. That the testator did not intend to penalize his daughter for anything her husband may have done is indicated in this record by a letter he wrote in 1931,. a year before his death, in which he said: “Nellie shouldn’t be punished for any of John’s mistakes.” I can find no “parity” or “manifest equity” in making a beloved daughter accept her bequest in worthless paper and almost worthless furniture as the equivalent of a son’s receipt of $21,500 in legal tender. If Mrs. Brydon’s legacy had been charged against $9,000 which the testator had (let us assume) in 1926 in a safe deposit box and at the time of his death the box was empty, could it be contended that Mrs. Brydon would have to accept the <em>emptiness </em>of that box as the equivalent of $9,000?

That the testator never for a moment had any such intention as that is proved by the fact that though his acual will dated May 29, 1926, formally gave all his estate to his son, he wrote <em>on the same dag </em>a letter to Ms son imposing a trust upon the <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>estate he should receive under the will, that trust providing for the daughter and her children <em>to the extent of one-half of the estate; </em>There is nothing in this record which gives the slightest support to the contention that a paper which has <em>no value whatsoever </em>can be used as payment of a legacy of $9,000 for which, when the testamentary paper was executed, bonds the testator, then believed were worth $9,000 were designated and set apart for its payment in carrying out a testator’s clearly expressed (and later repeated) <em>intention </em>that the legatee should have an <em>equal </em>share in the estate. As in the cases cited in this opinion and many others in the reports, such intention should be carried out so long as there are assets in the estate. Testator’s feelings toward his daughter never changed; his just intentions toward the natural object of his bounty should not be thwarted by the destruction in value of a part of his estate, for which destruction neither he nor the object of Ms paternal solicitude were in the remotest degree responsible. What the Court of Chancery of New Jersey said in <em>Johnson v. Conover et al., </em><a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.%20291" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="35 A. 291">35 Atl. 291</a>, 293, applies with full force to the case at bar: “The courts seem to go upon the ground that the testator is presumed to have intended to make a sensible and equitable disposition of his property; and <em>if the bequest is' to a person so related to the testator that the ademption of the gift could not have been anticipated by the </em>testator, <em>then the bequest will be held to be general to save it from extinction” </em>(Italics supplied.)</p>

Among the applicable canons, in addition to those already cited, are these: (1) “When [a testator] has expressed himself in ambiguous or doubtful language, the law will impute to his words such a meaning as, under all the circumstances, will conform to his probable intention and be <em>most agreeable to reason and </em>

Harrison, the testator, intended Ms daughter to have one-half of his estate. He unequivocally said so. The court below gave her one-half" of the estate. The majority decision gives her nothing. I think the decision of the <em>court below </em>conformed to the “pole star” of testamentary interpretation and should be affirmed.</p>
