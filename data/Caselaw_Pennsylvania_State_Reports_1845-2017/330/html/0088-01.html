He was convicted of murder in the first degree and the sentence of life imprisonment was imposed. A motion <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>for a new trial was refused and this appeal followed. The only assignment of error is that there was sufficient medical and other testimony to require an acquittal on the principal defense of insanity.</p>
    <p id="b123-3" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[153,571,1150,261]]]'>The question of defendantâ€™s mental condition at the time of the killing was for the jury. It was submitted to them upon a charge which fully and fairly stated the law. We have examined the record carefully and find all the ingredients of murder in the first degree present.</p>
