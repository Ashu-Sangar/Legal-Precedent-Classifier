L. 26, governs cases in which a public highway, other than a state highway or state-aid highway or county road is to be improved jointly by a county and a township or borough. These acts provide that no county shall appropriate and expend moneys for such improvement unless and until the supervisors of the township, or the council of the borough, shall have presented to the county commissioners a petition setting forth that a highway, or a section thereof, within the township or borough is in need of reconstruction or repair, and particularly describing it, and unless and until the application shall have been submitted to and approved by the State Highway Department.</p>

The Township of Luzerne recognized this. It desired to improve the East Fredericktown Road, and accordingly, in order to obtain assistance from the County, its supervisors presented the required petition to the county commissioners describing the road and asking for aid under the terms of the Act of 1919 and the <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>amendatory Act of 1921. The commissioners passed a resolution agreeing, on behalf of the County, to contribute fifty per cent of the cost of the improvement of this highway. The application was submitted to and approved by the State Highway Department, and bids were taken by the Township, but, on the advice of the State Highway Department, they were rejected as too high.</p>

What the township supervisors should have done in order to consummate this plan was to file with the county commissioners a new petition, or at least an amendment to the original petition, in accordance with the statutory procedure. This they failed to do. They went ahead with their plans, issued bonds to cover the cost, and let a separate contract for the improvement of each road. The work proceeded under the supervision of the State Highway Department. Prom time to time the County contributed funds by issuing vouchers bearing the legend: “To Fayette County’s share of the cost of construction of Luzerne Township Road,” these being made out directly to the contractor building the East Fredericktown Road; in this way the County paid a total of $71,408.50, which amounted to approximately half the cost of the improvement of that road. The Township claimed, however, that further sums were due by the County because, as it alleged, the supervisors, prior to the commencement of the work, had one day met the ■ commissioners on the Rush Run . Road, and at this informal meeting .the new plans for the two roads were discussed, the supervisors asked the commissioners 4o defray half the total cost, and the commissioners orally agreed that the County would pay $100,000 to<a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>ward the work on both highways. Accordingly the Township called upon the County to pay $28,591.50, the balance of the $100,000 claimed to have been thus promised. In response to this demand, the County commissioners passed a resolution appropriating $5,000 to the township supervisors as “county aid of Rush Run Road,” but further payments were refused, and the Township brought the present suit upon the alleged oral contract of the commissioners. At the trial, the making of such an agreement was not admitted by defendant, but the jury found for the Township, and the court overruled defendant’s motions for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v.</p>

The petition could have been favorably acted upon by an appropriation, or by a proper resolution of acceptance, and the petition and such a resolution would have fastened legal obligations upon the parties: <em>Greene County v.
