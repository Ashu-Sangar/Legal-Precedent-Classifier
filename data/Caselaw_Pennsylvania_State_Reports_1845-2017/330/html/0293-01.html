Defendant then appealed within the period allowed by the Act of March 30, 1921, P. L. 60, 12 PS section 1104, for appeals from such interlocutory decrees. The sole purpose of the Act allowing appeals in such cases “was to enable a defendant to have his liability to account finally determined before he should be put to the trouble and expense of stating an account, and [its] application is to be confined to that purpose”: <em>Rowley v. Rowley, </em><a href="/pa/289/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="289 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1103363" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0171-01">289 Pa. 171</a>, 174, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20226" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="137 A. 226">137 A. 226</a>. As defendant attached an account to its answer, no question for review under the statute remained at that stage of the proceeding: <em>Murphy v. Murphy, </em><a href="/pa/263/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="263 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1047449" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0196-01">263 Pa. 196</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.%20300" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="106 A. 300">106 A. 300</a>. The parties seem to have realized this, because leave was asked to remit the record for purposes of hearing pursuant to Equity Rule 67. On the return of the record, the learned court below filed an adjudication as if heard on bill and answer. To that adjudication defendant filed exceptions which were dismissed by the court in banc in an order stating “the decree nisi is directed to be entered as final and the record is respectfully returned” to this court. The decree is quite as interlocutory as it was when originally made in April, 1934.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Ordinarily, the <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>merits would not be reviewed until after final decree: see <em>Rowley v.

About April 9, 1928, he borrowed $6,000 from defendant bank, and, as part of the transaction, he and his wife conveyed to the bank certain real estate either to secure, as defendant claims, the repayment of that sum and also a preexisting debt in excess of $15,000, or, as plaintiff claims, the repayment only of the $6,000, interest and specified expenses.

The answer shows that the Trust Company has received full payment of its loan of $6,000, interest and expenses referred to. The seventh paragraph of the answer states: “Seventh. Defendant admits that the net rents, issues and profits from said real estate from April 9th, 1928, to date would have been more than ample and sufficient to repay to defendant any and all balances due on the aforesaid.loan, [of $6,000] but avers that by the terms of the trust agreement aforesaid, and at the request of William McCollum, part of the rents from the said real estate was applied to the payment of interest on the bond of William McCollum in the sum of $15,000, and payments on the note of the Braddock Lumber Company, referred to in paragraph three, and fire insurance on the premises covered by the mortgage in Swissvale, which was given to secure payment of the bond of William McCollum, as appears more in detail in the account of defendant attached hereto.”</p>
