    <p id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.7",68,[279,576,1151,685]]]'>Plaintiff <em>became </em>owner of a three-story business building in Scranton in 1936 at a foreclosure sale of a mortgage held by it, dated November 20, 1929. The second floor was occupied as a billiard room and bowling alley and the tenant proposed to take out the bowling alleys. The plaintiff filed a bill to restrain the removal, which the learned court dismissed, being of opinion “that the intention of the parties was, at the time the bowling alleys were placed in the building, that the same were to be treated as personal property.” The question is whether the defendants had the right to detach and remove them. The record contains a very meager showing of facts.</p>

In 1925 they demised the second floor to a tenant, described in the record as Brandt &amp; Kaplan, (composed of Michael Brandt and Nathan Kaplan) by a lease not in the record and said to have been lost, for the purpose of conducting a pool room and bowling alley. At that time the second floor was vacant, the building having just been completed.

He seems to have defaulted, as the next thing we find in the record is that, pursuant to a landlord’s warrant issued at the instance of Max Kaplan and Samuel Rosenthal on October 27, 1932, a constable sold “the right, title and interest of said Michael Brandt and Lackawanna Recreation Company in the said personal property ... to Max Kaplan for the aggregated sum of Three hundred ninety Dollars ($390.00).” The learned chancellor said “that the bowling alleys in question were severable from the freehold without material injury thereto to the building itself. ...” A list of the property sold included the seven bowling alleys. Max Kaplan, it will be recalled, was one of the owners of the fee.</p>

But instead of doing that, Kaplan, on March 8, 1933, sold his right, title and interest to the property purchased at the constable’s sale (and specifying the bowling alleys) to Monas Rosenthal for $1; apparently this was done with the acquiescence of the other freehold owner Samuel Rosenthal.</p>

The record does not show at what time in 1936 the foreclosure took place, whether during Marie Nebesky’s term or after it expired. We have, however, the averment in the bill, admitted in the answer, that the defendants, Max Kaplan and M. Rosenthal, were the tenants who threatened to remove the 'howling alleys. We do not know whether the pleader meant that Max Kaplan was the tenant of the first and third floors and M. Rosenthal of the second, or that they were co-lessees of the pool room and bowling alleys, and must therefore assume that the exact fact, so far as plaintiff’s case is concerned, is not material to the question raised. As the leases were made after the mortgage was recorded, they were of course subject to its lien, and the foreclosure ended the tenants’ term unless the purchaser elected to accept them. But as it appears, following the constable’s sale .to Kaplan of Brandt’s interest in the fixtures, that M.
