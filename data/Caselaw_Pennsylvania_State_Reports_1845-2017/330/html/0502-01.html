      <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>The record shows that the parties separated October 28, 1925, and that appellant’s husband has not contributed to her support since August 5, 1929, except under an order of the municipal court made on that date; that during the period from October, 1925, the parties have lived separate and apart with cessation of all marital relations. From their separation to the time of the hearing respondent contributed approximately $6,650 pursuant to an order in a non-support proceeding brought in the municipal court. When appellant’s petition was filed, respondent was in arrears $254 and, at the time of the hearing, $274, representing an arrearage period of slightly more than four months.</p>
    <p id="b539-5" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[121,1064,1153,581]]]'>In dismissing the petition the learned court below said that the Act of 1915 “makes no distinction between money voluntarily paid to the wife toward her support and money paid to her under an order of Court. The requirement of the Act is that the husband has not supported nor contributed toward the support of his wife for one year or more. The question of support is the controlling factor and we are of opinion that where the husband has contributed, either voluntarily or by order of Court, toward the support of his wife, she cannot be declared a feme sole trader.”</p>

The arrearage period of between four and five months<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> is of course less than the period of a year, which is fixed by the statute as one of the essentials to the granting of a feme sole trader’s certificate. The act also provides that it must appear “that the wife by her <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>own industry, or the joint industry of herself and her children, or by reason of an income from her own estate, has maintained herself or been maintained by her children.” The record is perhaps deficient in respect of that requirement. When inquiry was made of her concerning the source of her support other than that received from her husband she declined to state her earnings. “Q. In your petition you say that you and your child are maintained solely by yourself, and not by your husband. What business have you been engaged in to pay for the support of yourself and child? A. In what petition did I say that? Q. The one that you just filed in Court for the purpose of being declared a feme sole trader, paragraph 5. In what business have you been engaged so that you have been able to support yourself and child? A. In clerical work. Q. How much do you earn a week? A. I do not care to answer that.”</p>
    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.4",540,[291,1275,1152,968]]]'>■ The purpose of feme sole trader legislation is not punitive. Punishment for desertion and neglect to support is the subject of other legislation: Act of March 13, 1903, P. L. 26, 18 PS section 1256 et seq.; July 12, 1919, P. L. 939, 18 PS section 2159. A civil remedy is provided by the Act of May 23, 1907, P. L. 227, 48 PS section 131, as amended. Other familiar legislation provides for support orders, such as appellant obtained. As the effect of a feme sole trader declaration deprives her husband of the right to share in her property, as specified, the declaration should not be made unless conditions imposed by the legislature clearly appear in the record.
