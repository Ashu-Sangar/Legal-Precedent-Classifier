L. 581, 53 PS section 2901 et seq., entitled: “For the better government of cities of the first class of this Commonwealth”, commonly known as the Charter Act for Philadelphia. Four sections of Article XVII, P. L. 605, 53 PS section 3271 et seq., call for particular attention. Section 1 requires that, on or before the 15th day of October in each year, the mayor “shall furnish to the council” certain information in part based on information to be furnished to him by the city controller. Section 2 provides that council <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>shall be bound to accept estimates of receipts and liabilities furnished to the mayor by the city controller and shall consider the subject in open session, with reasonable opportunity to officers and citizens to be heard and, shall adopt, in one ordinance, by December 15th, a financial program for the ensuing year, as specified. Section 3 requires council to levy and fix the tax rate for the ensuing year on or before December 15th, subject to the conditions mentioned in the ordinance; the legislature specifically directed that “if the council shall fail to fix a tax rate on or before the 15th day of December of any year, the rate for the current year shall be the rate for the ensuing year. ...” Section 4 authorizes appropriations out of the estimated receipts and requires that “council shall appropriate, before the beginning of the ensuing year, a sufficient amount for the extinguishment of the floating indebtedness (other than that accruing within one year from condemnation of real property) which the city controller may estimate to be outstanding upon the first of January following, for the payment of all lawful obligations due by the city during the fiscal year commencing January first.” During the ensuing year, the controller must not countersign any warrants, except for sinking fund and interest payments, until council shall first have passed all appropriations necessary for the expenses for the current year of each city department, and within the estimated receipts from taxes and other sources except loans. No contract shall be binding without previous appropriation and no warrant shall be drawn for any expenditure without such appropriation; any warrant or contract otherwise issued shall be void. This section contains other relevant limitations as may be seen by consulting the section in the reporter’s statement.</p>

It also appears that “before the beginning of the ensuing year” (to use the words of the statute) the requii’ed <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>appropriations had not been made. On December 16th this proceeding was begun in the name of the Commonwealth, at the relation of the District Attorney, praying for a peremptory writ of mandamus requiring respondents to comply with the statute. An alternative writ was issued and a return was filed to which petitioner demurred. The learned court below, after hearing on the demurrer, dismissed the petition on the ground that the provisions of the statute were not mandatory. Immediately after the argument of the appeal, on January 24, 1938, we filed an order containing the following : <em>“It is </em>ordered and decreed that a writ of peremptory mandamus shall issue forthwith, commanding City Council on or before January 31,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> 1938, to adopt a budget and a financial program as required by law; writ returnable to this Court February 1, 1938.”</p>

This failure to adopt such a program was in clear violation of the law. The Act required the mayor, the city controller and council to comply with its provisions during 1937 so that obligations maturing on and after January 1, 1938, would be provided for. The legislature not only did not intend that the city should begin the ensuing year without provision having been made for the cost of the municipal government from January 1st on, but, in addition, had taken care to provide that if the tax rate was not fixed by December 15th on property then subject to taxation, the old tax rate should remain in effect. This mandamus proceeding called the attention of the learned court below to the default of the municipal authorities, and, as the statute clearly provided that no money could be expended after the first of January for running expenses, the learned court should have immediately granted the peremptory writ in order <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>that the municipal government from and after January, 1938, would have been provided for. The deplorable consequences likely to result from the failure to comply with the law might readily be imagined, but in this case it is unnecessary to deal with conjecture; the result of the default appears in the city controller’s petition. On January 28, 1938, the city controller, who, in default of the enactment of a budget before the end of 1937, was left without authority to countersign warrants for the payment of running expenses of the city government from and after January 1st, filed Ms petition in this court, asking leave to intervene and to be made a party in this case, and for an order authorizing him to approve the payment of expenses<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> necessary to maintain the city government from and after January 1st.

On the other hand, the learned city solicitor contends that the provisions are not manda<a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>tory but are merely directory or discretionary, and that the officers, or any of them, at pleasure may disregard the time specified by the legislature for the performance of the duties imposed on them. Construction is necessary only if the expressions used will bear two or more meanings. In applying a statute, it is first necessary to ascertain the meaning of the words used by the legislature; that meaning is matter of fact; having ascertained the meaning, the next step is to determine what the legislature intended should be their legal effect. The words used in the Charter Act have a commonly accepted meaning, about which difference of view seems impossible; if the words are given that meaning, there is no doubt they are mandatory: “the mayor <em>shall furnish”;</em>

The i*ate of taxation shall be fixed by December 15th; and this absolute direction is followed by a negative or alternative provision that in default of performance of that duty “the rate for the current year shall be the rate for the ensuing year”, with the additional consequence, for the ensuing year, that city “expenditures . . . shall be fixed and determined by the council so as to come within the estimated receipts from sources other than loans.” In other words, if the delegated officers do not fix the rate by December 15th, they are prohibited from doing so later, and, for the next year, expenditures from taxes on property then subjected to taxation are limited to the taxes at the old rate on that class of property.</p>

But as the learned court below was of opinion, and respondents’ argument is to the same effect, that the legislature, while using mandatory words, intended to vest power exercisable at discretion, we shall briefly examine the contention. It is said in respondents’ brief, that “the mere fixing of a time for the doing of a particular act, unless negative language is employed or unless an alternative consequence is provided for, is merely directory as to the time limit. ...” Now, as has been noted, the legislature not only used mandatory words, but in addition used the equivalent of “negative language” and also provided an “alternative consequence”. What could be more negative in effect or more completely “an alternative consequence” than declaring that for default in fixing a rate by December 15th, the old rate should apply for the new year and carry with it corresponding restrictions on expenditures? In addition, we must keep in mind that we are applying a statute providing for municipal government from year to year <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>without interruption and that every duty imposed was intended to be performed so that the municipal government might proceed from day to day without interruption.

The statute there involved declared that no debt or contract should be binding “unless authorized by law or ordinance, and an appropriation sufficient to pay the same be previously made by councils”. Plaintiff was employed as a clerk by the board of health at a salary fixed by the board at $2,000 a year; councils had appropriated only $1,400; it was held he could not recover more. The case therefore involved a contention that the contract of employment at the salary fixed by the board was enforceable notwithstanding the city’s failure to appropriate enough money to pay that salary. ShaksWOOD, J., said, p. 466, “Where the words are affirmative, and relate to the manner in which power or jurisdiction vested in a public officer or body is to be exercised, and not to the limits of the power or jurisdiction itself, they may and often have been construed to be directory; but negative words which go to the power of jurisdiction itself have never, that I am aware of, been brought within that category. . . .

L. 386, are words of positive prohibition.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The statutory provision involved in that case is not more prohibitive of action by council than the provision “If the council shall fail to fix a tax rate on or before the 15th day of December of any year, the rate for the current year shall be the rate for the ensuing year”, and this legislative intention, as applied to the whole financial program, is emphasized by the further limitation of expenditures during the ensuing <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>year to estimated receipts, as specified. Additional emphasis to the same effect is contributed by section 4 which contains a number of positive prohibitions on action by the controller and council. Moreover, if we apply the rule in the form “that whether a statute is mandatory or not depends on whether the thing directed to be done is of the essence of the thing required” (see <em>Deibert v. </em>Rhodes, <a href="/pa/291/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="291 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1107247" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0550-01">291 Pa. 550</a> at 554, <a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.%20515" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="140 A. 515">140 A. 515</a>; <em>National Transit Co. v. </em>Boardman, <a href="/pa/328/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="328 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1179724" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0450-01">328 Pa. 450</a>, 453, <a href="/citations/?q=197%20A.%20239" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="197 A. 239">197 A. 239</a>; <em>Tausig v. </em>Lawrence, <a href="/pa/328/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="328 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1179659" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0408-01">328 Pa. 408</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=197%20A.%20235" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="197 A. 235">197 A. 235</a>) we also reach the conclusion that the statute is mandatory, for unquestionably the integrity of the municipal government for 1938 depended on action in 1937 which is clearly what the statute provided.</p>

The controller, therefore, must perform a particular duty to enable the mayor to do his duty in order that council may complete the work of all three by adopting the next year’s financial program whether based on the old or on a new tax rate for the ensuing year; it is the joint product of the mayor, the controller and the council; the financial program must be adopted before the controller can authorize payment of expenses accruing on and after January 1st of the ensuing year.</p>

The return denied these averments and asserted that “No positive or certain certificate of estimated receipts and disbursements was . . . submitted . . .

The necessity for the continuity of local government is so obvious that the form of the statute will tolerate no excuse for nonperformance of the duty imposed; no alleged justification for default can be accepted. A municipal officer who omits to perform a governmental duty imposed on him by statute, assumes grave responsibility and by his failure may render himself liable to <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>indictment, prosecution, and on conviction, to removal from office: <em>Com. v. </em>Coyle, <a href="/pa/160/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="160 Pa. 36" data-case-ids="852213" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0036-01">160 Pa. 36</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20A.%20576" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="28 A. 576">28 A. 576</a>; <em>Com. v.

But the community is not dependent merely on the sanctions of the criminal law. The legislature intended to provide a system of municipal government that would not “breakdown”, as the controller, under oath, alleged, for want of the timely adoption of’ a budget. Failure to comply with the statute in this case<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> disabled or deprived the controller of his power to countersign payrolls for the 1938 running expenses, for payment of police, firemen and similar expenses, said to amount to several million dollars per month. The default of the city authorities does not render them immune from proceedings to require them to perform their duties. The legislature never intended that the City of Philadelphia should be without a government by mere default of its officers. The record shows that the city could not pay its running expenses for services beginning January 1st, with a resulting collapse in municipal government. If the default is of a character to justify prosecution, the criminal law may subject the defaulting officer or officers to indictments as indicated in the cases quoted above. Whether an action for damage will lie need not now be considered. But the Mandamus Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 345, 12 PS section 1911, furnishes a method; that employed in this case. Section 4, 12 PS section 1914, provides: “When the writ is sought to procure the enforcement of a public duty, the proceeding shall be prosecuted in the name of the Commonwealth on the relation of the Attorney General: <em>Provided </em>however, that said proceeding in proper cases shall be on the relation of the district attorney of the proper county: <em>Provided </em>further, That when said proceeding is <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>sought to enforce a duty affecting a particular public interest of the State, it shall be on the relation of the officer entrusted with the management of such interest. . . . ” In <em>Dechert, Controller of the City and County of Philadelphia, v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/113/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="113 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="457620" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0229-01">113 Pa. 229</a>, at p. 235, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.%20229" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="6 A. 229">6 A. 229</a>, Clark, J., said: “It is well settled that mandamus will lie to compel the performance by public officers of duties purely ministerial in their character, but it is equally well settled that as to all acts and duties necessarily calling for the exercise of judgment and discretion on their part, mandamus will not lie. Whilst the writ may perhaps be awarded to set the latter class of officers in motion, and to compel action upon the particular matters over which they may have jurisdiction, it will in no manner interfere with the exercise of that discretion nor control or dictate the judgment, or decision which shall be reached. It is unnecessary to quote authorities in support of this plain and well established principle of the law; such has been the uniform course of all the decisions, and in this case we do not understand the doctrine to be denied.” The court will not control discretion properly exercisable by the officer but it will require him to act in good faith in the circumstances. A peremptory writ was issued requiring the mayor of Philadelphia to perform his duty in <em>Chelton Trust Co. v. Blankenburg, </em><a href="/pa/241/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="241 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="976027" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0394-01">241 Pa. 394</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.%20664" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="88 A. 664">88 A. 664</a>, notwithstanding the fact that he asserted that he was acting in the exercise of discretion.
