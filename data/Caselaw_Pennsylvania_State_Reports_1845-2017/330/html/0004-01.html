His name and address were printed upon it and in the upper left-hand corner were printed the words “Sample H 14 W.B.” Maloney, in the presence of his daughter Margaret, aged 16 years, and son Thomas, Jr., aged 4 years, removed the wrapper of the package in the kitchen of his home in Wilkes-Barre Township and revealed the box. On prying open the lid of the box a violent explosion took place, which tore off his arm, blinded him, riddled his body with fragments of wood, paper and bits of metal. The explosion also severely injured the daughter and son above mentioned. Both Thomas Maloney, Sr., and Thomas Maloney, Jr., died as the result of the injuries so sustained. Maloney’s wife testified that her husband immediately after the explosion said, “Fugmann done this.” The admission in evidence of this declaration is the basis for the first assignment of error.</p>

Jones, a member of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, Luther Kniffen, a former sheriff of that county, Harry Gouldstone, a mine superintendent, James Gorman, Anthracite mine umpire, and Michael Gallagher. The bombs addressed to Judge Jones and Mr. Gorman were intercepted in the mails before delivery. The other three were delivered. The one sent to Mr. Kniffen was by chance opened in such a way that no detonation took place; the police intercepted the one sent to Mr. Gouldstone after it had been delivered to his home. Michael Gallagher was also killed by an explosion of a bomb when he opened the box addressed to him. All the bombs were wrapped in brown wrapping paper which a government expert testified as being identical (excluding the Gallagher wrapper of which no remnant was available for comparison).</p>
    <p id="b41-3" data-blocks='[["BL_41.4",41,[139,1341,1154,470]]]'>Defendant was arrested on July 1, 1936, and taken to the Wyoming Barracks of the State Police, where he was kept until a preliminary hearing was given him on the afternoon of July 7th. During his detention at the barracks, police officers made several searches of defendant’s home where some materials were found which the Commonwealth introduced in evidence for the purpose of identifying the defendant as the bombs’ manufacturer.</p>
    <p id="b41-4" data-blocks='[["BL_41.5",41,[140,1832,1153,587]]]'>The Commonwealth introduced evidence to show that the six bombs were deposited in United States mail boxes in the central part of the City of Wilkes-Barre, two each in different boxes, sometime between 4: 30 and 9:45 p. m., on April 9,1936. Each package was wrapped in a similar manner with brown wrapping paper and each bore, in the space usually employed for the return address, the pencil-printed symbol, “Sample H. 14 W.B.” Defendant’s handwriting experts agreed that the handwriting on the packages indicated beyond question that the same person printed them all.</p>

      <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>Defendant admitted that he secured a number of cigar boxes from two Schulte Cigar Stores in Wilkes-Barre about three to six weeks before the bombing; he claimed that he placed them in his car and that they were stolen from it when he parked it to go to the Osterhout Library in that city. He asserted that he wished to use these boxes as containers for small tools he had at home. The cigar box sent to Judge Jones was a “Seidenburg” and it contained on the bottom a number assigned exclusively by the manufacturers to boxes of cigars which were sent to the Schulte Warehouse for distribution to Schulte Stores. Likewise, the box sent to Gorman contained a carton number 56698, which was used in fifty instances by the Phillies Bayuk Manufacturer in sending boxes of cigars to the Schulte Warehouse in New York. Also, the Schulte Stores in Wilkes-Barre had a stamp in which they designated the months when they received their stock by the first twelve letters of the alphabet, representing the twelve months consecutively, the second symbol of the stamp being a figure representing the last figure in the year they were received. The “Harvester” box when received by Kniffen had a “0 6” stamped upon it, which was obliterated by processing, and the box addressed to James Gorman had, at the time it was introduced in evidence, the mark “C 6” still upon it. “0 6” indicated that the goods were received by the Schulte Stores in Wilkes-Barre in March, 1936.</p>
    <p id="b42-4" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[274,1862,1148,371]]]'>Edward Warden, a Schulte Cigar Store Manager, identified Fugmann as the man to whom he gave upon request “from three to five” cigar boxes on March 20, three weeks before the murders. Defendant admitted on cross-examination that he also obtained a “couple of cigar boxes” from a second Schulte Store in Wilkes-Barre, as well as “two or three” from Warden.</p>

However, he stated to the police at the Barracks on July 2nd that upon reading in the newspaper that one Joe Danowski, alias “Big Joe,” had committed suicide, he had told his wife that “Big Joe” was the man who had been near his [Fugmann’s] parked car when the cigar boxes were stolen from it. The police thereupon went to Fugmann’s home to check this assertion, and Mrs. Fugmann said that her husband had made no statement to her about stolen cigar boxes. On the witness stand she attempted to justify this discrediting of her husband’s statement to the police, by declaring that she “had the right to lie in her own home.”</p>
    <p id="b43-3" data-blocks='[["BL_43.4",43,[134,1224,1155,1181]],["BL_44.1",44,[270,351,1148,256]]]'>The Commonwealth also showed that Fugmann stated that while attending the funeral of Thomas Maloney, Jr. (who had died three weeks after the explosion), he left the funeral line to get a cigar box. As to this, the district attorney says: “With the entire valley and every police agency in northeastern Pennsylvania engaged in a canvass to elicit information concerning persons who might have gotten cigar boxes, he went in search of one at a time when the victim of a cigar box bombing was being buried, and he testified that he got one.” Where he got it he did not say. He claimed that this cigar box also was then stolen from his car during the funeral. He told a Mrs. Kennedy at the cemetery, on the day of the Maloney boy’s funeral, that he had a cigar box stolen from his car. The Commonwealth argues that all this was for the purpose of preparing “an alibi knowing that the police were making a complete search for persons who might have received cigar boxes and that he might have been remembered by the clerk in Schulte’s as receiving one or more boxes and he might thus later produce her as a witness to the fact that he had even before his arrest mentioned to someone that a <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>cigar box was missing from Ms car. His complete collapse, under cross-examination, as to tMs feature of the case robbed Mm of that alibi, as did also tbe fact that Mrs. Kennedy reported the fact to the police before his arrest.”</p>
    <p id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[271,626,1149,479]]]'>In 1933 and 1934 Maloney and Fugmann had been actively associated in a mine workers “seceding” union, which by 1936 had become defunct. As a motive for Maloney’s murder, the Commonwealth offered evidence that Fugmann’s former friendship for Maloney had been superseded by enmity, this arising in part from the fact that Fugmann had been unable to collect four hundred and sixty-five dollars owing to him (or his wife) by Maloney.</p>
    <p id="b44-5" data-blocks='[["BL_44.5",44,[272,1115,1150,1065]]]'>Defendant testified as to his whereabouts on the afternoon and evening of April 9th, during which time the bombs had been placed in the mail boxes. He asserted that he was at home during the afternoon and evening until 7 o’clock, when he drove his wife and daughter to church on South Main Street, Wilkes-Barre. After leaving them at the church at about 7:15 p. m., he said that he drove to the library, parked his car in front of it, went into the library to return some books and read until 7: 50 or 7:55 p. m., and then returned to church with his car for his wife and daughter. He said that he had to wait several minutes until 8 o’clock before the services were finished, when all three returned to their home, and that he did not leave his home during the remainder of the evening. Defendant’s wife and daughter and the minister of the church corroborated him as to the time of the services and the presence there of Mrs. Fugmann and her daughter. Defendant denied that he was at or near the vicinity of the receptacles in which the bombs were mailed.</p>

The <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>death-dealing box was divided into three compartments. In the right-hand compartment there was a flashlight battery glued to some small pieces of wood which in turn had been glued to the bottom of the box. A wire was attached to the battery and extended to a detonator placed in or near a stick of dynamite resting in the center compartment. There was also a quantity of loose powder or dynamite in the center compartment. In the left-hand compartment were portions of a newspaper. A piece of copper wire was glued to the inside of the lid of the box and was so arranged that when the lid was lifted slightly the wire near the battery would make contact with the latter, set off a spark which would be carried to the detonator, and thus cause an explosion.</p>

The explosive power of the bombs consisted of two kinds of “Monobel No. 8,” one being the “sprayed end,” manufactured by the Du Pont Company after March 14, 1935, and the other the “imsprayed end,” manufactured by it before that date. Two cartridges of “Monobel No. 8” “sprayed end” dynamite, i. e., the type manufactured after March 14, 1935, were found concealed in the coalbin of defendant’s cellar and six inches under a water pipe thereof. He denied knowledge of its existence. This type powder was exclusively used in Inman Shaft where he worked. The Commonwealth contends that the date of the manufacture of <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>the dynamite is significant because the type found in defendant’s cellar had not yet been created previous to his occupancy of that house.</p>

It was clearly made at a very short interval after the explosion, the time being that required by Mrs. Maloney to come down-stairs, where the kitchen was found filled with dust and smoke to the extent that to find Thomas Maloney she got on her hands and knees and crawled along the floor.

Since this utterance is made under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of the senses, and during the brief period when considerations of self-interest could not have been brought fully to bear by reasoned reflection, the utterance may be taken as particularly trustworthy (or, at least, as lacking .the usual grounds of untrustworthiness), and thus, as expressing the real tenor of the speaker’s belief as to the <em>facts just observed by him </em>[italics supplied]; and may therefore be received as testimony to those facts.” Spontaneous declarations as to the mere belief of the declarant are also admissible <em>when such belief is a fact in issue. </em>In the instant case the state of Maloney’s mind in respect to Fugmann was not a fact in issue and therefore his declaration of belief as to the defendant’s sinister design toward him, was not competent.

Maloney’s exclamation must have been a conclusion from something that had taken place between him and Fugmann some time before. As Wigmore says (Vol. 3, sec. 1750, page 751) : “The [spontaneous] utterance must relate to the circumstances of the occurrence preceding it.” Maloney’s utterance — so far as it involved Fugmann — did not relate to the circumstance of the occurrence (the explosion) which preceded it. It related to something which had preceded the explosion. (See <em>Agassiz v. Tramway Co., </em><a href="/citations/?q=21%20Wis.%20199" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="21 Wis. 199">21 W.

The solemnity attendant upon the one and the spontaneity of the other are mere avouchments of sincerity and not unchallengeable passports of admissibility.

For example, a defendant’s social or other affiliations might superficially relate to the “general event” of a certain crime, yet in a court of justice it would be inadmissible unless it possessed legally probative value.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> However, when the trial judge admits something in relation to “the general event” and at the same time or later in his charge instructs the jury that such evidence is “not any measure of proof of a defendant’s guilt or innocence,” it must be taken for granted <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>that the jury obeys the instruction and that therefore the admission of what was legally inadmissible evidence was <em>harmless </em>error.

There is no standard by which the effect of such formally “sterilized” testimony on the minds of the jury can be gauged. In <em>theory </em>the law intends that no testimony shall have any but a logical effect on jurors’ minds; in practice, nearly all testimony has both a logical and a psychological effect in varying ratios. The law intends that no witness’s testimony shall make any appeal except to the jurors’ reasoning faculties; in actual practice, a witness’s testimony sometimes makes more of an appeal to the emotions than to the reason. For example, in a murder trial, the victim’s widow may testify to some relevant fact of only minor importance while her very appearance before the jury may arouse the jury’s feelings against the defendant. On the other hand, the appearance of the defendant’s wife on the stand may by awakening the juror’s compassion for her, help the defendant’s cause far more than does her testimony. These only illustrate the human limitations on the practical administration of justice. The ideal of decisions based on clearly proved <em>facts </em>synthesized into judgments by coldly logical processes is — like most ideals — one that may be constantly approached but never reached.</p>

You must also determine that the handwriting on the Maloney bomb is the handwriting of Michael Fugmann; and these bombs are in evidence only because the Commonwealth urges that all these matters were in close relation, that the person who made one of them, or made those that were recovered, was necessarily in a fair conclusion from the evidence the person that made the others, and <em>it is for that reason alone </em>[italics supplied] that you have the right to consider what he found on those bombs.” The court gave similar instructions as to the nails and the wood with which the various bombs were made and the paper that <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>was used to wrap these bombs, which was similar to the paper found in Fugmann’s home.

This part of the charge standing alone is erroneous: <em>Com. v.

However, a few lines before the criticized excerpt italicized by the appellant in his paper book, the trial judge stated to the jury: “It might be that good character by itself would be sufficient to raise in your minds a reasonable doubt as to whether a person who has earned that reputation would be likely to perpetrate the type of offense with which he is charged.” Furthermore the court affirmed the defendant’s “seventh point” which reads as follows: “Evidence of good character is substantive evidence and not a mere makeweight introduced into a doubtful case. It may of itself create a reasonable doubt' and thereby produce an acquittal.” In considering the charge as a whole on the subject of good repute, we think the jurors clearly understood that if they found as a fact that the defendant had possessed a reputation as a peaceful, law-abiding citizen before being charged with the crime named in the indictment, and if this fact either standing alone or with all the other evidence in the case generated in their minds a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt, he was entitled to the benefit of it and should be acquitted. Defendant’s counsel were apparently satisfied with the affirmation of their “seventh point,” for they asked for no further instructions on the effect of “character testimony.” This assignment is overruled.</p>

If the jurors found beyond a reasonable doubt that Fugmann addressed the package which contained the fatal bomb and that no ex<a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>planation was made indicating that he did so in ignorance of the package’s deadly contents, they would have a right to <em>infer </em>either that he alone schemed and contrived the instrumentality and mailed it or that he, with a felonious intent, participated in that criminal undertaking, all with the intent to take the life of the addressee. If Fugmann addressed this package <em>without knowledge of its lethal character, </em>he could have said so. The excerpt complained of contains the qualifying words “if unexplained.” Under the circumstances here present it is permissible for a jury to infer the criminal intent of an addresser. The felonious connection of a defendant with the death of a person who received through the mails a deadly poison in a package alleged to have been addressed by him, was inferred by the jury in the case of <em>People v. Molineux, </em><a href="/ny/168/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="168 N.Y. 264" data-case-ids="2299526" data-case-paths="/ny/168/0264-01">168 N.

In that case the similarity between the handwriting on the “poison package” and the defendant’s handwriting was the basis of the conviction obtained. (The judgment was reversed on other grounds.) As to the probative value of proof of handwriting in criminal cases, see <em>State of New Jersey v. Bruno Hauptmann, </em><a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.%20809" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="180 A. 809">180 A. 809</a>. In that case the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey; in an opinion by Mr. Justice Parker, said, after referring to the identification of the handwriting on all the ransom notes, including the one left on the window sill of the nursery window, as that of the defendant, Hauptmann: “It is an inescapable inference that the writer of the ransom note on the window sill entered the nursery and perpetrated the crime.” In the case at bar Fugmann, instead of attempting to “explain” what the Commonwealth charged was his “handwriting” on the explosive package, denied it. This only emphasized its significance if the jury found it to be his. County Detective Kichard Powell testified that on the second of July, 1936, the day after Fugmann’s arrest, when he showed him the labels of the boxes containing the bombs which had been addressed, respectively, to <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>Judge B. B. Jones, Harry Gouldstone, James Gorman and Luther Kniffen, and called his attention to the printing of the names and addresses, he said that “it was his printing, that he would go down to the Courthouse and tell Judge Valentine that it was his printing, but that he did not put it there.” The witness stated that Fugmann repeated this “at least a half a dozen or a dozen times.” This assignment is overruled.</p>

At the close of the charge he invited suggestions from respective counsel as to “anything further.” The reply of defendant’s counsel was merely a request for a “general exception” and an inquiry as to whether handwriting charts were to be sent out with the jury.

Professor Arthur Koehler of the Forest Products Laboratories at Madison, Wisconsin, an expert of national repute, testified that the wood in the crosspieces in the deadly cigar boxes matched the wood found in Fugmann’s cellar, that the wood found in this cellar and that used in the crosspieces had been cut within “close proximity” of each other on the same machine in a saw mill, that they had been stapled in the same staple-cutting machine, and that other tests, indubitably showed that they had the same origin. Stanley B. Keith, a metallurgical engineer, and a nail expert of undoubted qualifications, testified that the nails used by the maker of the bombs as auxiliary nails in fastening the lids were identical with the nails found in the steel cabinet in defendant’s cellar and also in the shoes belonging to defendant which the latter had personally repaired. These nails “matched one another with microscopic accuracy.” The witness also testified that the nails found in defendant’s home had been made by the same machine and the same dies as the nails found in the boxes which contained the bombs. A glue expert, Dr. Elwin E. Harris of the Forest Products Laboratories at Madison, Wisconsin, testified that the glue <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>which was used in the insertion of the crosspieces of the bombs and on the copper wire leads was “a peculiar fish formula, to wit, Rogers Glue.” From the premises of defendant was taken a kitchen chair which had been repaired by glue. This glue the defendant received from a carpenter in the Hess Goldsmith Silk Mill. When defendant was arrested and asked if he received a quantity of glue from this carpenter, he denied knowledge of any ,such person or recollection of receiving any glue from him. Later, when the carpenter was brought before the defendant, he remembered the incident but said that the name of the man had been mispronounced and he did not recall it. The glue which was given to defendant by this man was “Rogers Glue.” We have already referred to the expert testimony as to the type of powder used in these bombs being of the same type that was found concealed on defendant’s premises. Experts called on behalf of the Commonwealth revealed a high degree of competency and their testimony was of great probative value. The sixth assignment is overruled.</p>
    <p id="b62-4" data-blocks='[["BL_62.4",62,[265,1442,1150,792]]]'>The seventh assignment is based on the fact that two alternate jurors were used as provided by the Act of May 1, 1935, P. L. 127 (17 PS 1153). Appellant argues that the use of these alternate jurors “constituted a violation of defendant’s constitutional right.” The argument of appellant on this point is as follows: “The Constitution guarantees that ‘trial by jury shall be as heretofore, and the right thereof remain inviolate’; ... it was the established custom and practice to keep the twelve jurors together in a capital case, from the time they were impanelled until their discharge after verdict rendered. The reason for it is plain. It was deemed prudent that in a case where life or death was the issue, all danger of external influence upon a jury’s verdict should be removed.”</p>

It does not import rigidity of <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>regulation in the manner of impanelling a jury. The cardinal principle is that the <em>essential features </em>of trial by jury as known at the common law shall be preserved. The fundamental law preserves the substance of the right; details of administration which leave the enjoyment of the right unaffected are of no constitutional concern. The right to trial by jury has sometimes been figuratively referred to as “the jewel of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.” The challenged act of assembly leaves the “jewel” untouched and undimmed and affects only its “setting.” The essentials of a trial by jury of a defendant in a criminal case as known at the common law were: (1) a jury composed of twelve<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> eligible persons duly summoned, sworn and impanelled for the trial of the issue; (2) a plea entered; (3) an ample right of challenge both for cause and peremptorily, secured to defendant; (4) a full, fair and public trial “under the superintendence of a judge empowered to instruct them on the law and to advise them on the facts, and (except on acquittal of a criminal charge) to set aside their verdict if in his opinion it is against the law or the evidence”: <em>Capital Traction Co. v.

We have no doubt they talked and discussed with the twelve jurors during the trial.”</p>

It could as logically be argued that since under our Constitution the essentials of trial by jury at common law must still be vouchsafed a defendant in a criminal case and since at common law jurors could not “eat or drink or have any eatables about them, without consent of court, and before verdict,” the appellant in the instant case did not have the trial by jury he was entitled to because the jury may have been served with food and drink during their deliberations and without the court’s permission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In reading this record one is impressed not only with the convincing character of the Commonwealth’s proof but also with the apparent lack of candor and truthfulness in the defendant’s testimony. Eor example, his explanation as to why he secured four or five cigar boxes three weeks before this homicide does not appear to “fit the facts.” He declared he wanted the boxes for his “small tools.” When asked why he did not keep these tools in his cabinet containing five or six drawers, he replied: “I don’t know.” When asked, “What kind of tools did you use?” he replied, “I got nuts and that stuff out of my car.” Later he said he also had “small nails.” He admitted under cross-examination that he “had these tools for about six years” and yet when asked: “You didn’t look around for cigar boxes until about three weeks before this bombing?” he answered: “No.” His explanation as to the flashlight batteries found in his home (similar to the batteries used in the bombs) was also unsatisfactory. He admitted that they did not fit his flashlight and that when he bought the batteries he did not take his flashlight along to fit the batteries into it. He also admitted that he had obtained several sheets of “brown wrapping paper about three feet square” from Richard Stroshal, that he took them home and then did not see the paper any <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>more.

The record shows that Fugmann and Maloney had formerly for a considerable period been on very friendly terms, Fugmann frequently visiting Maloney’s home, and that these friendly relations had later given way to hostile feeling on the part of Fugmann. A fellow workman of Fugmann testified that in February, 1935, the latter had told him that Maloney had put “three sticks of dynamite on his [Fugmann’s] porch” and that Fugmann said: “There is nothing too dirty for me to do to that dirty rat.” Proof of motive or of adequate motive is, of course, no essential part of the Commonwealth’s case when a conviction for crime is asked for: <em>Com. v.
