This hearing lasted until July 27th, when 2,400 pages of testimony had been taken. The injunction was continued and September 7th was fixed as the date for final hearing. On August 5th, defendants appealed to this Court. The right to appeal was challenged by appellee in a motion to quash. The reasons assigned were that as the appeal was from the order continuing the injunction made July 27th, it was from an interlocutory decree and the questions that might be raised on appeal from the granting of the preliminary injunction were thus waived: <em>Chiswell v.

Moreover, defendants by joining in the hearing, and participating fully in cross-examining at length the witnesses, might well be said to have waived the right of appeal from the original order. However, we will not at this time decide the motion to quash.

This is the rule in any case. It is equally clear, however, that where it appears that the challenge to the constitutionality of a statute which on its face imposes a heavy penalty for failure to obey its mandate is in good faith, and where the evidence purports to show a need for relief from allegedly exorbitant, oppressive and illegal exactions of money to comply with the mandate pending judicial determination, and where no existent rights are prejudiced, then under Sections 1, 9 and 11 of Article I of our State Constitution, and under the due process clause <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>of the Federal Constitution, it is not only the right, but the duty of the court to stay the operation of the penalties, and the law itself, until its constitutionality has been determined.

While many of the averments are general, of their nature they must be so. It is not necessary that the bill should recite the evidence or go into detail on each particular matter proposed to be proved. There are sufficient substantive averments on which appellee may predicate its case and adduce testimony in support thereof. Appellants dwell too seriously on appellee’s use of the words “apparent” and “likely” in referring to the consequences of the law. There could have been no doubt in appellants’ mind of the charges made against the act. A moment’s reflection will show that the use of the words was cautionary. They do not lessen the import of the allegations or the charges against the Act, nor detract from the inferences to be drawn therefrom, and the effect thereof on appellee’s railroad system from an operating and financial standpoint. Principally, the bill charged that the legislation would deprive appellee of property without due process of law in violation of the Bill of Bights of our Constitution, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, in that the regulations are arbitrary and unreasonable, and not in furtherance of the purpose stated in the title of the Act. The requirements were also stated to impose an undue burden on interstate commerce.</p>

The penalty provision of the Act clearly causes persons affected thereby to come within the protection of our Bill of Bights and the due process clause of the Federal Constitution. See <em>Oklahoma Operating Co. v.

Appellee, as it has pointed out, was at the outset faced with two alternatives, either that of complying with the Act and expending large sums of money which it could never recover even if the Act should be ultimately held invalid, or of ignoring the Act, and incurring heavy penalties which also it might never recover. The remaining possibility and obviously the only just and proper one under the circumstances is to have the enforcement of the Act restrained pending determination of the question of its validity. On principle of fairness and equity every citizen has a right to judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation which it is alleged takes from him without compensation his property, and he has the further right to have that question determined before these rights are swept from him. Any court denying this great prerogative denies the most elementary principle of justice. The opposite rule <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>is that of absolutism in legislative or executive bodies, which cannot be accepted.</p>

Reference is made to the decisions of this Court in <em>Suermann et al. v. Hadley et al., </em><a href="/pa/327/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="327 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1176710" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0190-01">327 Pa. 190</a>, and <em>Stewart et al. v.

The legal issues in those cases arose solely from statutory interpretation and not from factual considerations. The issues were evolved from the acts themselves. But this challenge against the constitutionality of the Full Crew Act depends entirely on facts. We cannot determine whether the Act is confiscatory, unreasonable and arbitrary, or whether it does not reasonably tend to promote safety, until facts are presented to show the existence of any of these effects. Prima facie, the Act is valid and must be so considered by us until its invalidity appears. Whether the measure promotes safety, or has a tendency to do so, must indubitably turn on facts and circumstances regarding that subject, and the relation which the provisions of the Act bear to safety. An analysis of the statute and the statute’s requirements is necessary; we must compare these with the incidents of transportation, including the causes which create the need for safeguards, and the methods now employed to obtain the safety of the public and employees. When the result is reached, if it is found the statutory protection is of such slight consequence, or is so incidental as to cause the provisions of the Act to be wholly impractical, and not in promotion of the safety it seems to strive for, then its operation would be unreasonable and arbitrary. This situation could only be developed by evidence. In these circumstances, of course, it would be error to refuse to hear evidence: <em>Borden’s Co. v. Baldwin, Commr. et al., </em><a href="/us/293/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="293 U.S. 194" data-case-ids="3929520" data-case-paths="/us/293/0194-01">293 U.

If we are to assume that any increase in the number of employees on a train insures safety, per se, regardless of any other consideration, then all such legislation is valid regardless of its consequences to the railroad, its travelers and the public in general. Safety is a relative term. Absolute safety can never be insured, and comparative safety is attended by certain necessary elements of disadvantage which must enter the comparison.

The state court had held, as the Commonwealth here contends, that the statute on its face was a constitutional exercise of the police power, and since the legislature’s determination of the wisdom of the measure was final, courts could not consider whether the Act was burdensome or unreasonable in its application to complainants. This position was repudiated by the Supreme Court. Appellee’s evidence shows that it will cost the railroad about $4,500,000 annually to carry out the provisions of this Act in the State. It is urged, not <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>without merit, that the speculative advantage to safety through the introduction of additional human agencies is so highly problematical and uncertain, that the expenditure of this sum each year for that purpose out of the net annual income for the Pennsylvania region is unreasonable and arbitrary.</p>

When state laws destructively approach this exclusive sphere of Federal control, it is then that supervision by the commerce clause must become effective, otherwise local regulation will become the rock upon which all interstate commerce power will break.

This important consideration should never be overlooked. Today the railroad transportation system of America, faced with automotive competition, has reached the point where its financial position is precarious. This fact must be considered in determining the relative cost to appellee of compliance.

Some of the requirements are new to Pennsylvania, and some have never been considered by the Supreme Court of the United States in any case. Furthermore, the record shows that conditions upon which the Act must operate have changed since 1911. It is well settled that where a law depends upon the existence of a certain set of facts to uphold it, if the facts change, then, though valid when passed, it may be invalid under the altered facts and circum<a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>stances: <em>Chastleton v.

The Supreme Court said in <em>Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. R. R. Co. v. Walters: </em>“A statute valid when enacted may become invalid by changing conditions to which it is applied. The police power is subject to the constitutional limitation that it may not be exercised arbitrarily or unreasonably. Unless the evidence and the special facts relied upon were of such nature that they could not conceivably establish that the action of the State [was] . . . arbitrary and unreasonable, the State Supreme Court obviously erred in refusing to consider the evidence.” The span of years has marked revolutionary changes in transportation. What may have been necessary for safety in 1911 may not be necessary today. Furthermore, the question of costs of compliance under the present statute, compared with the cost under the Act of 1911, is very important. In 1911, full crew regulations required this appellee to expend approximately $484,000 annually. Competition today from the different modes of transportation has resulted in a great depletion of revenues to rail carriers, yet with these diminished revenues the cost of appellee’s compliance with the Act of 1937, in Pennsylvania alone, is alleged to be over $4,500,000 per year. There was no alternative for the court below but to consider the testimony. The <em>Ewing </em>case is not controlling.</p>

The cost of this program for appellee’s entire system -is stated to exceed $280,000,000, of which approximately $122,-000,000 was spent in this State.

These combined with automatic detectors for dragging equipment, adopted in 1936, are designed to protect against running accidents from these causes. Finally, dangers attendant upon rock slides have been met by the erection of slide protection fences which give automatic signal warnings when slides occur. This is a comparatively recent development in transportation safety, and has been in use by appellee since 1926.

It is also shown that there is no safety purpose to be served by the requirement of Section 2 for a motorman’s assistant on multiple unit suburban electric trains. The need for an extra brakeman on passenger trains of 5 or more cars under' Section 2 is likewise shown as useless.
