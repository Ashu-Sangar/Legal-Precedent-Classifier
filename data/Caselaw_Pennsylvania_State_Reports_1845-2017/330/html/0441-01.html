However, she expressly reserved her right to use one-half of the mansion house and one-third of the adjacent garden. These agreements were recorded.</p>

He assured her that none of her rights would be destroyed by signing, but would be protected; further, unless she signed, he would commit suicide. Appellant signed this instrument, June 20, 1927; it was recorded the next day, and by it all her rights in the farm and mansion house under the will, as modified by the agreements of 1916 and 1917, were postponed to the lien of the above mortgage just as though she had personally joined in it, with the express understanding that she was waiving her rights only to that extent, and reciting as consideration the funds paid and to be paid to her son and daughter-in-law under the terms of the already recorded mortgage. At the end of the lengthy document is the following sentence: “All rights which I may have under the Last Will and Testament and the agreement and supplemental agreement hereinabove referred to are to remain in full force and virtue.”</p>

In 1936, this bank conveyed the property to Millie M. Kepler, Aaron’s widow, who thereafter mortgaged it to the Federal Land Bank of Baltimore and the Land Bank Commissioner of Baltimore, the remaining appellees. Since the death of her husband, Millie M. Kepler has kept possession of the entire farm, except for the portion of the house and garden which appellant has never surrendered.</p>

She alleges the mortgages violate the restrictions of the will, and the agreements were without consideration and fraudulently induced. Appellees filed preliminary objections to the bill which were sustained; the bill was dismissed because appellant was guilty of laches and ratified or confirmed all of the instruments; the bill was also held multifarious.</p>
    <p id="b478-5" data-blocks='[["BL_478.5",478,[268,1318,1152,749]]]'>A provision in a will making it a condition precedent to the devise that the farm and mansion house be inalienable and not subject to encumbrance is an unlawful restraint against alienation and void; the property passes without restriction.

There can be no doubt under the language used. She did “remise, re<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>lease, quit-claim, and discharge”; she gave up all her interest in that income. In return for this, her son bound himself, his heirs, executors and assigns' to pay her a fixed sum annually. It became the personal obligation of the son and was not equivalent to her interest under the will. It constituted a valid consideration for appellant’s surrender of her interest in the income. Appellant, however, was to continue to have possession of a portion of the house and garden.</p>
    <p id="b479-5" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[146,860,1152,1462]]]'>The allegations of fraud relating to these two agreements merely state that appellant’s son made false statements to her to induce the execution of the agreements. It is not enough to allege a legal conclusion that there has been fraud; the facts constituting the fraud must be clearly and explicitly set forth in the bill of complaint. Otherwise a demurrer or preliminary objections will be sustained: <em>Rice v.

Moreover, the Ohio Land Bank, and appellees who claim under it, would not be bound by any fraud of appellant’s son in the absence of notice. The mortgage of May 1, 1927, covered not only the son’s interest under the will but also appellant’s life interest in the income from the farm, which he had acquired. An innocent mortgagee for value is not bound by secret liens or equities even though the mortgagor’s title was obtained by fraud: <em>Puharic v. Novy, </em><a href="/pa/317/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="317 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="8845549" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0199-01">317 Pa. 199</a>; <em>Haggerty v.

The land bank gave valuable consideration for the son’s mortgage. Since fraud as to the agreements of 1916 and 1917 was not adequately alleged, and since fraud not of record and unknown to a bona fide mortgagee for value does not bind him or subsequent takers, appellant is not entitled to have these two agreements set aside, under the pleadings as now drawn.</p>

The instrument expressly referred to the mortgage as the consideration for the agreement. While not necessary to the decision, it may be pointed out that, in the light most favorable for appellees, the agreement was equivalent to a mortgage to the land bank of appellant’s life estate in the house and garden. No particular form of words is necessary for a mortgage. It is sufficient that the instrument is in writing, signed by the owner of the particular property or interest mortgaged and specifying the debt for which it is security. In substance, consequently, appellant mortgaged the interest to the Ohio Pennsylvania Bank, even stating that it should be treated as though she had joined in the earlier mortgage executed by her son and daughter-in-law. While the last sentence in the instrument would not cut down its effect as a mortgage, the language does on the surface appear contradictory; the writing taken as a whole indicates that she reserved such rights under the will as were not expressly surrendered or postponed by all the agreements.</p>

The rule is that, where a mortgage is given solely as security for an antecedent debt, and the mother’s last agreement was such a mortgage, the mortgagee takes subject to all equities, including fraud, here the son’s misrepresentation.

A different result would follow if some new consideration accompanied the subsequent mortgage, as, for example, an extension. Such consideration will not be inferred.

The covenant recorded by the son a number of days afterward does not constitute appellees purchasers for value.
