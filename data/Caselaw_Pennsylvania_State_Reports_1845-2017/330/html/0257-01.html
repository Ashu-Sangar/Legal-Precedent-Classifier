The victim was Esther E. Ebbert; the instrumentality was an electrically driven wringer attached to an electric washing machine. The two rollers of the wringer were equipped with a “release bar” marked at each end “Touch Release,” which when pushed doAvn by human touch was designed to cause the rollers to spring apart four or five inches to release anything caught therein. Its status in this case is that of a “safety device.” Mrs. Ebbert’s finger tips were drawn between the rollers while she was “feeding” a bathrobe into the rollers. She pressed the release but the “safety device” failed to function and her entire hand was drawn between the rollers and severely injured. She and her husband then brought this suit against the defendant, a retail dealer, the wringer’s vendor. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Mrs. Ebbert in the sum of $1,000 and in favor of the husband in the sum of $108.

The negligence charged was (a) “in selling . . . a washing machine and wringer which was mechanically and inherently dangerous, in that the shuttle in the safety device . . . was bent, out of line, so that it did not engage one arm of the device which released the rollers; (b) in failing to inspect the wringer . . . for . . . easily discoverable mechanical defects before delivering the same to the plaintiffs; (c) . . .; (d) . . .; (e) in inducing plaintiffs to purchase the machine and wringer by making unfounded and false warranties and representations as to its mechanical perfection and safety upon which . . . the plaintiff, Esther E.

The machine contained two of these bars, each connected with a safety catch at opposite ends of the enclosed chamber. If the device functioned properly the cam shaft would draw these bars towards the center releasing the safety catch at each end, which in turn removed the pressure from the top roller and as a result the roller sprang upward. But as on one end the cam shaft was “bent so far away that it did not engage with the rod” the pressure was released from <em>only one end </em>of the roller and as a result this end sprang up one-half inch while the other end remained tight against the lower roller. The witness stated further that it would not be possible to bind the cam shaft into the improper position it was in without the use of tools. No tool marks were visible on the cam shaft. He said the defect he found “looked to” him “as though it is a defect in the manufacture.” He was asked on cross-examination to account for the fact that the safety device worked at the time of the sale demonstration but did not work on the date of the accident. He replied: “That is possible. If you hit it hard, it might jar it loose on one side.” He was asked as to “the possibility that there was some wear in there and it would release at one time and not at a subsequent time.” He answered: “I do not believe it, but you might hit it <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>there and it not being engaged, and the next time it would be pulled down.”</p>

He was asked: “What instruction do you give the salesmen? A. We ask the salesmen to instruct the customer, the buyer of every washer, about its use, and that includes the touch release.” There was offered no testimony as to whether or not the washer in question was in proper working order when it was sold to the plaintiffs. Judge Brown in refusing defendant’s motion for judgment n. o. v. said: “The chamber containing the safety device was open at the bottom and a mere glance at the cam shaft would have disclosed the imperfect condition.”</p>

Appellant says: “A washer and wringer are not appliances that are inherently dangerous and injury results only when the user fails in precaution.” The phrase “inherently dangerous” is found in many reported cases, but there are situations like that now presented to us, in which the phrase is of little practical use.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Machines whose normal functions are not to injure, possess harmful potencies when constructed defectively or operated carelessly. An automobile is such a machine. Old-fashioned wringers excited no apprehensions of danger. While they oc<a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>casionally pinched fingers and while their functions were exactly the same as modern electrically driven wringers, their dangerous potentialities were far less. When in the rollers of the former, the operator’s fingers were enmeshed, she could immediately “shut off the power” (which came from her <em>other </em>arm) or quickly put the wringer “in reverse.” With an electrically driven wringer, the operator must rely on a “safety device,” such as failed in the instant case. Likewise (hv way of example), the old-fashioned icebox contained no mechanism or chemicals which presented any possibilities of danger to persons using it. Yet <em>electrically </em>and <em>chemically </em>equipped modern refrigerators may, as is well known, become dangerous instrumentalities when they fail to function. The difference in the possible dangers lurking respectively in two different mechanisms whose functions are identical is, like most differences, <em>one of degree.</em>

A “demonstration” of a simple old-fashioned wringer was probably not necessary. Since there are many varieties of machines used for work <em>normally </em>not dangerous, and since many machines used for such work become dangerous when not constructed with care, each case must be decided on its own special facts, and verbal formulas which were useful in solving the legal problems in the era of the “simple life” cannot now be judicially accorded their former importance. The public safety and security against the fatal or injurious consequences of negligence in demonstrating and testing mechanical devices for common public use and in which lurk obvious possibilities of danger is a consideration to which courts cannot be indifferent. An imperative social duty requires a vendor of a mechanical device to take at least such easily available precautions as are reasonably likely to prevent <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>serious injury to those who by using such a device may be exposed to dangers arising from its defective construction.</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[267,518,1151,1184]]]'>Appellant in support of its position cites cases which are distinguishable from the case at bar. One of these is <em>West v. </em>Emanuel, <a href="/pa/198/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="198 Pa. 180" data-case-ids="920351" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0180-01">198 Pa. 180</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20A.%20965" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="47 A. 965">47 A. 965</a>. In that case recovery was sought against a druggist because he sold a proprietary headache powder in an original package to a customer who apparently died from the effects of taking it. It was held that there was no cause of action since a druggist is not required to analyze the contents of each bottle or package he receives. It would, for example, be utterly impracticable and unreasonable to require grocers to open and analyze the contents of every can of food they sell. <em>The purchaser in such cases does not expect any such precaution to he taken </em>and relies wholly upon the integrity, good faith and care of the person who put up the food in the cans. The rule of the nonliability of vendors in “original package” cases is firmly established in the law. It is expressly recognized in section 401 of the Restatement of the Law of Torts, which declares that dealers of goods sold in original packages are not liable for “defective condition” unless such condition would be disclosed by “even a cursory inspection.”</p>

A vendor of such goods is therefore under no duty to subject them to rigid inspection or tests before selling.” The inapplicability of that statement to the state of facts before us is obvious. By no sanctioned verbal license could the defendant in the instant case be considered a “mere conduit” from the manufacturer to the <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>buyer. It did not sell the wringer in the <em>“original pack</em>ageIt took upon itself the duty of subjecting the wringer to ■ “inspection and tests” before selling. It is a legitimate inference that the cost of such inspection and tests was added to the price of the equipment. Defendant’s director of appliance sales testified: “We have service men to take care of appliances, something over 100 of them, but they take care of all appliances, refrigerators, washers and all.” We must assume that the work of these service men, i. e., testing and demonstrating appliances is essential work, that their salaries and wages are absorbed in the purchase price and that therefore a purchaser having paid the vendor for these tests and demonstrations, has a right to recover from the vendor for injuries resulting from inadequately tested machines the latter sold. To the question propounded: “Had defendant a duty to inspect the article for defects?” the answer is: The defendant <em>assumed </em>this duty and <em>was paid for discharging it. </em>This is one of those cases in which the action was properly brought against the vendor. The purchaser did not have to look to the manufacturer for redress. The vendor may call upon the manufacturer to answer to it for the manufacturer’s default, if it sees fit to do so.</p>

It was “demonstrated” and warranted “safe.” There was a defective pipe, permitting a leakage of gas, and an explosion occurred. For resulting injuries plaintiff sued. A verdict for plaintiff was sustained. The Supreme Court of Georgia said: “We think it may be reasonably inferred from all the facts alleged that the defect was one which a reasonably prudent dealer should have, discovered before placing, it upon the market and delivering it to a customer. . . .

Williston on Sales, Vol. 1, section 197, page 373, expresses the following: “. . . The action upon a warranty was in its origin a pure action of tort. There is no doubt that to-day the obligation of a warrantor is generally conceived of as contractual, and there can be no doubt also that a seller may expressly promise to be answerable for some alleged quality of the articles sold, or that if he makes such a promise for good consideration he enters into a contract. This, however, does not either upon authority or reason exhaust the possibilities of express warranties. It should not be the law, and by the weight of modern authority, it is not the law that a seller who by positive affirmation induces a buyer to enter into a bargain can escape from liability by denying that his affirmation was an offer to contract. A positive representation of fact is enough to render him liable. The distinction between warranty and representation which is important in some branches of the law is not appropriate here. The representation of fact which induces a bargain is a warranty.” In <em>Dushane v. Benedict, </em><a href="/us/120/0630-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="120 U.S. 630" data-case-ids="3468890" data-case-paths="/us/120/0630-01">120 U.

If I read the opinion of the majority correctly, it imposes the duty of inspection upon vendors of all articles not sold in sealed packages, wherever a defect would make the article sold dangerous for use. I think this holding goes far beyond the warrant of any satisfactory authority anywhere. As a general rule the vendor of an article manufactured by another has no obligation other than that in contract, expressly undertaken or implied by law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> There are, of course, exceptions.

They are all cases where the vendor has done more than make a sale. In each he has affirmatively done something and to his action negligence can be traced.

A demonstration, is for the purpose of instruction by means of a sample display of operation. No representation inheres in it. It is not an inspection and the customer does not understand it as such, nor does the vendor by demonstrating assume to make an inspection. And the fact that the vendor employs 100 service men has nothing to do with inspection. Service men make repairs after the machines are put to use. Salesmen sell and demonstrate as was the case here. Service men have no duty to perform until the machines sold are out of order; they then make repairs, free for a year after sale in this case, and for a charge thereafter. Consequently, I can find nothing in the case to indicate that the vendor or its demonstrator did or said anything that could have been negligent or that could have misled the plaintiff to her detriment. Defendant cannot, therefore, be held liable for any affirmative misconduct.</p>

The rule that a vendor cannot be liable for defects in goods sold in original cartons is based on the fact that he cannot then know of the defect: <em>Toarte v. Morton Mfg.

If from past experience with articles of the same sort he ought to know of defects he is liable even though the article was sold in a sealed carton: <em>Clark v. Army &amp; Navy Co-operative Society </em>[1903], 1 3L B. 155. Similarly, if by his special training as a dealer in certain articles he ought to be alert to recognize their defects, he is liable if he does not: Restatement, Torts, section 402.</p>
