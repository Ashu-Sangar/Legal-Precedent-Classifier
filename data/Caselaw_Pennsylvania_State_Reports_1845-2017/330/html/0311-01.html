On or about June 2,1936, the Kittanning Country Club, also located in the same township, applied for a renewal of its liquor license for the same period. The Board refused both applications upon the ground that the township in which the applicants were located, at a liquor referendum election held November 5, 1935, had voted against the issuance of liquor licenses. In consequence it was prohibited by law from renewing the licenses of the applicants. Thereupon both Kasnevich and Kittanning Country Club appealed to the court below, contending that the question whether liquor licenses should be granted in the township had not been submitted to the electors in the manner required by law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Section 502 of the Act provides as follows: “Whenever electors equal to at least ten per centum of the highest vote cast for any office in the municipality or township at the last preceding general election shall petition the corporate authorities of the municipality or township for a referendum on the question of granting such liquor licenses, the respective corporate authorities shall cause a question to be submitted at the general or municipal election occurring at least sixty days thereafter, by certifying a resolution, duly adopted, to the county commissioners for submission of such question, on the ballot or on voting machines, at such election in the manner provided by the election laws of the Commonwealth.</p>

Accordingly, from the two voting districts, 134 voted in favor of the issuance of liquor licenses and 173 against the granting of such licenses. Thereafter, the vote was officially computed by the Court of Common Pleas of Armstrong County and, as certified, it was filed with the Prothonotary of the county and a copy of such certification forwarded to the Secretary of the Commonwealth.

The court below decided that a valid referendum on the question of granting liquor licenses had not been held, because the ballot upon which the question was submitted to the electors improperly described the municipality in which the election was conducted. The court concluded that the ballots used in both townships should have followed the form prescribed by the Act of Assembly<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and should have read: “Do you favor the granting of liquor licenses for the sale of liquor in the Township of North Buffalo, Armstrong County?” The court said: “the voters of each district of this town<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>ship voted on the question as to whether or not liquor licenses were to be issued <em>in their district </em>but not as to whether they should be issued in the township as a whole.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

It is clear that an election under the Act of 1874 which is invalid, because of the failure of the authorities to comply with the statutory requirements for the submission of the question to the electors, may be attacked collaterally by a taxpayer’s bill. No direct remedy is there provided by the enabling statute. The same rule applies to proceedings of the type involved in the present appeals, and it would seem that a similar right exists in this case, particularly in view of the right of appeal conferred by Section 404 of the Act of 1935, P.
