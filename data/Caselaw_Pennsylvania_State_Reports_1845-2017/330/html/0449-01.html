The road frontage was 335 feet with a varying depth to a maximum of 396 feet. On the lot was a two-story brick and cement garage, 60 x 80 feet, with driveways and four pumps in front, and plaintiff has been conducting on the property a garage business, an automobile sales agency, and a gasoline service station. The highway was a 40-foot road, with an 18-foot, two-lane, concrete pavement. The property of plaintiff was on the outside of a rather sharp curve in the road, a situation which enhanced its commercial value by placing it <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>within the range of vision of approaching vehicles for a long distance in either direction.</p>

A portion of the highway approximately one-third of a mile in length was relocated. The new sector formed the chord of an arc, connecting by an almost straight line, 1,400 feet long, two points in the old highway, one about 675 feet and the other 1,200 feet from plaintiff’s property. The distance between the old and new roads was, at the point of greatest divergence, approximately 280 feet. The new roadway was 60 feet wide, with a 30-foot, three-lane, concrete pavement.</p>

L. 1596, already referred to, which provides that “Before the Secretary of Highways shall undertake the construction or improvement of any State highway in a borough, wherein a change of width or of existing lines and location is necessary, and damages are likely to result to abutting property, he shall notify the county commissioners of the proper county,” who shall attempt to agree with the property owner or owners “as to the amount of damages to be paid to the said owner or owners, which damages, if agreed upon, shall be paid by the county.” In case no such agreement is made, the Secretary of Highways may not proceed with the work unless the county commissioners agree thereto, “and, in such eases, the owner or owners of said property damaged thereby may present their petition to the court of quarter sessions for the appointment of viewers to ascertain and assess such damages. The proceedings upon said petition and by viewers shall be governed by exist<a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>ing laws relating to the ascertainment and assessment of damages for opening public highways, and such damages, when ascertained, shall be paid by the county in which the State highway is located.”</p>

It seems reasonably clear, however, that the Act of May 7, 1929, — as well as the other acts parallel therewith— was not intended, by the unqualified use of the word “damages,” to give to a property owner a cause of action not theretofore existing, but merely to provide, as between the county and the Commonwealth, for the ascertainment and liquidation of the damages to which, under then existing law, property owners were entitled. There was no statute then, nor has there been any since, expressly or by clear implication imposing liability upon the Commonwealth in the improvement of highways, other than in cases where land is appropriated: see <em>Saeger v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/258/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="258 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1035029" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0239-01">258 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/258/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="258 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1035029" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0239-01">239</a>; State Highway Route No. 72, </em><a href="/pa/265/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="265 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="1051903" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0369-01">265 Pa. 369</a>. Had the legislature desired to increase the Commonwealth’s liability by extending the right of recovery to cases not involving a direct encroachment upon property, it presumably would have used language plainly indicating such an intention. It is not unreasonable to hold that any legislation to that end, and embodying what would constitute such an important innovation, should be clear and even meticulously explicit. In the absence of language measuring up to that standard it must be inferred that by “damages” in the widening or relocation of a highway by the State was meant only those for which, under Article I, section 10, of the Constitution, the Commonwealth was liable, namely, those occurring where land is actually taken and not merely “injured” or its use impaired as a consequence of the improvement.</p>

As a matter of fact the old section of the highway was not vacated. Under the Acts of May 17, 1921, P. L. 837, and May 16, 1929, P. L. 1770,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the Secretary of Highways has the power, with the approval of the Governor, to declare a vacation, but no such order was made in the present case. By the Act of April 27, 1927, P. L. 392, amended by the Act of June 11, 1935, P. L. 320, it is provided that where any section of a State highway route is relocated, the portion of the highway abandoned as a State highway route is thereafter to be maintained by the authorities responsible for its maintenance prior to its establishment as a State highway. The original highway in front of plaintiff’s property still exists, therefore, exactly as before, except that it is now maintained by the county instead of by <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>the State. If, then, even a vacation of the highway would not have entitled plaintiff to damages, it seems incredible that a cause of action should arise where the highway remains open and physically unchanged, or that the legislature intended by the Act of May 7, 1929, to bring about such an anomalous situation.</p>

The measure of damages in all eminent domain proceedings being the difference in the fair market value of the property before and after the exercise of the right, it followed that one of the elements to be taken into consideration in the ascertainment of damages was the depreciation in the value of the property for the commercial purposes for which it had theretofore been used: see also <em>Puloka, v.

It was said in <em>State Highway Route No. 72, </em><a href="/pa-super/71/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="71 Pa. Super. 85" data-case-ids="638159" data-case-paths="/pa-super/71/0085-01">71 Pa.

The same result would have occurred if an entirely new highway had been built parallel with the existing one, especially if of better construction. Every improved road takes away travel from older ones and thereby to some extent diminishes the commercial value of properties abutting on the older roads. It is highly dubious whether damage of that kind constitutes injury to the property that would be compensable under existing statutes providing for the liability of the various local agencies of government in their exercise of the right of eminent domain.
