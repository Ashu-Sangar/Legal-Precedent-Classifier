The compensation is earned in the present, payable in the future to an employee, provided he possesses the qualifications required by the act, and complies with the terms, conditions, and regulations imposed on the receipt of retirement pay. Until <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>an employee has earned Ms retirement pay, or until the time arrives when' he may retire, his retirement pay is hut an inchoate right; but when the conditions are satisfied, at that time retirement pay becomes a vested right of which the person entitled thereto cannot be deprived: it has ripened into a full contractual obligation.” Among the conditions of the several retirement systems upon which retirement pay may be based are contributions by the employee of a portion of his salary to the retirement fund as required in the act by which he is governed from the time he enters or joins the retirement system, whether then entitled to retire or not;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> service in the particular unit of government for the required span of years, here twenty; finally he must reach superannuation age, here 50, if he was under that age when he joined the retirement system. An employee fulfilling these conditions then has a vested interest in retirement pay which cannot be destroyed, weakened or departed from by subsequent legislation. Neither dismissal from service or office, nor any involuntary removal can affect this vested right to retirement pay. We endeavored to specifically hold in the <em>McGovern </em>case that eligibility for retirement pay is complete as soon as an employee or member of the retirement system has satisfied the conditions requisite for retirement, <em>whether </em>
      <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>
      <em>the employee chooses to retire immediately or to continue in active service. </em>His rights to such pay are fixed as of the time he attained eligibility. Until retirement pay is earned as above described the right is inchoate. During this period retirement pay is being built up. The inchoate right becomes a complete vested right when the conditions connected with the particular retirement system are complied with. This right cannot be thereafter disturbed by legislation. We reiterated this thought in the <em>Teachers’ Tenure Act </em>Cases, <a href="/pa/329/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="329 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1181514" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0213-01">329 Pa. 213</a>.</p>

S. 571</a>, the plaintiff was a beneficiary under an insurance policy issued under the War Risk Insurance Act. The insured paid the monthly premiums prescribed under the Act. In an opinion by.Brandéis, J., the court held the War Risk Insurance policies contracts of the United States. “True, these contracts, unlike others, were not entered into by the United States for a business purpose. . . . In order to effect a benevolent purpose heavy burdens were assumed by the Government. But the policies, although not entered into for gain, are legal obligations of the same dignity as other contracts of the United States and possess the same legal incidents.” As to whether a right to disclaim liability under the policies had been expressly reserved to the legislative, the court said: “In order to promote efficiency in administration and justice in the distribution of War Risk Insurance benefits, the Administration was given power to prescribe the form of policies and to make regulations. The form prescribed provided that the policy should be subject to all amendments to the original Act, to all regulations then in force or thereafter adopted. . . . But no power to curtail the amount of the benefits which Congress contracted to pay was reserved to Congress; and none could be given by any regulation promulgated by the Administrator.” It was accordingly held that a subsequent statute denying the government’s obligation <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>under these policies was unconstitutional as in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The court said at p. 579: “Valid contracts are property, whether the obligor be a private individual, a municipality, a State or the United States. ...” The court said that due process prevented the United States from annulling these contracts, that “Congress was without power to reduce expenditures by abrogating contractual obligations of the United States.”</p>

The Act of 1929, Section 315, substantially re-enacting Section 5 of the Act of 1919, provides that the Board “may adopt, amend, revise and abolish, in its discretion, such regulations, not inconsistent with law, as it deems necessary.” As we pointed out in the <em>McGovern </em>case: “The legislature may from time to time, within the confines of that established relation, alter, change, amend, and render intact the actuarial soundness of the system so as to strengthen its fibers in any way it sees fit. Changes in <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>details, such as length of service required, contributions needed, and age requirements, to keep the fund on sound actuarial practices, are essential. Flexibility in component parts is a paramount necessity to guard against changed conditions and to permit keeping abreast with actuarial science. The basis is contribution from the county or state and from employee members.” The Board may from time to time adopt improved administrative methods, — technical changes in detail, — and may, while the employee’s right is inchoate, adopt such regulation for the betterment of the retirement fund’s security. It may increase payments or require other actuarial changes to protect the established principal, but as to employees who have through time built up or acquired their right to retirement pay, on the assurance from the government that it would be fully met, the government must understand that a definite fixed obligation has been assumed.</p>

Luthardt v. Retirement Board, </em><a href="/ill-app/273/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="273 Ill.

Where one has been employed by one of the units of government, has been placed upon the retired list, and is then re-employed by the same political unit, there is much room for argument that he should not be entitled to receive a retirement allowance and compensation on his return to service. These laws must be construed equitably in the interest of the State and the employee. It is evident the Retirement Act did not intend a different result, and that one re-employed in the same position from which he had retired cannot be considered “retired.” Nor would he be retired if employed by the same unit of government. But here McBride was not re-employed by his former employer, the county; he was employed by a different unit, the State. The importance of this distinction is illustrated by <em>Homan v. Mackey et al., </em><a href="/pa/295/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="295 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="1115128" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0082-01">295 Pa. 82</a>, in which the Court held plaintiff’s being in the em<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>ploy of the Superior Court was no legal answer to his application for a “pension” to which he was entitled as city employee under the applicable statute.

Plaintiff’s rights under the Retirement Act, having vested upon his becoming eligible for retirement, could not be impaired by legislation. Upon subsequently accepting a position with a different branch of the State government his rights to retirement pay were not waived. Accepting employment by the State is not a waiver of retirement rights. If the State may constitutionally provide that an individual’s rights are to be extinguished as here, conceivably the State may so increase the number of contingencies upon which the employees’ interest shall cease, as to actually force a surrender of all rights.</p>

Later plaintiff was employed as Chief of Police of Long Branch, N. Y. During this employment his pension was suspended. The court held that plaintiff could recover the amount of the suspended payments. The court said, and we agree: “We may concede an incongruity in plaintiff’s drawing a pension as a retired policeman and at the same time a salary as an active policeman in a neighboring city. That, however, was a right granted, or at least not denied to him under Section 1560 of the charter, when he retired. We take the statute as we find it.” See also <em>Graef v.
