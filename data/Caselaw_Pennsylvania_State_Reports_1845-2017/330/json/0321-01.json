Although this crossing must be considered dangerous in some respects, yet this evidence brings the case clearly within the ruling of Wink et al. v. Western Maryland R. R. Co., 116 Pa. Superior Ct. 374. There, under facts similiar to those now under consideration, the Court held that there was no evidence to sustain a finding that the defendant was guilty of negligence,\u201d and affirm the judgment.",
