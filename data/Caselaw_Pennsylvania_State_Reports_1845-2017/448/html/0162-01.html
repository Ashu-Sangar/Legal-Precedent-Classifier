The police, after interrogating a number of known gang members, ascertained from them that appellant, James Ravenell, was involved in the shooting.

Appellant alleged that he did not waive his right to have counsel present during interrogation and that the confession he signed was the product of police coercion. At the conclusion of the hearing on the motion to suppress, the hearing judge dismissed the petition. Appellant was subsequently tried before a judge and a jury and was found guilty of murder in the second degree. Post-trial motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied and on September 17, 1971, appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five nor more than twenty years.

As Detective Melfi placed appellant in the rear of an unmarked vehicle he gave him the full <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Bavenell was then transferred to a police wagon and taken to the Homicide Division in the Police Administration Building. At about 6:00 A.M. the <em>Miran</em>

At approximately 8:00 A.M., subsequent to giving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings a third time, Detective Melfi and Officer Thornhill commenced taking appellant’s statement on a typewriter. Appellant read the entire statement which amounted to an admission that he deliberately shot the deceased, Marvin Smith. He then signed every page and later read the entire statement into a tape recorder.</p>

At the hearing appellant testified that he ivas punched and slapped on several occasions while at the Police Administration Building and made and signed the confession so that he would not be physically punished any further. In appellant’s behalf two friends, one a participating gang member and the other a childhood friend then confined to the Detention Center, testified that appellant told them he was beaten by the police prior to his confession. Both witnesses agreed that Ravenell’s face appeared “kind of” or “slightly” swollen. Detective Melfi and Officer Thornhill testified to the chronological sequence of events prior to the appellant’s signing his confession and both unequivocally denied any physical coercion by the police.</p>

Contrary to appellant’s secondary contention that no specific findings were made, the hearing judge then concluded that the interests of all the witnesses had to be weighed and stated: <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>“I can see the interest of the defendant, which is a proper interest, and I can see the sense of allegiance which exists between gang members and life long friends, which is understandable. 1 detect, however, that there is no interest to be served by Thornhill and Melfi particularly. I find their testimony to be more credible than I do that of the petitioner and his witnesses. I dismiss the petition.” Record, Suppression Hearing, at 193. Based on this record, which indicates that the actions of the officers who arrested and interrogated Ravenell were constitutionally proper, we conclude that the hearing judge was correct in dismissing appellant’s application to suppress his confession. We likewise believe that the Commonwealth has complied with <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v.

Ravenell argues that the hearing judge erroneously excluded relevant evidence which he attempted to offer. Appellant’s witness, Robert Nixon, started to testify as to a further conversation that he had with the appellant at the Detention Center, two days after the arrest, concerning the alleged beating but the court ruled this testimony inadmissible. This, appellant contends, was error and should have been received in evidence as a prior consonant statement since appellant had already testified to having been beaten by police. In other words, appellant suggests that he should be allowed to bolster his own testimony by offering another witness who will testify that the appellant told him certain things a year before. To admit such self-serving evidence would give appellant the opportunity to manufacture testimony for himself. The admissibility of <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>such testimony, if at all, must rest upon an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>

Were it not otherwise, the door might be opened to the fabrication of evidence. However, there are certain well recognized exceptions to this general rule: prior declarations of a witness, which are consistent with his present testimony, may be admissible to corroborate his present testimony if it be alleged that the witness’ present testimony is recently fabricated, or if if be claimed that the witness is testifying from corrupt motives.</p>

Therefore, in the instant case where it was a matter of contradicting appellant’s testimony by credible evidence offered by the Commonwealth, and not an attempt to impeach his credibility by a suggestion that his testimony was a recent fabrication, evidence of a prior consonant statement was properly excluded.

First, it is argued that it was error to refuse to declare a mistrial when a witness responded with an alleged hearsay statement. The statement in question appears in the following dialogue in which the assistant district attorney is questioning one of her witnesses regarding his knowledge of the alleged murder weapon. “By Miss Abraham [Assistant District Attorney]: Q. Did you yourself touch the gun? A. Yes. Q. What did you do after you touched the gun? A. Nothing. Q. Did you do something subsequently after that? A. No. Q. What if anything did you do with the gun, if you did anything? A. I didn’t do nothing with the gun. Q. Did you do something later with the gun? A. Yes. Q. What did you do with it? A. I wiped the gun off. Q. What did you wipe the gun off with? A. With a cloth. Q. Why did you wipe the gun off with a cloth? A. I didn’t want—Mr. Shields: I object, Your Honor. If he is going to testify to some hearsay, it will be prejudicial. By The Court: Q. Why did you wipe the gun off? A. Because he said Pep [appellant] was supposed to shoot somebody. I don’t know. Mr. Shields: I object as highly prejudicial to the defendant as based on hearsay, and I would submit that the District Attorney was aware of this since in his statement—and I have just read the statement over here—she knew that she would elicit this from him before the jury. If Your Honor pleases, I would move for a mistrial. By Miss Abraham: Q. Sir was Pep there—Mr. Shields: If Your Honor please, I move that his response be stricken from the record. The Court: I didn’t hear his response, which I will not repeat. Members of the jury, if you heard his response to the question Why did he wipe the gun off with the cloth?’ If you did, whatever it <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>was, if you heard it, strike it from your mind. It is improper.”</p>
    <p id="b319-3" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[200,452,1148,983]]]'>Recognizing the hearsay nature of this statement, we do not feel, after an examination of the instant record in its entirety, that it had any influence on the verdict. It is to be noted that the trial judge promptly granted a motion to strike the response and instructed the jury to disregard it. Even where objectionable hearsay evidence was improperly admitted in evidence and a motion to strike was denied we have concluded that "[s]ome error in a protracted trial, such as this, will unfortunately occur, but we have consistently ruled that if the error did not deprive the defendant of the fundamentals of a fair trial we will not reverse the conviction.” <em>Commonwealth v. Lopinson, </em><a href="/pa/427/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="427 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1910385" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0284-01">427 Pa. 284</a>, 307, <a href="/citations/?q=234%20A.2d%20552" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="234 A.2d 552">234 A. 2d 552</a>, 565 (1967).

    <p id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[199,1448,1148,643]]]'>Also with respect to the statement at issue, we specifically reject the contention that reversible error has been committed because of the Commonwealth’s persistent attempts to influence the jury, to the great prejudice of the appellant, by deliberately eliciting the hearsay response. We agree that where counsel persists in intentionally seeking to inject incompetent evidence into the case such misconduct prevents a fair trial and warrants reversal. However, the record before us provides no basis for labeling the assistant district attorney’s zealous efforts in presenting the prosecution’s evidence as intentional misconduct.</p>
    <p id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.6",319,[200,2110,1147,210]],["BL_320.1",320,[203,340,1155,430]]]'>Appellant further contends that it was error for the trial court to permit Ms confession to be sent out with the jury during its deliberations. Appellant’s argument is based on Rule 1114, Pennsylvania Rules of <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>Criminal Procedure, <em>supra, </em>which provides: “Upon retiring for deliberations, the jury may take with it such exhibits as the trial judge deems proper. The jury shall not be permitted to have a transcript of any trial testimony nor a copy of the indictment.” Since the entire confession had been read into the record, appellant believes it became part of the trial transcript and therefore could not be sent out with the jury.</p>
    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.4",320,[196,783,1159,1036]]]'>We were recently confronted with this exact issue in <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Moore, </em>we held that Rule 1114 does grant the trial court discretion with respect <em>to </em>sending exhibits out with the jury when it retires. We found that a confession retained the status of an exhibit even though read into evidence and therefore at the sound discretion of the trial judge could be taken to the jury room. However, we must caution that such procedure should be carefully employed and is not permissible when under all the circumstances it affords this portion of the testimony undue emphasis. Because this was a long, complicated trial and the confession contained many confusing references to the participants in the fight by nickname, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial judge’s decision to send appellant’s confession out with the jury.</p>

During direct examination appellant testified that none of the police officers had said anything to him outside the house. After the appellant repeated this assertion on cross-examination, the assistant district attorney referred to testimony appellant gave at the suppression hearing. After a discussion as to the propriety of using this prior testimony for impeachment purposes, the trial judge permitted the following dialogue: “Q. Do you recall being asked a question by your attorney: ‘Now, after Detective Melfi told your mother that, what happened?

However, this privilege against self-incrimination cannot be construed to include the right to testify at a suppression hearing with complete impunity and at trial to testify in a <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>contrary manner. In order to prevent this type of occurrence Rule 323(g) expressly recognizes that it may be necessary to disclose portions of the record of the prior suppression hearing when “the interests of justice” so require.

In the present case, an examination of the record refutes appellant’s contention that it was impossible for a jury to give any gang member a fair trial. Accordingly, we do not believe that, as to James Ravenell, any juror was prejudicially affected by the pretrial publicity concerning gang violence.</p>

Whenever anyone admitted even the possibility of prejudice he was excused by the court without requiring counsel to challenge for cause. There were no exceptions to this jury selection procedure.</p>

Therefore, the mere postponement of trial would not cause a change in the public’s feelings against gangs in general.</p>

If we follow appellant’s argument, he is complaining that he did not have sufficient time to present his application for a continuance in a meaningful, well-documented manner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> There is no merit in this contention. The trial judge was well aware of the current adverse publicity gang violence was receiving in the Philadelphia community and it was only after a colloquy with counsel on this matter that he denied appellant’s motion for a continuance. We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying the motion without further hearing.</p>

The statute involved denied a man accused of a misdemeanor any opportunity at all to show that he could not be fairly tried.
