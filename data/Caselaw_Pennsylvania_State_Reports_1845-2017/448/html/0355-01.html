The court is informed that the effective date of such registration was November 9, 1968. Defendant Bata, on this showing, has complied with a half-portion of the court’s order, and has ignored the remainder. The termination of the English litigation was effected by plaintiff alone in an extremely roundabout and burdensome fashion. The fine imposed upon defendant Bata is remitted to the extent of $200,000; the remaining portion of the fine stands.” The court directed Central-Penn to pay the unremitted fine of $50,000 from the escrow to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
