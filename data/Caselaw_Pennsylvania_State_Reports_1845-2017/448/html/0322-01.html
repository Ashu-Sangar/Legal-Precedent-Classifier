The Commonwealth has not questioned the applicability of the two-year statute of limitations for misdemeanors, see note 2 supra, to these summary offenses. We note, however, that the Cigarette Tax Act fails to provide a statute of limitations for these offenses. We cannot construe this omission to indicate that the Legislature intended the Commonwealth to have a longer period of time to prosecute these summary offenses than it has to return <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>indictments for felonies and misdemeanors which are of a more serious nature. The statute of limitations for other summary offenses is consistently shorter than two years. See, e.g., Act of December 15, 1959, P. D. 1779, §282, 30 P.S. §282 (violation of the fish laws—one year); Act of May 5, 1921, P. D. 389, §15, 76 P.S. §115 (violations of weights and measures law—one year) ; Act of April 29, 1959, P. L. 58, §1201, as amended, 75 P.S. §1201 (The Vehicle Code—30 days). Therefore, if the prosecutions are barred for the misdemeanors, it follows that they are barred for the summary offenses.</p>

Therefore, the validity of each indictment must he measured for the purposes of the statute of limitations on the basis of the date of the acts charged therein.

Taking into account the time period for which the statute was tolled under the Commonwealth’s theory (July 18, 1967 to .Tune 7, 1968), the two-year period ran between July 30, 1968, the date of the second set of indictments and September 10, 1965. All indictments charging offenses which occurred before September 10, 1965 are therefore invalid under the statute of limitations (Nos. 1773-79, 1787-93, 1795-98, 1806-08, July Sessions 1968).</p>
