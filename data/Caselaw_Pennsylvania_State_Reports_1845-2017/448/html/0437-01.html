After the dissolution of the marriage the children were brought to Berks County in June 1965 to live with their maternal grandparents and aunt. Appellant worked briefly in New York City but in April 1966 she returned home to her parents and children. Anxious to complete her college education, she enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania in September 1966 and was subsequently graduated in 1968. Under an arrangement reached with her parents, the latter were to have custody of the two boys until appellant had completed her <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>education and was financially able to support them. During this two-year period Mrs. Holschuh worked week nights as a waitress in order to defray her expenses. Hence, her visits with her children were limited to non-school times such as weekends. In the fall of 1968 appellant enrolled in the graduate school of architecture at Yale University. Because of the increased distance and expense of traveling, Mrs. Holschuh testified that she ivas able to visit her children only once each month.</p>

She also disclosed that she was presently sharing her living quarters with a male graduate student, a Douglass Southworth, who was her “best friend”. It was further testified, however, that with the expected departure of Mr. South-worth for California, this living arrangement would he permanently altered. Mrs. Holschuh professed a groat desire to be reunited with her children, saying, “it will change my life” and that “the presence of them would evoke my position of mother which I have not been able to exercise over the past five years.”</p>

The court concluded by observing that “to leave these children with their elderly grandparents, or with their aunt, would deprive them of their last real chance to grow with a mother’s love and care which should continue for the lifetime of the mother.”</p>

All we can see is a promise by her that, if awarded her children, she will change her manner of living and that the presence of her sons will enable her to do so. This promise should not have been given the weight the lower court apparently gave it, since on occasions in the past during visitations of the children with petitioner <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>in her home, her male companion continued to stay there.” The Superior Court did not, however, find appellant to be an unfit mother. As Judge Montgomery, speaking for the court, wrote: “We hesitate to characterize the petitioner as an unfit mother and to conclude that she should not have her children for that reason. On the contrary, we will deny her custody because she has not established an environment where their welfare will be promoted.

Although unexpressed, the court undoubtedly did not lose sight of the fact that the boys would be leaving the jurisdiction of the court and its ability to insure that the promise was performed.</p>

Mindful that a mother ordinarily does have a prima facie right to her children over any other person, the evidence on this record convinces me that this presumption in favor of maternal custody has been overcome and rebutted. This record demonstrates to my satisfaction that the appellant-mother has “little or no regard for conventional standards, whether moral or social.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> To uproot these children from the home of appellant’s parents (where they have lived and been cared for over a period of seven years), a home well disciplined wherein the standards of behavior are “strikingly different from those espoused by appellant.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> places these children in a situation where adjustment will be highly improbable, if not impossible. Both the majority and minority opinions favor a mother whose past behavior, in my opinion based on the evidence of record, has forfeited her rights as a mother. The best interests of these children, who are at a highly impressionable stage of life, have been subordinated to a misplaced adherence to the rights ordinarily granted a mother.</p>

I believe the trial court’s finding that “the welfare of the children demands that their mother have custody” was fully supported by sufficient and competent evidence. In reversing that finding' of fact the Superior Court clearly intruded upon the province of the fact-finder and exceeded the proper scope of appellate review.</p>
    <p id="b597-4" data-blocks='[["BL_597.7",597,[153,951,1148,593]]]'>I am unpersuaded by the majority’s attempt to characterize the Superior Court’s direct invasion of the fact-finding province of the trial court as merely the drawing of different “deductions and conclusions of law” from appellant’s promise of “reformation”. What the majority ignores is the fact that appellant’s promise of “reformation” was merely part of all the evidence that the trial court properly considered in making its finding. The weight and effect to be accorded the mother’s testimony, as well as all the testimony iu the case, was clearly for the fact-finder—here the hearing court.</p>
