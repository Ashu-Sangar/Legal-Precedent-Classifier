Pursuant to the prearranged plan, Yuknavich drove his car and parked in the vicinity of the service station. While appellant waited in the car, Souder left to rob the establishment. He had with him the revolver and ammunition which appellant had furnished.

At the degree of guilt hearing the court determined that the killing of George Allabaugh was murder in the first degree and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. No direct appeal was taken from this judgment of sentence, but on March 27, 1968, appellant filed a petition in which he averred that he was <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>entitled to relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Evidentiary hearings were held and based upon testimony taken at the hearings and upon the trial record the hearing court concluded that neither the court nor the attorney of record advised appellant: of his right to appeal from the judgment of sentence; of the time within which the appeal had to be filed; of his right to the services of counsel; or that if he were unable to afford counsel the court would appoint counsel for the purposes of the appeal.

First, the relevant statutory law imputes the malice necessary for first degree murder to a felon who causes the death of another person during the perpetration of arson, rape, robbery, burglary, or kidnapping.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> However, since this statutory classification merely categorizes murder into two degrees, it is to the common law that one must look for the definition of murder. As enunciated in the landmark case of <em>Commonwealth v. Drum, </em><a href="/pa/58/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="58 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1013212" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0009-01">58 Pa. 9</a>, 15 (1868), “[t]he distinguishing criterion of murder is malice aforethought.” With this “criterion” as the basis, the doctrine of felony-murder became firmly imbedded in the common law. As applied in Pennsylvania, common law felony-murder “is a means of imputing malice where it may not exist expressly. Under this rule, the malice necessary to make a killing, even an accidental one, murder, is constructively inferred from the malice incident to the perpetration of the initial felony.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Smith v.

Therefore, in analyzing a homicide committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate a felony “the basic determination of the fact of murder is to be made according to the rules of the common law, including the felony-murder theory of imputed malice, and, upon a finding of guilt, the degree statute automatically raises the murder to first degree if it happened, inter alia, to have been committed in the perpetration of arson, rape, robbery, burglary or kidnap<a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>ping.” <em>Commonwealth v.

It is not unrealistic to ascribe to one who willfully engages in a plan to commit armed robbery, a wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences, or a mind regardless of social duty.

At the hearing of September 3, 1968, on the issue of whether the guilty plea was knowingly and intelligently made, appellant testified on cross-examination, when he was confronted with the trial record of the proceedings at which the guilty plea was entered, that he had stated to the court: that he was satisfied to enter the plea of guilty to murder; that this plea was entered of his own free will, with full knowledge of the nature of the charge and of the contents of the indictment; that the plea was entered without any promise or hope of any reward; and that the plea was discussed with his counsel before being entered. In addition, from the testimony of appellant’s attorney, it is clear: that appellant knew he was entitled to a jury trial if he wished; that appellant was aware of the felony-murder concept; and that appellant was told of the danger of the death penalty after a jury verdict of guilty.
