Shortly after his apprehension on September 2, 1969, appellant gave homicide detectives a complete, signed confession, detailing his participation in the events leading up to Shayka’s death. A pretrial motion to suppress this confession was denied, and that ruling is not now challenged. By his own admission, corroborated by the victim’s widow, who was an eyewitness to the happenings, the following transpired. At approximately 5:00 P.M. of the day Sliayka died, appellant, then aged 17, and two other <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>juveniles entered the deceased’s grocery and candy store. Appellant carried a loaded revolver and one of his companions was armed with a knife. When his demands for cash were met with hesitation, appellant jabbed the old storekeeper four times in the stomach, twice with his hands and a like number with the revolver barrel. The three youths then seized some loose change and cigarettes and fled as Shayka slumped to the floor. He was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital at 5:25 P.M.</p>

In laymen’s terms, Dr. Aronson positioned the fatal interna] injury at the level of the navel and gave as his expert opinion that death resulted from a poke or punch in the stomach inflicted with a pistol or fist. The witness admitted that a sudden rise in blood pressure, a fall on the area of the aneurysm, or even a bending over were <em>possible </em>causes of the fatal injury. When pressed on cross-examination, however, Dr. Aronson gave the following response: “Anything is possible. However, the close time relationship between the collapse of this individual and the events described prior to that collapse, make it obvious that there is a relationship between these two factors .... [A]s I understand your question, sir, you are asking me if by coincidence at the same time that the deceased in this case suffered some injury that he could have by coincidence ruptured his aorta at that time, my answer is, yes, anything is possible <em>but I consider that possibility in the realm of speculation or </em>absurdity.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

As we said in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Libonati, <a href="/pa/346/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="346 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1216395" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0504-01">346 Pa. 504</a>, 508, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.2d%2095" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="31 A.2d 95">31 A. 2d 95</a> (1943) : “Nor may we say, as a matter of law, that the guilt of the accused has not been sufficiently established to carry the case to the jury merely because of a <em>remote possibility </em>that the evidence, or some part of it, might be true and the accused still be innocent.” (Emphasis added.) See also <em>Commonwealth v. Holt, </em><a href="/citations/?q=350%20Pa.%20875" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="350 Pa. 875">350 Pa. 875</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20372" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="39 A.2d 372">39 A. 2d 372</a> (1944). Tt is manifest from the testimony of Dr. Aronson that he placed the chance of the victim’s having died from a cause other than the blows <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>inflicted by appellant as no greater than such a “remote possibility”. This case is clearly distinguishable from <em>Commonwealth v.

In both those cases, as here, the Commonwealth produced only one expert witness to prove the element of causation. In <em>Embry, </em>the opinion was with a “reasonable degree of medical certainty” only, and in <em>Redford </em>the testimony indicated that the defendant’s assault on the deceased “probably” caused the death. These two standards unquestionably fall short of Dr. Aronson’s positive assertion qualified only by a “possibility in the realm of speculation or absurdity”. We therefore reject appellant’s first contention.</p>
