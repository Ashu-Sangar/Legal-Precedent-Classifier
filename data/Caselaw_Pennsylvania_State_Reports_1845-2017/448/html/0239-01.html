In 1904, 306 mineral acres in Warrant 1990 (which, appellant contends, included the 153 acres comprising the Johnston tract) appeared on the unseated list, in addition to the 187 acres owned in complete fee by Blanchard in Warrant 1990. This entry remained the same in the triennial assessments of 1907 and 1910.

To support tMs chain, he argues that for several reasons to be examined the 1916 tax sale was invalid and did not divest the title of the Title Company, and consequently of the Blanchard heirs, to the tract. In the alternative, appellant argues that even if the 1916 tax sale were not defective for the several reasons asserted, it was nevertheless a nullity because the property had been previously transferred to Ms predecessor in title by the 1912 sale of 306 mineral acres.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> He contends that the Johnston tract was included in the 306 mineral acre assessment in Warrant 1990, which served as the basis for that transaction.</p>

The annual seated assessment of Union Township for the year 1911 shows “153 mineral—-Blanchard Charles Est.” On the assessment form the second column from the left, after the date column, is captioned “Acres Perches”. In succeeding years, “153 mineral”, which appeared under this heading, was shortened to “153 min”. Appellant’s characterization of the assessment as “153 min” is thus taken out of context. When viewed in light of the 1911 assessment and the column caption, the clear meaning is that it was 153 mineral acres that were being assessed to the Blanchard Estate. The .1916 Treasurer’s deed described the land as “153 acres mineral right situate in the township of Union, purporting to be owned by and assessed in the name of Chas. Blanchard Est.”</p>

In that deed twelve parcels were described, only some of which were located in Warrant 1990.

Nevertheless, that land was all lumped together and assessed as four tracts of unseated land.

Neely’s 1904 deed to the Title Company conveyed only “mineral rights”, but that indenture’s expressed purpose was to divest the estate of all remaining property pursuant to court decree. It is conceded by appellant that this deed was adequate to convey to the Title Company all oil and gas rights, and was not limited to “hard minerals”.

This was clearly established by our decision in <em>Wilson v. A. Cook Sons Co., supra. </em>In that case, as here, the taxpayer’s ownership of minerals admittedly included oil and gas; the assessment of his interest was of “minerals” only. Taxes became delinquent, and a tax sale was held. The County Treasurer’s deed to the purchaser conveyed only “minerals”. Later the taxpayer claimed that the tax sale had not covered oil and gas. The court held otherwise. Because we consider this case controlling on this phase of the case, we quote at length from the opinion of Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Frazer: “[Wilson] now contends <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>the assessment and sale of ‘minerals did not pass title to the oil and gas.’ On the tax duplicates and in the tax books of the county, plaintiff’s reserved estate is described as ‘mineral’, and he argues this term so used ‘did not cover oil and gas’ underlying the surface, and sets forth in his first assignment of error that the court was in error in its conclusion that the assessment of the ‘mineral’ included the oil and gas and that the treasurer’s sale passed to the purchaser and to his successors a good title to such property. . . . There was undoubtedly a separate estate here created in plaintiff of the underlying minerals, and we have frequently held that oil and gas are minerals (Marshall v. Mellon, <a href="/pa/179/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="179 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="886987" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0371-01">179 Pa. 371</a>; Chartiers Block Coal Co. v.

On the other hand, oil, gas and coal are minerals, and when the title to the same is severed from the owner of the surface and vested in a separate owner, an estate in land is thus created, which, if it be of any value, may be taxed. . . .

Acceptance of this proposition would undoubtedly lead to confusion and speculation, for no one would know what had actually been sold. Attempts to prove that assessors did or did not know of the presence of oil or gas when they assessed “minerals” at some point in the past would lead to protracted collateral investigation and litigation. It is true, of course, that an assessor can tax only that which has value. <em>Rockwell v.

The assessment of the 153 acres of minerals had been in the name of the “Blanchard Estate” since 1911. Thus neither the legal title owner of record (the Title Company) nor the undisclosed equitable owners (the heirs of Charles Blanchard) were identified by the 1913 and 1914 assessments.

This, however, is unimportant. What is important is to determine whether or not the property sold was properly to be considered seated or unseated. If unseated, it is immaterial that the name of the owner as given in the assessment is inaccurate, since no personal liability is involved; the land, not the owner, is looked to for payment of delinquent taxes.

The reason for the rule is thus stated by the Court in the case last cited: “The advertisement of four tracts as one being sanctioned, it will follow that any indefinite number may be thus published as one tract. The advertisement will not, in such case, give any notice to the owner of a single tract that his land is up for sale; if this mode of advertising is sanctioned, why not allow four or forty tracts to be assessed as one, and call it only an irregularity, as is done in this case?” <a href="/watts/9/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="9 Watts 319" data-case-ids="1850025" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0319-01">9 Watts at 327</a>.
