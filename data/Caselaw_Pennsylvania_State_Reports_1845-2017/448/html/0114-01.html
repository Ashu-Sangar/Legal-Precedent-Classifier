    <p id="b264-10" data-blocks='[["BL_264.17",264,[195,1565,1154,429]]]'>Appellant was indicted for murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter in connection with the fatal shooting of Edward Louden on March 11, 1968, in Watts Township, Perry County. After a jury trial, appellant was found guilty of second-degree murder. Post-trial motions were denied and the appellant was sentenced to a term of five to twenty years’ imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>

His version of the fatal encounter was that the deceased, in the company of one George Miller, arrived at appellant’s home—a single-room dwelling—at approximately 9:30 on the night of the shooting. Shortly thereafter, George Miller de<a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>parted, leaving appellant and the deceased alone in appellant’s home. Appellant testified that the deceased began drinking port wine which appellant had purchased earlier in the day, became intoxicated and threatened to kill appellant. During this diatribe, appellant was lying in bed but, upon hearing a click, which appellant interpreted as “breaking the gun,” he arose and discovered the deceased rising from a chair with appellant’s shotgun in his possession. Appellant allegedly grabbed the barrel of the shotgun, wresting it from the deceased’s grasp, reversed the gun so that it was pointing in the direction of the deceased and attempted to apply the safety mechanism which necessitated fingering the trigger. At this point, the deceased allegedly shoved the appellant, causing him to fall backwards and, while appellant was falling, the gun discharged, fatally striking the deceased in the area of the chest.</p>

In his confession, appellant admitted that he turned himself in at the police station, “to turn in that I shot a man.” He then proceeded to give the following account of the events surrounding the killing: “A. I got up and sat on the side of the bed. Miller had left. The longer [the deceased] sat the more he said that he would kill me and his brother, Ernest Roy Louden. I laid down with no covers on but I was awake. This is not the first occurrence that this has happened. He walked back into the kitchen again and sat at the table. I have three chairs over there. Then he started this procedure about killing my uncle and me. Q. Did he have the gun at this time? A. He had picked up the gun. It was in the corner by my bed. I had three splatter loads and one pumpkin ball. They were on the floor. I thought he loaded the gun as I heard a click. At <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>this time I was setting up and he came over towards me and pointed the gun at me. I grabbed the barrel of the gun and turned it around and <em>pointed the gun at him. </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Q. Did you have the gun pointed at him direct? A. When I grabbed the gun and turned it around I had the gun pointed more over his head than directly at him. Q. What took place then? A. He pushed me and I fell down on the floor right by the bed and my head hit the bed. The gun went off. As soon as the gun went off, he fell. I think that 1 threw the gun on the bed.”</p>

I immediately got out of bed and started out toward him. As it shows on the diagram here, when I got to the refrigerator, I saw he had the gun, he was in the chair, he was getting out of the chair, which is the arm chair, a padded arm chair. . . . A. When I came out, I had two choices. One choice would be to take a chance to get out the door, which opened inwardly, he was getting out of the chair with the gun which he had in his left hand, but he was getting out, and I definitely knew I didn’t have any chance to get through the door before he actually shot me, like T said, I didn’t doubt it a bit, and I wouldn’t have had any chance to get out. And the other choice, then, would be trying to talk him out of it as I did in the past, and when he got out of the chair he stepped to the right, his right, of the chair. ... A. Well, he was in the chair, he was getting up, and he took a step to the right of the chair, with the gun pointed at me, but he was sort of weaving. ... A. [The deceased] got out of the chair and, as I said, he stepped to the right, but he had the gun on me, like I said, he was standing there with the gun on me, and I immediately grabbed the barrel, here (indicating), real quick, I grabbed it and pointed the gun up in the air, and when he gave <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>me the push, my arm went out like this (indicating), I dropped my arm to catch myself, and the weight of the gun, I presume, or my own weight, it could have been the weight of the gun, when I come down, it was cocked and it went off. I fell backward, I don’t know whether it struck me, like the stock or something, but I lost my balance and fell, and my head hit the bed.”</p>
    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[193,732,1155,750]]]'>Thus, in his confession, unlike his testimony, appellant admitted pointing the gun at the deceased. Furthermore, the Commonwealth’s expert pathologist testified that the path of the fatal bullet established that it entered the body at a downward flight, rebutting appellant’s testimony that the gun discharged while appellant was in the act of falling. The jury obviously believed that the account contained in appellant’s pretrial confession was closer to what actually occurred. Appellant’s admission that he fired the fatal shot, after pointing the gun at the victim, when coupled with the pathologist’s testimony clearly constituted sufficient evidence to support a conviction of second-degree murder.</p>
    <p id="b268-5" data-blocks='[["BL_268.5",268,[196,1505,1154,254]]]'>Appellant argues that his confession, similar to but more damaging than his direct testimony, should not have been admitted into evidence because it was involuntary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The facts surrounding the confession are as follows:</p>

Upon entering the station, appellant was asked by the <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>trooper on duty whether he could be of assistance. Appellant replied, “I just shot my Uncle Ed.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The trooper directed no further questions to appellant but notified another trooper to return to the barracks. Trooper Montross testified that, upon receiving the radio communication, he returned to the barracks and immediately gave appellant the warnings required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.

Upon being told of his right to have an attorney present during any questioning, appellant mentioned the name of an attorney. Officer Corbett attempted to locate the attorney, but was told by appellant not to bother, that appellant would answer any questions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Prior to initiating the questioning, appellant was read the waiver of his rights. Inquiry was made as to whether he understood the waiver, to which appellant answered in the affirmative; whereupon he then signed it. The questioning was then initiated and the statement copied by Officer Corbett, typed, read by appellant, re-read to appellant by Officer Corbett and finally signed by appellant on each page. On its face, the evidence exhibited a knowing and intelligent waiver of appellant’s constitutional rights. Cf., <em>Commonwealth v. Goldsmith, </em><a href="/pa/438/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="438 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1929270" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0083-01">438 Pa. 83</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20322" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="263 A.2d 322">263 A. 2d 322</a> (1970). Appellant contends, however, that the statement was not voluntary since at the time it was given he was under the influence of medication. <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>The testimony of the state troopers and one Lester Kumler, who accompanied appellant to the police station, was that appellant acted normally at all times, his gait was steady and his speech was not slurred. The trial judge elected to believe this testimony. We conclude that the court’s finding of voluntariness is supported by a preponderance of the credible evidence.</p>
    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[179,730,1153,255]]]'>Although appellant’s statement is constitutionally admissible and the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, we believe that appellant has identified errors in the court’s charge which entitle him to a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[179,1008,1155,1037]]]'>In its charge to the jury, the court gave the following instructions concerning appellant’s right of self-defense in his own home: “In the home, <em>if you retreat about as far as you can retreat, and there is really no place further to go, </em>the law says you have a right to defend yourself in the home, where that may not exist out in the open where you can certainly get away.” (Emphasis added.) The court’s instruction was clearly an incorrect statement of the law. Where a man is dangerously assaulted in his own dwelling house by one not a member of the household, there exists no duty to retreat; rather, he may stand his ground and meet deadly force with deadly force to save his life or to protect himself from serious bodily harm.

It has been said that our basic and fundamental error test is “too vague and lends itself to inconsistent results.” See Justice Roberts’ dissenting opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Williams, <a href="/pa/432/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="432 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1919746" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0557-01">432 Pa. 557</a>, 570, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20301" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="248 A.2d 301">248 A. 2d 301</a>, 308 (1968). While we have treated each ease on its facts, we have said that alleged error in a charge, to which no objection was made, would only be considered on appeal where “it affects the merits or justice of the ease or, as some cases express it, offends against the fundamentals of a fair and impartial trial.” <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Jennings, supra, at page 25. It must be the type of erroneous charge which, if studiously followed by a jury, would prevent that jury from reaching a verdict favorable to a defendant, even if they believed the defendant’s version of the alleged crime and the defendant’s version, under the law, constituted a recognizable defense to the Commonwealth’s accusation, or at least required a verdict of a lower degree of homicide than that actually reached.</p>

It is conceivable that when the trial court gives an erroneous charge on a tangential issue, a trial counsel might refrain from objecting so as not to emphasize certain issues in the jury’s mind at the expense of others which he deems more crucial. However, when the court charges erroneously on an issue, and the defense case is abso<a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>lutely dependent upon the jury’s correct understanding of that issue, there can be no reasonable basis for defense counsel’s failure to object. Such an error we consider “basic and fundamental,” and to insure that the defendant received the fair trial to which he is entitled, we will consider the alleged error on appeal, even in the absence of an objection by his counsel.</p>
