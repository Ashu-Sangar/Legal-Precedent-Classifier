This principle is so well established that its basis is not normally a matter of discussion. There is, however, a deep undercurrent of reasons.

An expression indicative of favor or condemnation is quickly reflected in the jury box. ... To depart from the clear line of duty through questions, expressions or conduct, contravenes the orderly administration of justice.
