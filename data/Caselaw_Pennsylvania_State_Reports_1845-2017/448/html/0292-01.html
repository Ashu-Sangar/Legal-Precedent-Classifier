Roehrl in Harborcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania, on February 10, 1965. After testimony before the court en banc, he was adjudged guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. No appeal from the judgment was filed at that time. In November, 1967, after he had filed a post-conviction petition, <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>the court permitted appellant to file post-trial motions nunc pro tunc. Appellant then alleged that his plea of guilty should be invalidated because it was primarily induced or motivated by the existence of incriminating evidence unconstitutionally obtained. On appeal from the denial of these motions, we held that since appellant’s plea was made with the advice of counsel, and he did not allege that counsel’s advice was incompetent, his attack on the validity of his plea must fail. <em>Commonwealth v. Marsh, </em><a href="/pa/440/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="440 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="1932317" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0590-01">440 Pa. 590</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=271%20A.2d%20481" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="271 A.2d 481">271 A. 2d 481</a> (1970). However, we also found that constitutionally proscribed evidence was admitted during the degree-of - guilt hearing and, therefore, vacated the judgment and remanded the case for another degree-of-guilt hearing at which such evidence would not be admitted.</p>
    <p id="b442-4" data-blocks='[["BL_442.4",442,[207,1162,1155,429]]]'>On remand, upon motion of appellant’s counsel, the court below agreed on May 21, 1971, to suppress the testimony given by appellant at the previous degree-of - guilt hearing, because that testimony might have been impelled by the Commonwealth’s previous use of the tainted evidence, citing <em>Harrison v. United States, </em><a href="/us/392/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="392 U.S. 219" data-case-ids="6168861" data-case-paths="/us/392/0219-01">392 U.S. 219</a>, <a href="/us/392/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="392 U.S. 219" data-case-ids="6168861" data-case-paths="/us/392/0219-01">88 S.

    <p id="b442-5" data-blocks='[["BL_442.5",442,[202,1603,1157,760]]]'>During the period between the May 21 suppression order and the June 18 hearing date, there were frequent negotiations between appellant’s attorneys and the office of the District Attorney of Erie County. Those negotiations culminated in an agreement between opposing counsel that the Commonwealth would stipulate that the degree of guilt rose no higher than second degree in exchange for an agreement on the part of the appellant to forego any further appeals attempting to invalidate the existing guilty plea. The court refused to accept the agreement and, after the granting of a continuance to permit the Commonwealth to obtain all of its witnesses, the second degree-of-guilt hearing was held on July 28, 1971.</p>

      <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>This hearing resulted in a finding that the appellant was guilty of murder in the first degree. After denial of his post-trial motions and the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, appellant filed this appeal. On appeal, the appellant first alleges that the court should not have refused the stipulation that appellant’s guilt did not rise above second-degree murder and that the Commonwealth should not be allowed to disavow that agreement. We have repeatedly recognized that plea bargaining is an appropriate method of disposing of criminal cases. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, in those cases, we have made it clear that, although the opposing attorneys are bound by the agreement, the court is not bound to accept it and, if the court makes that fact clear to a defendant, the defendant cannot attack a plea made after the disclosure.</p>
    <p id="b443-3" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[157,1384,1150,703]]]'>In the instant case, the appellant did not plead guilty as the result of an agreement reached with the Commonwealth. Instead, his guilty plea was made prior to the agreement and we had already held that that plea could not be withdrawn. <em>Commonwealth v. Marsh, supra. </em>The only agreement made by the appellant was that he would make no further appellate or collateral attacks on the validity of his plea if the Commonwealth would stipulate that his degree of guilt rose no higher than second-degree murder. The court was not bound to accept the agreement and the appellant has, in fact made further attacks on the validity of the plea, which we will deal with herein.</p>
    <p id="b443-4" data-blocks='[["BL_443.5",443,[160,2101,1147,208]]]'>Since the appellant’s counsel admits that he was not lulled by reliance on the alleged agreement into failing to prepare properly for the hearing, appellant is entitled to no other remedy.</p>

    <p id="b445-4" data-blocks='[["BL_445.4",445,[163,712,1150,764]]]'>Most of appellant’s attack on the validity of his guilty plea is a repetition of arguments made in his previous appeal or :in his petition for reargument following our decision in that appeal. We are still convinced of the correctness of that decision. However, upon the request of the appellant, he was permitted to amend his motion for a new trial to include the specific allegation that the advice given to him by counsel at the time he originally entered his plea, was incompetently given. Since this allegation was not made in appellant’s previous appeal, and since, under the law of <em>McMann v.

I do not believe that the courts of this Commonwealth should allow a defendant to bargain away his rights to appellate review of his conviction or his rights of collateral attack. If a guilty plea has been voluntarily, intelligently, and lawfully entered, there is no need for a prosecutor to seek a further concession from a defendant that he surrender additionally whatever rights he may have to direct appeal or collateral review. To sanction such arrangements serves no proper interest of justice and would only invite attempts to insulate guilty pleas unlawfully obtained from appropriate appellate review.</p>
