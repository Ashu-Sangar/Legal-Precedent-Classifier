Appellee argues that the sentence of testator’s will which immediately precedes the signature is to be regarded as a specific residuary clause which bequeaths to appellants only whatever remains from the proceeds of testator’s insurance policies, after those proceeds are employed to pay for testator’s funeral. The property not specifically devised or bequeathed by testator’s will is valued at approximately $13,300, and consists largely of real estate valued at approximately $10,300.</p>

He wrote that I . . . hereby leave the <em>bulk </em>of my estate, . . .’ (underscoring by the court). The word ‘bulk’ is a common word used daily in regular conversations by millions of people. It has a common meaning. It means ‘most of’ or ‘the main part of’. We must assume that the decedent intended this word in the will to have the same meaning. The decedent’s gross estate is in excess of Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000), and the major portion not disposed of by his will was his real estate valued at Ten Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($10,300). Consequently, it can be seen that by his will he does dispose of the ‘bulk’ of his estate.”</p>

The court reasoned: “The audit statement disclosed that the insurance policies in question totaled Nineteen Hundred One and 14/100 Dollars ($1,901.14), which indicates that the decedent wanted these particular funds used to pay for his funeral expenses and the balance of said funds not so used he bequeathed to said minors. If he intended that all his other assets were to go to said minors; i.e., an amount in excess of Ten Thousand Dollars, he would not have written <em>‘If </em>there is anything left. . . .’ (underscoring by the court). Obviously he was referring to a small amount—anything left of his insurance money not used for the payment of the funeral bill.”</p>

There the question was whether the words “The balance, if any, to be divided into ten equal parts between” ten named persons related only to the immediately preceding bequest, or constituted a residuary clause to the entire will. Speaking' for the Court in holding for the latter alternative, Mr. Justice, later Chief Justice, Steen said: “A residuary clause is one which covers all of the estate not disposed of after providing for debts and particular legacies and devises. No technical mode of expression is necessary to constitute such a clause. ‘Balance’ is the vernacular for the legal phrase ‘rest, residue and remainder’: see Thompson’s Estate, <a href="/pa/237/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="237 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="988981" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0165-01">237 Pa. 165</a>, 169; Taylor’s Estate, <a href="/pa/239/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="239 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="995951,995953" data-case-paths="/pa/239/0153-02,/pa/239/0153-01">239 Pa. 153</a>, 163. The word ‘balance’ in the fifth paragraph of this will must be interpreted as meaning ‘balance <em>of the estate’, </em>there being no reason why it should be restricted to the balance of the fund derived from the items mentioned in the third paragraph: see In re Hayes’ Will, <a href="/ny/263/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="263 N.Y. 219" data-case-ids="2008490" data-case-paths="/ny/263/0219-01">263 N.Y. 219</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20N.E.%20716" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="188 N.E. 716">188 N.E. 716</a>. Whatever ambiguity exists must be resolved in accordance with the principle that a broad rather than a narrow construction of a residuary clause is favored in order to avoid intestacy, it being presumed that a testator intends to dispose of his whole estate: Fuller’s Estate, <a href="/pa/225/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="225 Pa. 626" data-case-ids="965344" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0626-01">225 Pa. 626</a>, 629; Carson’s Estate, <a href="/pa-super/130/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="130 Pa.

The first was the use of the tentative word “if” to introduce the last sentence.

This to me is quite unpersuasive; the amount of anyone’s residuary estate must in the nature of things be uncertain until death occurs, and there are many clearly written residuary clauses which, as matters eventuate, convey nothing to the legatee. That use of the words “if any” is not antithetical to the purpose of a residuary clause is demonstrated, <em>inter alia, </em>by our decision in <em>B richer Estate, supra, </em>335 Pa. at 303, and <em>Sorschek Estate, </em><a href="/pa/422/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="422 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="1901721" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0079-01">422 Pa. 79</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=221%20A.2d%20131" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="221 A.2d 131">221 A. 2d 131</a> (1966). Moreover, in the instant case, the testator’s estate at the time he drew the will exceeded the aggregate amount of specific bequests by only $3,000; it was solely because of the death of his mother, the other joint tenant to real estate, between the date of testator’s will and the date of his own death that the gross residuary estate at testator’s death rose to $13,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.4",556,[195,1314,1155,482]],["BL_557.1",557,[188,312,1147,378]]]'>The other reason for the lower court’s holding is that it thought the testator had clearly manifested an express intent <em>not </em>to dispose of all of his estate by the use of the word “bulk” in the second sentence. This word, said the court, means “most of”, but not “all”. That this is the common acceptation of “bulk” cannot be denied,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> but to declare that in a homespun document of this kind the word was deliberately used in order to create a partial intestacy seems to me to attribute <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>a semantological sophistication to the testator which is quite out of character with the rest of the will. Surely it is an equally tenable construction to consider the word “bulk” as relating to the specific bequests, which accounted for all but $3,000 (i.e., around 92%) of property owned at the time of writing the will. Thus viewed, the testator was in effect saying:</p>
    <blockquote id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[191,701,1145,154]]]'>“I hereby leave the bulk of my estate as follows: [i.e., the four specific bequests, plus instruction as to source of funeral expenses.]</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[191,866,1146,146]]]'>“If there is anything left after this [i.e., disposal of the ‘bulk’] it goes to the children of Mary Lou &amp; David.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b557-6" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[190,1032,1149,866]]]'>It is not necessary to take the position that this is the will’s manifest intent, but it is at least as reasonable as any other interpretation. In short, the will is ambiguous and unclear as to the meaning of “bulk” and as to the scope of the bequest in the last sentence. It is in just this sort of situation that the presumption against partial intestacy is designed to apply; it is in just this sort of situation that extrinsic evidence may be received to show intent. Such evidence may override the presumption, or confirm it. In the case at bar, the latter would have occurred, for the testimony (which the auditing judge felt obliged to disregard) was, in the words of his opinion, “that the decedent and his father [appellee] were not on good terms and that the decedent was friendly to the minor children, Lynn Christine Britton and Brian Lee Florek [appellants]”.</p>

[on] appellate review.” This proposition, however, is not here applicable. It pertains to cases in which the auditing judge, as the trier of fact, is required to hear <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>and review conflicting extrinsic evidence in order to resolve an issue of fact, which might be the testator’s intent, or some other question.

The rule is, of course, a proper recognition by appellate courts of the role of the judge as a fact-finder, including especially the peculiar opportunity which is his to observe witnesses and determine credibility. The same rules applies to findings by a chancellor, <em>Fec v.

Practice, Ch. 40, §107 (1962). In the case at bar there was no dispute of fact, no issue of credibility; indeed, as noted above, the auditing judge refused to consider extrinsic evidence offered to prove the testator’s intent. Such evidence was unnecessary, in the judge’s view, in light of his determination that the testator’s intent was obvious from an examination of the four corners of the instrument. This is not the sort of “fact finding” which is or should be controlling on appeal; although we should give the auditing judge’s opinion due weight, surely an appellate court possesses an equal capacity for determining the meaning of words and interpreting the language of a will from the undisputed factual circumstances.

Majestic Amusement Co., </em><a href="/pa/427/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="427 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1910419" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0429-01">427 Pa. 429</a>, 433, <a href="/citations/?q=234%20A.2d%20846" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="234 A.2d 846">234 A. 2d 846</a> (1967): “The facts are not in dispute.
