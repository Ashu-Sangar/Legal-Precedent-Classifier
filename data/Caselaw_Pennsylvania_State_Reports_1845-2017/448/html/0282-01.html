The officers transported Davis to St. Joseph’s Hospital for emergency treatment. At the hospital, Davis related that he had been talking to two young negro males after which-he heard a shot, felt a blow on the back of his head, and then observed the two boys running away. Davis did not know the names of the two boys and was unable to provide the police with an accurate description. On August 14, 1970, <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>Michael Davis died; the cause of death being a .22 caliber gunshot wound in the back of the head.</p>
    <p id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[166,432,1150,812]]]'>Larry Palmer, a seventeen-year-old black youth, was subsequently arrested and charged with the murder of Michael Davis. During Palmer’s non-jury trial, testimony revealed that the deceased and the appellant were members of rival Philadelphia gangs. The Commonwealth presented three witnesses who testified that during the week following the shooting of the deceased, the appellant approached them, and while engaged in conversation, admitted to them that he shot Davis in the back of the head. The witnesses further testified that shortly after the appellant admitted shooting Davis, the appellant pulled out a gun, and started shooting, causing injury to two persons. Palmer was found guilty of second degree murder and was sentenced to two and one-half to ten years imprisonment.</p>

We disagree. In Pennsylvania, the extrajudicial admissions or confessions of the accused are sufficient to convict, if the corpus delicti has been established by independent proof before the extra-judicial statements of the accused are received into evidence. <em>Commonwealth v.

They testified on direct examination that the appellant, a member of a rival gang, approached them while they were standing on a street corner and boasted to them that he had shot their comer man “Bird” (Davis) in the back of the head. The three witnesses also testified that shortly after the appellant informed them he was the one who shot Davis, he pulled a sawed-off rifle from under his coat and starting shooting, wounding two persons.</p>
    <p id="b435-3" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[180,937,1149,537]]]'>When the appellant testified, he denied shooting Davis, but did admit meeting the three Commonwealth witnesses, discussing with them the shooting of Davis, and then shooting several persons following the discussion. The judge found the testimony of the three witnesses more credible than that of the appellant, and chose to believe their testimony. Therefore, accepting their testimony as true, there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the crime charged.</p>
    <p id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.5",435,[183,1487,1151,859]]]'>The appellant also contends that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain a verdict of second degree murder. We do not agree. The common law definition of murder in Pennsylvania is “. . . an unlawful killing of another with malice aforethought, express or implied.” <em>Commonwealth v. Gooslin, supra. </em>By statute, murder is further classified into two degrees. Murder in the first degree is murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration of, or attempting to perpetuate any arson, rape, robbery, burglary, or kidnapping. <em>All other hinds of murder shall be murder in the second degree. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)

Here the killing was accomplished by use of a gun which lodged a .22 caliber bullet in the back of the victim’s head. Malice is properly implied when a deadly weapon is directed to a vital part of the body. <em>Commonwealth v.

We cannot agree. The sentence imposed by the trial court was according to the law which provides that those convicted of murder of the second degree, for the first time, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twenty (20) years. (18 P.S. 4701.) We cannot conclude that reservations as to guilt exist when a lower court imposes less than the maximum sentence.</p>
