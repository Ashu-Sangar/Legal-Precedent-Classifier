Leroy Irvis, a Negro, was brought into the Loyal Order of Moose, Lodge No. 107, appellee, as the guest of a member in good standing of the appellee lodge. Three other guests of the involved member were also present, but Mr. Irvis was the only non-Caucasian member of the party. Appellee’s personel refused to serve the party in either its dining room or its bar, and there is no dispute that that refusal was based solely on the fact that one of the members of the party was a Negro. Irvis complained to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, which, on January 13, 1969, instituted a complaint against the appellee lodge, alleging violations of the Public Accommodations Provisions of the Act of October 27, 1955, P. L. 744, as amended by the act of February 28, 1961, P. L. 47, 43 P.S. §951, et seq., known as the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. The lodge filed an answer to the complaint, in which it admitted the essential facts, but denied that it maintained a place of public accommodation and therefore claimed that the commission lacked jurisdiction and authority to deal with the refusal of service incident. In accordance with the provisions of the Human Relations Act, the commission conducted an investigation and found probable cause to proceed. Efforts to adjust the matter by conference, conciliation and persuasion were unsuccessful, and the commission then held a public hearing before hearing examiners. The parties entered into an agreed statement of facts which was adopted by the hearing examiners as their findings of fact, the pertinent portions of which are as follows:</p>

Section 4 of the Act,. 43 P.S. §954, defines a place of public accommodation as “any place which is open to, accepts or solicits the patronage of the general public . . . but shall not include any accommodations which are in their nature distinctly private.” The lodge concedes that any member of the general public who is of the Caucasian race and who is invited by a member of the lodge is welcome in its dining room. As aptly stated by the Superior Court dissenters: “The interests of privacy and exclusiveness of association which the Act acknowledged by creating its exclusion for fraternal organizations have been compromised by the policies of the organization itself. Any member of the public, regardless of affection or disaffection for the [lodge] and regardless of eligibility for membership (as in the case of women and children) may intrude upon the privacy and exclusiveness of the Moose dining room, so long as there is some member of the Moose who will stand account<a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>able for his conduct while on the premises . . . that is, any Caucasian member of the public.”</p>
    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.4",607,[160,442,1151,1023]]]'>The lodge argues that the amendment to § 5 of the act, enacted in 1961, was intended to grant immunity to fraternal organizations. Undoubtedly the act, as hereinabove quoted, does grant to fraternal organizations the right to discriminate on any basis upon which they desire to discriminate, but only when those actions are based on membership. Moreover, that language must be read in the light of the language of §4, which refers to facilities which are “distinctly private”. Therefore, fraternal organizations “are immune from the requirement of §5 when the accommodation or activity is related to membership in the organization, <em>and </em>when that activity or accommodation is distinctly private as to the members of that organization. There is absolutely no indication that the Legislature intended to grant fraternais a second distinct exception and one going beyond ‘membership.’” (Emphasis in original.) <em>Com. Human Rel. Comm. v. L.O.O.M., supra, </em>dissenting opinion, at page 361.</p>
    <p id="b607-6" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[163,1478,1148,420]]]'>There is, of course, no question that when the lodge leases its facilities to nonmembers, a place of public accommodation exists and the lodge does in fact follow a nondiscriminatory policy in such circumstances. The opening of the facilities to guests of members is a difference in degree rather than in character, and each constitutes a step beyond the limited area of immunity granted by the Unman Relations Act.</p>
    <p id="b607-7" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[163,1911,1150,426]]]'>The Superior Court dissenters were correct in resolving the construction of the act in the framework of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, §52, 46 P.S. §552. The act states, in part: “That the Legislature intends to favor the public interest as against any private interest.” No such public interest could be favored by a construction of the legislative intent such as is urged by the lodge.</p>

      <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>The Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, although it found the actions of the lodge to be “morally indefensible” and the conduct of the lodge’s agents to be “deficient in good manners and common sense”, fell into error by concluding that the accommodations in question were distinctly private, not a place of public accommodation and, therefore, beyond the reach of the Human Relations Act. The findings and declaration of policy contained in the Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. §952, clearly indicate the legislative intent, and a contrary decision by this Court would fly directly in the face of that stated policy. That is not to say that under the Act the lodge may not discriminate in whatever manner it pleases in determining its qualifications for membership. Having gone beyond that point, however, and made its facilities available to nonmembers, it may not do so on a discriminatory basis in violation of the Human Relations Act.</p>
