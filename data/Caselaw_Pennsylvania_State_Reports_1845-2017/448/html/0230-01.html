The police subsequently sought and located Linde’s automobile parked at a service station about 550 yards from the Nolan home. A police officer was dispatched to the hospital, and he obtained the keys to the vehicle from the hospital custodian. When the car was unlocked and searched, the police found a notebook containing five pages of handwritten thoughts. On June 2Srd the police presented these writings to Linde in the hospital and, after acknowledging he had written them, he initialed each page. The writings were of a most incriminating nature. One note as being written at 8:30 p.m. on June 12th told of Linde stealing the gun and also of his intention to kill Ruth Nolan. The writings were introduced against Linde at trial.</p>

Moreover, it is very clear that only in exigent circumstances will the judgment of the police as to probable cause serve as a sufficient authorization for a warrantless search. See Coolidge v.

Thus, a dual inquiry, both parts requiring affirmative answers must be made: first, whether there existed probable cause to search; and secondly, whether exigent circumstances can be found to excuse the obtaining of a warrant. Even assuming arguendo, the police had probable cause to <em>search </em>Linde’s vehicle, absence of exigent circumstances makes the search executed contrary to constitutional dictates.</p>
    <p id="b381-3" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[179,1265,1148,541]]]'>The record discloses that from the moment the vehicle was located until the search ensued, it was kept under constant police guard. At the time of the search, it was locked, unoccupied and the police were in possession of the keys. Linde himself was in the hospital undergoing emergency surgery, and there was no danger he would move it. Thus, no good reason existed why a search warrant could not be obtained. The “exigent circumstances” required for a warrantless search were clearly absent.</p>

The Court held the fact that the police opted to arrest the occupants and transport the vehicle to the police station before conducting the search was merely a matter of convenience and did not vitiate the authority to conduct a warrantless search.</p>

The only persuasive evidence that he had the requisite mental state to be guilty of murder in the first degree, rather than murder in the second degree was the record of his plans and intent to kill Euth Nolan, as written in the notebook.</p>
