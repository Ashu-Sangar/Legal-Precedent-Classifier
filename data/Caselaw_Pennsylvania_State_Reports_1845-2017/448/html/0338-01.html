Doctors have recommended a “spinal fusion” to relieve Ricky’s bent position, which would involve moving bone from Ricky’s pelvis to his spine. Although an orthopedic specialist testified, “there is no question that there is danger in this type of operation”, the mother did consent conditionally to the surgery. The condition is that, since the mother is a Jehovah’s Witness who believes that the Bible proscribes any blood transfusions which would be necessary for this surgery,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> she would not consent to any blood transfusions.

And neither rights of religion nor rights of parenthood are beyond limitation. Acting to guard the general interest in youth’s well being, the state as <em>parens patriae </em>may restrict the parent’s control by requiring school attendance [footnote omitted], regulating or prohibiting the child’s labor [footnote omitted] and in many other ways [footnote omitted]. Its authority is not nullified merely because the parent grounds his claim to control the child’s course of conduct on religion or conscience. Thus, he cannot claim freedom from compulsory vaccination for the child more than for himself on religious grounds [footnote omitted]. The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death. People v.

The catalogue need not be lengthened. It is sufficient to show what indeed appellant hardly disputes, that the state has a wide range of power for limiting parental freedom and authority in things affecting the child’s welfare; and that this includes, to some extent, matters of conscience and religious conviction.” On the other hand, the United States Supreme Court recently stated, “to agree that religiously grounded conduct must often be subject to the broad police power of the State is not to deny that there are areas of conduct protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and thus beyond <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>the power of the State to control, even under regulations of general applicability.” <em>Wisconsin v.

Stated differently, does the State have an interest of sufficient magnitude to warrant the abridgment of a parent’s right to freely practice his or her religion when those beliefs preclude medical treatment of a son or daughter whose life is not in immediate danger?

Kevin Sampson, fifteen years old, suffered from Von Eecldinghauson’s disease which caused a massive disfigurement of the right side of his face and neclc. While the incurable disease posed no immediate threat to his life, the dangerous surgery requiring blood transfusions would improve “not only the function but the appearance” of his face and neck. It should also be noted that all physicians involved counselled deiay until the boy was old enough to decide since the surgical risk would decrease as the boy grew older. The Family Court judge ruled in an extensive opinion that the State’s interest in the child’s health was paramount to the mother’s religious beliefs. That court further decided not to place this difficult decision on the boy and to order an immediate operation, thereby preventing psychological problems.

If we were to describe this surgery as “required”, like the Court of Appeals, our decision would conflict with the mother’s religious beliefs. Aside from religious considerations, one can also question the use of that adjective on medical grounds since an orthopedic specialist testified that the operation itself was dangerous. Indeed, one can question who, other than the Creator, has the right to term certain surgery as “required”. This fatal/ non-fatal distinction also steers the courts of this Commonwealth away from a medical and philosophical morass: if spinal surgery can be ordered, what about a hernia or gall bladder operation or a hysterectomy? The problems created by <em>Sampson </em>are endless. We are of the opinion that as between a parent and the state, the state does not have an interest of sufficient magnitude outweighing a parent’s religious beliefs when the child’s life is <em>not immediately imperiled </em>by his physical condition.</p>

In <em>Yoder, </em>Mr. Justice Douglas, dissenting in part, wanted to remand the matter in order to determine whether the Amish children wished to continue their education in spite of their parents’ beliefs: “if an Amish child desires to attend high school, and is mature enough to have that desire respected, the State may well be able to override the parents’ religiously motivated objections.” <a href="/us/406/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="406 U.S. 205" data-case-ids="6170178" data-case-paths="/us/406/0205-01">406 U.S. at 242</a>.

While the record before us gives no indication of Ricky’s thinking, it is the child rather than the parent in this appeal who is directly involved which thereby distinguishes <em>Yoder’s </em>decision not to discuss the beliefs of the parents vis-a-vis the children.

The First Amendment of the United States Constitution, as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that the States shall not limit the free exercise of religion.

Acting to guard the general interest in youth’s well being, the state as <em>parens patriae </em>may restrict the parent’s control. . . . Its authority is not nullified merely because the parent grounds his claim to control the child’s course of conduct on religion or conscience. . . .

Ct. 1970), recently answered this question in the affirmative in an almost identical situation. The case involved a 15-year-old boy who required an admittedly dangerous operation for the partial correction of a facial deformity. His mother was a Jehovah’s Witness and opposed the necessary blood transfusions. The court held that despite the fact that there was no immediate threat to the child’s life, the operation would be less risky and of more benefit if performed immediately. Therefore, it found the boy neglected within the meaning of the New York Family Court Act, which is very similar to our statute. After reviewing the decisions involving <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>emergency situations, the court concluded that: ‘[Although the mother’s religious objections to the administration of a blood transfusion ... is finished upon the scriptures and is sincerely held, it must give way before the state’s paramount duty to insure his right to live and grow up without disfigurement—the right to live and grow up with a sound mind and body. “Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves.

Moreover, the following language supports the position that the boy should have the operation: “To be sure, the power of the parent, even when linked to a free <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>exercise claim, may be subject to limitation under Prince if it appears <em>that the parental decisions will jeopardize the health </em>or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens.” (Emphasis supplied.) <a href="/us/406/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="406 U.S. 205" data-case-ids="6170178" data-case-paths="/us/406/0205-01">Id. at 233-234</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20S.%20Ct.%201542" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="92 S.
