Appellant argues that “grossly unprofessional conduct” is intended by the Legislature to constitute only the thirteen specific types of conduct enumerated in subsection (9). Appellant urges therefore that a finding that he did not violate any of these provisions or any other provision in the Pharmacy Act including rules adopted thereunder or any other law of Pennsylvania compels the conclusion that the Board exceeded its statutory authority in suspending appellant’s license for one year and revoking indefinitely his permit.

The focus of judicial inquiries thus should shift from statutory standards to administrative safeguards and administrative standards. . . . [T]he protections should grow beyond the non-delegation doctrine to a much broader requirement, judicially enforced, that as far as is practicable administrators must structure their discretionary power through appropriate safeguards and must confine and guide their discretionary powers through standards, principles and rules.

Reliance on rule-making powers would minimize these dangers. The statute provides adequate standards. See text accompanying notes 8-9 supra.

In <em>Cherry, </em>the court of appeals reversed a suspension of a dental license because the regulation relied upon banned conduct which had been impliedly sanctioned by the Legislature. The court (Justice Lehman) observed: “The Board of Regents cannot, as we have said, suspend or revoke the license of a dentist, for any cause not specified in section 1311, subdivision 2. It cannot ban as unprofessional conduct which has been impliedly sanctioned by the Legislature. Nor can it by regulation ban, as unprofessional, <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>conduct which, though not expressly impliedly sanctioned by the Legislature, accords with the standards accepted as proper by the ‘consensus of expert opinion’. <em>Even so there remains a large field in wh/ich the Board of Regents may by the exercise of its specific supervisory power ‘prescribe canons by 'which conduct deemed by it, in the exercise of fair judgment, to be unprofessional and objectionable’ is banned. ... In such case the regulation serves to apprise all practitioners of the standards which the official body authorized to supervise the profession deems necessary, and those who choose to disregard the wanning do so at their peril.’’ </em>Id. at 158-59, 44 N.IS. 2d at 412 (emphasis added).
