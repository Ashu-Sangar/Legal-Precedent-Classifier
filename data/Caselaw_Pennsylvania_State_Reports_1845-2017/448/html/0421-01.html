In that case, the. present appellants, who were also appellants there, appealed from a decision of the Court of Common Pleas <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>of Philadelphia affirming a decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment of Philadelphia.</p>

We found the zoning ordinance to be “a classic instance of spot zoning,” declared the rezoning ordinance invalid and reversed.</p>

The continuance of construction led to a petition to this Court by the successful appellants for an order to enforce our decision of October 9, 1970. On January 29, 1971. we entered an order which, inter alia, directed that no farther construction of the nursing home be continued nor any operation of that nursing home be commenced until after the determination of certain equity proceedings then pending in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>

Appellants have appealed that determination to this Court and have, in addition, requested that this Court impose sanctions on appellees for violation of this Court’s order of January 29, 1971.
