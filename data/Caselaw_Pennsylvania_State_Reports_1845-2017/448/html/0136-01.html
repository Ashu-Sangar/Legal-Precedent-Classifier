    <p id="b288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_288.4",288,[194,713,1153,596]]]'>As noted previously, St. John’s is chartered as a nonprofit corporation under the laws of Pennsylvania. The Articles of Incorporation describe St. John’s as a “Greek Catholic Church” which in itself is a somewhat ambiguous term. (See <em>Malanchuk v. St. Mary’s Creek Catholic Church of McKees Rocks, </em><a href="/pa/336/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="336 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1195595" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0385-01">336 Pa. 385</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20350" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 A.2d 350">9 A. 2d 350</a> (1939)). However, any ambiguity generated is at once dispelled by the clear terms with which the Articles further declare St. John’s to be a church “free and independent of and from any higher church authority or any larger or higher church body.”</p>
    <p id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.5",288,[193,1321,1153,595]]]'>Additionally, the duly enacted by-laws of the corporation reiterate this declaration of independence from higher episcopal authority (Church By-laws, Part 1, Paragraph 5) and further state: “The congregation has full power to select their own Bishop. The congregation pays catedratieum and other assessments to the Bishop only to that time that she is in accord with the Bishop. The congregation automatically ceases to have any connection or relations with the Bishop when she ceases paying diocesan assessments.” Church Bylaws, Part 1, Paragraph 6.</p>

Such facts as these are alleged to have established that Father Musko’s use of the church property as a priest united with Borne constitutes a diversion of the property from its originally intended use as an Orthodox church subject to Bishop Chornock’s episcopal authority.</p>
    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[166,929,1153,929]]]'>The difficulty in terms of proof is that most of this evidence pertains to what Father Musko did as an individual. None of it had the effect of jeopardizing St. John’s standing as an independent church. More importantly, the Articles of Incorporation and the bylaws clearly and beyond cavil establish St. John’s was founded as and is presently an independent church. And where autonomous existence of an incorporated church is clearly evident from its charter and by-laws, this is conclusive. In such an instance, a civil court may not declare the church to be a member of some higher church body merely because of ritual, practice or tribute to that higher church organization. See <em>St. Michael and Archangel Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church v. Uhniat, </em><a href="/pa/436/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="436 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1926096" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0222-01">436 Pa. 222</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=259%20A.2d%20862" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="259 A.2d 862">259 A. 2d 862</a> (1969), and <em>Dochkus v.

Therein, the language of the charter of the church involved was ambiguous and unclear. Hence, the governmental nature of the church could not be determined from the charter itself, and the court necessarily turned to a consideration of the rituals and practices of the church to determine if it were founded as an independent church or one that was a constituent part of a hierarchially governed church organization.</p>

In 3960 the church trustees refused to sign a resolution tendered to them by Bishop Chornock which would have declared the church to be “an organic part and member of the American Garpatho-Bussian Orthodox Greek Catholic Diocese.” Additionally, the minutes of the February 7, 1960 meeting show that the invitation to bless the church extended to Bishop Chornock <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>came from Father Musko personally, on the advice of legal counsel. This procedure was chosen so that congregational action would not be involved as well as to avoid any appearance of submission to jurisdiction. Hence, the position St. John’s took is in many ways similar to that of the <em>Malanch-uk </em>ease, supra, where it was found that, “The members of the parish were honored at the visitation from high church dignitaries but they never lost the independence which made them reject further affiliation with those dignitaries. . . .” <a href="/citations/?q=336%20Pa.%20395" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="336 Pa. 395">336 Pa. 395</a>.</p>
