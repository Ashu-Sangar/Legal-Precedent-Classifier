The inherent defect, in their estimation, is the deprivation of contractual and property rights; rights which were vested in the holders of life memberships and which cannot be divested without their consent. The property right so vested is declared to be the unqualified right to transfer each such certificate <em>in perpetuity, </em>exempt from dues and assessments in the hands of the holder.</p>

    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[186,1006,1149,1086]]]'>We take as our starting point scrutiny of the term <em>life member, </em>in general and in the context in which it appears in the membership certificate document. While there is a dearth of cases on the point the term “life membership” was discussed by the court in <em>Masonic Country Club of Western Michigan v. Holden, </em><a href="/f2d/12/0951-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 F.2d 951" data-case-ids="1644690" data-case-paths="/f2d/12/0951-01">12 F. 2d 951</a> (1926). At issue was the tax consequence of club membership. Analyzing the nature of such a membership, the court said at page 955: “It is a matter of common knowledge, of which this court will take judicial notice, that the kind of membership in clubs and organizations such as the plaintiff which is cal hid life membership is a familiar one, and constitutes essentially, as its name indicates, membership for life, subject to earlier termination only by resignation or dishonorable expulsion.” See also, <em>Martin v. Town &amp; Country Development, Inc., </em><a href="/cal-app-2d/230/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="230 Cal.

As was earlier noted, the certificate plainly states that, “The member<a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>ship hereby represented is perpetually exempt from dues and assessments, but is subject to all other bylaws and rules.” However, the word “perpetual” appears but once on the certificate and then as a modifer of the phrase “dues and assessments”. At no point does it modify the term “life member” nor in logic can it be transposed to do so. Moreover, if the word “perpetual” were given the meaning for which appellants contend, i.e., an indefinite existence or duration on the part of the membership and a right of perpetual transferability, the title “Life Member” would be bereft of meaning. Nor do we overlook the fact that the second paragraph of the certificate deals with the very matter of transferability and yet fails to use the word “perpetual”.</p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[202,1119,1155,471]]]'>We attribute little significance to the 1948 amendment to the title in the bylaws which formerly read “Life Members” and which now reads “Life [Perpetual] Members”. We are instead persuaded by the reasoning of the lower court that, “At the most all that was intended was an attempted clarification and conformity to the legend on the Life Member Certificate that that membership was perpetually exempt from dues and assessments.”</p>
    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[201,1612,1156,644]]]'>Appellants couple their argument that a vested property right in these memberships certificates arises by virtue of the contract between the Association and its individual members with the conclusion that this case is thus governed by such decisions as that of <em>Marshall v. Pilots Association, </em><a href="/pa/206/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="206 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="931908" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0182-01">206 Pa. 182</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.%20916" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="55 A. 916">55 A. 916</a> (1903), and <em>Becker v.

Therein this Court refused to sanction what it deemed to be a forfeiture or impairment of preexisting contract rights vested in the membership. The difficulty as we perceive it lies in the major premise of the aforementioned argument.</p>
    <p id="b306-6" data-blocks='[["BL_306.6",306,[204,2269,1151,105]],["BL_307.1",307,[186,312,1152,1198]]]'>• In our view the contract in the instant case consists of two elements: (1) the certificates of membership, <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>ami (2), the bylaws (including subsequent amendments) of the corporation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In lucid terms the certificate declares the holder to he perpetually exempt from all dues and assessments hut “subject to all other bylaws and rules” and “transferable ... in accordance with the provisions of the bylaws.” Emanating as they do from the bylaws, the rights of the membership (including any right of transfer) are qualified from the outset. Any right granted could thus be revoked or changed. See <em>Moon v. Locomotive Engineers Ins. Ass’n., </em><a href="/pa/343/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="343 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1208355" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0472-01">343 Pa. 472</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20474" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="23 A.2d 474">23 A. 2d 474</a> (1942). While it would have been possible for the Association to fix forever all of the rights of life members, thus rendering them insusceptible to future alteration, the documents critical to this case indicate eschewal of such an approach since certificate rights (save in the areas of dues and assessments) are made totally dependent upon the bylaws. Appellants’ reasoning, if accepted, would lead to an anomalous result in that their contract rights, if determined to he absolute and vested (with an unbridled right of transfer) would be different from and greater than their source, the bylaws.</p>

In none of the cases cited were rights expressly taken and accepted subject to all bylaws of the organization. Furthermore, we are not convinced that the principles operating in the case of <em>Schaad v. Hotel Easton Co., </em><a href="/pa/369/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="369 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1232361" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0486-01">369 Pa. 486</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20227" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="87 A.2d 227">87 </a><a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a><a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20227" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="87 A.2d 227">A. 2d 227</a> (1952), are in all ways relevant to the instant case. <em>Schaad </em>involved the attempted impairment through bylaw amendment of the rights of a preferred stockholder. Our Court held that certain contractual rights between a corporation and its members cannot be destroyed by a simple amendment to the bylaws without the consent of all those concerned even where there is provision for amendment. The Pittsburgh Athletic Association is, however, a nonprofit, <em>nonstock </em>corporation. The entirety of its assets is vested in the corporation alone; members are not and cannot be deemed <em>owners </em>in any sense of the term. What is being claimed presently is a vested right in the membership itself. Such a concept is rather ill-suited to consensual societies and clubs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> We adopt the pertinent observation of the chancellor that: “Inherent in the idea of a social club is the notion that those who make up the association be free to choose [possibly subject to certain limitations not here pertinent] who should belong and upon what terms. It is true that the right to choose its members may be given up by such a club. However, we find that this was not the intention here and we will not do it by indirection.”</p>

In their original complaint appellants asserted the amendment did not receive the necessary vote. Prior to the commencement of trial there was some on-the-record discussion about stipulating the number of votes cast. Appellants were willing to stipulate that 278 members attended the meeting and that the teller’s count showed 179 votes for the resolution and 83 against. Appellee would not stipulate as to the <em>accuracy </em>of the teller’s count. Disagreement centered around some 12 votes plus the question of how many members were still in attendance at the time of the vote. At this point the on-the-record stipulation discussion bogged down and ended inconclusively. The crucial fact of which we must take cognizance is that <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>at trial, counsel for appellants introduced no evidence whatsoever on the issue of whether or not the amendment carried.</p>
