He furtively glanced at the officers and then made a sudden dash into a nearby bar, causing the police to chase in hot pursuit. Upon reaching the bar, the officers saw Ray drop a .22 calibre pistol to the floor, a firearm which later was discovered to be loaded <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>and unlicensed. Ray was taken into custody on the spot, escorted to police headquarters and later taken before a magistrate. Subsequently, an indictment was returned by the grand jury charging Ray with carrying a concealed deadly weapon,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and unlawfully carrying a firearm without a license.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Attached to the indictment was a small slip of paper reciting a summary offense<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> against Ray to wit, violation of Section 10-814 of the Philadelphia Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[178,560,1154,596]]]'>The first witness called by the Commonwealth was a police officer who had observed Ray with the gun and who had made the arrest. The next state witness, another policeman, testified that a search of the records revealed no license for the firearm had been issued. This same witness then attempted to testify concerning an incriminating statement Ray made to the police. The trial judge refused to allow this evidence, citing as his reason the Commonwealth’s failure to establish a corpus delicti. The court asserted that the element lacking for proof of the corpus was that of concealment.</p>

Subsequently, the Superior Court denied the motion to quash, and filed an opinion ruling Section 10-814 of the Philadelphia Code was “unconstitutional” because it attempted to extend Philadelphia’s authority and power beyond the limits granted by the legislature.

    <p id="b459-7" data-blocks='[["BL_459.7",459,[188,1378,1148,706]]]'>On the record presented, the Superior Court erred in not quashing the appeal. If in its verdict of “not guilty” the trial court intended to include the asserted violation of Section 10-814 of the Philadelphia Code, an appeal does not lie. The Commonwealth may not appeal from a verdict of “not guilty” entered by the trial court in a criminal prosecution and this is so whether the prosecution be by indictment or by summary proceeding. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b460-4" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[183,548,1157,980]]]'>It is fundamental that generally an appeal will lie only from a definitive order, decree or judgment which finally terminates the action. <em>Middleberg v.

Additionally, the right of the Commonwealth to appeal is highly circumscribed. See <em>Gaskins Case, </em><a href="/pa/430/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="430 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1915774" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0298-01">430 Pa. 298</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20662" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="244 A.2d 662">244 A. 2d 662</a> (1968). It is true we have ruled the Commonwealth may appeal from certain pretrial orders involving a pure question of law and which in effect terminate the action. See <em>Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, </em><a href="/pa/411/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="411 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="1885971" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0056-01">411 Pa. 56</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20304" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="190 A.2d 304">190 A. 2d 304</a> (1963). However, where, as here, the trial court does not agree with the Commonwealth’s position on a question of constitutionality or statutory construction, in order to preserve its right to appeal the Commonwealth must insure the entry of an appropriate final order. See and compare, <em>Commonwealth v. Lodge No. 148, L.O.O.M., </em>supra; and <em>Commonwealth v. Arnold, </em><a href="/pa-super/215/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="215 Pa.
