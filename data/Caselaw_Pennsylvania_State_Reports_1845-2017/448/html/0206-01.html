Hawkins orally admitted to White that he fired the shot which caused Howell’s death, but said he had acted in self-defense.

There a confession was obtained from defendant at a time when he was represented by court-appointed counsel, a fact well known to the interrogating officers. No notice was given by these officers to defendant’s counsel of the intended interviews and he was not present when the statement was taken. The court was asked to rule that any statement, admission, or confession secured by police from one represented by an attorney, where the attorney was not timely advised of the proposed interview or interrogation, be rejected as violative of the right to counsel.

One does not need to be reminded that the protection afforded by the majority rule may be hollow indeed if the suspect must rely solely on his testimony to contravert the Commonwealth’s evidence of waiver regardless of the burden of proof imposed.</p>
    <p id="b371-4" data-blocks='[["BL_371.5",371,[198,1446,1147,596]]]'>The reluctance of the majority to reach this conclusion is most difficult to comprehend in view of the time honored prohibition that an attorney may not confer with an opposing party who is represented by counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Surely it is not considered that an attorney’s integrity is more suspect or his motives more sinister than that of police officials. No time in the prosecution of a criminal complaint is more critical than during custodial interrogation. In many instances, answers given in response to questions render subsequent assistance by counsel impotent.</p>

Here we are not concerned with unsolicited admissions but rather <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>inculpatory statements as a result of interrogation. Equally inapplicable is the argument that the suspect has the right to waive the presence of counsel during interrogation. The rule I suggest does not destroy this right, the suspect after consultation may still elect to dismiss his counsel and proceed with the interrogation in his absence. It does however, insure that he is fully appraised of the possible consequences of this course of action before the decision.</p>

He appeared to be functioning in a dull-normal level of intelligence.</p>

        <em>Miranda </em>does require that questioning must cease when the suspect expresses his desire for counsel. Questioning cannot be resumed without counsel unless the resumption is initiated by the suspect. <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. at 444-45</a>. It is certainly not a major departure to suggest that the obtaining of counsel is in fact an expression by the defendant that he wishes his presence during the critical stages of the proceedings.</p>
