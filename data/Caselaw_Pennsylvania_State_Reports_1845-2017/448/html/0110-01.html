      <p id="b260-7" data-blocks='[["BL_260.7",260,[194,1917,1152,172]]]'> The Commonwealth attempts to justify the trial court’s comment on the guilt of the accused on the ground that appellant’s defense counsel indicated to the jury that he thought his client was guilty of murder in the second degree.</p>

Though the trial court in its charge indicated that appellant’s attorney had made such a statement, that statement does not appear in the record, and we believe it far more likely that appellant’s experienced counsel, attempting to avoid a felony-<a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>murder conviction, indicated to the jury that <em>if his client was guilty of any offense, </em>it was second degree murder.</p>
      <p id="b261-10" data-blocks='[["BL_261.2",261,[189,1187,1147,487]]]'>Moreover, even if appellant’s attorney made such a statement, it would not justify the court’s comment. As the American Bar Association’s Code of Professional Responsibility provides: “In appearing in his professional capacity before a tribunal, a lawyer shall not . . . [ajssert his personal opinion ... as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. . . .” Disciplinary Rule 7-106(0) (4). Since appellant had elected to exercise his constitutional right to trial by jury, we could not permit his counsel <em>sua sponte </em>to make a statement that would be equivalent to a guilty plea by appellant. The Commonwealth cannot justify the trial court’s error by an error of the defense counsel.</p>
      <p id="b261-12" data-blocks='[["BL_261.3",261,[186,1696,1150,636]]]'>Filially, even if appellant’s attorney did state that in his opinion his client was guilty of second degree murder, the trial court did not rely on such a statement in making its comment on appellant’s guilt, but actually instructed the jury to disregard the statement of appellant’s counsel. The trial court first told the jury: ‘•My thinking is that both sides in this case agree that it is murder in the first degree. The Commonwealth says that there was a burglary, or a robbery, or both, and that the defendant did it. The defendant says there was a robbery, or burglary, or both, but that he did not do it—two other men did.” This statement, combined with the judge’s statement that it would be a “miscarriage of justice” to find the defendant not guilty, amounted to a direction to the jury to find the defendant guilty of first degree murder, which they did.</p>
