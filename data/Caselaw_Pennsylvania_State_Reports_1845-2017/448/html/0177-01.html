Specifically, it is argued that this testimony allowed the jury to infer that the appellant had a prior criminal record. Appellant also alleges error in the trial court’s denial of his motions for the production and examination of the police reports which contained the results of interviews with the Commonwealth’s witnesses who testified at trial. Since we find the references to the photographs sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial, we will deal exclusively with that issue.</p>

Bruno, supra, </em>the last decision in this line of reversals, specifically held that in view of the victim’s positive in-court identification of the defendant, not weakened by cross-examination, the reference to photographic identification was irrelevant, and because of the possible prejudice arising from the reference, a new trial was required. 215 Pa. Superior Ct. at 410-11, 258 A. 2d at 668. Even though this holding seems to imply that as a matter of law mere reference to a police photograph will disable the jury from presuming the defendant’s innocence, the Superior Court has since rejected the contention that prejudice automatically follows after reference to a police photograph and concluded that the entire record must be studied in order to determine whether, in light of all the evidence, prejudice against the defendant did <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>in fact exist. <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Taylor, <a href="/pa-super/219/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="219 Pa.

    <p id="b329-3" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[195,457,1149,1197]]]'>Due to the apparent inconsistencies which have resulted from these Superior Court decisions we find it necessary to clarify the law in this area. The suggestion that any reference to a defendant’s photograph is so prejudicial that an inflexible rule of reversal must apply is explicitly rejected. We hold that after the reference to a photograph the controlling question is whether or not a juror could reasonably infer from the facts presented that the accused had engaged in prior criminal activity. A mere passing reference to photographs from which a reasonable inference of prior criminal activity cannot properly be drawn does not invalidate the proceedings since there has been no prejudice as a result of the reference; so too, where it appears on the face of the record that there is an explanation of the police possession of the photograph unrelated to any inference of prior criminal activity. Thus, testimony suggesting that the photograph was secured from a school yearbook or from the possession of acquaintances of the defendant illustrates situations where the suspect is not prejudiced by the photographic reference.</p>

The presumed effect of such evidence is to predispose the minds of the jurors to believe the accused guilty, and thus effectually to strip him of the presumption of innocence.” <em>Commonwealth v. Trowery, </em><a href="/pa-super/211/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="211 Pa. Super. 171" data-case-ids="781537" data-case-paths="/pa-super/211/0171-01">211 Pa.

Recognizing the prejudicial effect of such evidence, there is no justification for indirectly allowing the introduction of prior criminal activity by reference to photographs of the accused.
