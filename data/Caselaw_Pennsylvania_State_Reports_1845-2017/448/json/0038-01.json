Under the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, \u00a7502(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7211.502(a) (Supp. 1972), the appeal was required to be filed within thirty (30) days of the entry of the decree in the court below. The instant appeal was not filed until August 12, 1971, or thirty-one (81) days after the entry of the decree in the court below.\nWhere an act of assembly fixes the time within which an appeal may be taken, the time may not be extended as a matter of indulgence. See, e.g., Luckenbach v. Luckenbach, 443 Pa. 417, 281 A. 2d 169 (1971), and cases cited therein.\nAppeal quashed. Each party to pay own costs.",
