        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nOn February 1,1969, Albert Schaab, age forty-three, was set upon and beaten by a group of young men. Appellant was a member of that group. They struck Schaab several times, dropped him to the ground and kicked Mm in the head. Sehaab was immediately taken to Philadelphia General Hospital, in a \u201csemi-stuporous state.\u201d On April 8,1969, sixty-seven days later, he died. On November 19, 1970, appellant, with counsel, waived a jury trial. The Commonwealth certified that the case would rise no higher than second-degree murder. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge found appellant guilty of second-degree murder. On December 81,1970, after appellant\u2019s post-trial motions were withdrawn, he was sentenced to a term of not less than two nor more than four years in the State Correctional Institution. Appellant has appealed from the judgment of sentence.\nThe sole issue raised on appeal is whether the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Schaab\u2019s death was caused by the criminal assault in which appellant participated. Dr. Halbert Fillinger, the Medical Examiner, was the sole medical witness on this issue. He testified that the deceased \u201chad a preexisting condition of internal hydrocephalus,\u201d identified as \u201can increase in the amount of fluid and pressure inside the hollow spaces of the brain, and it is due to a narrowing or a closing of the small vents wMch allow fluid to circulate from inside of the brain to the areas around it.\u201d However, according to Dr. Fillinger, if that condition were not disturbed, \u201cit would probably not be in and of itself lethal.\u201d The exact cause of death, according to Dr. Fillinger, was \u201cependymitis following internal hydrocephalus, due to multipie injuries of the head.\u201d Ependymitis was defined by Dr. Fillinger as an \u201cinflammation of the linings of the cavities of the brain\u201d which narrows the vents in the brain.\nAccording to Dr. Fillinger\u2019s explanation, Mr. Sehaab\u2019s pre-existing condition was aggravated by the serious beating which he received. The result was a blockage of these vents and a buildup of fluid and pressure on the brain which caused his loss of consciousness and swelling of the brain. To relieve this condition, a craniotomy was performed. That operation involved the opening of Sehaab\u2019s skull and \u201cthe insertion of a small plastic tube (a shunt) which bypasses the blocked vents in the brain and allows the pressure which has built up inside the brain to be siphoned off. . ..\u201d (Parenthetical material added.) As a result of the craniotomy, unfortunately, a staph infection developed in the deceased\u2019s brain. The infection further aggravated the ependymitis. The deceased\u2019s condition went generally downhill until he died eight days later.\nThe appellant, citing Commonwealth v. Embry, 441 Pa. 183, 272 A. 2d 178 (1971), and Commonwealth v. Radford, 428 Pa. 279, 236 A. 2d 802 (1968), contends that the testimony of the Medical Examiner was not sufficiently clear and unequivocal to establish the cause of death beyond a reasonable doubt. However, Dr. Fillinger\u2019s testimony was much more certain than that testimony held insufficient in Rad,ford or Embry. In Radford, the physician\u2019s opinion as to causation was held to be insufficient because \u201cat best his testimony indicate [d] that defendant\u2019s assault on the deceased probably caused the death.\u201d (Emphasis in original) Radford, supra, at 281. In Embry, the medical witness was only able to reconstruct the chain of causation with \u201ca reasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d Embry, supra, at 185.\nDr. Fillinger, in the instant case, did not limit the certainty of his opinion to \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cwith a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d He stated the cause of death, unequivocally, as \u201cependymitis following internal hydrocephalus, due to multiple injuries of the head.\u201d\nIn arguing that proof of the cause of death was indefinite, the appellant emphasizes that, in the hospital records, the probable cause of death was listed as \u201csepticemia, secondary to infected V. J. Shunt with probable brain abscess,\u201d referring to the final staph infection. However, there was no doubt in Dr. Fillinger\u2019s mind that the original assault, which caused the initial concussion and loss of consciousness necessitated \u201cthe surgical procedure, which allowed for the introduction of the bacteria.\u201d This chain of causation where death resulted after complications following treatment necessitated by a criminal assault on the decedent is similar to, though less remote than, the chain of causation found to be sufficient in Commonwealth v. Cheeks, 423 Pa. 67, 223 A. 2d 291 (1966). In Cheeks, the victim was stabbed, requiring an operation. To prevent postoperative complications, tubes were inserted. The patient became disoriented and kept pulling out the tubes. He ultimately died from suffocating on material sucked into his lungs through the tubes.\nAs we said in Cheeks, citing Com. ex rel. Peters v. Maroney, 415 Pa. 553, 204 A. 2d 459 (1964), \u201cone charged with homicide cannot escape liability merely because the blow he inflicted is not mortal, or the immediate cause of death.\u201d Cheeks, supra, at page 73.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones and Mr. Justice Nix concur in the result.\nAppellant had filed post-trial motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial. These motions having been withdrawn, there is really nothing for this Court to pass upon on this appeal, except the propriety of the sentence imposed. Appellant apparently is pursuing the motion in arrest of judgment which had been withdrawn on the date of sentence. The court below filed an opinion which treated the question raised on appeal on the merits, and we have also done so.",
