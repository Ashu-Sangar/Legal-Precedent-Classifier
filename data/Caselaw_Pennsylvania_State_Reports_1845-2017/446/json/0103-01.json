        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Egberts,\nAppellants argue that they are entitled to a new trial because of alleged abuses of discretion by the trial court. We find no such error and affirm the judgment.\nOn January 6, 1965, Jeffrey J. Jones, then three years old, was struck by a Volkswagen delivery truck owned by the appellees. The accident occurred on a one-way street in a residential neighborhood. At the time of the accident there were two cars parked on the right side of the street. An action of trespass was brought by appellants, as parents and natural guardians of Jeffrey and in their own right, to recover for Jeffrey\u2019s injuries. At the first trial, the trial court entered a compulsory nonsuit but was reversed on appeal by the Superior Court and a new trial was awarded. Jones v. Spidle, 213 Pa. Superior Ct. 81, 245 A. 2d 677 (1968). Trial was again held and resulted in a verdict for appellees. This appeal followed the denial of new trial motions and the entry of judgment on the verdict.\nAs part of appellants\u2019 case on damages, Jeffrey\u2019s medical records were introduced into evidence under the hospital record exception. Included in these records was this statement: \u201cboy ran between two parked cars\u2014and struck by front of truck.\u201d During his jury summation, appellees\u2019 counsel, over objection, read this statement to the jury to support his theory of the accident.\nThe trial court ruled that, since the appellants introduced the hospital records into evidence, it was proper for appellees\u2019 counsel to comment on everything contained in the hospital records. The trial court also sustained appellees\u2019 objection to appellants\u2019 counsel\u2019s statement, made in his summation to the jury, that the damaging passage in the hospital records was hearsay and not reliable, and refused to give a charge to the jury to the same effect. Appellants argue that these rulings constituted an abuse of discretion. We do not agree.\nIt is well established that hearsay evidence, admitted without objection, is accorded the same weight as evidence legally admissible as long as it is relevant and material to the issues in question. Commonwealth v. Boden, 399 Pa. 298, 308, 159 A. 2d 894, 899-900 (1960) ; Stevens v. Reading St. Railway Co., 384 Pa. 390, 395, 121 A. 2d 128, 131 (1956) ; Poluski v. Glen Alden Coal Co., 286 Pa. 473, 476, 133 Atl. 819, 820 (1926) ; Schade v. Milk Control Comm\u2019n, 196 Pa. Superior Ct. 14, 17, 173 A. 2d 647, 648 (1961). Furthermore, evidence admitted by stipi\u00fcation or consent of both parties is fully competent and accorded full weight although it contains otherwise inadmissible hearsay statements. Caranta v. Pioneer Home Improvements, Inc., 81 N.M. 393, 396, 467 P. 2d 719, 722 (1970) ; Goldthwaite v. Shera ton, 154 Me. 214, 145 A. 2d 362 (1958) ; Bernstein v. Alameda-Contra Med. Assoc., 139 Cal. App. 2d 241, 251, 293 P. 2d 862, 868 (Dist. Ct. App. 1956). Likewise, a motion to strike inadmissible testimony on the ground of incompetency of the witness mil be denied if it is made after direct and cross-examination have been completed and the party had reason to know of the witness\u2019 incompetency to testify. Lynch Estate, 427 Pa. 476, 479, 235 A. 2d 412, 414 (1967) ; McGary Estate, 355 Pa. 232, 236, 49 A. 2d 350, 352 (1946) ; Heller v. Fabel, 290 Pa. 43, 50, 138 Atl. 217, 219 (1927).\nOnce evidence is admitted, it is well settled: \u201cWhere either party to a proceeding discovers at any time that improper testimony has been inadvertently admitted, he may have the error corrected by applying to the court to have the evidence stricken. ... As a rule, such motion will be allowed only in cases ivhere the ground of objection was unknown and could not have been known with ordinary diligence at the time the evidence toas received. . . . The matter is ivithin the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d (Emphasis added). Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence \u00a7738 (1953) ; see also, 5 Standard Pennsylvania Practice \u00a7447 (1958). Here the party could have easily discovered and deleted or requested the trial court to delete the hearsay statement in question. In light of appellants\u2019 failure to do so, the trial court clearly did not abuse its discretion in refusing appellants\u2019 request to withdraw this evidence. It follows that the trial court correctly denied appellants\u2019 charge informing the jury that the statement is unreliable hearsay, meriting little weight, and also correctly sustained the appellees\u2019 objection to appellants\u2019 attempt to comment on the hearsay nature of the statement.\nThe appellants also allege as error the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the use of a diagram during the testimony of a police officer. The trial court ruled that the diagram was inaccurate and that the evidence it contained had already been introduced into the record. These matters are always left to the discretion of the trial court. Tolbert v. Gillette, 438 Pa. 63, 66, 260 A. 2d 463, 465 (1970); Vanic v. Ragni, 435 Pa. 26, 31, 254 A. 2d 618, 621 (1969). We can find no abuse of discretion on this record.\nThe appellants also contend that it was error to receive into evidence the appellee-driver\u2019s statement to the police, made shortly after the accident. The statement was originally used by the appellants in cross-examination of the driver when they reminded him that he originally told the police that \u201cthe first time that [he] saw [Jeffrey was] when he was right out in the street and he was about even with the right front of [his] truck.\u201d The court permitted the appellees to introduce the whole statement into evidence under the principle enunciated in Weaver v. Welsh, 325 Pa. 571, 575, 191 Atl. 3, 6 (1937), that \u201cwhere a party undertakes to prove an admission of another party, he must give the whole admission, and if a portion of it serves the party who made the admission, he must not leave it out; the whole must be for the consideration of the jury.\u201d The court\u2019s ruling was correct.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Eagen dissents.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the decision of this case.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMe. Justice O\u2019Brien :\nHospital records are admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule on the question of medical damages, even though the entrant cannot be cross-examined because, in the words of the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, Act of May 4, 1939, P. L. 42, \u00a72, 28 P.S. 91(b), \u201cthe sources of information, method and time of preparation [are] such as to justify its admission.\u201d However, the statement that the child ran between parked cars is not concerned with the patient\u2019s health. Instead, it concerns the question of liability, which is none of the hospital\u2019s \u201cprofessional\u201d business. As we explained in Commonwealth v. Harris, 351 Pa. 325, 330, 41 A. 2d 688 (1945) : \u201cCertainly every \u2018act, condition or event\u2019 which some hospital physician places in a hospital record does not ipso facto become competent when later an issue is being judicially tried to which such fact would be relevant if proved by competent testimony. The Act of 1939 obviously means that the \u2018act, condition or event\u2019 recorded in the hospital must be pathologically germane to the physical or mental condition which caused the patient to come to the hospital for treatment.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) See also Incollingo v. Ewing, 444 Pa. 263, 282 A. 2d 206 (1971), Fauceglia v. Harry, 409 Pa. 155, 185 A. 2d 598 (1962).\nThe fact that it was appellants who offered the records into evidence does not change the situation. Counsel should not be faced with the choice of either offering the records for all purposes, including illegitimate ones, or not offering them at all.\nThe trial court\u2019s opinion expresses the belief that the statement that the \u201cboy ran between two parked cars,\u201d even if improperly admitted, was not prejudicial because appellants had requested and the court had charged that: \u201c. . . [T]he driver of a motor vehicle has the duty, where a young child or children are observable at the side of a highway, to exercise a high degree of care to avoid striking a child who may dart into the street, or otherwise suddenly find himself before the auto in a position of peril, in view of the well known tendency of children to so act.\u201d\nI do not agree with the trial court. The requested point for charge, which the court properly accepted, described a fact situation significantly different from that described in the hospital records. In the appellants\u2019 description of the accident, Jeffrey is observable at the side of the highway before he darts into the street. In the description from the undisclosed source quoted in the hospital records, Jeffrey darts from between two parked cars and is, therefore, not observable before he darts. Consequently, such a description is highly prejudicial to the appellants\u2019 case and its admission warrants a new trial.\nI further disagree with the majority\u2019s view on the question of the police officer\u2019s diagram. It was appellants\u2019 contention that whether Jeffrey came from the right or the left side of the street, he must have been in the roadway for a sufficient time for the appellees\u2019 truck driver to have seen him and avoided him in the exercise of due care. Since there were no eyewitnesses other than the driver and Jeffrey, the appellants based their case on circumstantial evidence, including the distance of the skid marks from the cars parked to the driver\u2019s right and other measurements made at the scene by Sergeant Shenk of the Lancaster Police Department. To illustrate Ms testimony, the sergeant began to use a diagram which he had prepared as part of his investigation. The appellees objected to such use on the ground that the diagram was not drawn to scale and the objection was sustained, quite properly. The appellants then offered a map of the scene which was drawn to scale. This was also objected to by the appellees. The court sustained the objection because it felt that the diagram contained the same inaccuracies which were disclosed to be in the nonscale diagram by the cross-examination which had occurred at the first trial and because the evidence contained in the diagram was \u201cat best cumulative and already in the record in the officer\u2019s direct verbal testimony and photographs.\u201d\nI disagree with the trial court. The officer\u2019s testimony as to his measurements was difficult to understand and appreciate without the aid of a diagram. Photographs of the scene, taken from different perspectives, could be of little aid to the jury in grasping the significance, if any, of the officer\u2019s figures. If the diagram was drawn to scale and accurately depicted the officer\u2019s measurements, then it should have been admitted into evidence. The court\u2019s failure to do so unfairly made the appellants\u2019 presentation of their case much more difficult.\nI dissent and would reverse the judgment below and grant a new trial.",
