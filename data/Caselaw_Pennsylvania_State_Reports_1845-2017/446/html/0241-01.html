Appellant was brought to trial on the murder indictment and, while represented by counsel, jjleaded guilty.

On the afternoon of July 15, 1966, Lucy T. Husvar left her place of employment at approximately 4 o’clock and purchased some groceries and Salem cigarettes at a local grocery store. At approximately 8:15 that evening, a long-time friend called at the victim’s home, and after receiving no response to his knock at the front door, went to the rear of the house where he observed smoke coming through a basement window. He alerted the neighbors and a fire alarm was sounded. Several of the neighbors broke the locked door at the front of the building and went to the cellar steps, where they saw “a ball of flame” coming from the bottom of the cellar steps. They doused the flame with water and immediately discovered that the flame and smoke had emanated from a pillow which had been placed over the face and head of the deceased victim at the bottom of the cellar steps.</p>

The victim’s house and car keys were found on the basement floor by the side of her body and her handbag, with the wallet missing, was found on a kitchen chair. Large quantities of blood were found on the landing at the top of the cellar stairs, and blood and hair samples were present on the baseboards. Blood was also present on each of the stair treads, indicating that the body had collapsed on the landing <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>and was pulled down the cellar steps by the feet.

All of these witnesses described appellant as being “quite cool,” and not nervous when he identified himself to the four witnesses as the victim’s handyman.</p>

Appellant opened the door after a knock and greeted the police officers 'with the words, “I’ve been expecting you.” The police officers searched the apartment and their search revealed a shirt with bloodstains and burn marks, as well as trousers and shoes all bearing traces of blood. The bloodstains on the shirt and trousers were analyzed and found to be Type B blood, the same as that of the victim, whereas a blood sample taken from appellant revealed that his was Type A. Charred material was also found in scrapings taken from his shoes.

At approximately 7 A.M., he asked the police for a pencil and some paper, and stated, “I’d better write this, you’d never believe it if I told it to you.” Appellant then handwrote a full confession.</p>

He testified that he put a pillow over the victim’s face and tried to suffocate her. Failing in this, he stated that he poured the lighter fluid on the pillow and set the pillow afire in an attempt to insure her death.

The defense should be allowed when the defendant was incapable of some mental process which is a necessary element of the definition of the crime charged. He should be held responsible and punished for the lesser but related crime which does not require that mental process. But, if he is suffering from a mental condition which predisposes the accused to continued criminal activity, he should be retained in a mental institution until his release is consistent <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>with public safety.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> An alternate and corrective procedure is available through the Mental Health and Retardation Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a> Instead of a reduction in the degree of the crime the treatment of the defendant is provided under §413 of the Act: “Whenever any person charged with any crime is acquitted on the ground of insanity or having been insane at the time he committed the crime, the jury or the court as the case may be, shall state such reason for acquittal in its verdict, (b) In such event, the court may direct the Attorney for the Commonwealth to act as a petitioner to initiate commitment proceedings under section 406.” Section 406 permits, inter alia, an officer or agent of a governmental health or welfare organization or agency or “any responsible person” to bring the petition to commit any person in need of care.</p>

In most cases society is more interested in punishing the defendant’s state of mind than it is in punishing the defendant for the commission of the act itself. It is a general principle of our law “that the state of mind with which a person commits a criminal act is important in determining not only whether he should be punished therefor, but also, if he is to be punished, how severely.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_7" id="ref_footnote_3_7">7</a> For this reason an attempted crime is traditionally punished the same as the actual consummation of the crime itself. As reprehensible as the act in first degree murder is the state of mind that led to its commission. Nor would the social objectives of deterrence be accomplished by according the same sanction to those whose offense was “willful, deliberate <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>and premeditated” and to those who were mentally incapable of deliberation and premeditation. As the report by the American Bar Foundation concluded: “If the objective of this heavier sanction be deterrence, it is doubtful that a person incapable of premeditation and deliberation will be dissuaded from committing a premeditated murder by the higher penalty imposed for murder accompanied by these mental processes. Nor is a ‘fully responsible’ person likely to be deterred because those who are incapable of premeditation also face the same punishment. If this differential treatment reflects a community attitude that ‘cold-blooded’ murder is somehow more culpable than killing which springs from momentary impulses, these traditional notions are actually undermined by inflicting the penalty reserved for the ‘cold-blooded’ on those capable only of the impulse.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_8" id="ref_footnote_3_8">8</a>

        <em> </em>The statutory definition of murder in the first degree is: “All murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and j&gt;remeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration of, or attempting to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery, burglary, or kidnapping, shall be murder in the first degree. All other kinds of murder shall be murder in the second degree.” Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, as amended, 18 P.S. §4701. Since the Commonwealth did not allege that the murder in this case was committed by poison or while lying in wait or during the commission of a felony they had the burden of proving that the murder was “willful, deliberate and premeditated.”</p>
