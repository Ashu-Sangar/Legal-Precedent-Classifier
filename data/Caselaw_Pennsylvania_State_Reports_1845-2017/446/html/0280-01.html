    <p id="b395-3" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[203,774,1147,819]]]'>A narration of the factual background of these appeals begins with Rockwell’s merger on October 30, 1953, with the Timken-Detroit Axle Company and the concomitant acquisition of the Timken Silent Automatic (hereinafter TSA) division as a part of Rockwell’s corporate structure. Although the TSA product was long considered the best in the oil-fired furnace industry, this type of business was far removed from Rockwell’s chief concern, the manufacture of automotive parts. Moreover, reflecting the improvement and expansion of natural gas line facilities in the United States, the fuel furnace industry was drastically changing from oil-fired furnaces to natural gas-fired furnaces. Attempting to meet the challenge of its competitors, TSA developed and marketed its own gas-fired furnace.</p>
    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[202,1605,1148,541]]]'>Besides this factual discussion, an explanation of the mechanical operation of a gas-fired furnace is necessary. The key component of a gas-fired furnace, simple but indispensable, is the heat exchanger. However, the TSA heat exchanger was defective in two respects: it was noisy and it cracked. As best stated by the court below, “[f]or a Timken Silent Automatic furnace to make noise is one thing but for it to crack is another.” For this reason the TSA gas-fired furnace was not functional and, therefore, not marketable.</p>

      <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>Although, it is a matter of some dispute whether Rockwell or Scaife initiated negotiations for the sale and purchase of the TSA division, negotiations did commence in the Fall of 1954. Reviewing the record, one fact is abundantly clear: Rockwell was very much aware of the defective condition of its heat exchanger and the effect of this défective component on the marketability of its final product. Besides numerous complaints by customers, Rockwell’s cognizance of this problem is demonstrated, <em>inter </em>alia, by (1) its creation of a Heating Committee to scrutinize the situation; (2) its unavailing, trial-and-error method of improvement; and (3) Rockwell’s establishment of an accounting reserve of $26,000.00 per month to permit the writing-off of the heat exchangers. To capsulize the controversy, Scaife allegedly knew none of these facts when the contract for the sale of the TSA division was executed on March 31, 1955.</p>

Initially, we note that a fraudulent misrepresentation can take many forms: “ ‘fraud consists in anything calculated to deceive, whether by single act or combination, or by suppression of truth, or a suggestion of what is false, whether it be direct falsehood or by innuendo, by speech or silence, word of mouth, or look or gesture. It is any artifice by which a person is de<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>ceived to Ms disadvantage’: [Citation omitted].” <em>Reichert Estate, </em><a href="/pa/356/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="356 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="470700" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0269-01">356 Pa. 269</a>, 274, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20A.2d%20615" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="51 A.2d 615">51 A. 2d 615</a>, 617 (1947). Besides our previous recitation of the facts, additional evidence in this regard, both documentary and testimomal, are very pertinent.</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[187,610,1158,1042]]]'>First, during the negotiations, Scaife submitted twenty-six questions to Rockwell concerning the TSA division, including, <em>inter </em>alia: “why is this division for sale?” and “what reasons for declining sales volume and faster decline of profits for recent years?” Despite Rockwell’s awareness of the defective heat exchanger, no mention was made of tMs factor. Second, Scaife was not permitted to question TSA’s engineers and retail dealers during the negotiations. Third, testimony by various Scaife executives, if believed, indicated that any Mnt of trouble was excused by Rockwell officials as minor problems encountered daily by manufacturers. In light of the enormity of TSA’s problem, we cannot reject the jury’s implicit finding that Rockwell either deliberately evaded or actively concealed the true situation. Overall, we share the opirnon of the court en banc that, “there was sufficient evidence for the Court, as a matter of law, to submit to the jury and to justify the jury’s finding that there was a false misrepresentation.”</p>
    <p id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[186,1662,1155,322]]]'>The third element—an intention by the maker that the recipient would thereby be induced to act—is easily satisfied. The rosy picture painted by Rockwell during the course of the negotiations, coupled with Rockwell’s failure to disclose the malfunctioning of its heat exchanger, clearly supports the jury’s verdict.</p>

Relying heavily on <em>Emery v. Third Nat’l Bank, </em><a href="/pa/308/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="308 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1140241" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0504-01">308 Pa. 504</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.%20281" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="162 A. 281">162 Atl. 281</a> (1932), Rockwell principally argues that <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>Scaife knew or should have known of the defective heat exchanger and that any damage was essentially self-inflicted. On the other hand, one major facet of Scaife’s position, discussed by the court in its charge, is that the long-standing business and personal relationship between the executives of each corporation, while not attaining the legalistic stature of a “confidential relationship”, could justify a factual finding that Scaife reposed a specific confidence in Rockwell which was knowingly abused by Rockwell.</p>
    <p id="b399-3" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[199,904,1150,1437]],["BL_400.1",400,[184,345,1154,544]]]'>In Emery, this Court stated: “A misrepresentation as to the subject of a proposed sale will not support an action for deceit if the subject be open to the buyer’s observation.

The same opinion quotes from Slaughter v. Gerson, 13 Wallace 379, as follows: ‘Where the means of knowledge are at hand and equally available to both parties, and the subject of purchase is alike open to their inspection, if the purchaser does not avail himself of these means and opportunities, he will not be heard to say that he has been deceived by the vendor’s misrepresentations.’ This court has consistently adhered to these principles.

Utilizing this concept, Rockwell accentuates certain facts: (1) several marketing and engineering reports indicated TSA’s sluggish entry into the gas furnace market; (2) Scaife executives had, at least, a glimmering of this problem; and (3) Dr. Anthony, a metallurgical engineer employed by the Mellon Institute, testified that it would be obvious from an inspection of the heat <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>exchanger testing room (a Scaife official and Scaife’s chief engineer had toured one of these rooms) that the heat exchanger was defective. However, the evidence introduced by Scaife repudiated each of these allegations. Owing to this extremely close, factual controversy occasioned by our rigorous standard of review as well as the possibility of a specific confidence reposed by Scaife in Rockwell, we believe the tidal judge did not err in allowing this case to go to the jury and that the jury’s verdict is sufficiently supported by the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b400-4" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[179,900,1158,1426]]]'>On these facts, there is undisputed evidence of continuous, business transactions between the corporations. Moreover, close, personal relationships existed between the executives of both companies. Of course, Rockwell contends that familiarity and personal relationships did not influence this business transaction. Accordingly, the trial judge, correctly employing this Court’s language in <em>Zahn v. McMillin, </em><a href="/pa/179/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="179 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="887021" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0146-01">179 Pa. 146</a>, 153, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20A.%20188" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="36 A. 188">36 Atl. 188</a>, 189-90 (1897), stated in his charge to the <em>jury: “l. . . </em>there are cases where a party must not be silent upon a material fact within his knowledge, although he stands in no relationship of trust and confidence. If a party knows that another is relying upon his judgment and knowledge in contracting with him, although no confidential relation exists—and I will say that none existed in this case—and he does not state material facts within his knowledge, the contract will be avoided, for knowingly to permit another to act as though the action was confidential and yet not state material facts is fraudulent. It is said that a party, in such circumstances, is bound to destroy the confidence reposed in him or to state all the facts that such confidence demands.’ ” <em>See, also, Restatement of Torts, </em>§542 (1938). Thus, the jury could have concluded that Rockwell knowingly abused Scaife’s confidence which would further justify Scaife’s reliance.</p>

Moreover, we noted in <em>Neumam </em>that, “[w]hile formulated rules relating to the appropriate measure of damage in varying circumstances have to some extent become fixed, they are by no means immutable but bend to the exigencies of the particular case in order that just compensation may be ascertained and awarded”. <a href="/pa/356/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="356 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="470696" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0442-01">356 Pa. at 457</a>, 51 A. 2d at 766. Considering the demise of the oil-fired furnace industry, the steps taken by Scaife and the expenses thereby incurred to correct the defective heat exchanger can be fully justified as sound business practice and were proximately caused by Rockwell’s misrepresentation. Additionally, Scaife’s operating losses may not be equated with the “benefit of the bargain” rule prohibited in <em>Neuman; </em>whether all of these losses were proximately caused by Rockwell’s fraud is, of course, a question for the jury. In short, to apply the measure of dam-, ages formula discussed in <em>Tilghman </em>to the sale of a “defective” business would work a grave injustice. It is our opinion that the jury’s verdict is fully supported by the evidence and should be reinstated.</p>

While this would, I repeat, greatly aid an appellate Court, we must remember when we come to consider the question of an abuse of discretion that a trial Judge sees and hears the witnesses and, therefore, is in a far better position than an appellate Court to form a fair and just opinion on the point of excessiveness of the verdict.</p>
