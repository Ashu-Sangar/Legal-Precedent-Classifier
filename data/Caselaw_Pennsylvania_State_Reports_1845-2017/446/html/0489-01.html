Merrick, a resident and assistant públie defender of Chester County, filed a complaint in equity “on behalf of present and future indigent defendants” seeking to enjoin the county sheriff and warden from applying and enforcing three Pennsylvania statutes which permit imprisonment for nonpayment of fines.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Appellant alleged that application of these statutes to indigents would violate the United States Supreme Court’s holding in <em>Tate v. Short, </em><a href="/us/401/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="401 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="11712570" data-case-paths="/us/401/0395-01">401 U.S. 395</a>, 398, <a href="/us/401/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="401 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="11712570" data-case-paths="/us/401/0395-01">91 S. Ct. 668</a>, 671 (1971), that: “ ‘[Tjhe Constitution prohibits the State from imposing a fine as a sentence and then automatically converting it into a jail term solely because the defendant is indigent and cannot forthwith pay the fine in full.’ ”</p>

Short </em>that imprisonment of indigents for nonpayment of fines is precluded when alternative means are unsuccessful despite the defendant’s reasonable efforts to satisfy the fines by those means; and (2) that indigent defendants threatened by imprisonment for nonpayment of fines have an adequate remedy at law to which they can resort. Appellant appealed directly to this Court from the dismissal of his complaint in equity.</p>

All that appellant can point to is a decision by the late president judge of the Chester County Common Pleas Court which refused to release a defendant whose term of imprisonment was extended because of his inability to pay certain court costs that had been imposed upon him. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
