There is, admittedly, precedential support for this conclusion, and it reflects the long standing practice in our criminal courts. Upon reflection, however, I believe that logic and fairness mandate a different result, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>

Thus, when considering the degree of culpability of an individual being tried under such an indictment, a jury may return a voluntary manslaughter verdict if it finds that the killing, although intentional, was committed without malice; that is, the accused may be shown to have been acting under the influence of sudden passion which was caused by legally adequate provocation that placed him beyond the control of reason.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> See e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Walters, </em><a href="/pa/431/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="431 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1917416" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0074-01">431 Pa. 74</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20757" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="244 A.2d 757">244 A. 2d 757</a> (1968); <em>Commonwealth v.

These elements need not always be present, however, to support a voluntary manslaughter verdict. Pennsylvania courts have long accepted the common law rule that the jury has the power to find a defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter even in the absence of passion or provocation, where the evidence is sufficient to support a first or second degree murder verdict. <em>Commonwealth v. Hoffman, </em><a href="/pa/439/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="439 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="1930989" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0348-01">439 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20726" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="266 A.2d 726">266 A. 2d 726</a> (1970); <em>Commonwealth v.

Gable, </em>7 S. &amp; R. 423 (1821). Although superficially such a rule may seem incongruous, it does have a rational basis. In essence, the rationale of the rule is founded on two considerations: (1) the legal concept that voluntary manslaughter is by definition a lesser offense than murder but one included within a murder indictment, (2) a realistic appreciation of the fact that factors such as sympathy or extenuating circumstances may lead a jury to find a defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter even though the evidence is enough to establish guilt of murder in the second or even the first degree. <em>Commonwealth v. Hoffman, </em>supra.</p>

That rule gives a trial judge complete discretion in deciding whether or not to submit voluntary manslaughter to the jury as a possible verdict in a case where there is no evidence of passion or provocation. See e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. LaRue, </em><a href="/pa/381/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="381 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1258829" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0113-01">381 Pa. 113</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20362" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="112 A.2d 362">112 A. 2d 362</a> (1955) ; <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>Thus, while a jury has the power to return a verdict of guilty of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter in every case tried pursuant to a murder indictment, this power may be effectively negated by the decision of a trial judge to refuse to charge the jury on this point. In making this decision, the judge has no standards to guide him and there are no safeguards which would militate against the exercise of whim or caprice. In discussing this anomolous situation in his dissenting opinion in. <em>Commonwealth v. Pavillard, supra, </em>Mr. Justice Cohen (joined by Mr. Justice Jones) cogently stated: “How is a jury able to exercise its power [to bring in a voluntary manslaughter verdict] when it is never advised that it has such power? That rule has led to arbitrary justice . . . since trial judges have capriciously chosen to charge the doctrine or not.”</p>

It would seem that the interest of the Commonwealth is adequately protected by the fact that the trial judge may, indeed should, advise the jury that, where no evidence of provocation or passion has been presented, a verdict of voluntary manslaughter would not be warranted. <em>Commonwealth v.

Seeking to apply this principle to the situation before us, I am of the view that as long as we allow juries the latitude we do in homicide cases, as above set forth, criminal defendants must be treated equally by informing all juries of tbe verdicts they have the power to return. This means that the trial court should not have discretion whether or not to instruct on the elements of voluntary manslaughter; it should he obliged to do so in every murder trial, but with proper cautionary admonition such as that set forth in footnote 2.</p>

        <em> </em>An example of an acceptable jury charge in the circumstances of the instant case can be found in Daub, <em>Pennsylvania Trial Guide, </em>§618.5: “Under the law, you are entitled to bring in a verdict of voluntary manslaughter. That is a question for you and we may not interfere with your judgment in the matter. In our opinion there is no evidence of any sufficient cause of provocation which, if this were a malicious killing, would reduce it to voluntary manslaughter, but that is our opinion merely and it is not binding upon you. It is for you and you alone to say whether this was a case of voluntary manslaughter and we have no right to decide that issue.

An instruction such as suggested above merely suggests to the jury that the evidence is insufficient to show passion or provocation. In my view, such a jury charge conforms with the <em>American Bar Association Standards Relating to Trial by Jury, </em>which permit the court to comment on the evidence provided that the jury is “. . . clearly and unequivocally instructed that it is the exclusive judge of the facts . . . and that it is not bound by the comments of the court.” §4.7 (Approved Draft, 1968). In no way does the above proposed instruction imply that a not guilty verdict would be improper, nor could the jury infer from such a comment that a second or first degree murder verdict would be impermissible; the jury remains untainted by any judicial suggestion of the <em>ultimate </em>guilt (or degree of guilt) or innocence of the accused.</p>
