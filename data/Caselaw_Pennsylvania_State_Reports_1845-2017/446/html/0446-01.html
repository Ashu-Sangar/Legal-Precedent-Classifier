    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[187,802,1156,920]]]'>The basic facts of this case are not complex. In 1962 Hardex-Steubenville Corporation, Inc., appellant (herein “the Customer”) opened a checking account with appellee (herein “the Bank”), executing signature cards which, <em>inter </em>alia, authorized Myron Swartz, the President of the Customer, to sign checks on its behalf. In 1963 the Customer employed one Frank Iskra as an office manager and accountant. Early in 1964, Mr. Iskra began forging Mr. Swartz’ signature to checks purportedly made by the Customer, payable to Mr. Iskra’s order. Mr. Iskra continued this practice until it was detected in January, 1967. In the three-year period before discovery Mr. Iskra forged and the Bank paid checks in amounts totaling $97,000. Recovery is sought in the present suit only for these checks forged between January, 1966 and January, 1967, in amounts aggregating $63,105.28.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

As office manager, he received the Bank’s monthly statements of his employ<a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>er’s accounts, together with the month’s cancelled checks. From the latter, he removed the forged checks and altered the Customer’s books so as to make the missing funds appear to be attributable to inventory pilferage. The Customer notified the Bank promptly upon discovery of Mr. Iskra’s defalcations, but the Bank refused to credit the Customer’s account with the amounts it had paid out on the forged checks.</p>
    <p id="b561-4" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[178,814,1149,361]]]'>At trial the Customer introduced testimony tending to show that the Bank had been negligent in honoring the forged checks.

Except to the extent that the relationships of the parties are embodied in an agreement, they are governed in Pennsylvania by the Uniform Commercial Code. Act of April 6, 1953, P. L. 3, reenacted by Act of October 2, 1959, P. L. 1023, 12A P.S. §§3-101 et seq., as amended. As with the Code’s predecessor in this field, the Negotiable Instruments Law, the fundamental rule of the Code with respect to an unauthorized signature on an instrument is that it “is wholly inoperative as that of the person whose name is signed unless he ratifies it or is precluded from denying it; . . .” Code Section 3-404(1), 12A P.S. §3-404(1). Thus under the Code a bank breaches its agreement with a customer when it pays the holder of a forged check.

This duty and the effect of a customer’s failure to discharge it are set forth in subsections (1) and (2), respectively, of Section 4-406. 12A P.S. §4-406(1) and (2). Because of their importance to this case the text of these subsections is given herewith in full:</p>

Plaintiffs recovered a jury verdict in their suit against a bank because of its payment of forged checks drawn on plaintiffs’ account. The trial court granted defendant’s motion for judgment n.o.v. on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to give the bank prompt notice of the forgeries and were thereby precluded from asserting them. This Court reversed, holding that “[wjhile a depositor’s failure to give the bank timely notice that forged checks have been charged against his account ‘is a good defense . . . the bank has the burden of proof’ ... of its lack of knowledge in such connection, free from any fault of its own.” <a href="/pa/367/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="367 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1228312" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0459-01">367 Pa. at 465</a>. <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>The Court went on to quote with approval from an opinion of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island: “ ‘there is ample authority that the bank must then [after payment of a forged check has been established] affirmatively show that it had exercised due diligence in its transactions with the forger before it can put in issue the depositor’s alleged negligence’.” <a href="/pa/367/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="367 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1228312" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0459-01">367 Pa. at 465</a>. Finding that sufficient evidence of the bank’s negligence had been presented to make the issue thereof one for the jury, the Court reversed the judgment n.o.v. and entered judgment for the plaintiffs on the verdict. Thus, the rule in this Commonwealth even before the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code was that the customer’s failure promptly to notify the bank of forged checks returned to it would not preclude the customer’s recovery where the bank had been negligent in paying the checks.</p>

The only legal theory which was before the jury upon which it could have found for the Bank was the theory of the Customer’s negligence in failing to detect the forgeries and notify the Bank thereof. Section 3-406 operates under certain <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>conditions to prevent a purported maker of an instrument whose negligence has contributed to the creation or perpetration of a forgery from recovering against a good faith drawee. This relates to the maker’s conduct before the fact of forgery, whereas §4-406(1) relates to the maker’s conduct afterwards. The two sections clearly involve and require different factual determinations. It would thus be impossible for us now, as appellee urges, to uphold the verdict on the ground that it was justified under §3-406, for the legal theory of that section was never presented to the jury as a possible defense, nor was the jury instructed as to the facts it would have to find to make the defense viable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The Customer apparently read this Code provision as do we, since it did not seek recovery with respect to any forged checks paid and returned to it more than one year before it discovered the forgeries. The return to the Customer of each month’s statement together with the cancelled checks covered thereby started anew the one year period within which the Customer was required to detect the forgeries on the checks returned with that statement or be forever barred from asserting his cause of action against the Bank.</p>
