The court identified three viewpoints on the subject of a federally mandated constitutional right to counsel: (1) that the right extends only to felony offenses; (2) that the right exists in any criminal proceeding in which an accused may be deprived of his liberty; and (3) that the right exists not only in the case of any felony but also in the case of any “serious” misdemeanor in which the possible sentence exceeds six months imprisonment. The Maine court, relying extensively upon the Federal Buies of Procedure for Trials of Minor Offenses Before Magistrates,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> held there was an absolute right to counsel in the third category of cases described above.</p>

There are simply not enough lawyers to go around. Some pragmatic solution must be found so that even a law violator will be willing to admit that his pulling flowers in the park or his parking overtime are not important enough to require the city or state to furnish him a lawyer.

(For example, the crime of receiving stolen property, Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §817, as amended, 18 P.S. §4817, for which the maximum sentence is five years, can carry no greater maximum than two and one half years. Act of June 19, 1911, P. L. 1055, §6, as amended, 19 P.S. §1057.) Another illustration is the crime of bribery in athletic contests; although a misdemeanor, it carries a fine of up to $10,000 and imprisonment up to ten years, or both. See Act of June 24, 1939, P. Tj. 872, §614, as amended, 18 P.S. §4614.</p>
