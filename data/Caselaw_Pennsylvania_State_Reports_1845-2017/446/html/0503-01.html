Paragraph 21 of the lease specifically provided, <em>inter alia: </em>“This lease is subordinate to any mortgage now or hereafter created by the Landlord upon the leased premises and parking improvements provided that the mortgage instrument shall contain a clause to the effect that, or the mortgagee shall furnish the Tenant with a certificate or letter to the effect that, so long as the Tenant, its assignees, successors or subtenants are not in default under this lease, (a) The Tenant’s possession of the leased premises and its use of the parking facilities shall remain undisturbed whether or not the mortgage is in default and notwithstanding a foreclosure or other action by the mortgagee pursuant to the mortgage or any bond accompanying the mortgage, and (b) all provisions of this lease insofar as they affect the mortgagee shall be binding upon the mortgagee.”</p>

Stated differently, appellant argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action since paragraph twenty-one of the lease which was attached to the complaint clearly subordinated the lease to any subsequent mortgage. While we agree with appellant’s statement of the law, appellant’s reading of paragraph twenty-one ignores certain operative provisos contained therein.</p>
    <p id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.4",619,[162,1130,1155,1264]]]'>A careful reading of paragraph twenty-one demonstrates that the lease is subordinate to a subsequent mortgage “provided that the mortgage instrument shall contain a clause to the effect that, or the mortgagee shall furnish the tenant with a certificate or letter to the effect that, so long as the tenant, its assignees, successors or subtenants are not in default under this lease. . . .” Reviewing the record before us, we do not know if the mortgage contained such a clause or whether the mortgagee furnished such a certificate or letter to the tenant. Absent this evidence of record, we cannot be certain that these provisos were met ; for this reason we cannot determine that the lease was subordinate to the subsequent mortgage. “Where, in order to sustain the attack on the judgment, evidence relating to the cause of action must be introduced, the proceeding should not be to strike off the judgment, but rather to open it.” 7 Standard Pa. Prac. 185-86 (1971). The court below correctly denied the petition to strike and properly refused to consider the petition, sua sponte, as one to open the judgment. <em>Kros v.

      <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>Appellant next contends that since the complaint was not properly endorsed with a notice to plead, <em>see, </em>Pa. R. C. P. 1026, 1361, no answer was required; accordingly, the argument is made that the allegations of the complaint were automatically denied, see, Pa. R. C. P. 1029(d), and the default judgment was improper. The sole basis of this argument was the failure of appellee’s counsel to sign the notice to plead; both appellee and his counsel had signed the complaint and the backer of the complaint listed counsel’s name and business address. Although the Rules of Civil Procedure nowhere specifically require counsel to sign the notice to plead, we think that the better practice is for counsel to sign the notice to plead. However, we are of the opinion that a default judgment should not be stricken for this de minimis error. Since the obvious purpose of this requirement—notification to a defendant’s counsel of opposing counsel’s name and address— was served by the printed backer, we believe the court properly dismissed this argument. Indeed, this entire argument can be questioned in light of the correspondence requesting a “reasonable extension of time to answer or otherwise move.”</p>
