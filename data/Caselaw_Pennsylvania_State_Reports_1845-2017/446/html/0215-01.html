Appellant, who was accused of murdering her husband, had been named as a beneficiary on her husband’s life insurance policy. Since Simon had limited financial resources, her trial counsel agreed that a portion of his fee would be paid out of the proceeds of the insurance policy, despite the fact that if appellant were convicted of the murder of her husband, she would not be entitled to the proceeds of her husband’s policy. See, e.g., <em>Kravitz Estate, </em><a href="/pa/418/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="418 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="1896066" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0319-01">418 Pa. 319</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=211%20A.2d%20443" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="211 A.2d 443">211 A. 2d 443</a> (1965).

So long as counsel in her prior appeal was constitutionally effective, the fact that her present counsel may perhaps be more imaginative in constructing allegations of trial error is of no moment. To excuse an otherwise effective waiver of a claim on the sole ground that the claim arises from a novel factual setting is contrary to the significant policies of finality clearly embedded in Sections 3 and 4 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act and the cases cited supra.</p>

Besides my logical inclination to answer this query in the negative, this Court’s case law suggests a similar response. Thus, it was stated in <em>Com. v.
