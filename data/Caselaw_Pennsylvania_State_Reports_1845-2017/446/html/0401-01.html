    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[173,838,1155,755]]]'>The facts which give rise to this appeal are as follows: Appellant and deceaent were brothers. They worked together in the real estate and insurance businesses initially as employees of their father Clayton L. Brown, Sr. In 1960 the family business was incorporated as Clayton L. Brown, Inc., and decedent and appellant became stockholders with their father. In March of 1965 their father died, and the two brothers, pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement then in effect, each exercised his option to acquire 69 shares of their father’s stock at a price of $1.00 per share. With these acquisitions appellant and decedent became the sole shareholders of Clayton L. Brown, Inc., each holding 185 shares.</p>

Brown, Inc., at a price of $1.00 per share. The two brothers also agreed that in the event that either desired to sell his stock before his death, the other would have the right to purchase the shares for $1.00 per share. It was further agreed that a legend noting these restrictions would be affixed to the stock certificates. In his will executed in July of 1966, the decedent Clayton L. Brown, Jr., directed that in the event that the agreement of September 25, 1965, was found invalid, his <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>shares in Clayton L. Brown, Inc., should pass to appellant.</p>
    <p id="b517-5" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[177,449,1148,323]]]'>Decedent died March 26, 1968. His will, duly admitted to probate, named his wife Elizabeth W. Brown as executrix. In addition to the conditional bequest of shares to his brother described above, the only dis-positive provision in decedent’s will was a residuary clause devising the residue of his estate to his wife.</p>
    <p id="b517-6" data-blocks='[["BL_517.5",517,[174,783,1150,365]]]'>On March 13, 1968, decedent’s wife filed her election to take against decedent’s will. Since decedent died without issue, his wife by virtue of her election is entitled to one-half of decedent’s real and personal estate according to Section 8 of the Wills Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and to one-half of all conveyances by decedent which fall within Section 11 of the Estates Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In November of 1970, the orphans’ court held a hearing at which time evidence was presented relating both to the audit of the First and Partial Account and to appellant’s petition.</p>
    <p id="b517-8" data-blocks='[["BL_517.7",517,[169,1613,1150,483]],["BL_518.1",518,[179,342,1153,263]]]'>The evidence presented at this hearing indicated that aside from the 185 shares of stock, decedent’s estate consisted of only $262.50 in assets of ascertainable value and an unliquidated claim against Clayton L. Brown, Inc., which the executrix estimated was worth at most $7,500. On the other hand the estate owed a number of debts, largest of which was a debt of $15,-527.71 to the executrix. This debt arose as a result of money that the executrix had advanced to the es<a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>tate. These funds were employed to pay administration expenses, decedent’s funeral and medical expenses, and numerous unpreferred claims against the estate among which was a $9,200 bank loan which was outstanding at decedent’s death.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[177,618,1155,320]]]'>At the hearing, evidence was also offered in an attempt to determine the value of the shares in question. The expert produced by decedent’s wife estimated the current fair market value of Clayton L. Brown, Inc., stock to be $222 per share. Appellant’s expert fixed the corporate value at $76 per share.</p>
    <p id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[176,951,1154,474]]]'>The orphans’ court adjudication of March 19, 1971, rejected appellant’s claim for specific performance of the agreement and awarded the assets of the estate to the fiduciary for further accounting. This appeal followed. Executrix filed a motion to quash the appeal on the ground that the decree of the orphans’ court was not appealable. This Court ordered that the motion to quash be heard at the time of argument on the merits.</p>

    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[169,490,1148,637]]]'>Appellant’s petition in the orphans’ court sought specific performance of his “buy-sell” agreement with decedent. The petition was based upon Section 620 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1949. That section provides: “If any person makes a legally binding agreement to purchase or sell real or personal estate and dies before its consummation, his personal representative shall have power to consummate it, but if he does not do so, the court, on the application of any party in interest . . ., may order specific performance of the agreement if it would have been enforced specifically had the decedent not died.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

The court held that the agreement was “in substance” a “gift by the deceased to the survivor,” and that “Elizabeth W. Brown, by virtue of her election, has become the owner of <em>92y2 </em>shares of Clayton L. Brown, Inc., subject only to any charges, debts, or claims superior to her distributive rights.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The court apparently regarded the remainder of the shares as an asset of the estate, “available for its creditors as their interests and preferences may appear.” Thus the court <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>completely and finally denied appellant’s right to specific performance of the “buy-sell” agreement.</p>
    <p id="b520-4" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[184,436,1155,701]]]'>Although the orphans’ court did state in its adjudication that appellant’s petition would not be dismissed, but would be held in abeyance so that it could be renewed at an appropriate time, this statement cannot be taken as a ruling by the court that appellant at some later date might obtain specific performance of all or part of the “buy-sell” agreement. The court’s statement was merely an indication that under its view of the priority of the conflicting claims to the stock, appellant might be entitled to some portion of the shares if the estate was solvent <em>as a devisee under decedent’s will, </em>and not by virtue of any right to specific performance of his “buy-sell” agreement.</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[184,1147,1154,481]]]'>Since the orphans’ court thus “finally determined” that appellant was not entitled to the specific performance of the “buy-sell” agreement which he sought in his petition, it must be concluded that the court’s decree was a “final order” within the meaning of Sec-; tion 202 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act and thus properly subject to our appellate review. Accordingly we must dismiss appellee’s motion to quash the appeal.</p>

Each brother’s promise to convey his shares to the survivor for $1.00 per share was supported by legally sufficient consideration—the other brother’s prom<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>ise to do likewise.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Each brother realized that the “buy-sell” agreement offered both the potentiality for gain and the possibility of loss depending upon what transpired in the future. The potential gains and possible losses created by this agreement were of the same sort that are implicit in all business contracts dependent on future events. In addition, it has long been the law of this Commonwealth that a nonpersonal contractual duty does not terminate with the death of the party who assumed the duty, but is binding upon his estate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> In fact, the “buy-sell” agreement between appellant and decedent was expressly made binding on each brother’s “heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.” Moreover, it is clear that specific performance is a particularly appropriate remedy for enforcement of “buy-sell” agreements for shares of stock of closely-held corporations. Money damages would not be an adequate remedy. It is extremely difficult to determine the value of stock in a closely-held corporation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> and money damages would not accomplish the primary purpose of such “buy-sell” agreements—to prevent outsiders from entering the business.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
