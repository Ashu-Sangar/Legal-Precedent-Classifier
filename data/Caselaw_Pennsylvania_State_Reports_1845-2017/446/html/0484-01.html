Lastly, appellant urges that the result of the decree-below is to award distribution of Julia’s share to her husband, who was not of testator’s blood line. Within the' four corners of this will there is nothing whatsoever indicating an intent on testator’s part to restrict his bounty to those of his own blood and to exclude persons not of the blood.' Indeed, had such been testator’s intent he had ample time to revise his will to exclude possible inheritance by Julia’s husband.
