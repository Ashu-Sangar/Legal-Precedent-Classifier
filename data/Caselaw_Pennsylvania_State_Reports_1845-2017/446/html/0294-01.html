K. Fawcett had been injured in a fall and requesting that an ambulance be dispatched to his residence. Mr. Fawcett was an elderly gentleman who lived alone in a house in East Washington which was secluded from other residences in the area.</p>
    <p id="b409-9" data-blocks='[["BL_409.17",409,[165,1978,1150,371]]]'>When the ambulance attendants arrived at the Fawcett residence, they discovered the house had been broken into. They also found Mr. Fawcett dead in a bedroom on the second floor. He was bound and gagged and bore physical marks of a brutal assault. The entire house was in serious disarray indicating it had been ransacked.</p>

An examination of Mr. Fawcett’s body disclosed the existence of multiple bruises on the arms, face and head. A subsequent medical examination established that one such wound penetrated the deeper tissues of the scalp rupturing blood vessels between the thin and heavy covering of the brain resulting in a hemorrhage which caused death.</p>
    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[203,865,1155,543]]]'>On August 19, 1969, Sean W. Naser was taken into police custody and subsequently admitted having participated in a burglary of the Fawcett residence on the night of July 26th, together with Norvelle DeWitt Jennings, John Allen Banks and Charles Avery. He also gave the police information indicating Jennings and Banks had assaulted Mr. Fawcett during the perpetration of the burglary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As a result, all four individuals were arrested and indicted for burglary, larceny, conspiracy and murder.</p>
    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[203,1420,1155,257]]]'>Banks was the first to be tried on the charge of murder and was found guilty by the jury of murder in the second degree. The Commonwealth’s case against Banks depended almost completely on the testimony of Naser who testified as a Commonwealth witness.</p>
    <p id="b410-6" data-blocks='[["BL_410.6",410,[203,1698,1154,429]]]'>Jennings was tried next and was found guilty by the jury of murder in the first degree with the punishment fixed at life imprisonment. In this instance, Avery joined Naser as a Commonwealth witness against Jennings. The Commonwealth’s case was further strengthened by the testimony of a witness who heard Jennings admit involvement in the Fawcett burglary while a prisoner in jail awaiting trial.</p>

    <p id="b411-5" data-blocks='[["BL_411.6",411,[169,834,1150,821]]]'>About 9:30 p.m., on July 26, 1969, Naser, Banks, Jennings and Avery joined together and traveled in Naser’s automobile to the Fawcett residence with the intention of burglarizing it. As they approached the house, they observed a light was lit in one of the rooms on the second floor. A rear door was forced open, and Jennings, accompanied by Banks, entered the house, while Naser and Avery remained on the outside as “lookouts”. Jennings and Banks ascended to the second floor, forcibly overpowered Fawcett and struck him many blows to the head and body with their fists. They placed a gag in his mouth, bound his ankles and tied his hands behind his back. They then ransacked the house, took certain property belonging to Fawcett, rejoined Naser and Avery and fled from the scene.</p>
    <p id="b411-6" data-blocks='[["BL_411.7",411,[172,1669,1150,421]]]'>The sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree is not questioned, but it is urged a new trial is required because of prejudicial error during the prosecution proceedings. The trial was of extended duration and many assignments of error are asserted. After studying the record and each alleged error, we conclude the judgment should be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b411-7" data-blocks='[["BL_411.8",411,[173,2112,1148,209]]]'>It is argued due process was violated in that Jenings “was not tried by a jury of his peers” because “the jury was not properly selected” and “there was a breach of jury security”.</p>

      <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>In support of the first prong of this contention, it is submitted the trial court erred in excusing a number of prospective jurors for cause, merely because they expressed conscientious scruples against the imposition of the death penalty during voir dire examination. It is maintained this resulted in the selection of a trial jury “biased towards conviction” and also deprived Jennings of his right to a trial before a jury representing “a cross section” of the vicinage.</p>

Ct. 1788</a> (1968), the United States Supreme Court rejected the argument that disqualifying jurors in a capital case because of their objection to the imposition of the death penalty under any circumstances affects the neutrality and fairness of the jurors on the issue of guilt. See also <em>Commonwealth v.

Since there is nothing else in the record in support of the allegation that the jury was “biased towards conviction”, this contention is overruled.</p>
    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[180,1609,1156,650]]]'>Nor are we persuaded that the excusal of a limited number of jurors for cause because of such conscientious scruples deprived Jennings of a trial jury truly representative of the vicinage. Again, there is nothing in the record to establish that the jurors remaining in the panel were not so representative. Moreover, if Jennings’ position on this were sustained on this record, it would logically follow that in every instance where a juror is excused for cause, regardless of the reason, then the selection of the jury would necessarily be contrary to constitutional standards. The folly of such reasoning is self-evident.</p>

In the instant case, the only jurors disqualified for cause were those who stated they could not vote to impose the death penalty <em>under any circumstances. </em>The excusal of these jurors was not an abuse of the court’s discretion, nor did it violate constitutional due process. <em>Witherspoon v.

Upon learning of this, Jennings’ counsel moved for a mistrial. Upon inquiry, the court learned that the elderly juror involved failed to understand the court’s instructions previously given as to sequestration. The court then interviewed each juror who had already been selected and was informed that none had any conversation up to this point with the juror who broke security. The court then excused this juror for cause, directed that another juror be selected from the pane! in his stead and overruled the motion for a mistrial. Assuming the action of the court was in delegation of Rule 1111 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Crimina! Procedure,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the error was clearly harmless.</p>

Prior to arraignment, Jennings’ counsel moved to sever the burglary, larceny and conspiracy counts in the indictment from the murder count, and the motion was granted. During the arraignment proceedings, the court deliberately refrained from reading the complete contents of the indictment to Jennings because it still included the counts charging him with burglary, larceny and conspiracy. However, the court did inform Jennings that he “stands here indicted for the murder of F. K. Fawcett”, and inquired how he plead. No objection to the form or the sufficiency of the arraignment was then voiced, but some days later after the trial jury had been completely selected and sworn, a motion for a mistrial was made on the ground that the defendant had not been properly arraigned. Assuming that the procedure employed by <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>the court constituted error, again it was clearly harmless.

Moreover, we note that the trial court in the instant case called to the attention of the jury that Naser’s testimony originated from a corrupt source and should be scrutinized critically and with care before being accepted as true.

Also that the court instructed the jury that if Naser testified falsely as to any material fact his entire testimony could be rejected. Additionally, it should be noted that the challenged testimony was strongly corroborated by the testimony of another participant in the burglary, namely, Avery. Under the circumstances, the trial court did not err in refusing to rule out Naser’s testimony as a matter of law.</p>
