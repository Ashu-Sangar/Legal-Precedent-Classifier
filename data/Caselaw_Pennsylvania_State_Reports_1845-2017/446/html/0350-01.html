Finally, in November 1968, based on information recently received from one of the youths present at the time of the firebombing, a warrant issued charging Moses with murder. In seeking Moses out, the police learned that he was then a resident of the Auberle Home for Boys in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, and three officers were directed to proceed to the Home to take him into custody. Before traveling to the Home, these officers contacted an authority at the institution by phone and informed him of their intended visit and purpose. When the officers arrived about 11 p.m., they first met with three social workers of the Home and explained the nature of the criminal charge lodged against Moses. The latter was then brought into the room where the officers and the representatives of the institution were gathered. Moses was immediately informed why the officers were there, and one of the social workers, a Mr. Denman, then said he “wanted to question the boy”. The officers readily assented, but suggested the questioning occur outside of their presence and hearing in order that no possible violation ensue of Moses’ constitutional rights. Mr. Denman and another social worker then took Moses into another room. A few minutes later when they emerged, Moses was taken onto police custody.</p>

When the officer started to further “discuss” these rights, Moses said, “I know my rights, I know my rights”. During the ride back to Pittsburgh, nothing further was said about the crime involved.</p>

The officer’s questions and Moses’ answers were recorded on a typewriter. When this was completed at 1:42 a.m., Moses read the statement, signed it at the end and initialed each page. At the time, Moses was sixteen years of age and did not have the assistance of counsel.</p>

It is not asserted that Moses was not fully and clearly advised of all of his constitutional rights before he incriminated himself. But, it is argued that a “juvenile lacks the ability” to fully understand and assert his constitutional rights and, hence cannot effectively waive such rights without the advice of a more mature- person. We emphatically reject such a prophylactic rule, particularly where a sixteen-year or seventeen-year-old is concerned.</p>

However, to declare as a matter of law that a sixteen-year-old, regardless of maturity and intelligence, is unable to fully understand when he is informed of his constitutional rights and may not by himself waive his right to counsel before being questioned by the police would be to ignore reality and the sophistication of the average sixteen-year-old in these days and times.</p>

Unless such constitutional warnings are given and intelligently and understandingly waived by the child <em>and Ms </em>parents, no statement or admission can be used against him in an adversary proceeding.” (Emphasis added.) Similarly the Police Guidance Manual on Juvenile Delinquency, prepared by Professors Louis B. Schwartz and Stephen B. Goldstein of the University of Pennsylvania Law School for use by the Philadelphia Police Force and as a model for metropolitan police forces generally, advises: “. . . the juvenile gets more protection in some ways against police questioning than an adult gets . . . the youngster’s ‘consent’ to answer questions may not be enough to legalize if it [sic] he is too young to realize the risk and consequences, or if his parents or lawyer are not present.

Even in such a dated publication the manual instructs the police to notify the parents or guardians of an arrested minor as soon as possible. Presumably the rationale of such a requirement is to permit the minor to consult with a friendly and experienced adult before making critical decisions. It must be recognized that such manuals are of persuasive and pragmatic significance. .They show that police administrators and advisors are themselves aware of the potentials for abuse if a juvenile is un aided by counsel, parent, or adult friend when interro<a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>gated by the police.
