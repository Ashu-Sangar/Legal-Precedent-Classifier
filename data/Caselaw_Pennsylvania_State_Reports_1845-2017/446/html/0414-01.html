In 1966, appellee commenced an action in equity to partition the aforementioned real estate. A master was appointed for the purpose of conducting a private sale of the said real estate and the property <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>was purchased by appellant for $12,000. In addition to conducting the sale, the master took testimony for the purpose of allocating certain debits and credits between the parties.</p>

After receiving testimony from a real estate appraiser and the parties to this litigation, the master fixed the fair monthly rental value of the premises at $65 and recommended that appellant be charged for rent at the rate of $32.50 per month from December, 1959.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[198,1071,1154,370]]]'>The appellant filed timely exceptions to the master’s findings pursuant to Pa. R. C.

D’Orazio, </em><a href="/pa-d-c/80/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="80 Pa. D. &amp; C. 471" data-case-ids="8730817" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c/80/0471-01">80 Pa.

Appellant has lived in the premises since that time, has made repairs to the premises when necessary and, in point of fact, has acted as the sole owner of the premises. The activities of the appellee, occasionally, in cultivating the garden and visiting the premises to clean did not wrest exclusive possession from the appellant.</p>

        <em> </em>On appeal to this Court, appellant raises a third argument, namely, in order to recover rental value from the tenant in common in possession of the premises, there must be some act creating a landlord-tenant relationship. Since the properties passed to appellant and appellee by inheritance, no such relationship arises. Appellant did not raise this issue in the court below. We have consistently held that matters not properly raised in the court below cannot be raised initially on appeal. <em>E.g., Logan v.
