    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.8",172,[175,793,1155,595]]]'>In a Post Conviction Hearing Act petition, appellant alleged that his guilty plea was not voluntarily and intelligently entered. He had pleaded guilty to murder generally and had been found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to a term of six to twelve years’ imprisonment. His assertion is that his guilty plea could not have been knowingly and intelligently entered inasmuch as the plea was accompanied by the assertion of facts which, if believed, would establish that the homicide was justifiable, necessitated by self-defense.</p>
    <p id="b172-6" data-blocks='[["BL_172.9",172,[172,1402,1155,595]]]'>The crime for which appellant was tried was the stabbing to death of appellant’s fellow prison inmate. He and two fellow inmates testified that the decedent had been the aggressor, attacking appellant first, apparently angry because of appellant’s efforts to protect a fellow inmate from the decedent’s homosexual assaults by having the fellow inmate transferred to another part of the prison. He argues that in such circumstances, the plea could not have been entered with complete comprehension of its impact and was, therefore, not entered intelligently and voluntarily.</p>

      <em> </em>“that a guilty plea should not be accepted if coupled either (a) with the assertion of exculpatory facts, or (b) with a proclamation of innocence,” is correct, or whether the view expressed in the majority opinion in <em>Sampson, </em>that a guilty plea may be accepted when it is “coupled with a flat denial of responsibility,” but may not be accepted when it is “accompanied by an assertion of facts establishing an affirmative defense,” is correct, appellant’s guilty plea should not have been accepted. Here, the facts asserted, if believed, would have made out the affirmative defense of self-defense, and in such circumstances the acceptance of a plea of guilty is error.</p>
