Here the party could have easily discovered and deleted or requested the trial court to delete the hearsay statement in question. In light of appellants’ failure to do so, the trial court clearly did not abuse its discretion in refusing appellants’ request to withdraw this evidence. It follows that the trial court correctly denied appellants’ charge informing the jury that the statement is unreliable hearsay, meriting little weight, and also correctly sustained the appellees’ objection to appellants’ attempt to comment on the hearsay nature of the statement.</p>

It was appellants’ contention that whether Jeffrey came from the right or the left side of the street, he must have been in the roadway for a sufficient time for the appellees’ truck driver to have seen him and avoided him in the exercise of due care. Since there were no eyewitnesses other than the driver and Jeffrey, the appellants based their case on circumstantial evidence, including the distance of the skid marks from the cars parked to the driver’s right and other measurements made at the scene by Sergeant Shenk of the Lancaster Police Department. To illustrate Ms testimony, the sergeant began to use a diagram which he had prepared as part of his investigation. The appellees objected to such use on the ground that the diagram was not drawn to scale and the objection was sustained, quite properly. The appellants then offered a map of the scene which was drawn to scale. This was also objected to by the appellees. The court sustained the objection because it felt that the diagram contained the same inaccuracies which were disclosed to be in the nonscale diagram by <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>the cross-examination which had occurred at the first trial and because the evidence contained in the diagram was “at best cumulative and already in the record in the officer’s direct verbal testimony and photographs.”</p>

Photographs of the scene, taken from different perspectives, could be of little aid to the jury in grasping the significance, if any, of the officer’s figures. If the diagram was drawn to scale and accurately depicted the officer’s measurements, then it should have been admitted into evidence. The court’s failure to do so unfairly made the appellants’ presentation of their case much more difficult.</p>
