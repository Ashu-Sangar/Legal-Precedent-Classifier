A <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>three-judge court, after hearing testimony, found appellant guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In November 1970, appellant’s sentence was commuted, and he is now on parole.</p>
    <p id="b175-4" data-blocks='[["BL_175.4",175,[161,618,1150,432]]]'>On January 19, 1971, appellant filed a post-conviction petition, alleging that his guilty plea was involuntary and his counsel ineffective. At an evidentiary hearing, appellant testified that he never wanted to plead guilty and that his plea should not have been accepted because his own explanation of Nelson’s death constituted a claim of self-defense inconsistent with his guilty plea.</p>
    <p id="b175-5" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[157,1064,1149,428]]]'>Only one of his two court-appointed counsel was still living at the time of the hearing, and he testified that both he and his cocounsel advised appellant to plead guilty because they felt appellant’s story lacked credibility and the district attorney’s file, which they had read, contained a particularly damaging eyewitness account of the events, directly contradicting appellant’s vei'sion of the incident.</p>
    <p id="b175-6" data-blocks='[["BL_175.6",175,[155,1506,1148,323]]]'>The post-conviction hearing court, relying on <em>North Carolina v.

He backed off and put his hand in his pocket, and at that time I was standing by the bed, and I reached down and pulled out a 32 pistol that I had there, and I went over between the stove and the table and I told him to go out in the street until he finished his argument and then come back.</p>
    <p id="b176-10" data-blocks='[["BL_176.10",176,[200,2059,1151,146]]]'>“When I did that, he came out of his pocket with a knife and started at me, and I thought he meant business. . . .”</p>
