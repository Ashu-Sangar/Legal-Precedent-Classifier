A much more plausible interpretation is that it was the intention of the Legislature in enacting this broad revenue measure to give <em>all counties </em>the right to so tax the enumerated personal property. Since such a construction is radically inconsistent with the Act of 1868, we hold that the last mentioned act was impliedly repealed.
