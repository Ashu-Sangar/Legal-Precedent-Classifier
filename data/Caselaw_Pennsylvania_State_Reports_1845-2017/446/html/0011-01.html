Appellant and Ms codefendant were seen getting out of a stopped car and running between two houses, a distance of 150 to 200 feet from the Young residence, and then going directly to the rear of the Young residence. After stopping at the rear window, one of the men went down the rear cellar steps of the residence. The two men were then seen standing at the rear of the residence for a few minutes, and then continuing to the front. The state trooper observing this, having lost sight of the two men, then went to his police car and radioed for assistance. As he returned to the scene, he came upon the two men coming out of the bushes twenty feet from where he had originally been positioned. The two men were placed under arrest.</p>

    <p id="b126-4" data-blocks='[["BL_126.4",126,[210,442,1155,487]]]'>The two men were originally charged with burglary and the possession of burglary tools. However, as one state trooper testified on cross-examination, when the crime laboratory could not identify the fingerprints on the tools as belonging to either defendant, and since the defendants had never been observed in actual possession of the tools, these charges were dropped and the defendants were charged only with malicious loitering.</p>

    <p id="b126-7" data-blocks='[["BL_126.7",126,[205,1550,1156,422]]]'>During the Commonwealth’s case in chief, a state trooper testified that “the defendants were originally charged with burglary because the burglary tools were found in the area where the defendants were—when the defendants were placed under arrest.” The defense immediately moved for a mistrial. The court denied the motion, but directed the jury to disregard that statement.</p>

    <p id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.4",127,[149,446,1148,489]]]'>Such a repetition by the court could not help but emphasize the importance of the burglary arrests to the jury.

Phillips, </em><a href="/pa-super/183/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="183 Pa. Super. 377" data-case-ids="735341" data-case-paths="/pa-super/183/0377-01">183 Pa. Superior Ct. 377</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20A.2d%20733" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="132 A.2d 733">132 A. 2d 733</a> (1957), urges that it was not error to refuse the motion for a mistrial or a new trial, because the state trooper’s remarks, although irrelevant, did not prejudice the defendants. Rather, according to the Commonwealth’s argument, since the state trooper admitted on cross-examination that all burglary charges 'were dropped because there was no evidence to prove that the defendants ever actually possessed the burglary tools [the fingerprints on the tools could not be identified as those of the defendants] the reference to the burglary charges helped rather than hurt the defendants. We cannot accept this argument. The Commonwealth’s whole theory of this case was that appellant and his co-defendant were in the process of committing a burglary. As the Commonwealth said in its brief, in meeting another argument raised by the defendants—that the burglary tools should not have been admitted into evidence because of the absence of a link between the tools ami the defendants: “One of the elements of crime which the Commonwealth had to prove was malice. This has been defined as a showing of intent to do a Avrongful act or proof of the state of mind of a person who does a wrongful act. Commonwealth v. Williams, <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a><a href="/pa-super/185/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="185 Pa.

The defense advanced by the defendants was that they were present at this house for a lawful purpose. The Commonwealth’s evidence, specifically these exhibits in question, would tend to establish that on the contrary the defendants were there for an unlawful purpose, that is, the commission of the crime of burglary.”</p>
    <p id="b128-4" data-blocks='[["BL_128.4",128,[202,725,1157,643]]]'>By testifying as to the Commonwealth’s previous attempt to charge the defendants with burglary, the state trooper was putting in irrelevant evidence which served to emphasize the Commonwealth’s theory of this case. By repeating the improper testimony of the state trooper, the trial court was re-emphasizing the burglary charges, almost as if they were somehow relevant to a determination of why the appellant and his co-defendant were on the Young property and why Miller’s own explanation was not to be believed. There can be no doubt that appellant was severely prejudiced and deserves a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b128-5" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[199,1387,1155,266]]]'>Appellant’s first trial was tainted for an additional reason, which also requires reversal. Before this trial began, the judge made the following spontaneous, irrelevant and obviously prejudicial comment to the jury:</p>

At noon yesterday, I advised the Court Administrator that the case I was then trying would be completed by 3:00 o’clock, and for some reason or another—and I finished the case promptly at 3:00 o’clock. She was notified that I was prepared to go ahead and try another case. I got no further case yesterday, and I have been sitting in Chambers all morning until now, ten minutes to 3:00. It was only stirring up things just a few minutes ago that we finally get this jury.</p>
