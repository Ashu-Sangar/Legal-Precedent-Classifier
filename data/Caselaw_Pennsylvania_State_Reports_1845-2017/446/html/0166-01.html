S. savings bonds valued at f20,250 were found in this safe deposit box; these bonds had been purchased with decedent’s funds and were registered in the name of decedent or his sister. The Commonwealth appraised the bonds for inheritance tax purposes at their full value. On an appeal by the sister, the court below held that the “full appraised value of the bonds which devolved to [the sister were] subject to a transfer inheritance tax” and this Court affirmed that decree. The rationale in <em>Myers </em>was that the decedent had retained custody of and exercised complete control over the <em>bonds-—i.e., </em>the sister had no access to the box-—and that, while the bonds under the federal regulations were legally redeemable by either the decedent or his sister, the sister’s right of redemption was incapable of performance <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>since the decedent had not irrevocably parted with the possession of the bonds bnt had retained exclusive control of them. This Court stated, inter alia: “Both [the sister’s] possession and enjoyment of the bonds in question were postponed until the donor’s death since no previous access to them was made available to her. To permit a transfer inheritance tax exemption on all government bonds issued in the co-ownership form without examining the circumstances of each case, would encourage the practice of investing one’s estate in such bonds and registering them in joint names for the purpose of circumventing the payment of a legitimate exaction.” (p. 582).</p>

However, it is urged by appellee that the case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Myers </em>in that Edward Beggy’s own money purchased the bonds. The fact that Edward Beggy’s money may have contributed in whole or in part to the purchase of these bonds is of no moment. <em>See: Cochrane’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/342/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="342 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1207024" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0108-01">342 Pa. 108</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20A.2d%20305" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="20 A.2d 305">20 A. 2d 305</a> (1941); <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Horstman, </em>we dealt only with the question of <em>ownership </em>of U.

Although they were deposited in decedent’s, safe deposit box, the trial court specifically found that Edward had contributed at least one half toward their purchase price and that decedent had been holding Edward’s “share” in the bonds merely as a custodian. That be<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>ing so, Edward, upon Ms brother’s death, had “a right to the immediate ownership or possession and enjoyment” of the bonds. Finally, there is not the slightest evidence that the co-ownership was “created in contemplation of death.” In light of the foregoing, Section 241 is clearly controlling, and it follows that the trial court correctly ruled that inheritance tax was due only upon one half the value of the bonds.</p>

Because the decedent had bought the bonds with his own assets, the question arose whether all of the bonds were part of his estate or whether there had been a valid inter vivos gift of a one half interest to his brother. Since decedent had retained complete control and had exercised complete dominion over the bonds, it was ruled that all of the bonds were taxable as part of his estate. As an additional reason for so holding, this Court expressed the fear that the opposite result might “encourage the practice of investing one’s estate in such bonds and registering them in joint names for the purpose of circumventing the payment of a legitimate exaction.” <a href="/pa/359/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="359 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="473152" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0577-01">359 Pa. at 582</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20A.2d%2050" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="60 A.2d 50">60 A. 2d at 53</a>.</p>

Decedent could scarcely give to Edward that which <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>Edward already owned. For the same reason, there should be no concern here about the possibility of a covert scheme of tax avoidance.
