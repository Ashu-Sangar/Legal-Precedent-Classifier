All three felons were indicted for murder, and subse<a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>quently, Barlow entered a general plea of guilty to the indictment. After an evidentiary hearing before a three-judge court, lie was found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. Barlow filed this appeal.</p>

There is no merit to this contention.</p>
