Two firearms were used in killing each of the victims, and shots from both weapons were found in each of the bodies. The weapons were never found. No felony other than the homicides was involved, and there were no witnesses to the killing, so that the Commonwealth’s case was basically presented and predicated upon circumstantial evidence.</p>

All of the circumstances considered by the jury and described by the witnesses covered a short period, roughly between 5:55 p.m. and 7:13 p.m., on the evening of the killing. The defendant offered no evidence, so that the testimony presented by the Commonwealth was submitted to the jury without contradiction.</p>

McGrath testified that he arrived on the premises at about 5:55 p.m., at which time the building’s parking lot was vacant except for two automobiles; the defendant’s and that of another member of the union, Gregory Carchidi, who was also employed by the local as a janitor. The defendant, Sullivan, an official of Local 107, was then sitting at a desk beside a window in the second story office of another union official. From the window Sullivan had a view <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>of the parking lot, and his position at the window was maintained while McGrath entered the building, went up to that office on the second floor and began his janitorial work there. The switchboard for the telephone lines had been arranged for the night so that the line listed and used for incoming calls having to do with regular union business was plugged in to ring the extension telephone in the room where Sullivan was sitting. Another line with a different call number had been set up by the switchboard operator to ring in Gorey’s room, by prearrangement with Gorey’s knowledge, so that Joseph Vernick, who wished to speak with Gorey, could reach him by calling that number after 7 p.m. that evening. As McGrath started his cleaning work, Sullivan asked him why he was cleaning the building on this night, which was a Friday, and suggested that he wait until Sunday night to do the cleaning, pointing out that a union meeting was scheduled for Sunday during the daytime, so that the place would require cleaning after that meeting. The victims, Gorey and Janda, arrived between 6:10 and 6:15 p.m., and went to Gorey’s office on the second floor. The witness continued emptying trash baskets and working his way from one room to the next around the second story, going from the office in which Sullivan was sitting to the conference room which was next, but for an area-way, to the office in which the victims then were.</p>

There followed a conversation with Sullivan about something that John Gorey had said, during which <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>Carchidi came into the conference room at a time estimated to be a matter of a minnte or two after Sullivan had made his entrance.</p>

In fact, neither of them made any comment to the other. Instead, Carchidi spoke directly to McGrath, stating in Sullivan’s presence just about what Sullivan had just said: ‘. . . leave the cleaning go until Sunday after the meeting.’ Sullivan then left the conference room. McGrath testified that Sullivan’s departure was ‘from three to five minutes, approximately’, after Gorey had left; that he then continued his cleaning, and that Carchidi ‘reminded me again to let the cleaning go until after Sunday.’ It was at this point that McGrath heard ‘what I believed to be firecrackers ... I heard a lot of noise, loud reports, which I thought were firecrackers . . . just like I said, Your Honor, it was a bunch of noises simultaneously. Don’t know how to say the word, but if you light a whole pack of firecrackers and throw them on the floor and they would go off one right after another.’ In this charged atmosphere McGrath turned to Carchidi who was seated in the chair behind him and exclaimed, ‘What was that?’ WTiereupon Carchidi stated, ‘Get out of the building and don’t say nothing’. McGrath got out of the building and noticed that the cars that had been on the parking lot previously, Gorey’s, Sullivan’s and Carchidi’s, were still there, but at this time there was another car also on the lot. Mc-Grath fixed the time of his departure as between 7:05 and 7:15 p.m. He testified that, because of his hasty departure, doors to the rooms on the second floor where he had been working had been left open and the lights were left on when he left the building. He returned 15 to 20 minutes later and observed that the automobiles <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>of Sullivan and Carchidi, and the third car, had vacated the parking lot, leaving only the automobile of John Gorey; in addition, all of the doors inside the building had been closed, and all of the lights had been turned off. The door to the conference room which had been left open was now closed and locked.</p>
    <p id="b539-3" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[160,677,1151,882]]]'>“Other witnesses gave testimony which served to add important threads and details in the fabric of circumstantial evidence. For example, when Irene Glenn telephoned, dialing in on the principal telephone line of the union (which line, as previously noted had been set up to ring at the desk where Sullivan was then sitting), the call was answered by one who stated that he was Gorey. Her recollection was that this recipient of her call gave his name as ‘Bill’ Gorey; and, while she was not sure which first name he gave, she was quite positive that the last name given was ‘Gorey’. It was uncontested that Sullivan had written her name and telephone number on a certain yellow sheet of paper which was found in the waste basket in that office. Coupled with this was the fact that her call was at 6:15 p.m., just shortly after the victims had arrived.</p>
    <p id="b539-4" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[158,1572,1149,545]]]'>“Joseph Yernick, trying to reach Gorey, made his call to the number which was given to him by the union’s telephone switchboard operator, Esther Snyder. She testified that she had plugged this line into Gorey’s office with his knowledge, so that, presumably, he was expecting the call which remained unanswered that evening, apparently after his and Bita Janda’s deaths. Yernick rang through on this line to Gorey’s telephone several times, receiving no answer, over a period from 7:15 to 8:15 p.m.”</p>

Although the <em>Lopinson </em>case grew out of incidents occurring before the adoption of the version of Eules 102 and 116 which are in issue here, the reasoning of that case is controlling. As the opinion of Mr. Justice Eagen stated, “The Philadelphia medical examiner possesses all of the powers of a coroner by virtue of the provisions of the Philadelphia Home Eule Charter, including jurisdiction to conduct an inquest when sudden, violent or unnatural deaths occur, and to act as a committing magistrate if the deaths are found to be the result of homicide.” The opinion then quoted with approval the lower court’s historical recital in support of this holding. <a href="/pa/427/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="427 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1910385" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0284-01">427 Pa. at 291</a>.</p>

Guy, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/41/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="41 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 151" data-case-ids="1697861" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/41/0151-01">41 Pa. D. &amp; C. 2d 151</a> (Ally. Cty. 1966). In that case Common Pleas Judge Aldisert (now of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit) in a learned historical opinion, concluded that the coroner’s investigation was a proper alternative to the directives of Eules 102 and 116 for the initiation of criminal proceedings. Judge Aldisert demonstrated that since its inception in 1276, the office of coroner has been investigative in nature, as well as judicial; it is an office designed to protect the public welfare, and, for this purpose, includes the powers of a committing magistrate. Further, Judge Aldisert noted that to require a coroner’s hearing to begin with the filing of a written complaint, as appellant contends is required by Eule 102, would defeat the inherent quasi-investigative powers of that office, and hence the purpose of the office itself. Unlike a justice of the peace or other committing magistrate, the coro<a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>ner has the power and the duty to determine, upon an investigation undertaken on his own motion of the facts surrounding a suspicious death, that there is sufficient cause to hold an accused for the unlawful killing of another human being. The justice of the peace or ordinary committing magistrate, including a judge of the court of common pleas, has no power in his own right to set in motion the formal criminal process; he must await a written complaint of either a peace officer or an ordinary citizen. <em>Commonwealth v.

The <em>Rose </em>case concerned not the duties and functions of the office of coroner but the question whether a common pleas judge sitting as a committing magistrate could initiate proceedings for perjury without the filing of a complaint or granting a preliminary hearing. As we have recently indicated in <em>Commonwealth v.

Sullivan also claims he was denied his pre-trial rights when the trial court failed to grant his motion to quash the indictments. This motion raised, inter alia, the alleged violation of Sullivan’s rights to challenge the array of the grand jury by the procedure set forth in Buie 203 of the Pennsylvania Buies of Criminal Procedure. Buie 203 requires that the challenge to the array be made before the grand jurors are sworn and in any event before the bill of indictment is submitted to the grand jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This procedure was not followed in the instant case. Sullivan was held without bail at the conclusion of the Medical Examiner’s inquest into the death of Bita Janda and John Grorey and was indicted eleven days thereafter. No challenge to the array was made during this eleven-day period. The question of the denial of Sullivan’s right to challenge the array was first raised more than two months after the indictments were handed down when Sullivan’s new counsel, shortly after his retention by Sullivan, moved to quash the indictments.</p>

In the present case, in contrast, Sullivan, while still represented by counsel, became an accused and was held “for action of court” with respect to the homicides of Gorey and Janda. The precise date of the intended presentation was readily ascertainable, if indeed not already known to counsel, and eleven days was ample time in which to challenge the array.</p>

The Commonwealth offered the pictures to enable the jury to understand clearly the nature of the scene, the location of the bodies in the room, the nature of the wounds and injuries inflicted, the extent of the injuries, and in order to clarify the medical examiner’s explanation of the sequence of the shots fired. It was the Commonwealth’s theory, substantiated by ballistic evidence, that the murdered couple were killed by shots from two different weapons, and that each person was hit by shots from both guns. From the reconstruction of the shooting as it occurred through use of the slides the Commonwealth sought to demonstrate that neither victim could have shot the other; that Gorey was the primary target of the assassins, and that Mrs. Janda was then shot whilst seeking refuge under a desk.</p>

The objections to about forty slides were overruled after a lengthy consideration and previewing by the trial judge out of the presence of the jury; as to another group the objections were sustained.

This law was not overlooked by <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>the lower court; in fact, it ordered a reargument of that part of the new trial motion involving this question in order to consider whether our decision in <em>Powell, supra, </em>was intended to propound a new rule as to admissibility of photographs in homicide cases, and concluded (one judge dissenting) that it was not. In this we think the court was correct. A similar contention was made and rejected in <em>Commonwealth v. Wilson, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/433/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="433 Pa. 88" data-case-ids="1920959" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0088-01">433 Pa. 88</a>, 93, <a href="/citations/?q=249%20A.2d%20536" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="249 A.2d 536">249 A. 2d 536</a> (1969). As was pointed out in <em>Wilson, Powell </em>was “a clear case of felony-murder where the force used and the nature and extent of the injuries was irrelevant.” The slides in <em>Powell </em>went far beyond any possible relevance, including, for example, post autopsy demonstrations such as the peel-back of a scalp.</p>

Peyton, supra. </em>Having ourselves examined the pictures in the context of the rest of the evidence in the case, we are satisfied that he did not. The violent nature of the killings, indeed, the assassination-like aspects of it, was a vital part of the case and one as to which the jury was entitled to be fully informed. The slides were clearly of aid to the pathologist in giving his testimony as to the first degree character of the killings. Moreover, the conspiracy question, considered below in Part IV, was an issue in the case which added to the importance and significance of the nature of the wounds and positions of the bodies. It is clear to us that the admitted pictures in general supplemented in a meaningful way the pathological testimony and therefore had essential evidentiary value. While some of the pictures were gruesome, we cannot say that they were such as to inflame the minds and passions of the jury as to Sullivan, the defendant-appellant. Any tendency they may have had in <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>this direction was properly warned against by the trial judge before they were shown, as required by our decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

Restated in capsule form (the typewritten transcript of testimony is 1346 pages in length), the salient points of the Commonwealth’s case were the following: Five persons, and possibly six, were in the union hall at the time of the killings. When McGrath arrived to clean the hall at 6:00 p.m., that Friday evening he found that cars belonging to Sullivan and Carchidi were in the parking lot, as was a car which he recognized to be one which often was driven by DiPasquale. Upon his entrance into the building, McGrath found Sullivan and Carchidi to be there. A few minutes later he saw, from a window, John Gorey and Rita Jan da, the victims, arrive in Gorey’s automobile. As McGrath began to clean the hall, both Sullivan and Carchidi sought to have him discontinue his janitorial work and to leave the building. Shortly thereafter, while McGrath and Carchidi were talking, the “firecracker-like sounds” rang out. McGrath exclaimed “What’s that?”, and Carchidi responded, “Get out of the building and don’t say nothing.” McGrath left the building promptly, noting that the same cars (with the addition of Gorey’s) were parked in the lot as when he had entered the building. He also noticed DiPasquale standing- outside the hall. McGrath got into his car and drove home. Returning to <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>the scene a short time later, McGrath observed that only Gorey’s car remained in the lot.
