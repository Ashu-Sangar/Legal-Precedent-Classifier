    <p id="b225-8" data-blocks='[["BL_225.14",225,[142,1466,1151,429]]]'>In October of 1959, appellant, William I. Mirkil Co., a real estate brokerage firm, secured two tenants to occupy adjoining parcels of land in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, owned by Harry and Millie Ettinger. A one-year lease for the larger parcel (Tract A) was with Scott Smith Cadillac Co. for $500 per month, and another one-vear lease was with Herbert and Evelyn Albany at $100 per month for Tract B.</p>
    <p id="b225-9" data-blocks='[["BL_225.15",225,[142,1909,1147,208]]]'>Each lease contained provisions obliging the Ettingers to pay appellant leasing commissions for its service and assigned unmatured rents to appellant to the extent of the commissions as they accrued.</p>
    <p id="b225-10" data-blocks='[["BL_225.16",225,[142,2129,1147,100]]]'>In February of 1960, Bobert and Ann Gaylon purchased the two parcels from the Ettingers.</p>

From February to August, appellant continued to collect the rentals on the Scott Smith Cadillac lease until it was notified by the Gaylons that it should terminate that lease as well. On or about October 31, 1960, the Gaylons entered into a new month-to-month lease directly with Scott Smith Cadillac at a rental of $500 per month. On April 29, 1961, the Gaylons leased for a one-year term all but a small portion of Tracts A and B to Scott Smith Cadillac for $750 a month. Since that time, Scott Smith Cadillac remains a tenant on the two parcels. At issue in this case is whether appellant is entitled to commissions for rents received on the new lease and renewals of that lease.</p>
    <p id="b226-4" data-blocks='[["BL_226.4",226,[197,1177,1154,643]]]'>On November 15, 1963, appellant filed a complaint for commissions. The Gaylons filed preliminary objections seeking a more specific complaint. On February 2, 1969, appellant filed an amended complaint. On February 13, 1969, the Gaylons filed preliminary objections in the nature- of a demurrer. The lower court, sitting en banc, sustained these preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. The Superior Court affirmed the decision by a per curiam opinion, with Judge Hoffman filing a dissenting opinion in which Judge Montgomery and Judge Ceiicone joined. We granted allocatur and now we reverse.</p>

L. 205, 21 P.S.. 655, which provides: “A grantee of real estate which is subject to ground rent or bound by mortgage or other <em>encumbrance </em>shall not be personally liable for the payment of such . . . encumbrance, unless he shall, by an agreement in writing, have expressly assumed a personal liability therefor, or there shall be express words in the deed of conveyance stating that <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>the grant is made on condition of the grantee assuming such personal liability: Provided, That the use of the words 'under and subject to the payment of such . . . encumbrance,’ shall not alone be so construed as to make such grantee personally liable as aforesaid.”</p>
    <p id="b227-3" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[179,606,1147,374]]]'>The court held that the leases in question, containing as they do obligations on the part of the lessor to pay real estate commissions, were ''other encumbrances” within the language of the statute, and therefore the Gaylons were not responsible for commissions since they had not assumed in writing personal liability therefor.</p>
    <p id="b227-4" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[181,993,1150,927]]]'>We agree with the dissenters in the Superior Court. The statute is inapposite. It was designed to prevent an unwitting purchaser of real estate from being held personally liable on obligations he did not intend to assume but which the law imposed on him by reason of ownership or implication from general words in a deed which might amount to less than an explicit assumption. See <em>Fidelity-Philadelphia T. Co. v. Hale &amp; Kilburn Corp., </em><a href="/f-supp/24/0003-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="24 F. Supp. 3" data-case-ids="4163951" data-case-paths="/f-supp/24/0003-01">24 F. Supp. 3</a> (Pa. E.D. 1937). Brokerage commissions on leases stand on a different footing. There is no problem about the unwitting assumption of obligations without concomitant benefits. Instead, the law has always been, as we said in <em>Albert J. Grosser Co. v. Rosen, </em><a href="/pa/436/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="436 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1926172" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0311-01">436 Pa. 311</a>, 317, <a href="/citations/?q=259%20A.2d%20679" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="259 A.2d 679">259 A. 2d 679</a>, 681 (1969) : “By taking the benefits of the lease and collecting the rents, [the mortgagee in possession] has adopted the lease and must likewise take its burdens.”</p>

Instead, they argue that they only took subject to the leases and emphasize that in <em>Grosser, supra, </em>we held that the lease and the broker’s right to commissions were extinguished when the mortgagee actually purchased the property. Although there is a general rule that sheriff’s sales discharge all subsequent junior liens, there <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>is not such an automatic extinguishment of the leases by an ordinary conveyance. <em>Landau v. Western Pennsylvania National Bank, </em><a href="/pa/445/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="445 Pa. 217" data-case-ids="1940098" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0217-01">445 Pa. 217</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20331" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="282 A.2d 331">282 A. 2d 331</a> (1971).</p>
    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[186,558,1154,152]]]'>Rather, by adopting the benefits of the Scott Smith Cadillac lease, appellees also implicitly assented to the following provisions:</p>

    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[189,716,1156,539]]]'>The Gaylons also argue that Paragraph 20 does not apply because the relationship referred to in Paragraph 20 must be in reference to the same tract of land. The Gaylons emphasize that the new lease with Scott Smith Cadillac covers not only old Tract A, to which the lease drafted by appellant for the Ettingers and Scott Smith Cadillac applied, but also to practically all of Tract B, which was unaffected by the previous lease with Scott Smith Cadillac. On this argument we believe appellees have a point.</p>

It cannot be construed to include all relationships between the landlord and tenant and/or their assigns regardless of where the land is situate. Moreover, if the lease was drafted by appellant, which seems likely, since appellant’s name is on the lease form, the paragraphs quoted above would be strictly construed against the appellant, as the party drafting it. Eor these reasons, appellant will only be entitled to commissions for that portion of rent received which represents Tract A’s portion of the entire leased premises.</p>
