It was sufficient to establish that Glover, wielding a knife, broke into the second floor apartment of his estranged girl friend, Brenda McKinnon, while Andrew Robinson, Edward Milner and Wil<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>liam Burton were present; that as the three guests attempted to flee the danger, Glover ran after them, caught Robinson near a window in the kitchen of the residence, stabbed him, and pushed him out of the window causing injury which resulted in Robinson’s death. Glover attempted to excuse the stabbing by pleading self-defense at trial, but this defense failed as a matter of law, and undoubtedly failed to impress the jury, when Glover admitted during cross-examination that he stabbed Robinson as the latter was attempting to flee from him.

The record indicates that the incident complained of was not of serious proportion, and no prejudice resulted. Hence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award a new trial because of this uncalled-for conduct. See <em>Commonwealth v. Garrison, </em><a href="/pa/443/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="443 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="1937024" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0220-01">443 Pa. 220</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%20750" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="279 A.2d 750">279 A. 2d 750</a> (1971). Moreover, no motion for a mistrial was entered. Nonetheless, we wish to emphasize that it is the duty of the court to see that trial proceedings are conducted in an orderly manner and any disturbance or outbursts should be checked immediately by the court <em>on its own motion. </em>Misconduct on the part of a trial audience should never be tolerated and should immediately be suppressed in a manner as to impress upon the jury the impropriety and injustice of such conduct.</p>

An altercation developed between Glover and Edward Milner, who was present in the apartment at the time and came to the assistance of Miss McKinnon. Glover punched Milner in the mouth and threatened to secure a weapon “to kill this M. F.” before being taken into custody by the police. This evidence was properly admitted to demonstrate the existence of ill feeling and motive on the part of Glover directed against Miss McKinnon and her friends. It is well settled that “[e]vidence to prove motive, or intent, or plan, or design, or ill will or malice is always admissible.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Secondly, the words were introduced into evidence not for the truth of the matter contained therein but rather to corroborate the fact that they were in fact said.
