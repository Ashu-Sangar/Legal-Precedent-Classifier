We disagree with such an interpretation.</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[171,545,1147,854]]]'>Considered separately the language of §1101.501 seems explicit enough. However, construing this same language in the context of the remainder of the statute, as we must, what was latently ambiguous becomes obviously so. It is to be noted that Article VI contains provisions which deal with more than just the powers and duties of the Board; matters of decertification of employee representatives and grievance procedures are also treated therein. To follow appellant’s construction would make some parts of the statute operational while others lie dormant awaiting the effective date. But the canon of construction that every law shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions will not brook such a result in the instant case. See 46 P.S. §551, and <em>Lynch v. Owen J. Roberts School District, </em><a href="/pa/430/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="430 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1915751" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0461-01">430 Pa. 461</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="244 A.2d 1">244 A. 2d 1</a> (1968).</p>

The logic of appellant’s contention must run its course and that logic demands that wherever a power or duty of the Labor Board be found in the Act, it too must be exercisable immediately. In the face of such a situation, confusion and uncertainty in the practical application of the law would result and the possible problems of interpretation would be manifold. By way of illustration, Article XIII, §1101.1301 empowering the Labor Board to prevent any unfair labor practices would clearly be operative while Article XII, §1101.1201 which contains a listing of those unfair practices arguably might not be since the provisions found therein are neither “powers” nor “duties” to be exercised by the Board, but instead are commands to public employers and employees. But plainly <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>the latter provision is ancillary to the former, informing it with meaning. Logic demands that since the enumeration of unfair practices is so intimately bound up with the Board’s power to prevent them that §1101.-1201 should also be operative; otherwise it is the cart before the horse. But to construe the statute in this manner, i.e., non-power or duty provisions becoming operative as corollaries or modifiers of power and duty sections, would soon reduce the legislative imperative that the act shall take effect in ninety days to an empty formalism.</p>

On January 11, 1971, PCEA filed a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia to set aside this action of the PLRB on the grounds that the ordering of a new election precluded all rights of PCEA to certification as the collective bargaining agent under the stipulation and because it interfered with our deliberations in the present matter.
