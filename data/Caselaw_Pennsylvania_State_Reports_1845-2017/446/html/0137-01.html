    <p id="b251-3" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[162,463,1153,1540]]]'>The relevant facts are as follows: Plaintiff was injured on September 14, 1966 when the Ford automobile he was driving, owned by his father, Joseph M. Balk, went out of control on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The resulting accident was allegedly due to a defect in the steering mechanism. On August 30, 1968 suit was instituted by complaint against Ford Motor Company, as manufacturer, and Robin Ford, as dealer-seller, alleging that the personal injuries sustained by appellant, James Balk, and the property damage sustained by his father (the other plaintiff) were caused by both defendants or either of them in installing, and failing to discover, the defective steering mechanism, and in failing to warn plaintiffs of the existence thereof. On December 21, 1968, service of a reinstated complaint was made on both defendants. Neither defendant appeax*ed and a default judgment was taken against both on January 27, 1969. No notice was given of the entry of this judgment. Trial for assessment of damages was listed for October 27, 1969. Pursuant to Delaware County Court Rule 277(2), requiring five days written notice of such a hearing, notice was sent by registered mail to appellee on October 21, 1969. The caption on this notice stated only “Re: Balk v. Ford Motor Co.”, and in no way referred to any action involving Robin Ford. Robin Ford did not appear and an ex parte hearing was held, at which time a jury assessed damages of $75,000 against the defendant appellee alone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

So far as appears, Robin Ford was totally unaware of the judgment against it <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>until receipt of the letter of October 21, 1989, informing Robin Ford of the assessment hearing. This notice, however, referred only to the matter of “Balk v. Ford Motor Company”. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that by waiting to open judgment until November 3, 1969, after it had learned that damages had been assessed against it, Robin Ford did not act promptly. Although its action came nine months after the entry of the default judgment, the trial court sitting as a court in equity ivas more strongly influenced, and we think properly, by the date when defendant actually learned of the situation rather than the date it could have learned of it through the constructive notice given by recording a judgment. Two cases cited by appellant where the opening of judgments was denied sixteen and ten months after having been entered are inapposite. <em>Myers v. Mooney Aircraft, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/429/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="429 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1913502" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0177-01">429 Pa. 177</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=240%20A.2d%20505" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="240 A.2d 505">240 A. 2d 505</a> (1967) ; <em>Baraonfski v.

Appellee asserted in his petition to open, and neither plaintiff denied, that appellee is not the seller of the allegedly defective automobile. If this be true, the bottom drops out of appellant’s case: no duty whatever was owing by Robin Ford as seller to either Balk the father as purchaser or Balk the son as user of the car; if allowed to enter this defense, appellee presumably will be quickly successful in the suit.</p>

The record establishes that Robin Ford received service of the reinstated complaint on December <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>21,1968, that it forwarded it to its counsel twelve days later, that on the same day counsel forwarded it by registered mail to Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Robin Ford’s insurer, which received it on Monday, January 6, 1969. From that point on until the entry of the jury verdict, there is no trace of the complaint and no action taken on behalf of appellee with respect to the suit. The insurance company’s supervisor testified on deposition that mail relative to the company’s claims business was always heavier on Mondays than during the rest of the week, and particularly heavy on this particular Monday, following as it did the New Year’s holiday period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>Appellant’s final contention is that a court should utilize its equitable powers and refuse to open a default judgment where there has been detrimental reliance by the plaintiff on the failing of the defendant to appear and answer. We agree with the court below that appellant was in no way prejudiced by Robin Ford’s failure to respond. The reinstated complaint was not served until more than two years after the accident. Thus, even had appellee appeared and answered within twenty days, the statute of limitations had already run with regard to a new suit against the actual seller. By the same token, plaintiff at that time had no right to amend the complaint to charge Robin Ford as repairer of the car (appellant’s answer to the petition to open suggests that Robin Ford serviced the car even if it did not sell it) because such an amendment would involve the introduction of a new cause of action after the expiration of the Statute of Limitations. <em>Saracina v.
