At the conclusion of the jury trial, a compulsory nonsuit was entered by the trial judge in favor of the defendant, Dr. Francis J. McAndrews. The jury found in favor of the other two defendants, St. Luke’s Hospital and Dr. Ann Snyder. Appellant’s motions for a new trial and judgment n.o.v. were argued before a court en banc and denied, and judgment was entered on the jury’s verdict. This appeal followed. We will affirm.</p>

She was then 23 years of age and had been in apparent good health prior to the onset of what proved to be her terminal illness. Prior to December 25, she had had some slight temperature, but had been able to visit friends, returning home on the evening of December 25th. At that time she appeared to her mother and other lay persons to be acutely ill. Both of her legs were covered with black and blue blotches, she was coughing, moaning and was quite weak. In the <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>next two days her temperature dropped from a high of 104° to a low of 93° and her extremities became stiff and cold. At this point, on the advice of her family physician, she was transported to defendant hospital, being then in a condition described as semi-conscious. After examination by the defendant, Dr. Snyder, she was not admitted but was sent home with a diagnosis <em>of </em>“gastroenteritis”. She remained in bed for the next 38 hours at the end of which time her death occurred. Upon autopsy the cause of death was certified to be “intestinal gastroenteritis” and “bilateral pneumonia”.</p>

Some of these contentions, however, warrant some comment. Two of the contentions have to do with a changed autopsy report and áre based upon the participátion of Dr. J. W. Fisher in the autopsy examination and studies and the admissibility of the new report at the time of the trial.</p>
    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.5",454,[183,1413,1155,547]]]'>Dr. Fisher, a consulting pathologist at the hospital was present with others at the autopsy ordered by the coroner and held on December 30,. 1966. Dr. Fisher testified that tissue was removed from the body at- the autopsy, placed in paraffin blocks, kept in bottles-and stored in a cabinet in Dr. Fisher’s laboratory. Four months later, after a microscopic examination of some of the tissue, Dr. Fisher identified the cause of death as nonspecific myocarditis and prepared his new autopsy report.</p>

The pathologist who supervised the preparation of the autopsy, Dr. J. W. Fisher, actually testified at the trial as to the specific findings and conclusions in the report. The Act in question provides a practical procedure for avoiding the bar to proof of hearsay statements in so-called business records. Here, Dr. Fisher, the person responsible for the records was present and subjected to vigorous cross-examination as to the reliability of the method of preparation, as to the contents and as to the conclusions in the report. Moreover, because of the extent of Dr. Fisher’s direct testimony, from which the jury could have reconstructed the entire report, the admission of the report was proper, or at most harmless error.

We are satisfied that the cross-examination of this expert witness as to the cause of death was within permissible limits as a test of the value of the witness’ expert opinion. Admittedly, when the cross-examination finally appeared to be extended excessively as to the final autopsy report, the trial judge took steps to terminate further questioning when it appeared that defense counsel was doing more than testing the soundness of the expert’s opinion. Since we conclude that <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>the trial judge did not abuse his discretion and that the plaintiff was not obviously injured by the challenged cross-examination, we find no basis for a new trial because of the trial court’s action here. <em>Tolomeo v.

If there is evidence leading to a conclusion that the death from myocarditis could be associated with a symptom of pneumonia then those points were obviously too strong, but I will reiterate that the theory of the Plaintiff was that death occurred from pneumonia, and it is the theory of the defense that death occurred by virtue of myocarditis.”</p>

The charge was <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>an inaccurate oversimplification of the issues involved. If the jury found that the examination conducted by Dr. Snyder and the St. Luke’s Hospital emergency room staff was negligently conducted, and they found that, as appellant alleges, the decedent had pneumonia on December 27, 1966, which would have been disclosed by a competent medical examination, then, even if they found that the decedent died of myocarditis, they could not excuse the appellees, unless they also found that the myocarditis was in no way related to the pneumonia. For only if the myocarditis was unrelated to the pneumonia would a negligently-conducted examination not be the proximate cause of decedent’s death. The modification, in my view, compounded the error contained in the charge. Although the modification of Point for Charge No. 18 attempted to make a correction, the modification of Point For Charge No. 23 recreated the error contained in the original charge. By reiterating “that the theory of the plaintiff was that death occurred from pneumonia and it is the theory of the defense that death occurred by virtue of myocarditis,” the court once again made it appear to the jury that the two possible causes of death were mutually exclusive and that a finding of death caused by myocarditis eliminated the possibility of liability.</p>

As pointed out by the majority, the modified instructions were occasioned by appellant’s specific objections, and I do not believe that it requires much of a stretch to incorporate those objections in the general exception to the charge.</p>
