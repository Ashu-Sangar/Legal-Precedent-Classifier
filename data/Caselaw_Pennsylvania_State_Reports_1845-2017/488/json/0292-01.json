        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant, a licensed \u201cskilled nursing facility\u201d participating in the medical assistance program established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act and Article IV of the Public Welfare Code, challenges a \u201creimbursement ceiling\u201d of the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare. Without first directly petitioning the Department, appellant filed a \u201cPetition for Review\u201d in the Commonwealth Court, claiming that the ceiling contravenes federal law by basing a facility\u2019s entitlement to reimbursement on the availability of funds, and not on a \u201creasonable cost related basis.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E). On the Department\u2019s preliminary objections, the Commonwealth Court dismissed the petition because appellant \u201chas failed to exhaust an adequate administrative review process which must be resorted to as a prerequisite to obtaining judicial review.\u201d 34 Pa.Cmwlth. 177, 181, 382 A.2d 1290, 1292 (1978). We affirm.\nUnder the exhaustion requirement, \u201ca party must pursue the administrative remedies he has against an agency before challenging its action in court.\u201d Department of Environmental Resources v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 469 Pa. 578, 594 n.28, 367 A.2d 222, 230 n.28 (1976). Accord, McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. 185, 193, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 1662, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969); Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 50-51, 58 S.Ct. 459, 463, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938). See B. Schwartz, Administrative Law \u00a7 172 (1976); L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 497-98 (1965). Appellant accepts the soundness of the requirement of exhaustion, but claims the requirement has no application here. According to appellant, this case presents an issue which is \u201cstrictly legal\u201d and not in any respect dependent upon resolution of facts. On this \u201cstrictly legal\u201d question, appellant maintains that the ceiling is not reasonably cost-related and thus in \u201cclear violation\u201d of federal law. Appellant maintains this \u201cclear violation\u201d can and should immediately be corrected. Finally, appellant asserts that it would engage in an \u201cexercise in futility\u201d were it to seek administrative relief because, in appellant\u2019s view, departmental review can adjust reimbursements only if the adjusted sum is below the departmental ceiling.\nAppellant\u2019s justifications in support of its attempt to circumvent departmental remedies are unpersuasive. Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the reimbursement ceiling, as applied to appellant, will provide funds which are not reasonably cost-related. For example, there is nothing on this record which demonstrates that appellant\u2019s actual costs exceed the departmental ceiling. It might also be true that, because of non-allowable costs or inefficiencies, reimbursement at the departmental ceiling is entirely appropriate. As the Department points out, States are given latitude to determine what amount is\n\u201cadequate to reimburse in full such actual allowable costs of a facility that is economically and efficiently operated.\u201d\n42 C.F.R. \u00a7 450.30(a)(iv)(A). Thus, until it has been established, rather than presumed, that appellant\u2019s actual, legitimate costs exceed the departmental ceiling, appellant poses only a conjectural, speculative claim.\nHad appellant pursued departmental remedies, the critical factual issue appellant now presumes could have been properly considered and adjudicated. By departmental regulation, a skilled nursing facility which believes it has been aggrieved by the Department\u2019s reimbursement \u201cmay request within 30 days after notification by the Department, an informal or formal hearing under the Administrative Agency Law, Act of June 4, 1945, P.L. 1388.\u201d Nothing on this record would indicate that the departmental hearing would not afford appellant a full opportunity to establish its actual, legitimate costs and any claimed failure to reimburse properly. See Administrative Agency Law, \u00a7\u00a7 31-36 (\u201cadjudication procedure\u201d); see also 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 501-598.\nThe appropriateness of adhering to the exhaustion requirement where, as here, both a proper record as well as an administrative determination are lacking is clearly manifest. It has been observed that:\n\u201cPremature interruption of the administrative process is no more justified than premature interruption of the trial process by interlocutory appeals. The agency, as the tribunal of first instance, should be permitted to develop the factual background upon which decisions should be based. Like the trial court, the agency should be given the first chance to exercise discretion and apply its expertness. In addition, judicial efficiency requires the courts to stay their hand while the party may still vindicate his rights in the administrative process. If he is required to pursue further agency remedies, the courts may never have to intervene.\u201d\nSchwartz, supra at \u00a7 172 p. 498. There is simply no occasion here to create an exception to the requirement of exhaustion in order to permit \u201c[pjremature interruption of the administrative process.\u201d The order of the Commonwealth Court may not be disturbed.\nOrder affirmed.\n. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.\n. Act of June 13, 1967, P.L. 31, \u00a7 441.1 et seq., as amended, 62 P.S. \u00a7 441.1 et seq. (Supp.1979).\n. Under Section 1396a(a)(13)(E), state plans must provide:\n\u201ceffective July 1, 1976, for payment of the skilled nursing facility and intermediate care facility services provided under the plan on a reasonable cost related basis, as determined in accordance with methods and standards which shall be developed by the State on the basis of cost-finding methods approved and verified by the Secretary.\u201d\nSee 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 450.30(a)(3). See also Public Welfare Code, supra note 2, at \u00a7 443.1(3).\n. DPW Manual For Allowable Cost Reimbursement For Skilled Nursing and Intermediate Care Facilities, 5 Pa.Bull. 2928, 2934 (November 8, 1975). The governing departmental regulation provides in full:\n\u201cV. Facility appeal procedure.\nIn the event the facility disagrees with the interim per diem rate or annual adjustment established by the Department, the facility may request within 30 days after notification by the Department, an informal or formal hearing under the Administrative Agency Law, Act of June 4, 1945, P.L. 1388.\nThe facility will present written justification along with the request. Appeals will be heard within 45 days and decided within 90 days after requested.\u201d\nSee Administrative Agency Law, Act of June 4, 1945, P.L. 1388, \u00a7 35, formerly 71 P.S. \u00a7 1710.35 (1962), which provided:\n\u201cAgencies shall have the power to promulgate regulations prescribing their practice with respect to adjudication procedure not inconsistent with the terms of this act. . . \u201d\nSee also Act of July 31, 1963, P.L. 425, \u00a7 2 (\u00a7 51 of Administrative Agency Law amended to include DPW within its coverage). Section 35 of the Administrative Agency Law forms the basis for 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102(a), which provides that \u201c[a]n agency shall have power to promulgate, amend and repeal reasonable regulations implementing the provisions of this title.\n. Nothing in the language of the departmental regulation governing \u201cFacility Appeal Procedure,\u201d see supra note 4, would preclude inquiry at the \u201cinformal or formal hearing\u201d into the legality of the Department\u2019s reimbursement ceiling, followed by appeal directly to the Commonwealth Court. See Administrative Agency Law, \u00a7 41, as amended. We note, however, that the Department, without objection from appellant, has taken the position that the \u201cAppeal and Fair Hearing\u201d Chapter of the DPW Public Assistance Manual, see 55 Pa.Code Ch. 275, applies here. Under that Chapter, an appeal from a hearing officer\u2019s determination is to be taken first to the Secretary of the Department, and then to the Commonwealth Court. See 55 Pa.Code \u00a7 275.4(h)(4). The Commonwealth Court accepted the Department\u2019s position here. See 34 Pa.Cmwlth. at 180-181, 382 A.2d at 1292.\n. In view of our disposition, we do not now decide the validity of the challenged reimbursement ceiling. Resolution of that issue is for an administrative determination initially and, then if necessary, judicial review.",
