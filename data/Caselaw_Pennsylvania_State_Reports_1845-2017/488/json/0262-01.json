        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nAppellant was convicted of burglary, robbery, and conspiracy to commit burglary for his participation in the May 16, 1974 burglary and robbery of a law office. [During the commission of these crimes, a secretary in the law office (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cvictim\u201d) was injured.] Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant appealed to the Superior Court, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The Superior Court remanded the case \u201cto the lower court for an evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\u201d An evidentiary hearing was held and the lower court rejected appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Appellant re-appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the lower court in a per curiam opinion. This appeal followed.\nAppellant\u2019s first contention is that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move for the suppression of (1) the victim\u2019s alleged photograph identification and (2) the victim\u2019s subsequent identifications of appellant. Appellant argues that trial counsel should have moved for the suppression of the alleged photographic identification because it was allegedly made without the presence of counsel while he (appellant) was under arrest and because of \u201cthe likelihood of irreparable suggestivity inherent in such identifications.\u201d Appellant argues that trial counsel should have moved for the suppression of the victim's subsequent identifications of appellant because they were \u201ctainted\u201d by the alleged photographic identification.\nThis Court held in Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 605-06, 235 A.2d 349, 352-53 (1967) that:\ncounsel\u2019s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests. The test is not whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record. Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that trial counsel\u2019s decisions had any reasonable basis. [Emphasis in original]\n\u201cAs a corollary, counsel is not ineffective for failing to raise baseless or frivolous issues.\u201d Commonwealth v. Wilson, 482 Pa. 350, 353, 393 A.2d 1141, 1143 (1978).\nAt trial, the victim testified that during her hospitalization for treatment of the injuries incurred during the crimes in question, Police Officer Alfred M. Gillette visited her and showed her \u201csome photographs ... to identify.\u201d The victim described this photographic display as follows:\n[Prosecutor] Q Did you have occasion to speak with the police while you were in the hospital?\n[Victim] A Yes, sir.\nI had Detective Gillette came [sic] in the hospital with some photographs for me to identify, if I could. And I looked through quite a few of them, and I did pick out this one photograph as one that I suspected being the one who was in the office. It was a very small photograph and was taken from a distance.\nThere was no testimony at trial that the victim selected appellant\u2019s photograph during this photographic display. In fact, Officer Gillette (the officer who conducted the photographic display) testified at the evidentiary hearing that the victim \u201cmade no identification\u201d during the display:\n[Appellant\u2019s Counsel at the Evidentiary hearing] Q Now, I would ask you, do you recall going to a hospital on May 20, 1974, to talk to a Miss Ingels [the victim]?\n[Officer Gillette] A I believe she was in Montgomery Hospital. Yes, I was there.\nQ And at that time did you have occasion to show her any photographs?\nA Yes, I did.\nQ And did she pick out any photograph from the group that you showed her as the person who was involved in the robbery that took place in Attorney Robert Trucksess\u2019 [law] office?\nA No, she made no identification from the picture. Q Was Jay Arthur\u2019s [appellant] picture among those pictures that you showed her?\nA Yes, it was. [Emphasis provided]\nIt follows that since the victim did not make a photographic identification of appellant, the victim\u2019s subsequent identifications of appellant cannot be tainted by the non-existent photographic identification and, therefore, a motion to suppress the subsequent identifications would have been frivolous.\nAppellant\u2019s second contention is that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a lineup prior to the second preliminary hearing. [Subsequent to the first preliminary hearing, the charges against appellant were dismissed. Shortly thereafter, another criminal complaint (setting forth the same charges as the first) was filed against appellant, appellant was re-arrested, and a second preliminary hearing was held.]\nIn arguing that trial counsel should have requested a lineup prior to the second preliminary hearing, appellant assumes that the second preliminary hearing would have been where the \u201cfirst confrontation\u201d between the victim and himself would take place and that therefore, a lineup would mitigate any suggestiveness that might transpire at this \u201cfirst confrontation\u201d. Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit since the \u201cfirst confrontation\u201d between the victim and appellant had already occurred at the first preliminary hearing. At trial, the victim testified that at the first preliminary hearing, she identified (to at least two persons) appellant (who was present at the first preliminary hearing among a group of individuals of his same general description) as one of the individuals who committed the crimes in question. Since the \u201cfirst confrontation\u201d between the victim and appellant had already occurred at the first preliminary hearing, there was no need for a lineup prior to the second preliminary hearing to mitigate the suggestiveness which might transpire at a \u201cfirst confrontation\u201d.\nAppellant\u2019s third contention is that trial counsel was ineffective \u201cin failing to protect the Rule 1100 issue\u201d in that he did not answer the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for an extension of time to commence trial.\nOn January 29, 1975, appellant\u2019s trial counsel filed an \u201capplication for trial continuance\u201d and this application, which was opposed by the Commonwealth, was granted. In said application for continuance, appellant signed the following statement: \u201cI am . . . aware of my right to a speedy trial and that a continuance shall cause a delay in having said criminal charges disposed of by the Court.\u201d On February 4, 1975, six days after appellant\u2019s trial counsel filed his \u201capplication for trial continuance\u201d and 180 days after the complaint against appellant was filed, the Commonwealth filed a petition for an extension of time to commence trial (under Rule 1100). Appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not answer this petition and the petition was granted.\nAppellant\u2019s argument that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to oppose the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for an extension of time is without merit. The Commonwealth\u2019s petition was made necessary by the trial continuance which appellant moved for and received six days earlier. If trial counsel had opposed the Commonwealth\u2019s petition, he would have had to argue for an anomalous position, i. e., he would have had to argue that although appellant was entitled to a trial continuance 6 days earlier, the Commonwealth should not receive an extension of time to coincide with said continuance.\nAppellant\u2019s fourth contention is that trial counsel was ineffective because prior to trial, he \u25a0 failed to interview co-defendant William Thomas who (appellant argues) would have provided him with \u201ca possible alibi defense\u201d. The charges against co-defendant Thomas were dismissed on March 29,1975 (approximately three weeks prior to the start of appellant\u2019s trial) on the grounds that Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1100 was violated.\nAt the evidentiary hearing, appellant testified that \u201cabout a week before my sentencing\u201d, co-defendant Thomas \u201ctold me that he would tell Judge [Robert W.] Tredinnick [who presided at appellant\u2019s trial] that he [Thomas] was the one that had did [sic] the robbery, along with Howard Goudy\u201d and that appellant was not involved in the crimes. Appellant also testified that after having this conversation with Thomas, appellant informed trial counsel of same.\nThis contention is without merit. Appellant testified that he did not inform defense counsel of co-defendant Thomas\u2019 \u201cpossible alibi defense\u201d until appellant\u2019s trial was over; prior to appellant\u2019s trial, trial counsel had no knowledge that Thomas would provide an alibi for appellant.\nAs support for the proposition that trial counsel\u2019s failure to interview co-defendant Thomas constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant cites Commonwealth v. Mabie, 467 Pa. 464, 359 A.2d 369 (1976) wherein this Court held that a defense counsel\u2019s failure (prior to trial) to interview eyewitnesses to the crime in question constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Mabie is distinguishable from the instant case in that Mabie\u2019s defense counsel had to interview the aforementioned eyewitnesses before determining whether the eyewitnesses would be helpful to his client\u2019s case. By contrast, trial counsel in the instant case could conclude without interviewing co-defendant Thomas that his testimony would be of no value to and could damage the credibility of appellant\u2019s case. Thomas\u2019s entire testimony could be destroyed quite easily by the fact that he waited until the charges which were proferred against him were dismissed before he admitted that he (and not appellant) committed the crimes in question; Thomas\u2019 testimony would have the same lack of credibility as the testimony of \u201ca co-conspirator who is already in prison and realistically has little to lose by attempting to free his partner.\u201d Commonwealth v. Tervalon, 463 Pa. 581, 345 A.2d 671 (1975)\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\nNIX, J., concurred in the result.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellant also argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to have a stenographic record made of appellant\u2019s first preliminary hearing. In arguing that this record could have been useful to his case, appellant assumes that the victim testified at the first preliminary hearing and that, during her testimony, she failed to identify appellant. Appellant\u2019s argument fails since the victim did not testify at the first preliminary hearing.\nAppellant also argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to \u201chave a large group of Black males present at the [second] preliminary hearing\u201d so that (presumably) it be more difficult for the victim to make an identification of appellant at the second preliminary hearing. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to have this group in attendance at said hearing does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\n. Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1100(a)(2) provides:\nTrial in a court case in which a written complaint is filed against the defendant after June 30, 1974 shall commence no later than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date on which the complaint is filed.\nPennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1100(c) provides in pertinent part:\nAt any time prior to the expiration of the period for the commencement of trial, the attorney for the Commonwealth may apply to the court for an order extending the time for commencement of trial. . . . Such application shall be granted only if trial cannot be commenced within the prescribed period despite due diligence by the Commonwealth.\n. Appellant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for an extension of time does not meet the requirements of Commonwealth v. Mayfield, 469 Pa. 214, 364 A.2d 1345 (1976) and therefore, trial counsel should have opposed this petition. Mayfield was decided on October 8, 1976, 20 months after the Commonwealth filed its petition; \u201c[Qounsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to predict future developments in the law.\u201d Commonwealth v. Triplett, 476 Pa. 83, 381 A.2d 877 (1977).\n. Appellant also argues that tried counsel was ineffective in filing \u201cboiler-plate\u201d post-verdict motions and thereby giving \u201cup the right to raise the identification and Rule 1100 issues that were so central to . . . [appellant\u2019s] case.\u201d This claim is spurious. Appellant does not specify what errors were committed by the trial court with regards to the identification and Rule 1100 issues which should have been raised by trial counsel in post-verdict motions. Additionally, the failure of trial counsel to raise his own ineffectiveness with regards to the identification and Rule 1100 issues in post-verdict motions did not waive these claims of ineffectiveness. Commonwealth v. Gardner, 480 Pa. 7, 389 A.2d 58 (1978).",

In my view, trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to move to suppress the victim\u2019s in-court identification made outside counsel\u2019s presence after arrest. Relying on the investigating officer\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing held after trial to the effect that the victim made no such identification, the majority concludes that appellant\u2019s claim is without merit. This reliance, however, is entirely misplaced, for at trial the jury could reasonably conclude, based on the victim\u2019s testimony, that the victim indeed \u201cpicked out\u201d appellant at the photographic showing. There is, therefore, no foundation on this record to conclude that the photographic identification, which took place after appellant\u2019s arrest and outside counsel\u2019s presence, is valid. Nor is there anything on this record to indicate that the in-court identification had an independent origin. Appellant must be granted a new trial.",
