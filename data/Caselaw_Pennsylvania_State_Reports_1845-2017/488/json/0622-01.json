Appellant argues that his trial/direct appeal counsel was ineffective in several respects, namely:\n1. For failure to object to, or motion for a mistrial because of, allegedly prejudicial remarks of the prosecutor during his closing arguments;\n2. For failure to request an instruction to the jury on involuntary manslaughter; and\n3. for failure to call certain witnesses in his behalf.\nWe have examined the record and conclude that these issues are without merit. Accordingly, judgments of sentence affirmed.\nEAGEN, C. J., notes a dissent and would grant a new trial because of prosecutorial misconduct.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellant\u2019s judgments of sentence for murder of the third degree and carrying a firearm without a license were upheld by this Court on direct appeal. Commonwealth v. Solomon, 471 Pa. 417, 370 A.2d 372 (1977).",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI must dissent. Review of the record compels the conclusion that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction to the jury on involuntary manslaughter. I would therefore vacate the judgment of sentence and remand for a new trial.\nCounsel\u2019s assistance is effective if the particular course chosen by counsel has some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests. Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967). In every criminal homicide prosecution under the Crimes Code a defendant is entitled, upon request, to an involuntary manslaughter instruction. Commonwealth v. Smith, 474 Pa. 559, 379 A.2d 96 (1977); Commonwealth v. Garcia, 474 Pa. 449, 378 A.2d 1199 (1977) (plurality opinion). Counsel\u2019s failure to request the instruction, in light of the very strong evidence against his client, was incompatible with any theory of trial strategy. Thus, trial counsel\u2019s assistance was constitutionally insufficient, and appellant is entitled to a new trial.\nI note also my disagreement with the majority\u2019s disposition of appellant\u2019s claim that the remarks of the prosecutor at closing argument were unduly prejudicial. While there was no transcript made of the closing arguments, uncontradicted testimony at the PCHA hearing revealed that the prosecutor likened appellant\u2019s actions to that of a \u201chit-man\u201d or a \u201chit-man contract.\u201d\nIt is well-settled that a prosecuting attorney may not \u201cunfairly characterize and stigmatize the defendant.\u201d Commonwealth v. Van Cliff, 483 Pa. 576, 397 A.2d 1173 (1979). Accord, Commonwealth v. Gilman, 470 Pa. 179, 368 A.2d 253 (1977) (prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant as \u201ccold-blooded killer\u201d impermissible); Commonwealth v. Capalla, 322 Pa. 200, 185 A. 203 (1936) (reversible error for prosecutor to call defendant a \u201ccold-blooded killer\u201d); ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function and the Defense Function (Approved Draft 1971) \u00a7 5.8. In my view, the prosecutor\u2019s references here to a \u201chit-man\u201d or \u201chit-man contract\u201d were inflammatory and prejudicial and equally require relief.",
