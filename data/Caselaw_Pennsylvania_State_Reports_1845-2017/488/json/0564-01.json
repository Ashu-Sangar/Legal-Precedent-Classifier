All attempts by plaintiffs to litigate their various issues have become bogged down in a procedural morass.\nNow, while the plaintiffs are faced with the immediate danger of their business community being destroyed, a majority of this Court refuse to maintain the status quo of the situation.\nThe plaintiffs have asserted facts under oath which have never been legally denied by the defendants. If those facts are presented in court, the defendants, acting in concert and as one, will have been shown to have violated the Sunshine Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 261-269 (Supp.1979-80), the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 101-754 (Appendix), and to have deprived the plaintiffs of their property without due process of law.\nI think we are treading on dangerous ground when we allow, in this country, one person to take another\u2019s property for the sole reason that this entity \u201cjust wants to have it\u201d. A man\u2019s home and property used to be his castle. The speed and secrecy with which the defendants acted in \u201ccertifying\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 business properties as \u201cblighted\u201d indicates the defendants were aware of the problems which I am enunciating here. No government or unit thereof should ever act on behalf of, for and as if it represents a business corporation.\nThe defendants are now on notice that they act at their own peril. If the plaintiffs prevail in their cause, the defendants will have no room to complain of any remedy or restitution fashioned to right their wrong.",
