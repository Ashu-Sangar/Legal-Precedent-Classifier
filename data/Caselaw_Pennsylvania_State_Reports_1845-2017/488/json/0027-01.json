        "text": "OPINION\nROBERTS, Justice.\nOn April 8, 1975, appellant Ronald Upshur was convicted by a jury of murder of the first degree, robbery, and conspiracy. The court sentenced him to consecutive prison terms of life and twenty-five to fifty years. On direct appeal, appellant seeks relief on the ground, inter alia, that the trial court improperly refused trial counsel\u2019s request for an \u201caccomplice\u201d charge, and that trial counsel\u2019s subsequent failure to challenge this ruling in written post-verdict motions constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree, vacate the judgments of sentence, and grant a new trial.\nI\nOn April 15, 1975 trial counsel filed timely post-verdict motions averring in boiler plate fashion that the verdicts were unsupported by the evidence and contrary to law. At post-verdict argument, however, trial counsel briefed and argued numerous other issues. The court en banc held that the issues raised by written post-verdict motions lacked merit, and that the other issues had been waived because they were not filed in written post-verdict motions pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123. See Commonwealth v. Carrillo, 483 Pa. 215, 395 A.2d 570 (1978) (post-verdict court properly exercises discretion by refusing to address issues not presented in written post-verdict motions).\nAppellant, through new counsel, now contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to include these other issues in post-verdict motions, and that this Court should therefore consider these other issues. We must resolve the ineffectiveness claim by determining whether \u201cthe particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604, 235 A.2d 349, 352 (1967); see generally Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 331 A.2d 435 (1975).\nHere trial counsel, after filing boiler plate motions, briefed and argued before the post-verdict court issues not contained in the written post-verdict motions. It must be assumed that, in counsel\u2019s view, judicial consideration of these issues would advance his client\u2019s interests. In such circumstances, there can be no reasonable basis for the failure to raise issues in accordance with Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123. The interests of his client are in no way advanced by raising issues in an impermissible manner. Cf. Commonwealth v. Von Smith, 486 Pa. 564, 406 A.2d 1034 (1979) (untimely motion for severance cannot be predicated on any reasonable trial strategy). Since appellant\u2019s trial counsel failed to include in post-verdict motions the issues he thereafter wished to be considered by the court, appellant was denied effective representation. Accordingly, we consider the issues ineffective trial counsel failed to preserve properly.\nII\nOf the issues now properly before this Court, we need address only one. Malcolm McLaughlin testified for the Commonwealth that he heard appellant on two occasions admit to robbing and killing Alvin Smultkis. On the basis of other evidence adduced at trial, appellant\u2019s trial counsel contended that McLaughlin was an \u201caccomplice,\u201d and requested the court to instruct the jury on the weight to be accorded \u201caccomplice\u201d testimony. The court refused this charge. Appellant here urges that the court\u2019s refusal constitutes reversible error. We agree.\nTestimony of a witness who is an accomplice in the crime charged and testifies for the prosecution \u201cis to be carefully scrutinized and accepted with caution.\u201d Commonwealth v. Sisak, 436 Pa. 262, 265, 259 A.2d 428, 430 (1969); see Commonwealth v. Mouzon, 456 Pa. 230, 318 A.2d 703 (1974); Commonwealth v. Coades, 454 Pa. 448, 311 A.2d 896 (1973); see generally 3A Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 967 (Chadbourn rev.); Pennsylvania Standard Jury Instructions \u2014 Criminal \u00a7\u00a7 4.01-.03 (May 15, 1972 Draft). The rationale of this view is that \u201c[s]uch a witness, out of a reasonable expectation of leniency, has an interest in inculpating others.\u201d Commonwealth v. Russell, 477 Pa. 147, 153, 383 A.2d 866, 868 (1978); see generally Cool v. United States, 409 U.S. 100, 103, 93 S.Ct. 354, 357, 34 L.Ed.2d 335 (1972); Commonwealth v. Turner, 367 Pa. 403, 409-410, 80 A.2d 708, 712 (1951). An accomplice charge is necessitated not only when the evidence requires an inference that the witness was an accomplice, but also when it permits that inference. Commonwealth v. Sisak, supra, 436 Pa. at 268, 259 A.2d at 431.\nWhether evidence in this case permits an inference that McLaughlin was an accomplice is controlled by our decision in Commonwealth v. Thomas, 479 Pa. 34, 387 A.2d 820 (1978). Thomas arose from the same criminal incident as this case, and presented, as here, the issue whether Curtis Thomas, appellant Upshur\u2019s codefendant, was entitled to an accomplice charge. The evidence at Thomas\u2019s trial indicated that Thomas and two Commonwealth witnesses, McLaughlin and Smith, were members of Black Brothers Incorporated. This organization operated for the purpose of conducting criminal activity, and owned a gun available to its members for use in obtaining illegal \u201cprofits\u201d to be shared by all. Nonetheless, the trial court, as here, refused a requested accomplice instruction. This Court reversed. We held such \u201cevidence . . . permits the inference that the witnesses McLaughlin and Smith were participants in a conspiracy to commit robberies and other illegal acts in order to financially support ...\u201d Black Brothers Incorporated, id., 479 Pa. at 38, 387 A.2d at 822, and thus concluded that Thomas was entitled to an accomplice charge.\nThe Commonwealth fails to persuade us that on this issue the facts in Thomas are distinguishable from those in the instant case. The evidence adduced at appellant Upshur\u2019s trial demonstrates that McLaughlin and appellant were members of Black Brothers Incorporated, and that shortly after the robbery and killing of Smultkis appellant in disguise entered a meeting of Black Brothers Incorporated at which McLaughlin was present and announced his crime. Later that day appellant entrusted to McLaughlin the weapon he used in this criminal incident \u2014 a weapon owned by Black Brothers Incorporated.\nAs in Thomas, the facts here permit an inference that McLaughlin, as a member of Black Brothers Incorporated, participated in a conspiracy with appellant to rob and kill Alvin Smultkis. Here, as in Thomas, we hold that the trial court erroneously refused trial counsel\u2019s request for an accomplice charge.\nJudgments of sentence vacated and new trial granted.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nNIX, J., joins this opinion and files a concurring opinion. O\u2019BRIEN, J., concurs in the result.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion, in which FLAH-ERTY, J., joins.\n. Appellant took this direct appeal from his conviction for felonious homicide under the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II \u00a7 202(1), formerly 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1), replaced by 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722. The Superior Court transferred appellant\u2019s appeal of the conspiracy and robbery convictions to this Court under the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. V \u00a7 503, formerly 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.503, replaced by 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 705.\n. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123 (effective July 23, 1973) provides in relevant part:\n\u201c[0]nly those issues raised and the grounds relied upon in the [post-verdict] motions may be argued.\u201d\n. Appellant also appeals the post-verdict court\u2019s finding that the verdict is supported by the evidence. This claim is meritless.\n. In addition to this evidence, trial counsel by cross-examination of McLaughlin sought to establish the nature of Black Brothers Incorporated\u2019s activities, as was done in Thomas. Upon Commonwealth objections, however, the trial court refused to permit this line of questioning.",

        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent. The majority states: \u201cAccordingly, we consider the issues ineffective trial counsel failed to preserve properly. Of the issues now properly before this Court, we need address only one [the refusal of the trial court to instruct on \u2018accomplice\u2019 testimony].\u201d In proceeding to address the merits of this issue, the majority ignores the often-pronounced mandates of this Court that an appellate court may not reach the merits of issues not preserved for appeal.\nThis was made clear by Justice Pomeroy, speaking for a majority of this Court in Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 279 n.8, 372 A.2d 687, 696 n.8 (1977) which held:\nIt is well-settled that, as a rule, issues not raised by way of post-trial motions will not be considered on appeal. (cites omitted) . . . Attacks on ineffectiveness of counsel may not be properly used as a vehicle to circumvent the consequences of failing to preserve issues for appeal. If a finding of ineffectiveness of post-trial counsel is made, the appropriate remedy is to remand the case to the trial court to allow appellant to file post-trial motions nunc pro tunc. It is not ... to reach the merits of the claim which has not been preserved. So to conclude would be to resurrect the discarded doctrine of \u2018basic and fundamental error\u2019 under the rubric of ineffective assistance of counsel. Compare Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974). (emphasis added).\nSee also Commonwealth v. Holmes, 482 Pa. 97, 106, 393 A.2d 397, 401 (1978) and Commonwealth v. LaSane, 479 Pa. 629, 637 n.9, 389 A.2d 48, 52 n.9 (1978).\nIn the instant case, the asserted ineffectiveness occurred, if at all, at the post-trial hearing stage. Thus, as in Hub bard, the appropriate remedy for the ineffectiveness in this case is a remand to the trial court to allow appellant to file new post-trial motions nunc pro tunc.\nMoreover, even though it is improper to address the accomplice charge issue on the merits, I feel constrained to voice my disagreement with the majority\u2019s substantive analysis of that issue. The majority opinion relies on Commonwealth v. Thomas, 479 Pa. 34, 387 A.2d 820 (1978) to conclude \u201cthe trial court erroneously refused trial counsel\u2019s request for an accomplice charge.\u201d I feel an accomplice charge would not have been proper, however, for the reasons stated by the dissent in Thomas.\nAn accomplice charge serves to caution the jury that certain testimonial evidence is of a corrupt source and subject to close scrutiny, Commonwealth v. Mouzon, 456 Pa. 230, 318 A.2d 703 (1974), and must be given with respect to a prosecution witness where the evidence presents a jury question as to whether that witness was an accomplice in committing the crime with which the defendant stands charged. Commonwealth v. Mouzon, supra; Commonwealth v. Sisak, 436 Pa. 262, 259 A.2d 428 (1969).\nThe theory of the majority is that Smith and McLaughlin aided and abetted the murder \u2014 robbery as participants in a \u2018conspiracy to commit robberies and other illegal acts in order to financially support BBI (Black Brothers, Inc.).\u2019 Opinion of the Court, ante at 38. This is based upon statements given to the police by McLaughlin following his own arrest to the effect that BBI was engaged in nefarious activities of one sort or another, that the murder weapon belonged to the organization, and that the proceeds of the robbery were donated to the organization\u2019s treasury. Even if these statements be accepted as true they are insufficient to give rise to an inference that Smith and McLaughlin were in fact accomplices.\nIn order to establish that one has aided or abetted in the commission of a crime, it must be shown that one was an active partner in the planning or commission of the crime; the evidence must lead to more than mere speculation or conjecture. Commonwealth v. Fields, 460 Pa. 316, 333 A.2d 745 (1975); Commonwealth v. McFadden, 448 Pa. 146, 292 A.2d 358 (1972); Commonwealth v. Strantz, 328 Pa. 33, 195 A. 75 (1937). There is in the case at bar a patent absence of any such evidence. Indeed, the majority makes a quantum leap by assuming that mere knowledge of a crime may give rise to an inference of complicity in that crime. Such a notion has long been rejected in this Commonwealth: \u2018mere knowledge of the perpetration of a crime does not involve responsibility for its commission.\u2019 Commonwealth v. Giacobbe, 341 Pa. 187, 195, 19 A.2d 71, 75 (1941). While the fact that the proceeds of the robbery in question were donated to the treasury and the murder weapon belonged to the organization could be enough to implicate other members of BBI, including Smith and McLaughlin, their involvement would be only as accessories after the fact. Commonwealth v. McFadden, supra.\nBecause the evidence was insufficient to convict either witness on an accomplice theory, it was not error for the trial court to refuse to give an accomplice charge. Commonwealth v. Tervalon, 463 Pa. 581, 345 A.2d 671 (1975); Commonwealth v. Mouzon, supra. Hence this dissent.\n479 Pa. at 39-41, 387 A.2d at 823-24. (Pomeroy, J., dissenting, joined by O\u2019Brien, J.).\nFurthermore, even if I agreed that Thomas was decided correctly under the facts and circumstances of that case, it does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion in this case. The majority notes that, in Thomas, the evidence introduced at that trial indicated Black Brothers Incorporated (BBI) was organized and operated for the purpose of conducting ongoing criminal activity and that BBI owned the gun used by appellant, which gun had been used in similar \u201cjobs.\u201d This evidence was not before the jury in the instant case. The jury at appellant\u2019s trial knew only that appellant and McLaughlin were members of an organization known as Black Brothers Incorporated, that appellant announced his crime at a meeting of BBI, and that the witness McLaughlin had taken the gun from appellant; the jury did not know the illegal and conspiratorial nature of BBI\u2019s activities nor that BBI had owned the gun used in the crime. Thus, the evidence at appellant\u2019s trial could have at most supported an inference that McLaughlin was an accessory after the fact, as the evidence which persuaded the majority in Thomas to find an inference of accomplice involvement was simply not present in the instant case.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I dissent and would remand to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion, granting leave to appellant to file new post-verdict motions.\nFLAHERTY, J., joins this dissenting opinion.\nSection 306 of the Crimes Code defines \u2018accomplice\u2019 as follows: \u2018(c) Accomplice defined. \u2014 A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if:\n(1) with the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he:\n(1) solicits such other person to commit it; or\n(ii) aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing it; or\n(2) his conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity.\u2019\nSee the Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 306(c).\nLiability as an accessory after the fact is governed by Section 5105 of the Crimes Code. That section provides:\n\u2018(a) Offense defined. \u2014 A person commits an offense if, with intent to hinder the apprehension, prosecution, conviction or punishment of another for crime, he:\n(1) harbors or conceals the other;\n(2) provides or aids in providing a weapon, transportation, disguise or other means of avoiding apprehension or effecting escape;\n(3) conceals or destroys evidence of the crime, or tampers with a witness, informant, document or other source of information, regardless of its admissibility in evidence;\n(4) warns the other of impending discovery or apprehension, except that this clause does not apply to a warning given in connection with an effort to bring another into compliance with law; or\n(5) volunteers false information to a law enforcement officer. The Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5105.\u2019 . . .\n. In Thomas, the statements of McLaughlin and another BBI member were read into evidence \u2014 each also testified at trial. In appellant\u2019s trial, only McLaughlin testified. And, while McLaughlin\u2019s statement was entered as an exhibit, only an unrelated [to the issue of accomplice liability] portion was ever presented to the jury.",
