        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nOn March 31, 1975, appellee Pennsylvania Power & Light Company filed a request with the Public Utility Commission that it be allowed to charge certain rates for electricity and adopt a certain rate design, i. e., relationship of rates charged to different customer classes. Appellant, Pennsylvania Petroleum Association, is a trade association, whose members are retail distributors of heating oil. It filed a complaint with the commission, alleging appellee\u2019s proposed rates for heating were below cost and that such low rates should not be allowed because they would prevent appellant\u2019s members from competing fairly. The commission substantially allowed appellee\u2019s proposed rates and rate design and appellant appealed to the Commonwealth Court. The court quashed the appeal for lack of standing. 32 Pa.Cmwlth. 19, 377 A.2d 1270 (1977). We granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nWe find appellant\u2019s complaint failed to establish entitlement to relief which could be granted and, therefore, will not disturb the decision of the Commonwealth Court.\nPublic utility rates must be \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d Public Utility Code, Act of July 1, 1978; P.L. 598, No. 116, \u00a7 1301, 66 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1301. Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission v. Pa. Gas and Water (filed February 1, 1980); Keystone Water Company v. Pa. P.U.C., 477 Pa. 594, 611, 385 A.2d 946 (1978) (Opinion of Roberts, J., in support of reversal, joined by Eagen, C. J. and Nix, J.). There was a similar provision in the prior law, Act of March 21, 1939, P.L. 10, No. 11, \u00a7 2. A \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rate means a rate that will give the utility a fair return. Scranton v. Scranton S. H. Co., 405 Pa. 397, 176 A.2d 86 (1961). A customer claiming that a utility rate is in excess of what will give a fair return may seek to have it lowered. The seller of a competing product cannot force the utility to raise rates that it alleges are detrimental to its competitive position, as protection of such an interest is not an objective of the regulatory scheme. See Ritter Finance Co., Inc. v. Myers, 401 Pa. 467, 165 A.2d 246 (1960).\nThe Order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nLARSEN, J., concurs in the result.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.",
