In this capacity, on April 28, 1977, he entered into a written agreement to sell the real estate which is the subject of this controversy to appellee, Lanco, Inc. Appellant, Theresa Payne, a residuary beneficiary under the will, filed a petition asking the court below to restrain the sale. At the hearing on her petition, the appellees’ motion for a nonsuit was granted by the court and this appeal followed.</p>

We disagree. After careful review of the evidence, we are satisfied that the finding of the court below that there was no fraud here is amply supported by the record. Following a series of meetings between the administrator and the heirs, during which offers of $20,000, $25,000 and $27,000 were considered and rejected, the appellant, by letter dated March 29, 1976, made a written offer of $32,000 to purchase the property, and informed the administrator that she would be able to close within 30 days. On June 4,1976, counsel for the administrator advised appellant’s counsel that the offer was acceptable to his client and forwarded the proposed agreement of sale to appellant’s attorney for signature. There then followed an exchange of letters between counsel for the administrator and counsel for appellant, consisting, <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>for the most part, of changes which appellant’s counsel wished to have made in the sales agreement. This correspondence went on for almost one year, at which point, the administrator, apparently frustrated by the delay, discharged his attorney, engaged another, and entered into the aforementioned agreement to sell the property to Lanco, Inc. for the sum of $35,000. When appellant was informed of the proposed sale to Lanco, she immediately offered to pay $37,000 for the property.</p>

Appellant argues that the administrator’s conduct was improper in that he failed to obtain the best possible price for the property. Furthermore, it is asserted that the administrator attempted to exclude appellant from acquiring the property and thereby demonstrated inadequate regard for appellant’s interest as a beneficiary of the estate. Without deciding whether the administrator’s actions may have been improper, or whether he was guilty of neglect or bad faith, it is clear that his actions, as found by the lower court, did not amount to fraud. Since fraud was not proved, grounds to set aside the contract are lacking. Equity will not intervene to restrain a sale when statutory requirements are not met: <em>Aequitas sequitur legem.</em>

It is indisputable that a fiduciary has a duty to deal fairly with beneficiaries of an estate. <em>Steele Estate, </em><a href="/pa/377/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="377 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="1249593" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0250-01">377 Pa. 250</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.2d%20409" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="103 A.2d 409">103 A.2d 409</a> (1954). However, there is no requirement, as appellant contends, that a fiduciary give special preference to a beneficiary in the sale of estate property. Moreover, the fact that appellant was willing to make a better offer after the contract of sale had been entered into is not a sufficient ground for setting aside the contract. See 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3360(a); <em>Curtis Estate </em>(Salke Appeal), <a href="/pa/437/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="437 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1927757" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0123-01">437 Pa. 123</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=261%20A.2d%20589" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="261 A.2d 589">261 A.2d 589</a> (1970).
