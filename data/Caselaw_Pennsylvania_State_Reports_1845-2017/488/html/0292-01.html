See B. Schwartz, Administrative Law § 172 (1976); L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 497-98 (1965). Appellant accepts the soundness of the requirement of exhaustion, but claims the requirement has no application here. According to appellant, this case presents an issue which is <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>“strictly legal” and not in any respect dependent upon resolution of facts. On this “strictly legal” question, appellant maintains that the ceiling is not reasonably cost-related and thus in “clear violation” of federal law. Appellant maintains this “clear violation” can and should immediately be corrected. Finally, appellant asserts that it would engage in an “exercise in futility” were it to seek administrative relief because, in appellant’s view, departmental review can adjust reimbursements only if the adjusted sum is below the departmental ceiling.</p>
    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[243,873,1147,567]]]'>Appellant’s justifications in support of its attempt to circumvent departmental remedies are unpersuasive. Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the reimbursement ceiling, as applied to appellant, will provide funds which are not reasonably cost-related. For example, there is nothing on this record which demonstrates that appellant’s actual costs exceed the departmental ceiling. It might also be true that, because of non-allowable costs or inefficiencies, reimbursement at the departmental ceiling is entirely appropriate. As the Department points out, States are given latitude to determine what amount is</p>
    <blockquote id="AGT" data-blocks='[["BL_365.6",365,[285,1462,1104,98]]]'>“adequate to reimburse in full such actual allowable costs of a facility that is economically and efficiently operated.”</blockquote>
