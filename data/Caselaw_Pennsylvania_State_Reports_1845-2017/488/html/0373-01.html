On September 26, 1979, the grand jury issued a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to the custodian of records of the Hawthorne Corporation, which directed production of the corporation’s records before the grand jury concerning the Penrose Bridge landfill for the period from September 1, 1978 to September 1, 1979.

In order to further satisfy himself of the propriety of the investigation, the supervising judge conducted an <em>in-camera </em>hearing with representatives of the district attorney’s office to further probe the basis for conducting the inquiry and requested submission of an amended <em>Schofield </em>affidavit by the Commonwealth.

The court found that, given the information in the possession of the district attorney, there was a “credible, sound” basis on which to believe crimes may have occurred and that the investigative resources of the grand jury were necessary to compel production of otherwise unavailable witnesses and documents.
