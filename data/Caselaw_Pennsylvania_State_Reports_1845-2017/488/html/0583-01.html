Exceptions were filed and argued before the court <em>en bane </em>and were dismissed. Natalie and Stella Pavlovich have now appealed charging that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the finding of a parol trust and that the Chancellor abused his discretion in permitting recovery upon a ground that was inconsistent with the pleading and theory of appellee during the hearings below. We find both of these contentions to be without merit and affirm the decree of the learned Chancellor.</p>
