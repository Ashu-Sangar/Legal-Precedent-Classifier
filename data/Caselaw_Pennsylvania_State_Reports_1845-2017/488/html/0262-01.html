[During the commission of these crimes, a secretary in the law office (hereinafter referred to as the “victim”) was injured.] Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant appealed to the Superior Court, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The Superior Court remanded the case “to the lower court for an evidentiary hearing on appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.” An evidentiary hearing was held and the lower court rejected appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Appellant re-appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the lower court in a per curiam opinion. This appeal followed.</p>

In my view, trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to move to suppress the victim’s in-court identification made outside counsel’s presence after arrest. Relying on the investigating officer’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing held after trial to the effect that the victim made no such identification, the majority concludes that appellant’s claim is without merit. This reliance, however, is entirely misplaced, for at trial the jury could reasonably conclude, based on the victim’s testimony, that the victim indeed “picked out” appellant at the photographic showing. There is, therefore, no foundation on this record to conclude that the photographic identification, which took place after appellant’s arrest and outside counsel’s presence, is valid. Nor is there anything on this record to indicate that the in-court identification had an independent origin. Appellant must be granted a new trial.</p>
