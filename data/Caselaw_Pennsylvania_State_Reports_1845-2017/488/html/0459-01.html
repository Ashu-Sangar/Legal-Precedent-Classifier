Johnson died as a result of knife wounds received in the attack; his two companions were hospitalized with knife wounds. Reginald Glover, appellant, was arrested on January 6, 1976 and charged with murder, criminal conspiracy, two counts of aggravated assault and possessing an instrument of a crime. He was tried by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, sitting without a jury, and was convicted of Murder of the Third Degree and all of the other charges. Post-trial motions were denied and a sentence of two to fifteen years was imposed for the murder conviction, with concurrent sentences of two to ten years for the criminal conspiracy conviction and five years probation for the assault and weapons convictions. Glover filed appeals in both the Superior Court and in this Court. The Superior Court certified its appeal to us and this consolidated appeal followed. We affirm the judgments of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b532-7" data-blocks='[["BL_532.6",532,[245,1513,1155,731]]]'>Appellant first argues that his statement to the police concerning his role in the incident should have been suppressed. In this regard, he claims that the statement was the product of an unlawful arrest; the statement was coerced; the statement was not knowingly given; and finally that the Commonwealth should be deemed to have admitted the well-pleaded facts of appellant’s motion to suppress his statement because of its failure to answer the motion within seven (7) days, as required by former Pa.R.Crim.P. 308(a). Secondly, appellant argues that the identification testimony at trial should be ruled inadmissible and a new trial granted because it was tainted by a pre-trial identification made in violation of appellant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.</p>

One of the young men, Sanford, told police that he participated in the attack and described the progress of the attackers as they moved from a pool room to the point of the attack: “As we were going to Nicetown we met other dudes as we walked towards Old York Road. We met Onion, Reggie, and a whole lot of other dudes. We walked down Old York Road to Wyoming. When we reached Old York Road and Wyoming everybody split into groups. We went into Nice-town turf.” N.T. 3-16-76 at 15. Sanford was unable to give “Reggie’s” last name and he did not give a description. The second young man, Ransom, said that Reginald Glover, appellant, was “involved” in the stabbing incident. Ransom positively identified a photograph of appellant, and police subsequently arrested Glover.</p>

This Court has held that probable cause to arrest is established by information supplied by a confessed accomplice. <em>Commonwealth v.

In this case, one informant, who implicated himself in the incident, also implicated “Reggie.” The second informant, also involved in the incident, while being questioned about the crime, implicated “Reginald Glover”, the appellant herein. Acting on this information, the police arrested Glover. Under these facts, there was probable cause for the arrest.</p>

She testified further that his clothes were dirty and that he told her he had been forced to give the statement. Further, appellant <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>offered evidence that he had complained to prison officials of physical ailments stemming from an alleged beating during his arrest.</p>

    <p id="b534-7" data-blocks='[["BL_534.8",534,[237,1376,1156,975]]]'>Appellant’s evidence indicates that he was admitted to the Philadelphia Detention Center on January 7, 1976. At the time of admission, he was given a complete physical examination. Although appellant testified that he was beaten and kicked by detectives during interrogation, and although he complained of an upset stomach when he arrived at the detention center on January 7, the medical records indicate no observable physical abnormalities. Further, although detention center records indicate that appellant claimed that he had been beaten at the time he was arrested, his mother’s testimony is that she was present when the police arrived at her house to take her son into custody, and that she accompanied her son to the police station in the police car. Her testimony is silent as to any beating during that period of time. Finally, evidence that appellant was beaten by police is contradicted by testimony of the detective who questioned appellant. We conclude that the record supports the decision of the court below that appellant’s statement was not coerced.</p>

He claims that evidence of his limited reading ability, when combined with evidence of his low intelligence quotient, indicated that he was unable to understand the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that, therefore, the lower court improperly denied his motion to suppress his confession.

When appellant responded that he understood his rights, but still wished to give a statement, the detective proceeded with the interrogation. At the conclusion of the six page statement, appellant told the detective that he could not read. As a result of this claim, the detective brought appellant’s mother and the mother of a co-defendant into the interrogation room to read the statement aloud to appellant. Since appellant’s mother had forgotten her glasses, the co-defendant’s mother read the statement aloud. After this, appellant signed each page of the statement, and his mother and the co-defendant’s mother signed the statement as witnesses.</p>
