On June 17, 1977, acting pursuant to the Second Class County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. § 5452.17a, the assessments, as revised in 1976 for the northern district, were certified to the political subdivisions of Allegheny County for their use in levying taxes for the calendar years 1977, 1978 and 1979. In 1977, taxes on real property located in the northern district were levied on the basis of the 1976 revised assessments. The other two districts were taxed in 1977 on the basis of assessments determined in 1975 and 1974.

Although first class and third class counties are required by statute to divide such counties into assessment districts, see Act of June 27, 1939, P.L. 1199, § 5, 72 P.S. § 5341.5 and Act of June 26, 1931, P.L. 1379, § 4, 72 P.S. § 5345, respectively, these and all other counties, except second class counties, are required to make annual assessments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">9</a> Therefore, all counties, except Allegheny County, in effect, assess property county-wide on an annual basis.</p>

It directs that taxes may only be levied on such assessments when the assessments have been completed for the entire county. By its terms, Act 100 applies to all counties except “counties of the first class.” The Commonwealth Court did not consider this introductory phrase when it held that Act 100 did not apply to Allegheny County. See Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(b) (Supp.1978-79). However, even after considering this introductory phrase, we hold that Act 100 does not apply to <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>Allegheny County because Allegheny County is permitted to employ a district-wide, triennial assessment system.</p>
    <p id="b163-4" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[200,460,1151,1381]]]'>Initially, we are supported in this conclusion because to apply Act 100 to Allegheny County, under the district-wide, triennial assessment system, would lead to a result not intended by the legislature. In ascertaining the intent of the General Assembly, we are to presume that it does not intend a result that “is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.” Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C. S.A. § 1922(1) (Supp.1978-79). Yet, the application of Act 100 to a county using a triennial, district-wide assessment system would result in an unequal tax burden on property owners within the county in any given year. Under Act 100, taxes could not be levied on assessments made in the first district in year one until assessments were completed for the other two districts in Allegheny County in years two and three. Under the existing unstable economic climate and increasing inflation, this would produce a grossly unfair situation. Property owners in the first district assessed in year one would pay taxes based on that assessment only after assessments had been made on <em>increased </em>real estate values in the other two districts in Allegheny County in years two and three. Thus, property owners assessed in year one would pay taxes on assessments based on earlier and lower real estate values for three years,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">10</a> while those assessed in years two and three would pay taxes on assessments based on higher real estate values for three years, respectively.

Other sections of the Second Class County Assessment Law provide for giving notice of the new district-wide assessments, a right of appeal and finally the certification of the revised assessment to political subdivisions. Second Class County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. §§ 5452.10, 5452.11, 5452.16 and 5452.17a. The Commonwealth Court held that:</p>

    <p id="A2L" data-blocks='[["BL_165.10",165,[665,1708,197,41]]]'>dissenting.</p>
    <p id="b165-10" data-blocks='[["BL_165.11",165,[232,1770,1148,363]]]'>Today the majority holds that the Legislature did not intend to apply Act 100, Act of May 22, 1933, P.L. 853, art. IV, § 402, as amended, 72 P.S. § 5020~402(a) (Supp.1979-80) to Allegheny County because that county employs triennial assessments. I must dissent. The Legislature could not have been more explicit in its statutory mandate that second class counties like Allegheny are subject to the Act.</p>
    <p id="b165-11" data-blocks='[["BL_165.12",165,[232,2154,1147,151]],["BL_166.1",166,[248,266,1154,370]]]'>Since 1933, counties of the second class have been authorized by the Legislature to use triennial assessments. 72 P.S. § 5020-401(b). When the Legislature enacted Act 100 <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>in 1976 it provided that Act 100 applies to all counties “[ejxcept . . . counties of the first class . . . . ” Because the Legislature has directed the courts of this Commonwealth to follow the “words of a statute [when they] are clear and free from all ambiguity . . . ,” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(b), we are compelled to apply Act 100 to Allegheny County.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[248,672,1155,1171]]]'>The majority sets forth three unpersuasive reasons for disregarding the express language of the statute. First it states that application of Act 100 to a county using triennial assessments “would produce a grossly unfair situation” in the present inflationary economy. This conclusion is premised upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the operation of triennial assessments. If we assume, as does the majority, that property values are continually increasing, then triennial assessments (with or without Act 100) could result in higher tax burdens for similarly situated property owners who are assessed in different years. Such a result would, of course, violate the constitutional requirement of uniform taxation. See Pa.Const. art. 8, § 1. But the Legislature, well aware of this difficulty, in 1975 amended the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. § 5020-402(a) (Supp.1979-80) to authorize assessors to adjust assessments to reflect economic changes. See also 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(3). Thus, equity and tax uniformity can be preserved. So long as triennial assessments incorporate appropriate economic adjustments, the application of Act 100 will in no way upset the equitable and uniform tax burden upon county taxpayers.</p>
    <p id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.6",166,[251,1887,1153,421]]]'>The majority next suggests that Act 100, by its own terms, applies only to “county-wide” assessments. Triennial assessments are “district-wide,” suggests the majority, and therefore beyond the ambit of Act 100. I cannot agree. A county using triennial assessments assesses all taxable property in the county. Though the period of assessment is three years, rather than one, there is no dispute that the assessment is county-wide.</p>
    <p id="b167-3" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[221,280,1147,309]]]'>
      <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>The majority’s third objection is that Act 100 is inconsistent with Second Class County Law dealing with triennial assessments, and therefore superseded by it. However, the relevant Second Class County Law and the majority opinion disclose no intrinsic inconsistency. See generally 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1932(b).</p>
    <p id="b167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[222,608,1147,150]]]'>Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the trial court holding that Act 100 applies.</p>
