Preston, a brother of Karla and a roomer in the house, and William Anderson, Karla’s husband, argued about taking Karla to a hospital for treatment. Finally, as William was about to take Karla to the hospital, <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>he told Preston to “get into the car if he wanted to take [Karla] to the hospital.” Preston responded: “You better have a gun.” William then took Karla to the hospital for treatment.</p>
    <p id="b385-4" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[223,551,1148,567]]]'>On the return from the hospital, Karla entered the home first and met Preston and Ernest Anthony (Kareem) Eley. Preston had a gun and said to her: “I’m going to kill your husband.” Karla screamed, and William, who was still outside the home, entered the porch of the home where he was confronted by Eley. Eley grabbed William and held his arms behind his back. A struggle ensued during which Preston came out of the home onto the porch. While the struggle continued, Preston fired three shots. One hit Eley in the leg while the others struck William causing wounds which resulted in his death.</p>

But, Preston argues the testimony of the Commonwealth witnesses was too contradictory to support the convictions. In particular, Preston refers to contradictions in the testimony regarding the precise position of a Commonwealth witness, Raymond Anderson, at the time he observed the incident and a contradiction in the evidence between the precise location on the porch where William was shot and where his body was found by police. Additionally, Preston points to an alleged admission of bias based on family relationships on the part of another Commonwealth witness.</p>

Defense counsel responded by stating a substantial issue existed for appeal, namely the Commonwealth had deprived the defense of the testimony of Eley, an eyewitness. A discussion resulted which revealed that Eley had been arrested shortly after the killing; that he had been discharged at a preliminary hearing for lack of evidence; that, during the course of jury selection, Eley had been present in court; that, three days before the taking of <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>testimony commenced, the Commonwealth caused Eley to be rearrested;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and, that Eley then allegedly said he would claim his Fifth Amendment right and not testify.</p>

Counsel cannot sit idly by in the hopes of attaining a favorable verdict and, when such is not attained, be allowed to bring alleged errors or improprieties to the attention of the court which could have been asserted during the trial. Because the matter was not brought to the attention of the court prior to the verdict being entered, the court was deprived of an opportunity to avoid any error. Accordingly, the issue is waived.

But we decline to now so rule because, as an apparent result of Preston’s failure to serve his pro se brief on the Commonwealth as evidenced by a lack of a proof of service, we are without the benefit of a response brief. Hence, since we are remanding to the trial court for the reason stated above, Preston may there present his claims and the Commonwealth may then respond on the basis of waiver or otherwise.</p>

By necessity there is contact between a court officer and jurors during a trial, as the court officer is responsible for the jury’s accommodations and comfort, and is the physical connection between the Court and the individual jurors. Conversation, which would include the exchange of pleasantries, is commonplace, necessary and even desirable. To require an inquiry into each instance of conversation between a juror and a court officer is unrealistically burdensome to the trial process.</p>

Jurors do not take “vows of silence.” They are permitted to talk to their friends, family, other jurors, court officers, etc. They are only prohibited from speaking to persons who are involved in the case in which they are participating. Of course, jurors are not to discuss the case with anyone until the official deliberations begin.</p>
