Our inquiry, then, is whether the classification is patently arbitrary and bears no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. Given the beneficial and far-reaching effects of Pennsylvania’s comprehensive Workmen’s Compensation legislation and the continuing efforts of the legislature at almost every session, to upgrade the system and make it more responsive to the needs of the employer, the employee and to our society as a whole, we cannot say that Section 303(b) bears no reasonable relationship to any legitimate governmental interest.</p>

However, for historical and humane reasons, this Court in prior decisions has permitted the substitution of the Workmen’s Compensation law for one’s access to the courts. And since the Majority’s limitation, (bar of a third party’s joinder of an employer) is within the scope of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, I join in the result of the majority with the condition that the employer’s right to subrogation is not automatic. The employer must in some judicial proceedings establish its freedom from fault in order to be subrogated.</p>
