Within moments of the crime, its occurrence and location and the fact that the perpetrator was a negro male were broadcast over the police radio. These messages were received by Patrolman Joseph Passio who was approximately seven blocks from the crime scene and who then began to cruise the area surrounding the victim’s residence in his patrol car. After finding the streets deserted (as is normally the case in that particular neighborhood during the early morning hours), Patrolman Passio parked his vehicle and entered the victim’s residence.

Another officer drove up and also began to participate in the discussion. In response to the second officer’s questions, appellee stated that he had no money, no bus transfer, and that he was currently on probation for the crime of rape. Whereupon, the officers frisked or patted down the appellee and found that his clothing was in a state of disarray, his pants were very wrinkled, and his shirt tail was almost entirely out of his pants.

He stated that he had committed the crime and recounted how he had gained entry into the victim’s home and made his way to the second floor. However, before he had explained the details of the rape and assault, appellee refused to make any further statements, and the interview was terminated at 7:40 a. m.

With respect to the out-of-court identification and the results of the search of appellee and his clothing (the probable cause for which was derived from the identification), appellee asserts that 1) the on-the-scene identification procedure utilized by the police was unduly suggestive, unreliable, and conducive to misidentification; and 2) the Commonwealth’s refusal to produce the victim at the suppression hearing resulted in a failure on the part of the Commonwealth to meet its burden of proof and a denial of appellee’s rights of confrontation, due process, and compulsory process. Further, with respect to the inculpatory statements made by appellee after his arrest, appellee asserts that 1) he could not effectively waive his constitutional rights because he was a juvenile and was not given an opportunity to consult with an interested adult; 2) he did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his constitutional rights; 3) his statements were obtained in violation of the Juvenile Act because he was not taken before a <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>court or to a juvenile facility before being transported to the detective division; and 4) his statements were obtained in violation of Pa.R.Crira.P. 130 and were the product of unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment.

Rule 323(j) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a suppression court’s ruling with respect to the admissibility of evidence is not binding at trial “upon a showing of evidence which was theretofore unavailable”. The suppression court’s ruling obviously made the victim’s testimony “unavailable” for purposes of the suppression <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>hearing and, pursuant to Rule 323(j), appellee may examine the victim at trial and ask that court to reconsider the admissibility of the identification testimony and the results of the search. The suppression court’s ruling did not, therefore, result in a deprivation of appellee’s constitutional rights; it merely postponed for a brief time his ability to exercise them.

The Commonwealth also concedes that the police in the instant case made minimal attempts to secure an interested adult. The Commonwealth, however, asserts that under the circumstances of this case, the presence of an interested adult was not necessary for a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of constitutional rights, and asks this Court to reexamine the wisdom of applying a <em>per se </em>rule to situations such as that presented by the instant case.</p>

Appellee had been involved in juvenile court proceedings in 1974 where he was represented by counsel and had spent time in a juvenile detention facility. At the time of his arrest on the instant charges, appellee had completed nine years of schooling and was repeating his tenth year. Finally, as the Commonwealth witnesses stated and the suppression court found, appellee was informed of his constitutional rights prior to being questioned, and he was competent to and did understand them.</p>

I concur. Appellee is not the youthful and inexperienced juvenile contemplated by <em>McCutehen </em>and its progeny. His experience with the criminal justice system, his comprehension of his constitutional rights, and the proximity of his age to eighteen years indicate that he was quite capable of making an independent assessment of whether or not to waive those rights. Consequently, no purpose will be served in this case by drawing a “brightline” at the magical moment appellee reaches the age of eighteen <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>years and suppressing the instant confession merely because there was no interested adult present when appellee waived his rights. I would therefore hold that where, as here, the defendant’s age, experience, and intelligence are such that the presence of an interested adult will not significantly contribute to his comprehension and understanding of the situation, he may make an effective waiver of his constitutional rights without first consulting an interested adult.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

In addition to what has already been recounted, the uncontradicted testimony of the Commonwealth witnesses was that appellee was not physically abused, threatened, or promised anything; that none of his requests were denied; that he was left alone and undisturbed between the interviews; that he behaved normally; and that he was cooperative, willing, and responsive and appeared to be comprehending all that was spoken to him. The only testimony introduced by appellee was that of a psychologist who testified that contrary to the opinion of the Commonwealth’s expert, appellee possesses below average intelligence and maturity and has tendencies to distrust others and withdraw when suffering from anxiety. Appellee did not, however, introduce any evidence indicating that he was suffering from anxiety at the time he waived his constitutional rights and, as noted previously, the suppression court found that appellee did in fact understand his rights. Therefore, while this evidence of mental condition is relevant, it is not sufficient to overcome the uncontradicted <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>testimony of the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v.

The Juvenile Act, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, § 2, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6326, provides that a person taking a juvenile into custody shall, “with all reasonable speed and without first taking the child elsewhere,” release the child to his parent or guardian, take the child to the court, or deliver him to a detention or shelter care facility, and Pa.R.Crim.P. 130 forbids “unnecessary” delays between arrest and arraignment. Both the Act and the Rule have been construed to permit the police to take a defendant to a police station, attend to administrative matters, question him, and to allow the necessary delays attendant thereto.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> In the instant case, the events which transpired during the four hours and fifteen minutes that elapsed before appellee’s inculpatory statements consisted solely of appellee’s identification, transportation from the scene of the crime to the detective division, approximately one-half hour of questioning, three hours of investigation to ascertain the veracity of appellee’s statements, and ten more minutes of questioning. Thus, as the suppression court found, the delay was almost entirely attributable to appellee’s questioning and reasonable investigation incident thereto and was not improper within the meaning of the Juvenile Act and Pa.R.Crim.P. 130.</p>

Appellee asserts that he was arrested at the time Patrolman Passio summoned him to the patrol car. The suppression court, however, held that this was an investigatory stop and not an arrest. The testimony of the Commonwealth witnesses discloses that appellee was not handcuffed or otherwise physically restrained prior to being placed in the patrol car; that the conversation with him was brief and consisted of general questions not directly concerning the crime under investigation; that throughout a large part of the conversation, Patrolman Passio did not even get out of his patrol car; and that appellee was in no way threatened or intimated by the officers.
