Wolbach was operating a truck on Legislative <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>Route 08081 in Athens Township, Bradford County. He pulled off the road to help a friend, Gary Miller, who was having trouble starting his car. He parked in front of a car owned by appellee John A. Fay. While Wolbach was standing between his truck and Fay’s car, a car driven by appellee Caroline Barber struck Fay’s car, which in turn struck Wolbach, seriously injuring him.</p>
    <p id="b311-5" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[192,710,1149,625]]]'>Wolbach and his wife, Esther Wolbach, also appellant herein, sued Fay in the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County. They alleged he was negligent in leaving his car unattended, without parking lights or flashers. They also sued James P. Calhoun and Madelyn C. Calhoun, his wife, appellees herein and owners of the property in front of which the vehicles were parked. The Calhouns operate a farm market on the property. Appellants alleged they were negligent in failing to provide adequate parking and lighting, making it necessary for the vehicles to park partly on the road. Fay joined Caroline Barber and her husband, William G. Barber, as additional defendants.</p>

Rule of Civil Procedure 1035(b) provides that summary judgment may be entered if on “the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admis<a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>sions of file, together with the affidavits, if any . there is no genuine issue as to any material fact . . . .” Appellants claim there was an issue as to whether the release was valid as applied to the defendants other than the Barbers. The effect of a release must be determined from the ordinary meaning of its language. <em>Estate of Bodnar, </em><a href="/pa/472/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="472 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1727747" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0383-01">472 Pa. 383</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="472 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1727747" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0383-01">372 A.2d 746</a> (1977).

Reformation of the release would require a showing of fraud or mutual mistake by clear, precise, and convincing evidence. <em>Yoo Hoo Bottling Co. of Pa., Inc. v. Leibowitz, </em><a href="/pa/432/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="432 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1919716" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0117-01">432 Pa. 117</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20469" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="247 A.2d 469">247 A.2d 469</a> (1968).</p>
    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[260,1201,1156,913]]]'>Appellants contend the release was procured by fraud, that Marvin Wolbach did not know he was releasing anyone other than the Barbers, and that he did not contemplate doing so. The alleged fraud consisted of the failure of the insurance agent to fully explain the effect of the release. However, Wolbach admitted in a deposition that the release was in clear language, that he read it, and that he understood the meaning of the words. Since there is no allegation of actual misrepresentation and appellant had an opportunity to read the release and admitted he understood it, we find there was no fraud. Appellant’s admissions cast doubt on the allegation of lack of knowledge or contemplation of the release of all parties. If the allegation were accepted, it would establish only a unilateral and not a mutual mistake. The facts as alleged by appellants provide no basis for setting aside the release. It was proper to enter summary judgment.</p>

    <p id="b313-6" data-blocks='[["BL_313.7",313,[196,425,1149,634]]]'>This case is a classic example of the manifest injustice that often arises when an unwary and unsuspecting individual attempts to amicably settle a claim with an insurance company. The majority concludes that the release in question insulates from possible liability not only appellees William G. and Caroline Barber, but also appellees James P. and Madelyn C. Calhoun and appellee John A. Fay. The majority reaches this conclusion despite the fact that appellants negotiated the settlement and release with the agent of the Barbers’ insurance company only. Appellants entered into settlement negotiations with none of the remaining appellees or their agents.</p>
