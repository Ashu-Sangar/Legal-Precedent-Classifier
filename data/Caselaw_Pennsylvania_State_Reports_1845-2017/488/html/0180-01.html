Based on these representations, the Bureau <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>decided appellants’ unemployment was due to a labor dispute and denied benefits.</p>

Therefore, since the employer failed to maintain the status quo, the responsibility of the work stoppage must be borne by the employer, and the work stoppage constitutes a lockout.</blockquote>

While the Bureau was aware, at the time it rendered decisions in appellants’ cases, that the employer had moved <em>some </em>machinery and inventory from the plant on the day preceding the work stoppage, the evidence was considered insufficient to demonstrate a lockout had occurred. Only after all of the plant’s machinery and inventory had been removed, and a hollow shell remained, was the Bureau (the Board of Review) convinced the work stoppage was the result of George Sail’s unwillingness to maintain the status quo pending contract negotiations.</p>
    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[198,950,1151,1292]]]'>When appellants filed their claims, they did not have the benefit of the employer’s subsequent conduct, which conduct refuted its assertions that work was available to appellants and that it was not shutting down its facility. Since this conduct demonstrated the employer had misrepresented the facts in appellants’ cases, I would hold that this deceit amounts to fraud and I would allow appellants to appeal the Bureau’s determinations nunc pro tunc under these circumstances. It seems to me that an employee should not be denied unemployment compensation benefits which would have been granted him but for his employer’s misrepresentations to the Bureau. To recognize such an exception to the ordinarily desirable rules of finality of administrative decisions would further the remedial purposes of the Unemployment Compensation laws which are to be construed liberally to accomplish those purposes. <em>See Frumento v.
