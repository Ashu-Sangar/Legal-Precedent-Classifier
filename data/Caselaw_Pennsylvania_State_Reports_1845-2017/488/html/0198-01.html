Ralph began mining operations, but ceased these operations upon being informed by his attorney, Clifford Johnston, that he owned less than all of the rights in the Kreska Tract. Ralph thereafter began efforts designed to purchase the outstanding rights to the Kreska Tract. On August 27, 1974, George Scott, the surviving executor of the Estate of Harry Boulton, sold the estate’s one-third interest in the mineral rights underlying the Kreska Tract to Ralph, <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>“Subject ... to a lease of said mineral rights to Thompson Coal Company. . . .’’On the same date, Clearfield Bank and Trust Company and George Scott, co-guardians for Harold J.

The interest of both former owners in the lease to Leroy and Thompson Coal was assigned to Ralph at the time of the conveyance of the mineral rights. On September 10, 1974, Raymond J. Hess leased his mineral rights under the Kreska Tract to Ralph and can-celled his lease with the Thompson Coal Company, the cancellation to be effective March 1, 1975.

Underlying these requisites, of course, is the existence of a contract or of a prospective contractual relation between the third person and the plaintiff.
