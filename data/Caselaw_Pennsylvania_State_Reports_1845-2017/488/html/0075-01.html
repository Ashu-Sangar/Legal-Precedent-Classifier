      <em> </em>On May 24, 1977, the court entered an order prohibiting the Commonwealth from presenting evidence of the defendant’s prior conviction. On June 6, 1977, the case proceeded to trial, and the Commonwealth called as its second witness, Mrs. Shirley McClennan, an eyewitness to the crime.

But see <em>Commonwealth v. Potter, </em>supra (opinion in support of reversal); <em>Commonwealth v. Bolden, </em>supra (plurality opinion). However, he also asserts the assistant district attorney attempted to “cover up” this “commission of an improper <em>act” </em>— viz., failure to warn the witness — by asking the witness to “give us some background on how long you know him and how many times you have seen him.” Appellant contends this question was “pointed” and “loaded” and was intended to provoke a mistrial. Under the standard announced in <em>Commonwealth v.

I write separately only to make clear what issues truly are in this case. After a full evidentiary hearing, the trial court determined that the Commonwealth cautioned its civilian witness not to refer to appellant’s previous conviction, and that the witness nonetheless did so spontaneously. The record clearly supports these determinations. Accordingly, there is no reason here for the plurality to decide that the Commonwealth does not owe “an affirmative duty to caution any witness who knew of defendant’s prior criminal record against referring to it in the jury’s presence.” Plurality opinion at p.-. <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>1237. Nor is there any reason on this record to decide the standard under which appellant’s claim of prosecutorial misconduct warranting discharge should be tested. Compare, e. g., <em>Commonwealth v.
