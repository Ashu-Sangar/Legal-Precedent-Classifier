Previously, parties nominated candidates by a means other than a primary election, such as conventions or caucuses. <em>Winston v.

When primary elections were statutorily adopted as the process by which candidates for public office were to be nominated, the constitutional provision was made applicable by common practice to the primary election. As a result, in both the municipal and primary elections, each elector voted for only two persons, each party nominated two candidates at the primary election, and the three persons having the highest number of votes at the municipal election were elected to the offices.</p>

Appellant reasons that, since the provision applies to both primary and municipal elections in limiting the number of persons an elector may vote for, the <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>final phrase stating that the “three persons receiving the highest number of votes shall be elected” also refers to the primary election and mandates three nominations. Stated otherwise, appellant reasons that, since the term “election” includes any “municipal” or “primary” election, see The Pennsylvania Election Code, Act of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1333, art. I, § 102(f), 25 P.S. § 2602(f) [hereinafter: 25 P.S. § ]; cf. <em>Thiemann v. Allen, </em><a href="/pa/485/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="485 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="1755626" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0431-01">485 Pa. 431</a>, <a href="/pa/485/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="485 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="1755626" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0431-01">402 A.2d 1348</a> (1979), the term “elected” in the final phrase in art. 9, § 4, supra, includes “nominated” so that the “three persons receiving the highest number of votes [in a primary election] shall be” nominated.</p>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[237,987,1154,844]]]'>It is true that in <em>Thiemann v. Allen, </em><a href="/pa/485/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="485 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="1755626" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0431-01">supra,</a> while interpreting 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 3133 (1978) which provided for limited voting for the offices of judge of the Commonwealth Court, we said the term “election” includes the “primary” election. But the basis for this ruling was 25 P.S. § 2602(f) which specifically defines “election” as “any general, municipal, special or primary election, unless otherwise specified.” Appellant’s reasoning that the term “election” is so inextricably tied to the term “elected” so that “elected” includes “nominated” ignores the statutory basis relied on in <em>Thiemann v. Allen, </em><a href="/pa/485/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="485 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="1755626" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0431-01">supra.</a> Indeed, appellant’s interpretation of the term “elected” is contrary to the statutory scheme of 25 P.S. §§ 2601 <em>et seq. </em>which generally distinguishes between being “nominated” at a “primary” election and being “elected” at a “municipal” or “general” election. See, e. g., 25 P.S. §§ 2602(r), 2753, 2862, 2863, 2882, 3154.</p>

To adopt appellant’s position would be contrary to this historical approach. Moreover, since Pa.Const. art. 9, § 4 (1968) <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>was recently adopted, since it is similar to Pa.Const. art. 14, § 7 (1874), and since the historical implementation of Pa. Const, art. 14, § 7 (1874) resulted in only as many nominees as the number of persons an elector could vote for, the framers must have intended to continue that practice with the adoption of Pa.Const. art. 9, § 4 (1968).</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[204,690,1149,312]]]'>Finally, as Judge Louik of the Court of Common Pleas pointed out, were we to adopt appellant’s position, we would, as a practical matter,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> have to abolish straight party voting as provided for at 25 P.S. §§ 2963(f) and 3007(b). Our interpretation avoids any conflict between the constitutional and statutory provisions.</p>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[207,1028,1146,257]]]'>Hence, we reject appellant’s position and rule that Pa.

    <p id="b171-6" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[205,1327,1149,795]]]'>We need address only one other argument advanced by appellant. He argues the interpretation we now adopt will render Pa.Const. art. 9, § 4 (1968) violative of the federal constitution because the provision will now serve as “a practical guarantee, ipso jure, of minority party representation.” Appellant concedes that, if Pa.Const. art. 9, § 4 (1968) merely encourages minority representation rather than guarantees it, the provision would not be violative of the federal constitution. As pointed out in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Teller v. Jennings, </em><a href="/pa/409/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="409 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="1883228" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0513-01">409 Pa. 513</a>, 516 n. 2, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.2d%20916" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="186 A.2d 916">186 A.2d 916</a> n. 2 (1963), Pa.Const. art. 9, § 4 (1968) merely encourages minority representation because, inter alia, “a write-in candidate can be elected as the third commissioner although he is also a member of the party which elects its two slated candidates.” Hence, the argument is without merit.</p>
