The court did not speculate that Damario’s estate might receive funds in the future. Instead, the court’s determination was based on existing assets of the estate, including assets inherited from the estate of Damario’s mother immediately following the jury’s verdict. The court properly exercised its discretion in granting the county’s petition for reimbursement, where the petition was filed within a reasonable period after the services were supplied. So too the court’s reimbursement order was proper in that it directed payment of a sum certain, in full satisfaction of the county’s claim. See generally, S. Krantz, C. Smith, D. Rossman, P.

The argument that a defendant may decline appointed counsel if he knows he may be required to reimburse, thus “chilling” his constitutional right to counsel, has' been rejected in <em>Fuller v. Oregon, </em><a href="/us/417/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="417 U.S. 40" data-case-ids="1519339" data-case-paths="/us/417/0040-01">supra,</a> <a href="/us/417/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="417 U.S. 40" data-case-ids="1519339" data-case-paths="/us/417/0040-01">417 U.S. at 53-55</a>, <a href="/us/417/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="417 U.S. 40" data-case-ids="1519339" data-case-paths="/us/417/0040-01">94 S.Ct. at 2124-2125</a>. There is also no merit to the claim that appellant was denied due process of law due to lack of guidelines for reimbursement determinations. Here the court of equity closely scrutinized the amount charged for the services and found it to be reasonable, and we find no reason for disturbing the court’s result.</p>
