Appellee stated in this letter to the Superintendent of the Fox Chapel Area School District that her “duties as a new mother, which include breast-feeding” necessitated the requested leave of absence. The Superintendent responded by stating that the Collective Bargaining Agreement contained no provisions for child-rearing leave. On the day prior to the scheduled commencement of appellee’s teaching duties, she and a field representative of the Pennsylvania State Education Association attempted to procure from the Board an unpaid leave of absence purportedly in order to breast-feed the child as a preventive measure against allergies.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This request was denied by the Board, and appellee refused to return to work and resume her teaching responsibilities even though so ordered.</p>

First, the maternity-leave provision provides that each extension shall not exceed thirty days; yet, appellee, in fact, sought a leave of absence far in excess of that period. On January 5, 1976, she sought a leave for the remainder of the 1975-76 school year. Secondly, the maternity-leave provision provides that requests for extensions must be accompanied by a physician’s certificate establishing the need for the exten<a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>sion. Yet appellee stated in her letter to the Board (wherein she requested a leave of absence) that her obstetrician would not certify her need for another extension since, in his judgment, she had recovered from pregnancy. Thirdly, the Board hearings established that appellee was both physically and mentally fit to resume her teaching responsibilities; and, in that situation, the maternity-leave provision expressly provides that “[t]he maternity leave will end upon the [Professional Employee’s] recovering the ability to follow her occupation.” Finally, the maternity-leave provision makes no mention of extensions for health needs other than for the woman’s own recovery; yet, appellee’s request was based upon maternal duties generated by her child’s health needs.</p>

Furthermore, where a reasonable person acting reasonably might have reached the same decision as the Board, then there is substantial evidence for the Board’s determination which should not then be disturbed on appeal. <em>Penn-Delco School Dist. v.

The evil which the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act seeks to overcome is the dissimilar treatment, on the basis of sex, of persons similarly situated.

This disagreement stems, in part, from the shifting reasons offered as to the purpose for the leave of absence requested by appellee. Her letter of June 5, 1976 states that “duties as a new mother, which include breast-feeding” necessitated the leave. Then before the Board on January 12, 1976, appellee stated that breast-feeding was a preventive measure against allergies developing in the child. Finally, at the hearings of dismissal and for the first time in her multiple dealings with the school authorities, appellee offered a newly-advanced reason for breast-feeding her child, namely, that her infant rejected bottle-feeding upon discharge from the hospital in October, 1975. But testimony of the pediatrician, as well as that of appellee, suggested that the decision to breast-feed was made prior to appellee’s consulting with the pediatrician. The pediatrician’s letter to the Board makes no reference to this purported bottle rejection (see note 2 <em>supra </em>). Appellee only decided to inform the pediatrician of this crucial matter on her fifth visit to the pediatrician on February 20, 1976. In light of the entire record, the Board did not believe that appellant’s baby had rejected bottle-feeding.</p>
