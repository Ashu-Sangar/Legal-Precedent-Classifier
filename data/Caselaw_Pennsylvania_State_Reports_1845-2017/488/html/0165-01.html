Appellant takes the position that testator’s intent concerning the disposition of the bequest to a predeceased sibling is ambiguous.

    <p id="b237-5" data-blocks='[["BL_237.5",237,[211,1086,1147,465]]]'>The Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Northumberland County disagreed. It concluded that the language of testator’s will, particularly “and to the survivor or survivors of them,” manifests testator’s “contrary intent” within the meaning of section 2514 to limit takers to those named siblings who are living at testator’s death, thus precluding operation of subsection (9). We agree with appellant that the orphans’ court misinterpreted testator’s will.</p>
    <p id="b237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_237.6",237,[206,1593,1152,417]]]'>This Court has not yet held that a testator must expressly provide for a possible lapse to manifest “contrary intent” overcoming operation of the anti-lapse statute.

In paragraph THIRD of his will, Testator fails to make an express statement concerning his intended disposition of residue in the event a named beneficiary predeceases him. Instead, he merely states his desire to leave the residue to his named <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>siblings “and to the survivor or survivors of them.” By contrast, in other paragraphs of his will, testator expressly provides for the possibility of lapse. In paragraph FIRST, in which testator gives his nephew Emerson Asher Shoemaker a monetary gift, testator provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[301,593,1111,248]]]'>“I give and bequeath the sum of One Thousand ($1,000.00) Dollars, unto my nephew, EMERSON ASHER SHOEMAKER, of Reading, Pennsylvania, should he survive me, but if he predeceases me, then this paragraph of my Will shall be null and void and of no effect.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b238-6" data-blocks='[["BL_238.6",238,[259,869,1153,259]]]'>In Paragraph SECOND, testator employs the identical language manifesting an intent to provide a lapse in another bequest of $1,000 to another nephew, Larry Welker. There, testator again stated “if he predeceases me, then this paragraph of my Will shall be null and void and of no effect.”</p>
    <p id="ADO" data-blocks='[["BL_238.7",238,[259,1148,1154,526]]]'>Testator’s careful use of express language directing a lapse of these bequests in his will raises considerable doubt that he intended a lapse in paragraph THIRD, where no such language is used. It cannot now be said with the requisite reasonable certainty that testator intended a lapse of residuary bequests under paragraph THIRD. In accordance with the Legislature’s directive contained in 20 Pa.C.S. § 2514(9), it must be presumed that testator did not intend his bequest to Ralph Kehler to lapse. By way of the same statute, appellant may share in the residuary estate.</p>
