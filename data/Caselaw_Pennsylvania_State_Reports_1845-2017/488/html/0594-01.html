    <p id="b666-5" data-blocks='[["BL_666.5",666,[249,342,1156,673]]]'>On September 13, 1976, Ellis was arrested on charges of murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter in connection with the shooting death of Robert Thompson. After a jury trial, Ellis was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Post-verdict motions were denied, and Ellis was sentenced to serve a term of four to eight years imprisonment, to pay the costs of prosecution, and to pay a fine of $500. Ellis filed a direct appeal in this Court limited to the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the voluntary manslaughter conviction. On November 2, 1978, we affirmed the judgment of sentence in a per curiam opinion. <em>Commonwealth v. Ellis, </em><a href="/pa/481/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="481 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="1747278" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0528-01">481 Pa. 528</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="393 A.2d 30" data-case-ids="1747278,1747286" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0528-01,/pa/481/0529-01">393 A.2d 30</a> (1978).</p>

Counsel, other than trial counsel, was appointed to assist Ellis, and an amended petition was filed on June 1, 1979. After a counselled hearing, relief was denied. This appeal followed.</p>

Ellis contends that, since there was evidence at trial on which a verdict of involuntary manslaughter could have been based, involuntary manslaughter was a permissible verdict and should have been presented for the jury’s consid<a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>eration. Ellis relies on the rationale in <em>Commonwealth v.

Trial counsel stated that the evidence did not support an involuntary manslaughter verdict, and that he did not want a “compromise” verdict, namely involuntary manslaughter, to be presented to the jury. Trial counsel wanted to preserve Ellis’ chance for outright acquittal because Ellis was on parole at the time of the shooting, and any conviction would probably result in a revocation of parole. We have recently held that trial counsel’s failure to request a charge on involuntary manslaughter, in order to preserve the possibility of an outright acquittal based on acceptance of the defense version of the criminal occurrence, is a permissible trial strategy designed to effectuate the best interests of trial counsel’s client. <em>Commonwealth v. Musi, </em><a href="/pa/486/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="486 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1757605" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0102-01">486 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="486 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1757605" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0102-01">404 A.2d 378</a> (1979).

Trial counsel represented Ellis during post-verdict motions and on direct appeal. New counsel, other than trial counsel, was appointed to represent Ellis for the first time during the post-conviction proceedings. New counsel properly raised the effective assistance claim at the first possible opportunity, i. e., at the post-conviction stage. Accordingly, the issue is properly before us.
