Plaintiffs, white applicants for jobs as firefighters in the City of Pittsburgh, challenge the Pittsburgh Civil Service Commission’s proposed use of race-conscious hiring procedures to correct racial discrimination in the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. Claiming they would have been hired but for the challenged procedures, these plaintiffs took statutory appeals from the Commission’s proposal and also sought injunctive relief. These actions were consolidated before the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County which, after a hearing, denied all claims. On appeal a divided Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that the Commission’s action was not authorized by federal employment discrimination law and violated state employment discrimination law, state civil service law and the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.</p>

In 1974 the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania found that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and the Pittsburgh Civil Service Commission had been discriminating in hiring against blacks in violation of federal law. <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Glickman, </em><a href="/f-supp/370/0724-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="370 F.

The Commission is charged by state law with the obligation to test and certify to the City all candidates for firefighter. See Act of June 27, 1939, P.L. 1207, § 1, as amended, 53 P.S. § 23491 (Supp.1979). The plaintiffs claimed that the City’s hiring practices, based on the Commission’s testing procedures, were illegally discriminatory and sought = an injunction against future discrimination. Plaintiffs alleged a history of <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>minority under-representation in the Pittsburgh firefighting force, including a prior history of intentional limitation on the number of black firefighters. The plaintiffs also specifically attacked the Commission’s 1972 testing procedures, claiming that the tests had an unjustifiable racially disproportionate impact.</p>

Undisputed evidence from Bureau officials, for example, described hiring practices from the 1930’s through the 1950’s when the City maintained two segregated black firehouses. This testimony acknowledged the existence of a patronage hiring system which, even long after the demise of the “separate but equal” doctrine continued to place a fixed limit on the number of jobs available to blacks. As a result of this and other practices the district court found that</p>

The court found that 70% of the white applicants taking the written examination passed, while only 45.2% of the black applicants passed. On the basis of these test results and the past and current disparity between the percentage of black firefighters and the percentage of blacks in the city, the court found a prima facie case of racial discrimination. <a href="/f-supp/370/0724-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="370 F.

The court further ordered the Commission to take all necessary steps to recruit blacks to take whatever test the Commission ultimately devised. The court acknowledged the possibility of ordering racially-oriented hiring as a remedy for the found discrimination, but refrained from doing so. The court was obviously impressed by the good faith of the City officials and, in substantial part, refrained from ordering quota hiring because of its trust that the defendants would remedy the problem themselves. The court stated that “in the final analysis, responsibility for eradicating racial discrimination in the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire rests upon the defendants alone.” <a href="/f-supp/370/0724-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="370 F.

Nevertheless, as a final note the court admonished: “It must, however, be made clear that the fact that at this stage of the proceedings the Court has rejected the option of imposing a racial hiring quota does not mean that it is foreclosed from instituting such a remedy in the future.” <a href="/f-supp/370/0724-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="370 F.

In June of 1974 the Commission administered a new hiring examination, comprised entirely of physical agility tests. The eligibility list based on the results of these tests remained in force through September 1975. Of the 163 firefighters hired during that time, 21 were members of minority groups. No challenge is made to that test or to any hiring based on it.</p>

The 1975 examination, like that in 1974, tested only physical agility. It consisted of five or six separate events including a shuttle-run, hose-coupling and climbing. This examination <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>had been used in other cities, including San Francisco, where it had been shown reliable in predicting minimum qualifications for firefighters. And the Commission, likewise, had previously found the examination to be a reliable test of minimum job qualification. Record at 83a.</p>
    <p id="b547-4" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[200,634,1147,262]]]'>As usually administered, the passing score on the examination, indicating minimal qualification, is 75. The test does not, however, predict differences in ability or qualification between those who pass with a score of 75 and those whose scores are higher. Record at 84a, 93a.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.6",547,[199,934,1149,265]]]'>As required by the district court, the Commission conducted an extensive campaign to notify minority groups about the up-coming test. Approximately 1500 applicants took the examination, 522 of whom were minorities. Over 1160 applicants passed, approximately 360 of whom were minorities.</p>
    <p id="b547-6" data-blocks='[["BL_547.7",547,[199,1236,1150,646]]]'>Although minorities passed the 1975 test in roughly the same percentage as whites, minorities did not place in substantial numbers at the top of the list. Thus, in March 1976, when the City requested the Commission to certify twenty candidates for new openings for firefighters, only three of those among the first twenty on the testing list were minorities. At that time, however, still only 55 members or 5% of the 1047 person Fire Bureau were black. Thus, although the black population of Pittsburgh had risen to 22%, the increase in black representation in the Fire Bureau had increased only one percent since the federal court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Glickman.</em>

      <em>Weber </em>concerned the legality under Title VII of an affirmative action craft-training program established by employer-union collective bargaining. In order to alleviate racial imbalances in its craft work force, Kaiser Aluminum instituted a plan to select at least 50% black trainees to fill craft openings in its plants until such time as the percentage of black skilled craft workers approximated the percentage of blacks in the local labor force. White employees with more seniority who were excluded from the program because of the 50% requirement brought suit.

In expanding Title VII’s coverage to include public employment, Congress expressed natural concern over federal involvement in state and local Employment matters. Thus, to avoid against possible difficulties Congress required that judicial enforcement proceedings against such employers, when necessary, be pursued by the Attorney General rather than by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(f)(l), in order to place the full force of the federal government behind such enforcement. See, S.Rep.No. 415, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in Legislative History, supra at 434. Because of these same concerns Congress placed considerable emphasis on the hope that public employers <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>would voluntarily comply with Title VIFs requirements, or that the Commission would be able to effect conciliation. See e. g., Legislative History, supra at 896 (Senate; remarks of Committee Chairman Williams). Nevertheless, in the present case appellees would have the Commission wait until instructed to institute racial hiring by the federal Commission or until ordered to do so by the federal district court. We do not readily believe that federal law requires states and state agencies to refrain from good faith compliance with federal employment standards only so that a federal court may order them to act. Notions of comity and federal-state harmony would surely be sacrificed by such a conclusion. And such a view is completely contrary to the assumptions on which Congress acted when it amended Title VII. Like Congress, we have no doubt that voluntary state compliance, where forthcoming, is inevitably superior to the often difficult practical problems of federal supervisory jurisdiction.

The evil to be remedied is the spoils system which affords those in political power the discretion to award jobs to political and social friends, rather than to those more qualified.

As one leading supporter of the statute announced at the time of its passage in the Senate, the “only purpose” of the legislation was to give Pittsburgh better fire protection by creating “a fire department completely unhampered by any political interference.” <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.2d%20368" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="19 A.2d 368">Id.</a> (Remarks of Sen.

Although not determinative, it is noteworthy that those minority applicants effected by the program voluntarily intervened as defendants in the trial court urging support of the Commission’s action. Similarly, the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters has taken the same position, amicus curiae, at earlier stages of this litigation. Furthermore, white applicants were not forced to bear an inappropriate burden. Nothing in the record suggests that appellees were any more qualified than those minority applicants the Com<a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>mission wished to certify. Still, fifty percent of those to be certified by the Commission were white. And under applicable state civil service law appellees would have remained on the eligibility list, which could have remained in force for up to three years. See 53 P.S. § 23453. Thus it was not unlikely that, under usual practices, appellees would have been certified at a later date. Any potential harm to appellees simply does not outweigh the necessity for the effective remedial action taken by the Commission. There is no question that the Commission’s plan is acceptable when judged by the standards adopted by Mr. Justice Brennan and the three other Justices who joined him.</p>

      <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>Thus the only remaining question under this approach is the validity of the means adopted by the Commission. Although Mr. Justice Powell’s strict scrutiny approach calls for a test of necessity when racial classifications are employed, his opinion strongly suggests that explicit racial preferences would meet this standard if they are in response to “judicial, legislative or administrative findings of constitutional or statutory violations.” Id. at 307, 98 S.Ct. at 2758. <em>Price v. Civil Service Commission of Sacramento, </em>supra at 281 n. 17, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20475" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="161 Cal.

For the obligation to correct prior violations may well make remedial preferences necessary. In disapproving of the University of California’s self-initiated admissions program, Mr. Justice Powell specifically distinguished the Court’s employment discrimination cases and the decisions of the federal court of appeals which have required racial preferences as remedies for established violations of the federal employment laws. Id. at 298-301, 98 S.Ct. at 2753-55. And Mr. Justice Powell did not suggest that other governmental bodies may not take similar action to remedy discrimination once an appropriate determination of prior discrimination has been made. Indeed, as we have suggested, a barrier to all but court-ordered action would frustrate our usual preference for voluntary compliance, would delay remedial action and, where a state employer is involved, would unnecessarily disrupt federal-state relations. We view the findings of discrimination in the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire embodied in the federal court decision in <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Glickman </em>as sufficient to meet the threshold requirement articulated by Mr. Justice Powell. And, for reasons we have already given, we believe the Commission’s plan an appropriate response to those findings. The record plainly establishes the ineffectiveness of other remedial action. We are satisfied, given the unchallenged findings of the common pleas court, that the Commission’s plan was, indeed, a necessary step toward eliminating the existing effects of the prior <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>discrimination. Accordingly, we believe the Commission’s remedial plan permissible even under the approach of Mr. Justice Powell. We therefore hold that the Commission’s plan is not prohibited by the equal protection clause.</p>

In support of a finding that this has occurred in the instant case, the majority relies on the “existing federal judicial finding of discrimination in the Bureau of Fire”, and the Common Pleas Court’s finding that the Commission’s proposed action was a necessary practical step to correct that discrimination.</p>
    <p id="b575-6" data-blocks='[["BL_575.7",575,[169,1249,1149,310]]]'>As for the Common Pleas Court’s finding, little solace can be gained, since this Court’s ruling was <em>subsequent </em>to the Commission’s actions and cannot be used as a basis for finding that the Commission had a judicial finding upon which it could rely.

      <em>Glickman </em>was followed in the Western District Court by <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v.

Here, the Federal District Court did invoke a quota system for the hiring of police officers. However, the Court, through Judge Weber, adopted the reasoning of the <em>Glickman </em>case and stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b576-3" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[321,332,1113,206]]]'>
      <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>We agree entirely with the rationale of Judge Teitelbaum of this court, as expressed in [Glickman] on a greater urgency of the application of a quota system in a case involving a police force than a fire department, (p. 1030)</blockquote>
    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[279,573,1156,314]]]'>If there was any doubt left that the Federal Court did not believe that a quota system should not be invoked for the Pittsburgh fire fighters, that doubt should have been dispelled when defendants tried to remove the instant case to the Federal Court. In denying removal and in remanding the case to the state court, Judge Rabe Marsh said:</p>
    <blockquote id="AJv" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[322,909,1118,417]]]'>Indeed, in the instant case, <em>it may well be that a racially-oriented hiring system is more inconsistent with federal equal rights law than is the civil service system of hiring </em>on the basis of merit. Section 703 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 specifically states that preferential treatment is not required on account of numerical or percentage imbalance. (Emphasis added). <em>Chmill, et al. v. City of Pittsburgh, et al., </em>Civil Action 76-537.</blockquote>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.7",576,[280,1350,1154,205]]]'>Under all of the above, it is difficult to perceive how the majority can argue that the Civil Service Commission was responding to a judicial mandate in imposing the quota system which the Federal Court itself had rejected.</p>
    <p id="b576-6" data-blocks='[["BL_576.8",576,[281,1576,1158,789]]]'>The overriding question to be asked here is whether this Court is going to permit a Commission established by the legislature to “enact” rules contrary to those established by the legislature. If the Commission felt that a quota system was required to right past discriminatory wrongs, it would have been appropriate for the Commission to go back to Federal Court and seek a judicial determination based upon a record developed in open court. At least this procedure would have preserved the integrity of the statute while allowing the court to determine if the time had indeed arrived when the quota system was the only means left to correct the past discriminatory conduct. Of course, the Commission could have alternatively sought legislative changes which would have permitted the creation of the two certified lists.</p>
    <p id="b577-3" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[204,342,1148,620]]]'>
      <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>Here, the Commission took neither of the above available courses of action and, instead, disregarded the very Act of the legislature under which it had been created. The legislative history of the Civil Service Act (53 P.S. § 23491 et seq. (1957) &amp; Supp.1979), upon which the majority seems to rely, clearly establishes an intention on the part of the legislature to do away with political patronage in the hiring of fire fighters. Nowhere in this history is there any indication that the legislature sought to control every other evil faced by society. And, clearly, the Commission itself was not given any authority in the Act to remedy all of society’s ills on its own.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[201,991,1152,793]]]'>The majority attempts to support its argument that the Commission has the power to advance other state interests in addition to eliminating the patronage system, by pointing to Subsection (f) of § 23493.1 which allows the addition of 10 points to the score of every passing applicant who has been honorably discharged from the armed services. This is a self-defeating argument. It is self-defeating because it supports the inescapable conclusion that the Commission must be guided by its legislative creator as to what state interests it may advance. A consistent reading of the majority opinion would require a finding that the Civil Service Commission could independently decide that the time had come to eliminate the veteran’s preference points. And, yet, the majority does not openly suggest that the Commission does have this authority.</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.6",577,[199,1803,1151,580]],["BL_578.1",578,[273,351,1153,200]]]'>And, under the majority’s view, what other “state policy fully consistent with the civil service objectives” could the Commission now unilaterally invoke without prior legislative approval? Further, is it to be left to the Commission to decide what our “state policy” is? Should the Commission now be permitted to decide that the gay rights movement requires a state policy that a certain percentage of the fire bureau be gay? Should the Commission now be permitted to decide that the fire bureau be composed of 50% women? I believe that it is up to our elected officials in the legislature to determine “state policy”. The effects of a decision that <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>an agency can <em>go </em>outside the bounds of the legislation which created it to determine policy would create a chaotic situation not apparently envisioned by the majority. Under the majority, all agencies could establish their own policies.</p>
    <p id="b578-4" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[273,570,1157,1216]]]'>The majority relies on the assertion that all of the candidates who passed the Commission’s 1975 examination were equally qualified as fire fighters. This statement begs the question because the legislation creating the Commission called for applicants to the competitive class being appointed “only from the top of the competitive list.” In fact, there would be little use in creating a competitive list if the Commission were left to its whim in determining who from the entire list of successful applicants it would certify. The very purpose of the Act was to eliminate discrimination in hiring by requiring a mechanical certification from the top down according to the applicant’s score on the test. The majority would destroy this noble goal by once again giving to the employing agency the right to pick and choose who would be certified. In fact, the trial court found that the Civil Service Commission “violated the express terms of the Civil Service Act . . . original (appointments) must be made from the top of the list. The (Civil Service Commission’s) quota system deviates from this straight down the list approach in the Act. The purpose of the Civil Service Act was to guarantee that appointments would be made solely on the basis of merit, to obtain the best man or woman for the job.”</p>
    <p id="b578-6" data-blocks='[["BL_578.5",578,[275,1803,1156,309]]]'>Finally, it is the opinion of this writer that the Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>United Steelworkers of America v.
