    <p id="b260-6" data-blocks='[["BL_260.7",260,[264,626,1154,206]]]'>This is an appeal from a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County, Orphans’ Court Division, granting a petition to involuntarily terminate the appellant-mother’s parental rights in Infant Female F.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b260-7" data-blocks='[["BL_260.8",260,[264,853,1153,525]]]'>The child was born out of wedlock on July 2,1978 and was placed by the appellant with the Catholic Charities of Union-town, Pennsylvania (Agency), on July 3 for lodging and care. The child has continued in the care of the Agency since. In August, 1978, the appellant signed a petition for voluntary relinquishment of her parental rights but later changed her mind, and, upon being so informed, the couut denied the petition. On February 28, 1979, a petition for involuntary termination was filed by the Agency. The petition was granted by the court on April 20 after evidentiary hearings.</p>
    <p id="b260-8" data-blocks='[["BL_260.9",260,[265,1397,1153,420]]]'>The court’s decree of termination was bottomed upon its conclusion that the mother had evidenced a settled purpose for a period of at least six months of relinquishing her parental claim and had continuously neglected to provide the child with essential care and subsistence since birth. Cf. Section 311, Adoption Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, No. 208, 1 P.S. § 311 (Supp.1978-79) and <em>Appeal of Dianne B., </em><a href="/pa/456/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="456 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="584423" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0429-01">456 Pa. 429</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=321%20A.2d%20618" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="321 A.2d 618">321 A.2d 618</a> (1974).</p>

On August 16, she made an appointment with the Agency for August 21 to continue these discussions but failed to appear for the appointment. Thereafter, a series <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>of letters forwarded by the Agency and admittedly received by her, requesting her cooperation, were ignored.</p>
