However, on February 17, six days before the running of the one-hundred-twenty-day period, Washington consented to a continuance of the trial to February 28. On February 28, the trial was again delayed because Washington filed a motion to dismiss the charges for violation of art. IV(c) of the Agreement on Detainers. Argument on this motion was heard by the court on March 1 and denied the same day. The trial began the following day. Under such circumstances, we find no violation of art.

Later, during cross-examination in response to a question as to whether Washington had been given a court hearing in Kansas before his return to Pennsylvania, this witness said: “Sentenced prisoners do not have court hearings.” A second motion for a <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>mistrial was then denied.

    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[258,469,1154,632]]]'>The purpose of this witness’s testimony was apparently to show that Washington had fled Philadelphia after the homicide here involved. However, the fact that he was serving a sentence in Leavenworth Penitentiary was of no concern and had no relevancy. It is established, beyond argument, that a testimonial reference indicating to the jury that the accused has been engaged in other criminal activity, denies the accused a fair trial and requires a retrial, except under well-defined and limited circumstances not here present. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Turner, </em><a href="/pa/454/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="454 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="579919" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0439-01">454 Pa. 439</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20899" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="311 A.2d 899">311 A.2d 899</a> (1973).

    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.6",208,[258,1167,1156,945]]]'>The Commonwealth urges that prejudice resulting from the challenged testimony could have been cured by cautionary instructions. Even granting this, no such instructions were given. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the witness was an employee of the district attorney’s office supervising significant procedures; as such, it is a reasonable assumption that he should have known not to make such statements. The Commonwealth also urges that the testimony was harmless since the jury could have inferred Washington was in custody in Leavenworth Penitentiary on the present charges. One would be quite naive to subscribe to this argument. More importantly, in determining if the introduction of the challenged testimony constitutes reversible error, the controlling question is whether the jury could reasonably infer therefrom that the accused had engaged in other unrelated criminal activity. <em>Commonwealth v. Allen, </em><a href="/pa/448/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="448 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1944732" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0177-01">448 Pa. 177</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20373" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="292 A.2d 373">292 A.2d 373</a> (1973).
