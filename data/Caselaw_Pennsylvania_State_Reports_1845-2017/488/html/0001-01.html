The orphans’ court rejected appellant’s challenge to debtor Clark’s “release and renunciation” of the full, unknown amount of his distributable share of the estates of his deceased parents, John Clark and Madeline Clark. Clark had “released and renounced” his interest in exchange for settlement of his obligation to repay an equally unknown amount of estate funds he misappropriated while executor of the estates. Although the orphans’ court denied appellant relief on the ground that Clark “is generally in default in the two estates in a greater amount than his share in both estates,” and thus nothing remains for attachment, we agree with appellant that the record contains insufficient evidence to support the conclusion of the orphans’ court. Accordingly, we vacate the decrees and remand with instructions.</p>

Clark received letters testamentary in August of 1973. By November of 1975, the orphans’ court removed him as executor for mismanagement of the estates and misappropriation of estate assets.

Two days later, the Sheriff served the executrix with the writs.

As a result of the negotiations, in February of 1978, Clark executed a “release and renunciation” of whatever distributable share of the estates he might have received. Thereafter, appellant filed a claim with the estates based on his attachment executions two years earlier. In May of 1978, at audit, appellant filed a “petition to enjoin” Clark’s release and renunciation insofar as it affected his existing attachment executions. The orphans’ court denied relief and these appeals followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

All that appellant seeks, however, is to have his attachment executions operate on Clark’s share to the extent the share exceeds the amount Clark owes the estates. (Indeed, appellant concedes the estates’ claims on Clark’s share take priority over his. See e. g., <em>Strong’s Executors v. </em>Bass, supra note 3.) Appellant contends that the facts necessary to calculate whether an attachable share exists have not been determined.</p>

The finding of the orphans’ court here, that Clark “generally” is in default in an amount greater than the amount which he would receive, lacks the necessary evidentiary support. This determination can be made only if two amounts first have been established: (1) the amount of the bequest to Patrick Clark, and (2) the amount of estate assets Clark improperly withdrew. Neither amount, however, has been determined, for there has been no accurate inventory of either estate filed, and the present executrix has not established the amount by which Patrick Clark should be surcharged. As an attaching judgment creditor, appellant must be permitted to require proper determination of both amounts. Cf. e. g., <em>Centrella Estate, </em>20 D. &amp; C.2d 486, 489 (O.C.Phila.1960) (Klein, P. J.) (attaching creditor of distributee “clearly has the right to compel an accounting”).</p>

It cannot support the rule the estates urge this Court to adopt.</p>

Indeed, correspondence between the parties demonstrates that appellant refrained from any further action to permit the estates full opportunity to ascertain its losses. And the claimed inaction has in no respect prejudiced the estates. See 2 Standard Pennsylvania Practice § 26 (1956).

    <p id="b80-6" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[247,1079,1152,205]]]'>The legislature has recently enacted a statute which is controlling in this situation, the Act of July 9,1976, P.L. 562, No. 136, Ch. 62 (Disclaimers) 20 Pa.C.S. §§ 6201-6207 (Supp. 1979-80). Section 6201 provides, in relevant part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b80-7" data-blocks='[["BL_80.6",80,[287,1298,1112,312]]]'>A person to whom an interest in property would have devolved by whatever means, including a beneficiary under a will . . . may disclaim it in whole or in part by a written disclaimer which shall (1) describe the interest disclaimed, (2) declare the disclaimer and extent thereof, and (3) be signed by the disclaimant.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b80-9" data-blocks='[["BL_80.7",80,[287,1624,1112,150]]]'>The right to disclaim shall exist notwithstanding any limitation on the interest in the nature of a spendthrift provision or similar restriction.</blockquote>
    <p id="b80-10" data-blocks='[["BL_80.8",80,[245,1794,1154,96]]]'>Section 6205 describes the effect of such a disclaimer; it provides:.</p>
    <blockquote id="b80-11" data-blocks='[["BL_80.9",80,[286,1907,1114,149]],["BL_81.1",81,[226,331,1103,95]]]'>(a) In general. — A disclaimer relates back <em>for all purposes </em>to the date of the death of the decedent . The disclaimer shall be binding upon the disclaimant <em>and </em>
      <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>
      <em>all persons claiming through or under him. </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>
    <p id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[182,446,1148,574]]]'>The broad language of this section leads to the inevitable conclusion that a disclaimer will prevent a creditor from reaching a beneficiary’s interest under a testamentary gift which has been disclaimed in the manner provided in the statute. The disclaimer relates back <em>for all purposes </em>to the decedent’s death and is binding on <em>all persons </em>claiming through the disclaimant. A creditor claims through the debtor/disclaimant and, since the disclaimer relates back to decedent’s death, the effect in law is that no interest in the estate has ever passed to the disclaimant which could be attached by a creditor.</p>
    <p id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[181,1040,1149,781]]]'>This was the effect desired by the drafters of the Disclaimer Act. Chapter 62 was patterned after the Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act, the Uniform Disclaimer of Transfers by Will, Intestacy or Appointment Act and the Uniform Disclaimer of Transfers under Nontestamentary Instruments Act. <em>See </em>§ 6201, Official Advisory Committee Comment. The Commissioner’s Comment to § 3 of the Uniform Disclaimer of Transfers by Will, Intestacy or Appointment Act makes it clear that the Act applies to creditors of a disclaimer: “[a]s regards creditors . . . the provision for ‘relation back’ has the legal effect of preventing a succession from becoming operative in favor of the disclaimant. The relation back is ‘for all purposes’ which would include, among others for the purpose of rights of creditors . . . .”</p>
    <p id="b81-8" data-blocks='[["BL_81.7",81,[178,1849,1150,299]]]'>Thus, a beneficiary is <em>permitted </em>by Chapter 62 to disclaim an interest even though such disclaimer operates to “cutoff” a creditor’s attached interest. However, Chapter 62 also provides that a prior acceptance of the interest by the beneficiary will operate as a bar to disclaimer. Section 6206 states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b81-9" data-blocks='[["BL_81.8",81,[220,2173,1106,204]]]'>(a) Acceptance. — A disclaimer may be made at any time before acceptance.

      <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>(1) The taking of possession or accepting delivery of the property or interest.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[300,492,1113,87]]]'>(3) An assignment conveyance, encumbrance, pledge or other transfer of the interest or a contract to do so.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.6",82,[300,659,1110,95]]]'>To constitute a bar to a disclaimer, a prior acceptance must be affirmatively proved. .</blockquote>
    <p id="b82-7" data-blocks='[["BL_82.7",82,[257,773,1154,664]]]'>In the instant case, while the lower court did not specifically deal with this section of the Code, it is evident that Patrick Clark, the beneficiary, had accepted his interest in the Clark estates. There is no dispute that he appropriated the assets of the Clark estates to his own beneficial use and enjoyment — this was admitted by Patrick Clark in criminal court. I would hold that, even though the beneficiary has no <em>legal </em>right to presently possess or enjoy the assets in an estate, appropriation by the beneficiary of those assets to his own beneficial use and enjoyment constitutes acceptance under § 6206. Accordingly, Patrick Clark’s acceptance of his interest in the Clark estates would operate as a bar to an effective disclaimer of that interest.</p>
    <p id="b82-8" data-blocks='[["BL_82.8",82,[256,1465,1154,625]]]'>Having accepted the interest, Clark’s “release and renunciation” was, in reality, <em>a form of conveyance </em>— a transfer of the interest <em>he had already accepted </em>to others who also had interests in the Clark estates. “ ‘Release’ is a type of conveyance . . . . As opposed to cases of disclaimer or renunciation, it is assumed in cases of release that the releasor owned something to begin with and that he has released it to somebody else who owned an interest in the same property.” Bregy, Intestacy, Wills and Estates Acts of 1947, section 3, ¶ 5 (Bisel 1949); <em>see </em>Official Advisory Committee Comment to 20 Pa.C.S. § 6201 (“release after acceptance ... is really a form of conveyance”).</p>
    <p id="b82-10" data-blocks='[["BL_82.9",82,[258,2107,1152,247]]]'>A release of an interest in an estate is sanctioned by 20 Pa.C.S. § 6103 (1975). However, this section does not speak to the effect of a release on the rights of a creditor of the releasor. Appellant contends that this conveyance in the form of release was fraudulent as to him.</p>
    <p id="b83-4" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[180,330,1149,742]]]'>
      <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>Appellant admits that his right to receive Patrick Clark’s share of the Clark estates is subject to the executrix’ right to set off any debt which Clark owes to the estates. Brief for Appellant at 15. However, appellant claims the estates are limited in their set-off to the amount in which Clark was in default. This, according to appellant, requires a determination of two amounts — the amount of assets in the Clark estates from which Patrick Clark’s share could be computed and the amount of assets which were converted by him. Appellant’s proposition is that the consideration given by the estate in exchange for the beneficiary’s release must be equal to the value of the interest released, else the difference will be subject to attack as a fraudulent conveyance upon creditors of the beneficiary.</p>
    <p id="b83-5" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[182,1091,1148,580]]]'>The restrictions on a debtor’s ability to convey assets to a creditor to the detriment of another creditor are to be found in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, 39 P.S. §§ 351-363 (1954) (hereinafter UFCA). Section 351 of the UFCA defines a “conveyance” as including “every payment of money, assignment, <em>release, </em>transfer, lease, mortgage or pledge of <em>tangible or intangible property . </em>. . .” A release of an interest in an estate as heretofore discussed is, therefore, within the ambit of the UFCA and, if fraudulent as defined therein, may be reached by creditors of the conveyor.</p>
    <p id="b83-7" data-blocks='[["BL_83.6",83,[180,1690,1150,688]],["BL_84.1",84,[262,320,1154,200]]]'>Under the UFCA, there are two categories of conveyances which are fraudulent. The first category, section 357, deals with conveyances made with intent to defraud and provides “[ejvery conveyance made and every obligation incurred with actual intent, as distinguished from intent presumed in law, to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors, is fraudulent to both present and future creditors”. The lower court found no intent to defraud and so held section 357 inapplicable. It is clear that Patrick Clark’s release was the result of family negotiations toward settlement and guilty plea negotiations. The release was made a condition of the criminal court’s acceptance of the prosecution’s recommended sentence, and was the <em>quid pro quo </em>for <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>the estates’ withdrawal of civil litigation against Clark. Thus, there was adequate evidence supporting the finding that the release was not made with actual intent to defraud appellant.</p>
    <p id="b84-5" data-blocks='[["BL_84.5",84,[262,539,1151,95]]]'>The second category, section 354, deals with conveyances made by an insolvent; it provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b84-6" data-blocks='[["BL_84.6",84,[302,648,1111,246]]]'>Every conveyance made and every obligation incurred by a person who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent, is fraudulent as to creditors, without regard to his actual intent, if the conveyance is made or the obligation is incurred without a fair consideration.</blockquote>
    <p id="b84-7" data-blocks='[["BL_84.7",84,[259,919,1154,463]]]'>The lower court held this section inapplicable because Patrick Clark “had other assets which he was required to deposit in escrow for the estate, so he did not thereby render himself insolvent.” Thus, that court found no fraudulent conveyance under § 354 because the debtor was not rendered insolvent by the release. However, the mere fact that he had such “other assets ... in escrow” does not establish his solvency as these assets were pledged to the estate as part of the entire transaction which precipitated the release.</p>
    <p id="b84-8" data-blocks='[["BL_84.8",84,[259,1400,1154,724]],["BL_85.1",85,[174,319,1146,97]]]'>Moreover, the court ignored the statutory definition for insolvency.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Under that definition, Patrick Clark could still be found insolvent even though he had assets in escrow. I would, therefore, vacate the order of the Orphans’ Court and remand for an application of the statutory definition of insolvency. Additionally, if the court would determine that Patrick Clark was rendered insolvent by the release, a further determination would have to be made, namely, whether the release was given for fair consideration within the meaning of § 353 of the UFCA: If the court would find that the monetary value of the interest released by Patrick Clark exceeded the monetary value of the set-off due the Clark estates by virtue of Patrick’s theft and mismanagement of estate assets, the excess consideration would be <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>subject to attack and, to that extent, could be set aside under applicable provisions of the UFCA.</p>
