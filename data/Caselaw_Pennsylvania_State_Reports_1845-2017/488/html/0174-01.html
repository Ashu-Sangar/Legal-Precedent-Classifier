There, a computer check was run on appellant, which showed two outstanding warrants for his arrest on charges of forgery. The warrants concerned a check-cashing incident which occurred in Lancaster County in September of 1974 and were based upon information — both oral and recorded — supplied by Detective David Parsons of the Lancaster police. Appellant was immediately placed under arrest and while awaiting transportation to Lancaster, he was photographed. Later, after his return to Lancaster, appellant was fingerprinted and a handwriting sample was taken.</p>

The words ‘subscribed to by the affiant’, added to the original clause by the Constitution of 1874, modify the words ‘oath or affirmation’ and not ‘probable cause’, thus implying that the oath or affirmation must be in written form. The purpose of the added phrase, according to one historian, was to ‘more certainly identify the person responsible for the prosecution.’ White, The Constitution of Pennsylvania, p. 158 (1907). The reports of the debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1872-73 show that the phrase was added not to require all facts to be in writing, but so that the accusations and the accuser’s name would be in writing. In reporting the amendment, the chairman of the Committee on the Declaration of Rights said: ‘That was done in consequence of information we had that it was a practice in Philadelphia amongst aldermen and committing magistrates to receive verbal information against persons accused of crime and make no record of them, and therefore we require warrants to be supported by oath or affirmation subscribed to by the affiant, to put a stop to that practice.’ 4 Deb.Const.Conv.Pa. 646 (1873). Later in the debates the chairman reiterated that the amendment was added to combat the practice in Philadelphia where the charges were not reduced to writing, and even when they were, no signature was required of the complaining witness. 4 Deb.Const.Conv.Pa. 733.” <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawley, </em><a href="/pa-super/209/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="209 Pa.
