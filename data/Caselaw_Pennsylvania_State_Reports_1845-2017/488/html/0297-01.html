At about 3:00 a. m., Baker observed, just outside of Carlisle, a tractor-trailer parked on U.S. Interstate Route 81 and a person nearby placing a flare on the highway. Baker proceeded to the scene, where he came upon a motor vehicle resting on a southwesterly direction on the guardrail along the northbound, passing lane of travel.</p>

Baker approached appellee. Appellee asked Baker about “getting a wrecker to come and take the car off the guardrails,” but Baker did not call for a tow truck. Instead, he summoned another patrol car to assist with traffic. Because the accident occurred outside of Carlisle, Baker also contacted Carlisle Police Headquarters, which in turn contacted State Police.</p>

The Commonwealth takes the position that the quoted language of <em>D’Nicuola </em>upon which the suppression court relied is not sound. The Commonwealth claims <em>D’Nicuola </em>is based on a “faulty assumption” that <em>Miranda </em>requires warnings whenever as accused is in custody or the focus of an investigation.
