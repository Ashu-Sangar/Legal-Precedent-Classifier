    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.6",414,[267,1022,1156,877]]]'>First, appellant contends that insofar as the addresses of stampholders are unknown, the rule set forth in <em>Texas v. New Jersey, <a href="/us/379/0674-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="379 U.S. 674" data-case-ids="11733018" data-case-paths="/us/379/0674-01">supra,</a> </em>constitutes a complete jurisdictional bar to <em>any </em>consideration of the petition in escheat by a Pennsylvania court. The <em>Texas </em>rule establishes priority among multiple states attempting to escheat the same res. It specifies that the state of the last known addresses of the creditors of intangible personalty has the superior right to escheat, and where such addresses are lacking, the superior power of escheat resides in the state of corporate domicile.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Since the creditors’ addresses in the instant case are unknown, appellant concludes both that Pennsylvania lacks the power to escheat according to the <em>Texas </em>rule, and lacking such power to escheat, Pennsylvania courts also necessarily lack the power to hear this action in escheat.

There are two relevant Pennsylvania statutes. The first, the Act of July 29, 1953, P.L. 986, § 1, amending the Act of May 2, 1889, P.L. 66, § 3, formerly 27 P.S. § 333 (1958), was in effect at the time the Commonwealth filed its present petition in escheat. This act provides only that “any real property or personal property within or subject to the control of the Commonwealth” shall escheat to the Commonwealth where the owner’s whereabouts are unknown for seven years, 27 P.S. § 333(b), where the property is unclaimed for seven years, 27 P.S. § 333(c), or where the property is without a rightful owner, 27 P.S. § 333(d).</p>

Thus, the Court set up a test for determining which State had the claim to escheat superior to all others. <em>Texas v. New Jersey, </em><a href="/us/379/0674-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="379 U.S. 674" data-case-ids="11733018" data-case-paths="/us/379/0674-01">379 U.S. 674</a>, <a href="/us/379/0674-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="379 U.S. 674" data-case-ids="11733018" data-case-paths="/us/379/0674-01">85 S.Ct. 626</a>, <a href="/us/379/0674-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="379 U.S. 674" data-case-ids="11733018" data-case-paths="/us/379/0674-01">13 L.Ed.2d 596</a> (1965). The threshold issue is whether under the Act we are limited to a determination of the court’s power pursuant to the test set forth in <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>or whether we may also determine whether this State’s claim to escheat is superior to all others. <em>Texas v. New Jersey, supra. </em>The majority concludes that the Act does not allow inquiry into the questions presented by the <em>Texas </em>decision. This view fails to perceive the true nature of the bar set up in that case and attributes to the Act a restrictive and consistent interpretation that is not justified under prior precedent.</p>

New Jersey </em>challenge would fall within its parameters. Although as a general rule a court may have jurisdiction or competency in <em>in rem </em>matters where the requirements of <em>Shaffer v. Heitner </em>have been satisfied, the <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>ruling made an exception in escheat cases and added an additional jurisdictional requirement. The power to es-cheat flows from the sovereignty of the State. <em>Texas v. New Jersey </em>provides a basis for determining which sovereign has the power, where there are competing claims of sister States. Thus a determination that a State lacks the power to escheat because of a superior claim relates to the competency of the court in the same manner as a finding that a court was acting without statutory authority. The court’s powers are derived from the State, <em>see Arrott v.

The case for applying to jurisdiction <em>in rem </em>the same test of “fair play and substantial justice” as governs assertions of jurisdiction <em>in personam </em>is simple and straightforward. It is premised on recognition that “[t]he phrase, ‘judicial jurisdiction over a thing’ is a customary elliptical way of referring to jurisdiction over the interests of persons in a thing.” (Citations omitted). This recognition leads to the conclusion that in order to justify an exercise of jurisdiction <em>in rem, </em>the basis for jurisdiction must be sufficient to justify exercising “jurisdiction over the interest of persons in a thing.” (Footnotes omitted). <em>Shaffer v.

Mr. Justice Larsen oversimplifies the inquiry when he attempts to limit the test of subject matter jurisdiction to encompass only the nature of case being considered. For example, the courts of common pleas of this Commonwealth have subject matter jurisdiction over prosecutions for homicide. Yet, even if a Pennsylvania trial court had jurisdiction over the parties through their consent, a Pennsylvania court could not try a person for a homicide that occurred in California. In such an instance the Pennsylvania court would lack subject matter jurisdiction because the crime did not occur in Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania therefore lacked sufficient contacts or interest in the case. Similarly, the Pennsylvania courts have been given the authority to hear escheat matters but in the present case, it <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>is asserted that the contacts and interest are insufficient to allow Pennsylvania courts <em>to hear and decide </em>this case.
