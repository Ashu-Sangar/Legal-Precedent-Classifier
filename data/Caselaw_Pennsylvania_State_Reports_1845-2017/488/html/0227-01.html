Since the Commonwealth was seeking the death penalty, the jury further deliberated and found aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to death. This direct appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b300-6" data-blocks='[["BL_300.7",300,[245,1037,1151,141]]]'>Appellant first argues that the suppression court erred in failing to suppress statements given to police. The facts are as follows.</p>
    <p id="b300-7" data-blocks='[["BL_300.8",300,[244,1209,1153,311]]]'>On February 21, 1977, police discovered the bodies of Victor Soto, his wife Betty Soto, and her fourteen-year-old daughter, Wanda McKim, in their home at 1231 South 46th Street in Philadelphia. Mr. and Mrs. Soto had been bound with electrical cord and stabbed repeatedly while Ms. McKim was found submerged in a bathtub full of water.</p>
    <p id="b300-8" data-blocks='[["BL_300.9",300,[244,1543,1154,690]]]'>Police at the scene learned that Mrs. Soto had another daughter, Helen McKim, who had recently moved out of the Soto household. Police learned that Helen had struck her mother with a hammer a week or so before the killings. Police discovered that Helen was living at the home of Mrs. Ruth Stroman at 4821 Kingsessing Avenue in Philadelphia. At the Stroman home, police found Helen McKim, Sharlinda Stroman, William Blannon and appellant. All four agreed to go to police headquarters to be interviewed concerning their knowledge of the victims. Before leaving, however, Ruth Stroman told a Detective Hildred Allen that appellant and Blannon had been around the Soto residence over the past weekend.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Appellant was questioned by Detective Harry McCabe for approximately thirty minutes about his knowledge of the slain family and their relationship with Helen McKim. McCabe testified that appellant was not under arrest and that appellant was very cooperative in answering questions. Appellant agreed to take a polygraph examination, but he was found unfit for the examination because he had been smoking marijuana all day before arriving at police headquarters.</p>
    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[219,871,1146,528]]]'>At 8:30 P.M., Sergeant Herbert Gibbons, the detective in charge of the case, told appellant that he was free to leave and that the police would give him a ride home. Appellant, however, informed Sergeant Gibbons that he preferred to wait until police were done questioning his girlfriend, Sharlinda Stroman. Appellant, who was not a suspect at this time, remained in the waiting room overnight.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The next morning appellant was given breakfast. During the period between 8:30 P.M. and 7:00 A.M. the following morning, appellant was not questioned.</p>

Sharlinda Stroman, on the other hand, told police during questioning that she, Blannon and appellant had been together at her home all day Saturday. Because of the inconsistencies between the statements of Blannon and Stroman, Sergeant Gibbons instructed Detective Francis Ansel to interview appellant concerning Blannon’s whereabouts on Saturday. During an interview between 7:05 A.M. and 8:45 A.M., appellant told Ansel that he had been with Blannon all Saturday evening except for a ten-minute period when Blannon left to buy beer. Appellant also told Ansel he did not know who had killed the three victims. Detective Ansel testified that appellant appeared normal and alert and had no trouble answering questions. <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>Ansel further testified that appellant was not a suspect; however, the officer felt appellant was providing a false alibi for Blannon.</p>

During this period, Sergeant Gibbons was reviewing all of the statements given to police and noticed the discrepancies between the statements given by Blannon, appellant and Stroman. At 11:00 A.M., Gibbons instructed Detective Guster Richardson to give appellant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and advise him he could be charged with hindering the prosecution of Blannon if he insisted on providing a false alibi for Blannon. Appellant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which he waived. During this interview, appellant informed Detective Richardson that he had confused the events of Friday with Saturday’s events; appellant contended he had gone out alone on Saturday and could not account for Blannon’s activities on that evening. The interview concluded at 12:30 P.M. when appellant agreed to take a polygraph examination.</p>

The polygraph examination itself was conducted between 2:00 P.M. and 2:30 P.M. When appellant asked how he had done, Martinez informed him he had not done very well. Appellant then told Martinez he would tell what had happened. Martinez gave appellant paper and told him to write down what had occurred. Appellant then wrote out a confession admitting complicity in the killings which he signed at 3:07 P.M. Martinez then informed Sergeant Gibbons of appellant’s confession. Gibbons, who testified he was surprised by the confession, instructed Detective Martin Buck to take a formal statement. Buck again gave appellant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings which he again waived. Appellant admitted that he had helped tie up Mr. and Mrs. Soto before Blannon had stabbed them and that he had helped strangle Wanda McKim. Appellant read and signed the confession at 4:52 P.M. Detective Buck testified that appellant had been alert <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>and talkative during the interview, and had not been subjected to force or threats.</p>

When advised that he was being charged with three counts of homicide, appellant stated, “Wait awhile judge. I don’t mind going to jail for what I did, but I’m not going to jail for what I didn’t do. I didn’t kill no three people. I just killed one.” After he had been arraigned, appellant also told Officer Alfred Bertolino that he had only killed the young girl.</p>
    <p id="b303-6" data-blocks='[["BL_303.6",303,[228,843,1148,474]]]'>The suppression court, after hearing this testimony, made findings of fact and conclusions of law and ruled that all of appellant’s statements were admissible. Although appellant did not testify at the suppression hearing he testified at trial that he had not written or signed the confession and that he had been detained overnight and that the confession was the product of force and threats of force. That testimony was rejected as incredible by the trial court in denying appellant’s post-verdict motions.</p>

Upon arrival, they “invited” the daughter and three others, appellant, appellant’s girlfriend Sharlinda Stroman, and William Blannon, to police headquarters to be interviewed regarding their knowledge of the victims. Police provided the transportation. Before they left, however, the owner of the home told police that appellant and Blannon “know more about it because they were around there over the weekend.” Upon arriving at police headquarters that evening, police, without first advising appellant of his rights, asked appellant questions concerning his knowledge of the victims.</p>

At the time of this “offer,” however, police still were questioning appellant’s girlfriend Stroman. Because appellant decided to wait for Stroman, he declined the “offer.” Police questioned appellant’s girlfriend Stroman throughout the night. In the meantime, appellant spent the night at police headquarters in a locked waiting room. Blannon, also questioned throughout the night, eventually confessed. The first thing the next morning, at 7:00 a. m., police further questioned appellant, again without first administering <em>Miranda </em>warnings, purportedly to “reconcile discrepancies” between statements given by Blannon and Stroman. Police claim that <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>after this second round of questioning they “noticed” discrepancies in the statements of Blannon, appellant, and Stroman.

    <p id="b308-5" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[261,584,1155,876]]]'>It is well-settled Pennsylvania law that “the test of custodial interrogation is whether the individual being interrogated reasonably believes his freedom of action is being restricted.” <em>Commonwealth v.

At the very least, it must be concluded that appellant could reasonably believe his freedom of action was restricted at the time of the second round of questioning. Police resumed their questioning of appellant the first thing in the morning after, the night before, they had already questioned appellant, had already asked appellant to take a polygraph examination, and had continued to question his girlfriend Stroman throughout the night. In harmony with established Pennsylvania law, this Court should hold that because <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not properly given, the inculpatory statement police took from appellant must be suppressed and appellant must be awarded a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

The majority is impressed by the officers’ assurance that appellant was “free to leave,” their “offer” to appellant of a ride home in a police car, their claim that the second round of questioning was designed only to “reconcile discrepancies” between statements given by Blannon and appellant’s girlfriend, and .the assertion that appellant was not a suspect until police “noted” discrepancies in his state<a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>ments after the second round of questioning. The majority’s reliance on these self-serving statements, however, is entirely misplaced. For the alleged purposes of the police are not controlling under Pennsylvania’s established test of “custodial interrogation.” What matters instead is the perception of the suspect at the time of interrogation.

In my view, this record certainly suggests that, from the time police first arrived at the home where the older daughter of one of the victims lived and where appellant was visiting, appellant could reasonably believe his freedom of action was being restricted. It was the police who suggested that appellant and his companions go to police headquarters to talk about the victims. Police took appellant and the companions to police headquarters in police cars. And, the owner of the house implicated Blannon and appellant in the killings.</p>
