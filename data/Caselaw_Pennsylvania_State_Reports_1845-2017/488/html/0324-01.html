On appeal from that order, this Court held that 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1311 (Supp.1979-80) requires “the initial determination of the presence or absence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in a jury trial for murder be made <em>by the jury </em>after it has convicted the defendant of murder of the first degree.” [Emphasis in original.] <em>Bullock, </em><a href="/pa/471/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="471 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="1725176" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0292-01">supra,</a> 471 Pa. at 303, 370 A.2d at 314.
