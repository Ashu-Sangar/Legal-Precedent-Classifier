After being committed to a state hospital for evaluation and treatment, and after an extension of that commitment order, appellant was, in lieu of a sentence of incarceration, ordered to undergo two' consecutive terms of probation totaling 19 years and to be recommitted to the state hospital and detained there until cured of alcoholism. At the sentencing hearing, the court specifically cautioned appellant against continuing to consume alcohol and further warned appellant that a substantial term of imprisonment could result from his failure to comply with said prohibition against the use of alcohol.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Appellant was charged with rape, simple assault, aggravated assault, terroristic threats, and recklessly endangering another person. Following a preliminary hearing on these charges, appellant was bound over for grand jury action, and a probation violation hearing was held. At that hearing, appellant admitted that he had not followed the alcohol treatment program arranged for him by his probation officer, that he had resumed his drinking habits, that he had spent the twelve hours which preceded the rape drinking alcoholic beverages with the man who committed the rape and who appellant knew was wanted on murder charges, and that he was present throughout the commission of the rape. Appellant, however, claimed that he was too intoxicated to prevent the crimes, and that he only simulated intercourse with the victim because he feared for his own safety. The court found that probation had not been effective in accomplishing rehabilitation, revoked the probation and sentenced appellant to consecutive <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>terms of incarceration of five to fifteen years and two to four years.</p>
