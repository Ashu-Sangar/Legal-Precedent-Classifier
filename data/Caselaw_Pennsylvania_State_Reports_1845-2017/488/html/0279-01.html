Appellant was originally tried before a jury and convicted of murder, assault and battery and various weapons offenses in December, 1973. On appeal, we reversed and remanded for a new trial by Order of Court dated January 29, 1976. See, <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant was subsequently retried and convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree of one victim and aggravated assault on another victim. Post verdict motions were denied and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed upon the murder conviction, with a concurrent sentence of five to ten years imprisonment imposed upon the conviction for assault. This appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

We find no merit to the latter and we are unable to adequately consider appellant’s first argument without an additional finding of fact by the lower court. Accordingly, we remand.</p>

Appellant stood by the door with a gun in his hand and yelled, “Where’s Boatwright?” At that point, Samuel Hill, one of the patrons in the Club, walked over to appellant to talk to him, whereupon appellant shot him in the back. Walter Boatwright then ran to the front of the bar. Appellant shot Boatwright in the head, then pulled the fallen man up by the collar and shot him again in the neck. The appellant turned from his dead victim (Boatwright) and fired the now-empty weapon once more at Hill before fleeing. Although partially paralyzed, Hill survived to testify against appellant at his trial.</p>

The trial judge indicated that he permitted the testimony, not because he believed “that [Ms. McClonton was] testifying from corrupt motives, [but because] there [was] some question as to [her] accuracy and some question as to whether [her testimony] was recently fabricated, meaning that [she] recently reviewed it and made up something without much accuracy.” (N.T. 8/4/76 at 16). Moreover, the prior consonant statement was admitted only for rehabilitation purposes and not to corroborate Ms. McClonton’s testimony. The trial judge made clear to the jury by instructing them prior to the introduction of the prior consonant statement that they were to consider the evidence solely for the purpose of rehabilitating Ms. McClonton and <em>“not </em>for the purpose of proving the truth of the testimony that she gave.” (N.T. 8/3/76 at 94). Thus the limited admissibility of the evidence was properly explained to the jury. As such, we find that the testimony was properly admitted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6</a>

Ms. McClonton was not asked by either defense counsel or counsel for the prosecution for an explanation as to why her present testimony varied in several places from her testimony at the previous trial. We note, however, the significant time lapse between the incident (August 1972), the first trial (December 1973), and the second trial (July 1976) and recognize the accompanying probability of a lapse of the witness’ memory. As for Ms. McClonton’s prior statement to Detective LaRue that she knew nothing about the crime and her subsequent statement to Detective Richardson (as well as her testimony at trial) that she saw appellant shoot Boatwright and Hill, the reason for the inconsistency was explained by Detective Richardson. Apparently, Ms. McClonton had herself had some dealings with the police prior to the incident herein. As a result of this prior involvement, she was apparently willing to talk to Detective Richardson but was reluctant to talk to other detectives. Thus, this explains why she would tell Detective LaRue that she knew nothing about the crime, but was willing to make a statement to Detective Richardson.</p>
