In the early decades of the nineteenth century, concerted employee activities in support of demands for higher wages and better working conditions were met with criminal prosecution as common law conspiracies. In the latter part of the century and in the early years of the twentieth century, unionization was combatted by civil injunctions.

In my view, the crucial issue is not, as the majority suggests, whether appellants’ action requires a Pennsylvania tribunal to determine that appellants had a meritorious federal unfair labor practice charge against the employer. Rather, the issue of preemption here more properly turns upon whether appellants have stated a federal unfair labor practice against appellees.</p>

Treasure Lake discharged appellants on May 23, 1969 and fourteen other employees one month later. In September, 1969, appellees filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of Treasure Lake employees: The NLRB held in the employees’ favor and ordered the Treasure Lake employees reinstated, with back pay.</p>

Appellants allege that they asked appellees to add their names to the list of aggrieved parties and that appellees misrepresented appellants would be included in the action brought before the NLRB, but then “did nothing to press [appellants’] claims.” Though ambiguous, appellants’ allegations (and prayer for relief) suggest both intentional and negligent misrepresentations. Appellants sought damages equalling the back pay they claim would have been awarded had they been included in the NLRB action, along with punitive damages. Appellants neither joined nor pursued an independent action against their employer Treasure Lake.</p>
