The appellants complained that section 402 of the General County Assessment Law, Act of May 22, 1933, P.L. 853, art. IV, § 402, as <em>amended, </em>Act of June 24, 1976, P.L. 422, No. 100, § 1, 72 P.S. § 5020-402 (Supp.1979-80) [hereinafter; Act 100], was violated by levying taxes on a revised or increased assessment of one assessment district before a revised assessment of the entire county was completed and certified.</p>
    <p id="b87-6" data-blocks='[["BL_87.7",87,[184,1270,1151,795]]]'>The appellees filed preliminary objections to the complaint alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellants failed to pursue available statutory remedies. Appellees cited the General County Assessment Law, Act of May 22, 1933, P.L. 853, art. I, <em>as amended, </em>72 P.S. §§ 5020-1 <em>et seq.; </em>the Second Class County Assessment Law, Act of June 21, 1939, P.L. 626, <em>as amended, </em>72 P.S. §§ 5452.1 <em>et seq.; </em>and, the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, Act of June 18,1923, P.L. 840, <em>as amended, </em>12 P.S. §§ 831 <em>et seq., </em>as the statutory remedies available. The trial court overruled the preliminary objections and directed the appellees to answer on the merits. An appeal was filed in the Commonwealth Court and that court entered a per curiam order which vacated the order of the Court of Common Pleas and dismissed the action. We granted allocatur.</p>

However, a study of the complaint <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>is persuasive that, before relief could be granted on the basis thereof, it was necessary for the complaining taxpayers to establish that the challenged tax levy violated provisions of Act 100, supra. In a related action, the Commonwealth Court and this Court have both ruled that Act 100, supra, does not apply to the tax levy involved.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> That ruling is binding here. Under the circumstances, the present action cannot be sustained and further proceedings would be an unnecessary burden on an already overly-burdened court system.</p>

No matter how the underlying merits of this case are resolved, this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction to dismiss this action in equity.

Accordingly, I would vacate the decree of the Commonwealth Court and remand this case to the common pleas court.</p>
