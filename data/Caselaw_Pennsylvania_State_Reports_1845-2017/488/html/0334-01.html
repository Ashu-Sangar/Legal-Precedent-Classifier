Sterling, </em><a href="/pa-super/241/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="241 Pa.

There, a controlled delivery was arranged of a package containing a pitcher concealing a large quantity of hashish, addressed to Mrs. Donald Farr, in care of the defendant and his wife. When the police searched the apartment pursuant to a warrant they found the package <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>unopened. Except for an ambiguous postcard sent earlier by the sender of the package promising “souvenirs,” there was no evidence that the defendant knew what was inside the package. The defendant’s conviction for possession with intent to deliver was reversed on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of a conscious exercise of dominion over the controlled substance. The court stated that “[ajbsent some proof of appellant’s conscious exercise of dominion over the hashish — not just exercise of dominion over the package or the pitcher — the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction under § 780-113(a)(30) of the Controlled Substance Act.”</p>

We do not believe this evidence could reasonably support an inference of appellant’s knowledge sufficient to sustain a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree with the dissenting judges in the Superior Court that the <em>Sterling </em>holding is manifestly correct and should be followed here. Similarly, we fail to see a basis for the Superior Court majority’s conclusion that the facts of the present case and those of <em>Sterling </em>are “distinguishable in several important ways,” mandating a contrary result.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Rather, appellant testified that he and his brother had arranged for appellant to accept deliveries of pottery, antiques and tapestry. Appellant testified he never knew that his brother was involved in drugs until after appellant’s arrest and that he did not discuss the presence of drugs in the pottery with his brother until several days after his arrest. Assuming, as we must, that this testimony was <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>disbelieved by the jury, still all the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was insufficient to support a conviction. Indeed, the Commonwealth presented no evidence that prior packages received by appellant from his brother contained contraband, or that drugs were ever discussed by appellant and his brother during their visit.
