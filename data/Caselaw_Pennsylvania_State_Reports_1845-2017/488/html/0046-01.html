      <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>The facts are as follows. Appellant, Leonard P. Flack, is a district justice of the peace for Magisterial District 38-2-20 located in Norristown, Montgomery County. Appellant began his first term of office on January 5, 1970, and commenced his second term on January 5, 1976. During his tenure in office, appellant’s salary has been computed successively under the Magisterial Districts Act, Act of December 2, 1968, P.L. 1131, § 5, 42 P.S. § 1305, repealed by the Magisterial District Reform Act, Act of July 15, 1976, P.L. 1014, § 701(a)(2), 42 P.S. § 2701(a)(2), and the Magisterial District Reform Act, Act of July 15, 1976, P.L. 1014, § 206, 42 P.S. § 2206. Under both acts, the salary of a district justice was computed partly by reference to the population of his magisterial district. Hence, during appellant’s first term of office, his salary, which is not part of the instant controversy, was $1,022.23 per month. This sum was determined on the basis of an annual salary of $6,000 plus forty cents for each resident of his district. The Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, on December 19, 1969, had certified that appellant’s district contained a population of 15,667, and his salary was computed accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b118-5" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[236,1471,1157,364]]]'>On January 4, 1971, this court ordered a recertification of the population of all magisterial districts using figures derived from the 1970 United States census. The recertification figures for Montgomery County were approved on January 31, 1975, and became effective the first Monday of January, 1976, coinciding with the new terms of all district justices, including appellant, elected in 1975.</p>

At the commencement of appellant’s second term the population of his district was 12,723. Notwithstanding the population decline in his district, appellant, for the first six months of his second term, continued receiving a salary based upon the older, higher population figure.</p>

This increase, too, was computed using the pre-1970 population figure.</p>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[189,631,1148,531]]]'>The error in the recertification was discovered and a corrected recertification which included the corrected population figure for appellant’s district, was issued on July 1, 1976. Later, the fact that an incorrect salary had been paid to appellant was also discovered, and, on December 6, 1976, the Court Administrator, one of the appellees herein, informed appellant that he would, in the future, be paid the lower salary which recertification demanded, and directed that appellant undertake to return the overpayments he had received from the beginning of his second term.</p>
    <p id="b119-6" data-blocks='[["BL_119.6",119,[189,1188,1149,580]]]'>Appellant filed a petition for review in the nature of mandamus in the Commonwealth Court, claiming that the actions of the Court Administrator violated Article V, § 16 and Article III, § 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In denying appellant’s motion for summary judgment, and entering judgment for appellees, the Commonwealth Court held that appellees had violated neither constitutional provision. The court also held appellant was liable only for those overpayments made after July 1,1976, the date on which the corrected recertification was issued. Appellant appeals the finding of constitutionality.</p>
    <p id="b119-7" data-blocks='[["BL_119.7",119,[190,1793,1147,141]]]'>Appellant relies upon Article V, § 16 of the Pennsylvania Constitution for support. That constitutional provision mandates:</p>

And it is appellees who are charged with the duty to follow the directive of the legislature. <em>Quail v.

It is, of course, true that in fulfillment of their obligation appellees may not act in contravention of constitutional proscription, that is, they may not diminish the salaries of judicial officers during those officers’ current terms.</p>
    <p id="b120-7" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[234,993,1158,686]]]'>But the instant case presents no such diminution of salary. The salaries of <em>all </em>justices of the peace were modified at the commencement of their January, 1975 terms. It was only by virtue of administrative oversight or clerical error that appellant’s salary was not modified at that time and that he continued to receive a salary <em>not authorized by law, </em>that is, higher than that to which he was entitled. The constitutional provision here at issue is intended to preserve the independence of the judiciary. <em>Flack v. Barbieri, </em>32 Pa.Cmwlth. 170, <a href="/citations/?q=378%20A.2d%20500" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="378 A.2d 500">378 A.2d 500</a> (1977).

The majority offers neither an explanation for this blatant departure from prior law or a demonstration of the error of our previous decisions. To the contrary, it ignores the well settled principles of law in this area, and attempts to justify the result reached on the basis of an “administrative oversight or clerical error.” Although, as a result of the unique circumstances of this case, I can agree with the order entered by the Commonwealth Court; I am compelled to express my strong disagreement with the reasoning employed by the majority.</p>

Flack, has served as a district justice of the peace in the City of Norristown since 1970. His magisterial district has been, and is designated as No. 38-2-20. For his first term in office<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> District Justice Flack received an annual salary as computed under the formula established by section 5 of the Magisterial Districts Act then in effect. Act of December 2, 1968, P.L. 1131 § 5.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Under that formula, the District Justice was to receive an annual salary of $6,000 plus $.40 for each resident of the district. The Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, on December 19, 1969, had certified that the population of appellant's magisterial district was 15,667. At the time of his election for the new term commencing the first Monday of January, 1976 and at the time that he took office, the December, 1969 population certification for his district remained in effect. Under this formulation, he received an annual salary of $12,266.80 which amounted to monthly payments in the amount of $1,022.23. A recertification of his district took effect July 1, 1976. This recertification showed that the population of the district had fallen to <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>12,723 residents. It is conceded that this recertification was based upon the decennial census of 1970. Using the formulation under the- former Magisterial Districts Act and applying it to the new population figure, appellant would receive an annual salary of $11,089.20 which represents monthly payments of $924.10. It is therefore clear that an attempt to apply the former Magisterial Districts Act formulation, using the recertified population figure, would have represented a reduction in the salary that the appellant had previously received during his first term. The question simply stated is whether or not the attempt of July 1, 1976 to adjust the salary of appellant constituted an impermissible <em>diminution </em>of salary during his term in office.</p>

Article 3, § 27 provides: “No law shall extend the term of any public officer, or increase or diminish his salary or emoluments, after his election or appointment.” This limitation of legislative authority has retained the identical language as it first appeared in Article III, § 13 of the 1874 Constitution. This prohibition against the diminution of salary during the term of office also appears in the new Judiciary Article of 1968, Art. 5, § 16. Article 5, § 16 provides in pertinent part: “Justices, judges and justices of the peace shall be compensated by the Commonwealth as provided by law. Their compensation shall not be diminished during their terms of office, unless by law applying generally to all salaried officers of the Commonwealth.”</p>

At first blush there might be some appeal to an argument that where the amount of compensation is dependent upon a formulae established before the term of office and the formula is not disturbed during the term, but a diminution occurs as a result of the application of that formula the constitutional prohibition is not disturbed.
