Mr. Cleveland was roused from sleep at approximately 6:30 a. m., December 21, 1974, by noises he described at trial as: “bang, oh; bang, oh; bang, bang, oh, oh.” Following these sounds, Mr. Cleveland left his bed and listened at his closed bedroom door for further sounds. He testified that he heard footsteps travel-ling down the hallway of his apartment, from the front living room to the bathroom across the hall from his own bedroom; that he heard running water in the bathroom; that as the water was running, he heard knocking and shouts of “Police” at the apartment’s side and rear doors; that the water was shut off and that he heard the person in <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>the bathroom walk toward the living room and en route slide a metal instrument across the hallway floor towards the hallway closet. Mr. Cleveland, correctly surmising that the person had gone back into the front living room, then left his bedroom and opened the side entrance to the apartment letting police officers into the apartment. The officers found appellant in the front living room and immediately arrested him after finding the victim lying in another bedroom in the apartment bleeding profusely from several gunshot wounds.</p>
    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[206,881,1153,1169]]]'>A search of the apartment by the police netted a .22 calibre weapon on the floor of the hallway closet containing five spent cartridges and four live rounds. All of these cartridges were imprinted with a “D” on the rim. A ballistics expert testified that this mark identified the rounds as being manufactured by the Dominion Company of Canada. The police later found 16 identical live shells in appellant’s apartment after a search pursuant to a search warrant. This type of ammunition with the “D” marking is unique to the Dominion Company and is not found in general circulation within the United States. Although fragments of bullets were removed from the victim’s body and the wall of the murder scene, the fragments were so distorted that ballistics tests could not positively prove that they had been fired from the weapon found in the closet. There was no doubt that they had been fired from a .22 calibre weapon. Tests indicated that the weapon had been wiped clean of fingerprints. Mr. Cleveland testified that neither he nor his nephew owned the revolver and that he had never seen it before. Appellant denied that the weapon was his, but admitted that he had possessed the .22 calibre ammunition found in his apartment by police.</p>

The medical examiner testified <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>that in his expert opinion the victim could not have died by accidental or suicidal means. Bloodstains were found on appellant’s pants, although medical tests could not determine whether they were of the same type as that of the victim.</p>

He stated that he was a friend of the victim’s and that he did not kill him. He testeified that he was not awakened by the shots but rather by the pounding on the door by the police. He contended that the bloodstains on his pants were caused when he bent down, to look at the victim’s body after his arrest, or alternatively, that he had been beaten by one of the arresting officers.</p>

First, appellant admitted his presence at the scene of the crime. Second, the two doors to the apartment were bolted from the inside and the apartment building had been surrounded by police so that the killer was still inside the apartment when the police entered. Third, Mr. Cleveland’s testimony indicated that there was only one other person in the apartment moving; that person being the appellant. Fourth, appellant possessed the same rare type of ammunition in his own apartment as was contained in the weapon found at the crime scene. The jury could properly have concluded from this evidence that appellant had killed the victim with malice aforethought.</p>
