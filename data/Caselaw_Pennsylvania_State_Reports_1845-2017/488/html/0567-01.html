Appellant instantly contends that the court erred by improperly accepting various exhibits offered to establish the claim and that the claimant failed to prove the claim against the estate by clear, direct, precise and convincing evidence. We find all of these arguments to be unimpressive and affirm for the reasons that follow.</p>
    <p id="b640-5" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[293,722,1155,681]]]'>The decedent during his lifetime was the secretary of the Indyk Brothers Construction Company (Construction Company) which engaged in road building and earth-moving activities for governmental and private entities. In the course of its business, the Construction Company would execute surety bonds to guarantee payment of materials, supplies and/or completion of the various projects. The instant claim arises from surety bonds furnished by National Union for the benefit of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding certain highway construction contracts which Construction Company had agreed to perform. The decedent executed an agreement, in his individual capacity, to indemnify National Union in the event of a breach.</p>
    <p id="b640-6" data-blocks='[["BL_640.5",640,[292,1423,1156,947]],["BL_641.1",641,[188,354,1150,306]]]'>The original construction, performance and material bonds were executed by National Union in the early 1960’s. In 1965, the Construction Company defaulted on certain construction projects and National Union, as surety, elected to take over and complete the commitments, using Construction Company to perform the work. The total net loss to the surety resulting from the default was in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). In 1968, National Union was acquired by American International Group (Group) and the records of National Union as to this claim were transferred to New York, New York, then to San Francisco, California, then returned to New York City and eventually returned to Pittsburgh where they had been originally kept by National Union. As stated, National Union submitted a claim against the estate of the decedent, which had a balance for distribution of approximately twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,-000.00). After hearing all of the evidence, the chancellor ordered that National Union should share in the balance for <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>distribution and the court en banc dismissed the exceptions and a final decree was entered. The executors of the estate appealed to this Court pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31,1970, P.L. 678, No. 223, art. II, § 202(3) now codified at 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 722(3) (1979 Pamphlet).</p>
    <p id="b641-4" data-blocks='[["BL_641.4",641,[190,684,1150,512]]]'>The first assignment of error offered by appellant is that the chancellor erred in admitting into evidence the business records of National Union under the Uniform Business Records As Evidence Act, Act of May 4, 1939, P.L. 42, No. 35, § 2; 28 P.S. § 91b (1958).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The crux of appellant’s argument is that the witness who sought to authenticate the records had no personal knowledge of National Union’s business records prior to 1969 and was, therefore not qualified to testify as to their preparation or to provide a proper foundation for their introduction.</p>

Today, instead of a single shopkeeper who transacts and records the sale, there are a myriad of sales girls, department heads, bookkeepers, etc., etc., etc., who compile summaries and consolidate the <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>records made by others. Quite often different individuals have personal knowledge of the various phases of a transaction so that no one individual has knowledge of the entire transaction. In addition, the frequent turnover of personnel often makes it impossible to identify the employee — if it were only one — who took part in the transaction. Under these circumstances, to require the entrant to have personal knowledge of the event recorded, and to require proof of the identity of the recorder, would exclude almost all evidence concerning the activities of large business organizations — a result diametrically opposed to the purpose and spirit of the [Uniform] Business Records as Evidence Act.

He testified that although he had no personal knowledge of National Union’s record keeping prior to 1969, upon examination he found that these records had been kept in conformity with the record keeping practices of the insurance industry. Moreover, governmental regulations had been promulgated covering the keeping of these records and that National Union’s records were in full compliance with those regulations. The governmental regulations required that the entries by made by persons having knowledge of the transactions to which the particular entry relates as a regular business practice. From 1969 when National Union <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>was acquired by Group, the witness has been personally in charge of these records.

All of these arguments are unpersuasive. First, it is urged that since the claim is based upon bonds which were furnished regarding certain highway construction contracts, the failure to offer into evidence the bonds or contracts was fatal to appellee’s case. The instant claim against the estate was based upon an indemnity agreement executed by the decedent in his individual capacity. Thus the failure to introduce into evidence the bonds and/or ccontracts that occasioned the execution of the indemnity agreement is obviously not a fatal defect in the proof of the claim. The indemnity agreement signed by deceased in his individual capacity was admitted into evidence. Further the record is clear that there was a default causing loss to National Union for which it was entitled to recover under the terms of the indemnity agreement relied upon. Second, appellant attacks upon the attestation of the Notary Public, the admission of copies of the original documents, the use of a summary ledger sheet as an aid during the witness’s <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>testimony are all totally devoid of merit and do not require discussion.</p>
