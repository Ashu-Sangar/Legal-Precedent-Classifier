Appellant was arrested at 8:10 a. m. on May 10, 1975 and arrived at the Police Administration building at 8:45 a. m. At 9:05 a. m., appellant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and waived his right to remain silent and his right to counsel. From 9:05 a. m.-9:30 a. m., Officer Michael Gannon interrogated appellant. During this interval, appellant gave a partially incriminating statement, admitting to being with the girls the prior evening and to having intercourse with them. At 9:30 a. xn., appellant informed Officer Gannon that he would tell the whole truth after he talked to his girlfriend.</p>
    <p id="b517-6" data-blocks='[["BL_517.6",517,[220,1299,1151,842]]]'>Appellant was then taken to the polygraph room where he stayed from 9:40 a. m. to 11:07 a. m., but no polygraph was administered. An attorney, Neil Carver, arrived at that time at the request of appellant’s family to consult with appellant. From 11:07 a. m. to 11:25 a. m., appellant was allowed to use the restroom facilities, given water and then left alone in the interrogation room. At 11:25 a. m. until 12:15 p. m., attorney Carver consulted with appellant, and advised appellant not to make any further statements. Thereafter, attorney Carver informed Officer Gannon that he had explained to appellant his right to remain silent. According to attorney Carver’s testimony, and that of Officer Gannon, attorney Carver did not tell the police not to further interrogate appellant, nor did he instruct them that he desired to be present during further interrogation of appellant.</p>
    <p id="b517-7" data-blocks='[["BL_517.7",517,[219,2160,1148,204]],["BL_518.1",518,[260,325,1154,582]]]'>From 12:15 p. m. until 12:30 p. m., appellant was left alone in the interrogation room, and he again was accorded restroom privileges and given water. At 12:30 p. m., Officer Gannon dialed the phone number of appellant’s girlfriend, <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>with whom he lived, and appellant spoke with her until 12:35 p. m. Appellant was then left alone until 12:55 p. m. Appellant then banged on the door of the interrogation room and, when Officer Gannon responded, appellant said he wanted to tell him what happened. Appellant again waived his right to remain silent, and rendered a second statement to police. He also expressed a willingness to make this statement without the presence of an attorney.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> This statement was much longer than the first. Appellant detailed the rapes, beatings and his participation in the burnings, as well as his subsequent incriminating conduct.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[260,929,1154,409]]]'>The suppression court further found that, at all times relevant to the giving of the statements, appellant was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs, was not tired, made no request that was refused, was fully able to understand his interrogators and to communicate without any difficulty. Attorney Carver also testified that he had thoroughly explained appellant’s rights to him and that appellant understood them.</p>
    <p id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.6",518,[261,1380,1156,304]]]'>The suppression court concluded that appellant gave the statements freely and voluntarily, and that the waiver of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel was made knowingly, voluntarily and with full comprehension of his rights.

      <em>Mercier </em>offers appellant no solace, however, as the record demonstrates without contradiction that 1) appellant <em>never </em>asserted his right to remain silent, nor did attorney Carver assert such right on his behalf and 2) appellant initiated the questioning which resulted in his second statement, as he previously said he would after he had discussed the matter with his girlfriend.

Those accounts of Stickle’s and Jacquot’s court proceedings were factual and unemotional, and did no more than recite events which were a matter of public record. The article concerning the suppressed confession was similarly factual, unemotional and a matter of public record. The contents of the confession were not revealed— only the fact of this Court’s affirmance of the suppression. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v.

During trial, Officer Winston testified Beverly Rodenbaugh had identified a photograph of appellant while in the emergency room of Roxborough Hospital. The trial judge, the Honorable Edwin S. Maimed, then handed a plain manila folder to Officer Winston which contained exhibit “C-32”, a police photograph of appellant. Officer Winston, keeping the photograph out of sight of the jury in order to prevent them from discovering it was a police photograph, then identified “C-32” as the photograph shown to Miss Rodenbaugh.</p>

His argument is that the “secretive manner” in which “C-32” was displayed during trial, the fact that police obtained the photograph within a short time after Miss Rodenbaugh named appellant as one of her assailants, and the fact that “there was no suggestion that the photograph came from a school yearbook or from the possession of acquaintances or any innocent source,” could only lead the jury to conclude “C-32” had been obtained from police files.

The first occurred when the defense counsel handed appellant an unloaded gun for identification. Although the assistant district attorney was aware the gun was unloaded, he stated for all to hear “don’t leave that gun up there. Show it to him but don’t leave it up there.” Defense counsel moved for a mistrial on the grounds this statement was intended to paint appellant as a dangerous man. The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial, but admonished the prosecutor, and carefully instructed the jury to disregard his comment. While this Court does not condone the prosecutor’s court-room theatrics, his remark was an isolated one occurring during the course of a fairly conducted month-long trial and certainly did not rise to the level of impropriety which would justify a mistrial. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The very presence of counsel during custodial interrogation is a bulwark against the compulsion of the surroundings and provides a credible witness <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>for the defense if there is a subsequent issue as to the circumstances surrounding the questioning.”</blockquote>

      <em>Commonwealth v. Hawkins, </em>supra, 448 Pa. at 222-23, 292 A.2d at 310 (Nix, J., joined by Roberts and Manderino, JJ., dissenting).</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[248,621,1154,462]]]'>There may also be circumstances where an accused, although represented by counsel, spontaneously volunteers statements to the police. And, as our prior cases have held, such statements should not be excluded. <em>Commonwealth v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/481/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="481 Pa. 217" data-case-ids="1747280" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0217-01">481 Pa. 217</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="392 A.2d 685" data-case-ids="1747280,1747336" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0217-01,/pa/481/0216-02">392 A.2d 685</a> (1978). This case, however, clearly does not involve a spontaneous confession. Nor does the record demonstrate any other exigent circumstances which might excuse the failure to allow counsel to participate in the accused’s decision to speak.</p>
    <p id="b528-6" data-blocks='[["BL_528.6",528,[249,1102,1156,722]]]'>The majority would distinguish this case from <em>Hilliard </em>because counsel in this case did not specifically request to be present during any further interrogation. Certainly this confession could not stand if counsel had made such a request and the police had nevertheless failed to honor it. See <em>Commonwealth v. Lark, </em><a href="/pa/482/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="482 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="1749603" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0292-01">supra.</a> Still, counsel’s failure specifically to request to be present during any later interrogation is no reason to afford the appellant’s right to counsel’s presence any less protection. And in this case counsel clearly expressed to the police his instructions to appellant that the latter not make any statement. Particularly in such a circumstance I would not permit the police then to obtain a statement from appellant outside of counsel’s presence.</p>
    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.7",528,[252,1849,1153,255]]]'>Finally, I must note that if <em>Hilliard </em>is as inapposite as the majority believes, it is indeed remarkable to what length the majority goes to discredit it. Majority Opinion, ante at n.3. If the question presented in <em>Hilliard </em>is not presented here I would not indulge in such inappropriate dicta.</p>
