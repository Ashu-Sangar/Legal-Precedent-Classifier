    <p id="b210-11" data-blocks='[["BL_210.10",210,[250,1252,1155,406]]]'>Appellant, Leonard Edwards, was convicted by a jury of murder of the first degree, possessing instruments of crime and related weapons charges, and aggravated assault. Following the denial of appellant’s post-verdict motions, a sentence of death was imposed for the murder of the first degree conviction in accordance with the jury’s findings. This appeal follows,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in which appellant raises the following issues:</p>
    <p id="b210-12" data-blocks='[["BL_210.11",210,[250,1692,1152,95]]]'>1) that the trial court erred when it denied defense counsel’s request to recall appellant to the witness stand;</p>
