Appellant William Allen failed to establish that in withdrawing funds from the joint account, the donee, James Allen, Jr., “was not acting for the mutual benefit of himself and his father.” See <em>Dzierski Estate, </em><a href="/pa/449/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="449 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="1945599" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0285-01">449 Pa. 285</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20716" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="296 A.2d 716">296 A.2d 716</a> (1972).</p>
