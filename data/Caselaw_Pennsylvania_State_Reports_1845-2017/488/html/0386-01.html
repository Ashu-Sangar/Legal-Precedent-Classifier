(Troiani) is a Pennsylvania corporation which operates a luncheon and supper restaurant afloat on the Monongahela River, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County. In order to transport customers to and from the restaurant, the appellant operates a watercraft known as “The Pittsburgher,” for a charge. This watercraft is also offered for hire to conduct sightseeing tours along the Ohio, Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers, all within Allegheny County. On October 22,1975, appellant applied for a certificate of public convenience with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (Commission) authorizing them to conduct the aforementioned activities. The application was protested by Gateway Clipper, Inc. which had been previously certified by the Commission to provide “excursion” service sought by Troiani’s application. No action was taken on the application for over a year. On February 25, 1977, appellant, by letter of counsel, questioned the jurisdiction of the Commission over the application it had originally made. In the interim period, Troiani had changed counsel and new counsel maintained that the Second Class County Port Authority Act, Act of April 6, 1956, P.L. (1955) 1414, <em>as amend</em>

On March 10, 1977, Troiani instituted an action in the Commonwealth Court requesting an injunction to stay the Commission’s proceedings and for a review of the propriety of the Commission’s exercise of jurisdiction in the matter. The Commission filed preliminary objections in the form of a demurrer which were sustained by the Commonwealth Court and the petition for review was dismissed.

Proceeding from this premise, appellant argues that since the Commission’s attempt to exercise jurisdiction is clearly erroneous, the Commonwealth Court should have issued a restraining order against the Commission, pursuant to section 1111 of the Public Utility Law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a> The Commonwealth Court <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>sustained the demurrer and dismissed Troiani’s action based upon their conclusion that Troiani had failed to establish the inadequacy of its statutory remedy of appeal and also failed to demonstrate that the Commission’s assertion of jurisdiction was clearly erroneous.
