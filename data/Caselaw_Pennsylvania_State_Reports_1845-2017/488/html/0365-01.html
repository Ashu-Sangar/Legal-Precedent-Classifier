On November 19, 1979, in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Civil Division, a petition to contest the election was filed by the defeated tax-collector candidate Maria Olshansky and certain named registered electors (hereinafter called appellants) against the winning tax-collector Charles Cannon, the Montgomery County Election Board, the Whitpain Township Republican Campaign Committee and its Chairman, Charles Lewis (hereinafter called appellees). A $1,000 bond was filed by appellants on November 21, 1979. In preliminary objections, appellees alleged that appellants’ bond was improper and therefore requested the lower court to dismiss appellants’ petition to contest the election. By order dated January 2, 1980, the lower court dismissed appellants’ petition on the grounds that appellants’ bond had failed to comply with the Election Code’s bonding provision, Act of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1333, art. XVII, § 1759, as <em>affected, </em>25 P.S. § 3459 (Supp.1979-80).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellants appealed the dismissal of their petition to contest the election directly to this Court.</p>

Furthermore, this <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>Court’s decisional law has long held to the principle that the filing of a bond in substantial conformity with the Election Code’s bonding provision is also a condition of the lower court’s jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate the contest. <em>Moritz’s Contested Election, </em><a href="/pa/256/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="256 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1030709" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0537-01">256 Pa. 537</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.%201033" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="100 A. 1033">100 A. 1033</a> (1917).

    <p id="b439-4" data-blocks='[["BL_439.6",439,[211,717,1151,802]]]'>Appellants’ second contention is that the petition should be upheld on the grounds of public policy and the public interest. Specifically, appellants maintain that an election should not remain “shrouded in a cloud of doubt” thereby eroding the public’s confidence in the elective franchise. The legislature of this Commonwealth likewise shares appellants’ concern for protecting the elective franchise from erosion and debilitation. By requiring full compliance with the statutory bonding requirements — assuring, thereby, the filing of a proper, timely and sufficient bond — the legislature has protected the elective franchise from dilatory and costly disruptions which would gravely injure the elective process. Thus our holding here, in fact, enhances the elective franchise and challenges associated therewith by requiring adherence to the law by all the contestants.</p>

Appellant’s argument is without merit. A well-known rule of statutory construction, Statutory Construction Act of 1972, Act of November 25, 1970, P.L. 707, No. 230, added December 6, 1972, P.L. 1339, No. 290, § 3, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1933, provides that when a general provision in a statute shall be in irreconcilable conflict with a special provision in the same or another statute, “the special provisions shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision, . . ..” Application of this rule makes it patently clear that the Election Code’s specific bonding provision is controlling. To construe matters otherwise would result in a total emasculation of the express requirements of the bonding provision of the Election Code.
