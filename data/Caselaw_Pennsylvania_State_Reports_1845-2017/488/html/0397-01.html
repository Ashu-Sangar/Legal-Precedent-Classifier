Thereafter, on December 24, 1976, appellant’s estranged wife and male companion were shot to death by an unknown assailant. Appellant was sought for questioning in relation to the incident, but efforts to locate him by police officers and appellant’s parole agent proved to be unsuccessful. The Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (Board) then authorized the Allegheny County Detective Bureau to arrest appellant, based upon the parole agent’s belief that appellant was in violation of three conditions of parole.</p>

Appellant was given a detention hearing by a Board representative on January 17, 1977, and was ordered detained pending disposition of the criminal charges. On April 18, 1977, a jury found appellant guilty of the Firearms Law violations with which he was charged, and a sentence of two to five years imprisonment was imposed. On October 3, 1977, ap<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>pellant was transferred from a county correctional facility to the State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh, where he was confined in the Diagnostic and Classification Center. A parole revocation hearing was held on November 10, 1977, and the Board subsequently issued an order recommitting appellant as a convicted parole violator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Board also determined that the time which appellant had spent in custody, prior to sentencing on the Firearm’s conviction (January 8, 1977 to September 29, 1977), should be credited against the sentences from which appellant was paroled. Appellant filed a petition for review in Commonwealth Court seeking to set aside the Board order and challenging the validity of the arrest warrant issued by the Board. The Commonwealth Court sustained the Board’s preliminary objections and dismissed the petition. <em>Gaito v.

Section 21.1 of the Act of August 6, 1941, P.L. 861, <em>added by </em>Section 5 of the Act of August 24, 1951, P.L. 1401, <em>as amended, </em>61 P.S. § 331.21a(a), provides that a parolee who is convicted of committing a crime while on parole “shall be given no credit for the time at liberty on parole.” In <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

The <em>Thomas </em>Court noted that the Board may require a parolee who is convicted of a crime while on parole to serve the unexpired balance of his original maximum sentence. This court also noted that “a Parole Board is under no constitutional obligation to diminish the length of the sentence of a recommitted parole by a period equal to the time when the prisoner was on parole.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b472-8" data-blocks='[["BL_472.8",472,[251,1471,1154,414]]]'>Appellant remained incarcerated in the county correctional institution (and thus outside the jurisdiction of the Board) until October 3, 1977, at which time he was returned to the State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh. A final revocation of parole hearing was held on November 1, 1977. Thus, appellant was given a final revocation hearing 38 days after his return to the state correctional facility, a time clearly within the permissible 120 day period.</p>

Appellant cites no relevant authority, and we can find no authority or reasoning to support this contention even if we accept as true appellant’s allegations concerning the limitations of his privileges.

    <p id="b473-4" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[214,727,1155,1191]]]'>Appellant’s final contention is that the Board erred in determining that the time which he spent in custody, prior to sentencing on the Firearm’s violation, should be credited against the judgments of sentence imposed against him in 1959 and 1960 (original sentences). Appellant insists that the custody time in question should be applied to his new sentence (Firearm’s violation) rather than to his original sentences. Relying upon its decision in <em>Mitchell v.

Thus, if a defendant is being held in custody <em>solely </em>because of a detainer lodged by the Board and has otherwise met the requirements for bail on the new criminal charges, the time which he spent in custody shall be credited against his original sentence.
