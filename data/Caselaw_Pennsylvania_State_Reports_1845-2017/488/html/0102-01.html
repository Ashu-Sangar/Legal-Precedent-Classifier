In 1969, the legislature chose only to amend the employment, union, and housing provisions of Section 5 by adding gender as a prohibited classification. Act of July 9, 1969, P.L. 133, § 2.

Even after this implementing legislation, the legislature felt compelled to amend Section 5(i)(l) the next month by adding gender discrimination to its list of unlawful discriminatory practices. The Opinion in Support of Reversal can offer no reasonable basis consistent with the Act’s history to support the conclusion that prior to 1978 the legislature intended Section 5(i)(l) to include gender discrimination.

As noted above, section 3 provides that the opportunity to obtain the advantages of places of public accommodation, resort or amusement free from discrimination on the basis of sex is a cognizable civil right which is enforceable by the Commission. It is inconceivable that the Legislature intended to create a right enforceable by the Commission without concurrently providing the Commission a mechanism for enforcing it.
