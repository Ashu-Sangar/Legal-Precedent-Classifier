Testimony at trial revealed that on the evening of the incident, appellant stated to an acquaintance he was going “to beat up” the victim who owed him fifteen dollars ($15.00). Several witnesses to the encounter heard appellant demand money from the victim before firing the fatal shot. Trial in this case commenced on November 18, 1976 before a court sitting with a jury. After the Commonwealth rested its case, appellant elected to enter a plea of guilty to murder generally and the possession of an instrument of crime. The plea of guilt was accepted after an extensive on-the-record colloquy, and the Court proceeded to accept the testimony of the defense as to the degree of homicide involved. Upon sentencing, the court imposed concurrent sentences of two and one half years to ten years under the charge of murder of the third degree and one to two years imprisonment for the possession of an instrument of crime. No post-conviction motions were filed. This direct appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Specifically, it is charged that the record fails to show that the jurors would be chosen from members of the community.

It is suggested that a remand is in order to determine whether appellant may have been aware of his rights in this regard from some source other than the on-the-record colloquy. Such a solution is unacceptable. The purpose in requiring the promulgation of rules 320 and 321, and the requiring of the filing of a petition to withdraw the pleas was to make the procedure for a challenge to the entry of a plea in conformity with all other attacks upon the validity of a conviction.

Here appellant exercised his right to a trial by jury and a jury was selected to pass upon his guilt or innocence. He and his counsel participated in the selection of the jury impanelled and there is no suggestion that any of the jurors called or chosen were not of the vicinage. To invalidate a plea because appellant was not expressly told of this right under circumstances where it is clear that the right was fully accorded would be tantamount to placing form over substance.
