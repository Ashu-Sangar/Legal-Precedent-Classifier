Review of the Commonwealth’s banking laws discloses the Legislature’s intention to exclusively reserve regulation of the state banks to the Commonwealth. It is clear, moreover, that appellant’s Business Privilege Tax <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>impermissibly “impinges” upon this regulated area in contravention of the legislative preemption for the Commonwealth. It must be concluded therefore that appellee state banks are not taxable under appellant’s ordinance. Because federal law prohibits discrimination in taxation between state and national banks, it would be impermissible to impose this tax upon national banks while excluding state banks from such taxation. Hence, we hold that appellant’s tax is also invalid as applied to appellee national banks.</p>

There the Court found that the United States Congress had preempted the field of airport head taxes and that the federal Constitution by virtue of the supremacy clause barred state or local taxes on the same subject. Obviously, these weighty issues of federal constitutional law are not present in the instant case.
