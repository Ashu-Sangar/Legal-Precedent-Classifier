We must determine whether the initial search was lawful and, if not, whether the probable cause affidavit that included information obtained in that search nonetheless was sufficient to validate the warrant that ultimately issued. The Commonwealth, as Appellant, challenges the Order of the Superior Court, which deemed the search unlawful, reversed the trial court’s denial of suppression, and vacated sentence. We now reverse the Superior Court’s Order and reinstate the judgment of sentence.</p>

Purcell reported that a Hispanic male had arrived at the office to pick up a shipment of 20 boxes, for which a fee of over $2,000 was due on delivery. Purcell said the man, whom he described as “nervous,” was unaware that he would have to pay for the shipment. According to Purcell, the man left the premises and promised to return with the cash. Purcell became suspicious and inspected the shipment. In one of the boxes, he observed packets of marijuana wrapped in plastic.</p>

The man paid the shipping fee in cash and the boxes were loaded into the U-Haul truck he was driving. Meanwhile, police staked out the area around Yellow Freight and waited for the U-Haul truck to exit the terminal. When it did so, police stopped the truck and ordered the man from it. The man was identified as Appellee Jose Hernandez. In his possession were directions from the Philadelphia International Airport to the Yellow Freight terminal, as well as directions from Yellow Freight to an address in Reading, Pennsylvania. Police learned that Hernandez had flown from Los Angeles to <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>Philadelphia earlier that morning and paid cash for a hotel room in Bensalem with two other Hispanic males. Several hours later, Hernandez rented the U-Haul truck, also with cash, and then made his way to Yellow Freight.</p>
    <p id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[287,542,1158,739]]]'>Bensalem Police Officer Cary Palmer was involved in the investigation and had been approaching the Yellow Freight terminal in his vehicle when he observed the U-Haul track. By the time Officer Palmer arrived on the scene, other officers had stopped Hernandez and he was standing outside the track speaking to the officers. Officer Palmer approached the truck and observed that the rollup rear door was closed with a latch, but unlocked. Drawing his weapon, he opened the rollup door, entered the rear of the truck, and circled the pallet of boxes contained inside. Officer Palmer did not touch any of the boxes, but he did observe an open box and saw that it contained “a brown package, maybe 12 to 18 inches in length ... that, from [his] training and experience [he] recognized ... [as] consistent with ... some kind of narcotics.”</p>
    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.6",398,[280,1314,1156,636]]]'>According to Officer Palmer, he entered the rear of the truck “to see[,] for officers’ safety reasons[,] if there was someone else in the truck.” Following Palmer’s observation, the officers had the U-Haul truck towed to headquarters, where they continued their investigation. A canine sniff of the vehicle resulted in a positive indication for controlled substances in the rear. Further, Hernandez spoke with officers and explained that he had been paid $1,000 to travel from Los Angeles to Philadelphia to pick up the shipment. He admitted that the shipment contained controlled substances, but he refused to name the person for whom he was working because he feared for his family’s safety.</p>

The [HJispanic male was unaware that he had to pay the $2,283.83 and went outside returning with the $2,283.83 approx. 1/2 hour later.

Prior to trial, he moved to suppress admission of the drugs based on his assertion that the officers’ entry into the rear of the U-Haul truck was unlawful. The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that the limited search of the truck was proper in light of the potential danger to police. Following a guilty verdict and the imposition of a five-to-ten year prison term, Hernandez filed an appeal with the Superior Court. That Court vacated the <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>judgment of sentence, relying on its conclusion that the initial search was not authorized by law and, further, that the warrant was insufficient in setting out probable cause.

Further, Purcell was not identifying a substance in order to prove its content at trial beyond a reasonable doubt; so he need not have offered expert testimony that what he saw was marijuana. Purcell reported that he observed marijuana in plastic wrap.

Contrary to the Superi- or Court’s analysis, the warrant reveals considerably more information than Purcell’s mere “unsupported” report of contraband.

Certainly, the authority to conduct the canine sniff was not the product of the unlawful, initial search of the U-Haul truck, as canine sniffs of vehicle exteriors need only be supported by reasonable suspicion. <em>See Rogers, </em><a href="/pa/578/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="849 A.2d 1185" data-case-ids="1329441,9244120" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0127-01,/a2d/849/1185-01">849 A.2d at 1190-91</a> (exteri- or vehicle canine sniff need only be supported by reasonable suspicion, whereas canine sniff of person requires probable cause).

Police obviously must be able to negate danger to themselves and the public even if the danger is short of deadly.

Rather the instant search was conducted when police stopped a moving vehicle just thirty minutes after a reported crime. Inasmuch as the requirement of probable cause was satisfied, the exigencies of the mobility of the vehicle and of there having been inadequate time and opportunity to obtain a warrant rendered the search proper.</blockquote>
