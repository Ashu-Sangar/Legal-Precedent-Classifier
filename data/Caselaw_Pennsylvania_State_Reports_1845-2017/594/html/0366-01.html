The instant convictions arose from an incident occurring in the Germantown section of Philadelphia where appellee shot and killed Gavin Anderson, Kevin Anderson, and Otis Reynolds after appellee and his fellow conspirators had robbed the victims.

The jury found “family considerations” as a mitigating factor pursuant to the “catchall” mitigator. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8) (“Any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.”). The jury determined that the three aggravating factors outweighed the single mitigating circumstance and, accordingly, set the penalty at death for each of the murders.</p>

The PCRA court then concluded, as a matter of law, that direct appeal counsel had an opportunity to raise <em>Besch </em>on appeal, and that if appellate counsel had done so, this Court would have reversed the Pa.C.O.A. conviction. The remaining issue, according to the PCRA court, was whether appellee should be granted a new trial on all charges based on the effect of the admission of the corresponding Pa.C.O.A. evidence at trial. To aid the court in resolving this issue, it ordered an evidentiary hearing to establish what evidence, if any, would not have been admissible had there been no Pa.C.O.A. charges. Additionally, the PCRA court ordered that appellee submit a <em>“concise </em>list of all categories of evidence which he claims would have been inadmissible at trial (including citations to trial record), along with <em>succinct </em>statements in support of each claim of inadmissibility (including <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>pin-point case citations, where appropriate).” PCRA Ct.

Appellee further argued that the inadmissible evidence severely tainted the jury’s verdict on the other charges, thereby requiring a new trial. Moreover, attached to the memorandum was a signed statement from David Rudenstein, Esq., appellee’s direct appeal counsel, stating that he had no tactical or strategic reason for failing to raise a <em>Besch </em>claim on direct appeal. The Commonwealth submitted its response on August 19, 2002, primarily arguing that appellee’s claim was meritless because he failed to prove actual prejudice. Specifically, the Commonwealth maintained that the Pa.C.O.A. evidence had no bearing on the outcome of the trial because, out of the eight predicate racketeering acts offered to the jury with respect to the substantive Pa.C.O.A. charge, the jury found only three — the murder and robbery of Gavin Anderson, the murder and robbery of Kevin Anderson, and the murder and robbery of Otis Reynolds — and each of those incidents resulted in non-Pa.C.O.A. convictions as well.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Therefore, according to the Commonwealth, the jury could not have been tainted by the admission of other crimes evidence where the jury expressly found appellee criminally responsible, under <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>the Pa.C.O.A., for only the murders and robberies in which he was the actual shooter.</p>

Accordingly, there is no transcript and no record of testimony offered. In an order dated May 29, 2003, the PCRA court vacated appellee’s Pa.C.O.A. conviction, vacated the sentences for the remaining convictions, and granted a global new trial on the non-Pa.C.O.A. charges. In an accompanying opinion, the PCRA court reiterated that appellate counsel had an opportunity to raise <em>Besch </em>on direct appeal, and opined that, if he had done so, this Court would have reversed the Pa.C.O.A. conviction. The court then determined that the Pa.C.O.A. evidence admitted at trial was substantial and highly prejudicial, and opined that it would not have been admissible if not for the Pa.C.O.A. charges. This retroactively inadmissible evidence, as noted by the court, included: “testimony regarding criminal acts and conduct by others in the alleged ‘organization’ which occurred after [appellee] was incarcerated; and evidence of gun transactions, drug activity, robberies and other murders, including a murder for which [appellee] had been acquitted.” PCRA Ct. Op., 5/29/03, at 3. The PCRA court noted that the resulting and complicated issue was whether the admission of the Pa.C.O.A. evidence, now rendered inadmissible by <em>Besch, </em>required a new trial on all the charges even though <em>Besch </em>did not directly affect those charges. The court concluded with a peremptory view grounded in the capital nature of the case, opining that: “[u]ntil and unless the Supreme Court instructs otherwise, we believe that a conviction resulting in a sentence of death must not be based upon highly inflammatory evidence that was only admissible by virtue of the serendipitous timing of a pending challenge to the [Pa.C.O.A.].” <em>Id. </em>at 3-4, <a href="/pa/544/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="674 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="463578,7862507" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0001-01,/a2d/674/0655-01">674 A.2d 655</a>.</p>

First, the Commonwealth maintains that appellee’s current Besch-related ineffectiveness claim is previously litigated because this Court decided on direct appeal that the evidence was sufficient to support appellee’s Pa. C.O.A. conviction. Commonwealth’s Brief at 14-16 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(3) (PCRA petitioner must plead and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his claim has not been previously litigated in order to garner relief)); <em>see Carson, </em><a href="/pa/590/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="913 A.2d 220" data-case-ids="3851924,8436764" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0501-01,/a2d/913/0220-01">913 A.2d at 234</a>. The issue addressed by this Court on direct appeal, however, is clearly different from the instant ineffectiveness claim and, thus, the present claim is not previously litigated. <em>Commonwealth v.

Specifically, on direct appeal, appellee challenged certain testimony by David Lee, who had sold guns and other weapons to appellee and co-defendant Wilson from 1988 to 1990. Appellee argued that Lee’s testimony of gun sales made to co-defendant Wilson in 1990 was irrelevant to any of the crimes charged because appellee was incarcerated at that time and was no longer a part of the gang’s conspiracy. This Court determined that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the 1990 gun sales against appellee, but found the error harmless. Notably, we highlighted Lee’s testimony as to his direct dealings with appellee regarding the purchase of an AK-47 assault rifle and hand grenades, and James White’s <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> testimony that money acquired from robbing and killing drug dealers was used to buy guns and other weapons paraphernalia. This Court concluded that this properly admitted evidence overwhelmingly <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>established appellee’s guilt of violating the Pa.C.O.A. <em>Williams, </em>720 A.2d at 688.

Citing <em>Yacoubian </em>and other Superior Court case law, the Commonwealth maintains that the governing law at the time of appellee’s 1993 trial was that the Pa.C.O.A. encompassed wholly illegitimate enterprises. The Commonwealth also highlights the General Assembly’s swift reaction to <em>Besch </em>by amending the Pa.C.OA. in 1996 to explicitly include both legal and illegal organizations. The Commonwealth argues that because the 1996 amendment was made effective immediately, the law at the time appellee filed his direct appeal brief (which was before <em>Shaffer </em>was decided) was that wholly illegitimate enterprises could be prosecuted under the Pa.C.O.A. Therefore, the Commonwealth argues, counsel cannot be found ineffective for failing to raise <em>Besch </em>on direct appeal when case law at the time of trial and during direct appeal supported appellee’s Pa.C.O.A. conviction.

Therefore, according to appellee, this Court should not conduct this discretionary analysis for the trial court in the first instance.

In addressing this issue, the PCRA court engaged in a cursory analysis, focusing in large part on the fact that this was a capital case. The court failed to address the categories of evidence cited by appellee or any of the Commonwealth’s arguments that the Pa.C.O.A. evidence was admissible for other valid, independent purposes.

The fact that we have determined that there is a reasonable probability that appellee’s Pa.C.OA. conviction would have been set aside on direct appeal if counsel had invoked <em>Beseh </em>and therefore counsel was ineffective, does not mean that Ncse/i-derivative or <em>Besch-t&amp;ngential </em>claims would have been entertained on direct review, if counsel had raised them. <em>Beseh </em>did not address derivative evidentiary claims, nor did the majority in that case grant a global new trial. Thus, direct appeal counsel could not invoke <em>Beseh, </em>or any other case for that matter, as controlling support for a claim that appellee was entitled to a global new trial on the non-Pa. C.O.A. charges, based on the spillover prejudicial effect of Pa.C.O.A. evidence. Furthermore, although appellate counsel theoretically could have requested consideration of the waived, derivative evidentiary claim under relaxed waiver, it is entirely speculative whether the Court would have engaged in such review for, as we have noted above, the doctrine was discretionary. <em>Sneed, supra; Duffey, supra. </em>In this regard, it is significant that the derivative evidentiary claim is fact-specific, and would have been unsupported by any trial level record devoted to the issue in that guise — indeed, the PCRA court had to hold an evidentiary hearing and required briefing in order to decide the claim.

Such a layered claim is subject to the <em>Strickland/ Pierce </em>test as to each attorney, including its prejudice <em>requirement </em>— ie., appellee at this stage of the proceeding has the burden of showing that, if a <em>Besch </em>objection had been raised by counsel at the trial level, the evidence he now complains of would have been excluded as a matter of law, and there is a reasonable probability that the failure to exclude it essentially caused the verdicts for murder, robbery, and conspiracy.

Appellee claims that the “someone” referred to in the testimony was appellee, albeit he concedes that his name was not explicitly identified by James White and was redacted in co-defendant Bennett’s statement to police, which was admitted at trial. Nevertheless, appellee maintains that it was clear to the jury that the unidentified “someone” was appellee. Appellee then argues that this evidence was inadmissible because: he was previously acquitted of any involvement in the attempted robbery of David Perez and resulting Marrón Jenrette murder; and, these crimes were not alleged as predicate racketeering acts against him.</p>

I also join in the majority’s conclusion that trial and direct appeal counsel were not ineffective for failing to raise Besch-related claims, and in the majority’s subsequent finding that the admission of the evidence challenged by appellee “cannot be deemed prejudicial where the jury expressly found appellee criminally responsible for only the murders and robberies in which he was the actual shooter.” M.O. at 396, 936 A.2d at 30. As the majority notes, “the jury obviously rejected the evidence submitted in support of [the five unfounded predicate] acts.” <em>Id. </em>As a result of the jury’s acquit<a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>ting appellee of crimes in which he was not the shooter, I agree that appellee was not prejudiced by the admission of evidence unrelated to the murders of Gavin Anderson, Kevin Anderson, and Otis Reynolds. Because I believe that this would be a sufficient basis upon which to find a lack of <em>Strickland/Pierce </em>prejudice, I see no need to address the specific admissibility of each piece of evidence challenged by appellee. Accordingly, I decline to join that portion of the majority opinion.</p>
