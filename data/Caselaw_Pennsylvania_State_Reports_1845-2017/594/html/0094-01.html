The court further explained that interest owed on a provider’s bill becomes part of the bill itself. <em>Collins v.

In doing so, it dismissed Appellant’s argument that 75 Pa.C.S. § 1797 provides the right of action for the interest accrued under section 1716. <em>Schappell v. Motorists Mut. Ins.

According to the court, section 1716 provides a right to interest for <em>overdue </em>payments of benefits, whereas section 1797 provides a right of action for <em>unpaid </em>benefits. <em>Schappell, </em><a href="/a2d/868/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="868 A.2d 1" data-case-ids="9175450" data-case-paths="/a2d/868/0001-01">868 A.2d at 4</a>.

By way of further analysis, the court held that section 1716 does not appear to provide a private cause of action for interest alone. The Legislature explicitly provided a cause of action for unpaid bills in section 1797, it would have done so for section 1716 too, if that had been its intent. Finally, the Superior Court found that permitting actions, particularly class actions, for the minimal amounts of interest due under section 1716 would undermine the MVFRL’s goal of cost-containment. <a href="/a2d/868/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="868 A.2d 1" data-case-ids="9175450" data-case-paths="/a2d/868/0001-01">868 A.2d at 5</a>.</p>

Particularly, the dissent points out that section 1797 was primarily drafted to (1) establish the maximum permissible charges medical providers could bill for treating patients injured in motor vehicle accidents, and (2) to create an administrative system to efficiently adjudicate challenges by insurers to the reasonableness or necessity of healthcare professionals’ treatments, charges, products, or accommodations provided to individuals injured in motor vehicle accidents. <em><a href="/a2d/868/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="868 A.2d 1" data-case-ids="9175450" data-case-paths="/a2d/868/0001-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/868/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="868 A.2d 1" data-case-ids="9175450" data-case-paths="/a2d/868/0001-01">at 6-7</a>.

    <p id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[107,443,1154,526]]]'>Rather than the indirect approach taken by the majority, the dissent would look directly at the language of Section 1716 itself. From this language, Judge McEwen contends, it is clear that the Legislature intended for a private cause of action to exist to vindicate the right to interest provided by the statute. Further, the dissent dismisses the contention of the majority that permitting actions for <em>de minimis </em>amounts of interest would undermine the purpose of the MVFRL. On the contrary, the dissent concludes that it would encourage compliance with the statute on behalf of the insurers.</p>

Indeed, the test reflects the extraneous considerations set forth by the Statutory Construction Act for ascertaining legislative intent. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(1), (3), (4). According to the test, to determine whether a statute creates a private cause of action a court must investigate (1) whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted; (2) whether there is any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one; and (3) whether it is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff. <em>Estate of Witthoefl v.

Imme<a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>diately after specifying that interest accrues for overdue payments, the section states: “In the event the insurer <em>‘is found </em>’ to have acted in an unreasonable manner in refusing to pay benefits when due, the insurer shall pay, in addition to the benefits owed and the interest thereon, a reasonable attorney fee based upon the actual time expended.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1716 <em>(emphasis </em>supplied). The term “is found” is telling in that it raises the question “by whom?” In our view, the answer is “by a court.” Therefore, this section contemplates that a remedy for nonpayment of the specified interest will be available. In the event that the court finds that the insurer’s actions were unreasonable in failing to make timely payment, the attorney fees expended in seeking the interest may be awarded.</p>

Appellant looks, as did the Superior Court, to 75 Pa.C.S. § 1797 in analyzing whether section 1716 provides a private cause of action. Specifically, he points to the language of subsection (b)(4) which states: Appeal to Court.-A provider of medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise or an insured may challenge before a court an insurer’s refusal to pay for past or future medical treatment or rehabilitative services or merchandise, the reasonableness or necessity of which the insurer has not challenged before a PRO. Conduct considered to be wanton shall be subject to a payment of treble damages to the injured party.</p>
      <p id="b177-8" data-blocks='[["BL_177.9",177,[139,2051,1124,310]]]'>75 Pa.C.S. § 1797(b)(4). Appellant contends that this section clearly affords a provider with a private cause of action for unpaid medical bills. Appellant further argues that if the insurer fails to pay interest on an overdue bill, it has failed to pay the entire bill. <em>Citing, Collins v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/426/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="426 Pa.

We find that it is unnecessary to look beyond section 1716 and will not, therefore, undertake an analysis of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1797.</p>

The insurer has refused to pay the full bill, and as § 1797(b)(4) authorizes an appeal before the courts to challenge an insurer’s “refusal to pay,” the remedy under § 1797(b)(4) is available.
