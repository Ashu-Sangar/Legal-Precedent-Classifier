In this case, the Superior Court ruled that sheriffs deputies have common-law authority to conduct an independent investigation of a suspected methamphetamine manufactory, obtain a search warrant in furtherance of that investigation, and effectuate arrests for any offenses the investigation reveals. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In that case, a probation officer, who knew that her defendant was precluded from operating a motor vehicle as a condition of his probation, observed him driving a car. She reported her observations to the sheriffs office, providing a description of the vehicle and its license plate number. The deputy sheriff who received the call contacted the Bureau of Driver Licensing and verified that defendant’s license was under suspension and that the vehicle in question was registered to defendant.

Just as <em>Leet </em>vindicated little more than an arrest authority held by any citizen for felonies and breaches of the peace committed in the sheriffs presence, <em>Lockridge </em>plainly applied only to its limited context. This Court’s rule-making prerogatives do not extend to conferring substantial investigatory powers to sheriffs for crimes detailed in statutory provisions that fail to provide such authority. Moreover, any doubt about the breadth of our <em>Lockridge </em>decision was dispelled in <em>Kopko II, </em>which drew a clear line between sheriffs’ authority vis-á-vis summary offenses and with respect to the more invasive actions typically required to investigate violations of the Wiretapping Act’s serious predicate offenses.</p>

Thus, the arrest warrant was predicated on evidence secured only by the execution of a search warrant that never should have issued, inasmuch as sheriff’s deputies had no legal authority to obtain that warrant in the first instance.

The majority, in my estimation, mistakenly focuses on the scope of employment of a sheriffs deputy, rather than evaluating their actual conduct under the Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Constitution. I find the issue of statutory investigative authority to be a red herring, not determinative of the case; investigative authority does not settle the question of whether deputies should, may, or must investigate drug offenses. To obtain relief, appellant must show there was impropriety in the actions of the officers, some violation of a statute, our Rules, or the Constitution. I do not find he has done so.</p>

Whether they are statutorily authorized to investigate drug matters is irrelevant — as concerns appellant, it does not matter whether they came for a quiet stroll, to distribute religious tracts, or to investigate the Lindbergh kidnapping. They did nothing in seeking Ms. Harris that offends appellant. As such, that which they saw and smelled there, in the air and light accessible to all, and which eventually comprised probable cause for the search warrant, was not learned illegally.

This distinction is significant, for while deputy sheriffs may not be <em>responsible </em>for investigating drug offenses, (which excludes them from the list of law enforcement officers eligible for wiretap training), <em>Kopko II </em>does not amount to a sweeping <em>preclusion </em>of their ability to participate in all law enforcement procedures just because they involve crimes enumerated in § 5708. One has the legal right to participate in many things that one is not responsible for; not being responsible for your brother’s keep does not prevent you from helping out now and then on pain of “illegality.” In any event, the issue of general authority (rather than specific responsibility) simply was not before the court in <em>Kopko II.</em>
