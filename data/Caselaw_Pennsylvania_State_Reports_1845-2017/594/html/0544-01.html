Thus, the insurer, having paid Gillette, is not subrogated to the amount actually received by Gillette; rather, it is subrogated to the share that Gillette has the <em>right </em>to receive.

The lead opinion would find that Debbie Gillette had a right to receive an award under the Wrongful Death Act, and that Ms. Gillette’s right had passed by operation of the Workers’ Compensation Act to Utica National Insurance which compensated Ms. Gillette for the death of her husband while at work. The lead opinion does not explain how this right vested in Ms. Gillette, who had disclaimed her share of the award. By operation of law, “a disclaimer relates back for all purposes to the date of death of the decedent and shall, for purposes of determining the rights of other parties, be equivalent to the disclaimant having died before the decedent in a case of devolution by will or intestacy.” 20 Pa.C.S. § 6205. Therefore, Ms. Gillette’s disclaimer creates a legal fiction that assumes that she died before her husband was fatally wounded, and thus she could not have acquired a right to which Utica’s right of subrogation could attach.</p>

If Ms. Gillette is treated as predeceased because of her disclaimer, we can assume that the Gillette children would have received not only the wrongful death award, but also the workers’ compensation award. That being the case, Utica would have been subrogated to the children’s right to receive a wrongful death award, having already paid them workers’ compensation benefits. If the disclaimer requires us to indulge the legal fiction that treats Ms. Gillette as if she has predeceased her husband then we are bound to follow this course to its logical conclusion in the law and uphold Utica’s right to be subrogated to whomever directly benefits. Otherwise, we leave a loophole that makes the subrogation right a nullity in wrongful death cases, and we allow a double recovery.</p>

Decedent was survived by his wife, Appellee Ms. Gillette, and their three children. Appellant Utica National Insurance Group is the workers’ compensation provider for the school district where Decedent worked and was killed. Following Decedent’s death, Utica paid fatal claim benefits to Ms. Gillette in the amount of $167,934. Ms. Gillette, in her own right and as executor of Decedent’s estate, commenced a wrongful death lawsuit against A.W. and his parents, which was consolidated with the personal injury lawsuit brought by J.T.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Ms. Gillette <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>and J.T. agreed to settle their claims against the Wursts for $300,000, the limit of the Wurst’s homeowner’s insurance policy. Under the proposed settlement, Ms. Gillette would receive $288,000 and J.T. would receive the remaining $12,000. Pennsylvania’s Wrongful Death Statute mandates that Pennsylvania’s intestacy scheme be used to determine distribution of the $288,000 award received by Ms. Gillette. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8301(b). After payment of counsel fees and costs, if Ms. Gillette had accepted her intestate spousal share, she would have received $109,493.77, and each of Decedent’s three children would have received $26,497.93.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Ms. Gillette, however, exercised her right under Pennsylvania law to disclaim the portion of the settlement funds allotted to her as the surviving spouse by the intestacy scheme, with the exception of $12,000 for Decedent’s funeral expenses, resulting in the balance of the spousal share to be distributed to Decedent’s and her children.</p>

The trial court permitted Utica to intervene, and then approved the settlement, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve the subrogation issue presented by Utica and upholding Ms. Gillette’s right to disclaim her share of the settlement funds. The Superior Court affirmed, finding that nothing prevents a beneficiary from disclaiming an intestate interest in proceeds from a wrongful death action so long as the disclaimer is carried out in accordance with applicable statutory law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

In accord with this statutory language, quoted below, when Ms. Gillette disclaimed her right to the settlement proceeds, she triggered a legal fiction requiring that she be treated as having predeceased Decedent.

Whether the disclaimant has excessive unliquidated credit card bills, is a judgment debtor, or, like here, is subject to a right of subrogation, the legislature has decided, as a matter of sound public policy, that the satisfaction of the debt can be avoided through disclaimer. The majority implicitly limits this right to situations where the disclaimer will result in tax benefits for the disclaimant. However, that is not what the legislature has said. Simply because the right to disclaim is often used to avoid taxes does not mean that one cannot disclaim for any other reason, including defeating the claims of creditors. Indeed, that is what has happened here. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>

Mr. Chief Justice Cappy, in his concurring opinion, invokes the fiction that a disclaimant is treated as having predeceased the decedent for purposes of disclaimer, and hypothesizes that if Ms. Gillette had truly predeceased Decedent, then Decedent's three children would have received fatal claim benefits. Under the hypothetical, where Ms. Gillette predeceased Decedent, the children also would have brought the wrongful death action and received the wrongful death award. Because the recipients of the fatal claim benefit and the wrongful death award would be the same in this scenario, the concurrence reasons that Utica would then have a right of subrogation against the three children. Respectfully, the hypothetical is premised on the improper expansion of the legal fiction created by 20 Pa.C.S. § 6205(b) to fatal claim benefits paid under the Workers' Compensation Act. The fiction applies only in the context of the devolution of property after exercise of a disclaimer under the PEF Code. It does not apply to benefits paid under the Workers’ Compensation Act. Thus, the Legislature's creation of the fiction that the disclaimant predeceased the decedent for purposes of the PEF Code does not impact or alter the factual and legal reality that Ms. Gillette was the recipient of the fatal claim benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act. As these benefits went to Ms. Gillette and, by virtue of her disclaimer, the wrongful death proceeds went to the children, the concurrence is constructed upon a faulty premises.</p>

In order to establish a right of subrogation against a third-party recovery, an employer must demonstrate that the fund to which it seeks subrogation was for the same compensable injury for which the employer is liable under the Workers’ Compensation Act. <em>Sharkey v.

Because of the existence of Ms. Gillette for purposes of the fatal claim benefits, Decedent's children had no right of their own to recover fatal claim benefits. <em>See Anderson v. Borough of Greenville, </em><a href="/pa/442/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="442 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1935378" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0011-01">442 Pa. 11</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=273%20A.2d%20512" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="273 A.2d 512">273 A.2d 512</a> (1971). The fatal claim benefits were therefore paid directly to Ms. Gillette. In contrast, by virtue of Ms. Gillette’s disclaimer, the wrongful death award will be paid to Decedent’s children. Consequently, the fund to which Utica seeks subrogation is not for the same injury for which it paid fatal claim benefits, and it cannot establish a right of subrogation against a third party recovery by Decedent's children. <em>Sharkey.</em>
