    <p id="b121-11" data-blocks='[["BL_121.11",121,[102,1666,1155,687]]]'>Appellee Nationwide acknowledges this Court’s reluctance to grant reargument, but insists reargument is warranted based on the proposition that this Court has overlooked the consequences of the <em>Saekett </em>decision on the insurance industry, and failed to appreciate the distinctions between personal and commercial insurance practice. <em>Saekett </em>was a case concerning personal automobile insurance. Nationwide posits, from the insurer’s perspective, the costs and administrative burdens attendant to compliance with the <em>Saekett </em>decision are great. Nationwide further asserts that the cost of insurance will rise following <em>Saekett, </em>that this consequence could not have been intended by this Court, and such unintended consequences form the basis for reargument.</p>
    <p id="b122-3" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[283,314,1155,362]]]'>
      <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>While recognizing the potential for costs to be affected by the <em>Sackett </em>decision (“As a practical matter, there will be <em>some </em>cost attendant to compliance with today’s holding”), the case was decided on statutory construction principles. Simply put, the statute there at issue, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1738, was unambiguous. <em>Sackett v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/591/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="591 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="3014050,3017123" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0416-01,/pa/591/0416-02">591 Pa. 416</a>, 427, <a href="/pa/591/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="919 A.2d 194" data-case-ids="3014050,3017123,8325205,8325246" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0416-01,/pa/591/0416-02,/a2d/919/0194-01,/a2d/919/0194-02">919 A.2d 194</a>, 201 (2007).</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[281,703,1158,735]]]'>Nationwide’s concerns about the effect of <em>Sackett </em>on the insurance industry, especially the commercial lines, rest upon hypothetical situations and facts <em>dehors </em>the record. There is no contention that this Court has overlooked or misapprehended a fact of record or controlling authority. Rule 2543 does not provide a basis for reargument where a party simply disagrees with the outcome, and it most certainly does not do so where the applicant wishes to make arguments not developed in the appeal process or based upon facts not at issue in the appeal or made part of the record. Therefore, even if Nationwide’s predictions prove true, and heightened administrative and exposure costs result in an increase in the cost of insurance, this is no basis for reargument. In fact, that is the Legislature’s milieu.</p>
    <p id="b122-5" data-blocks='[["BL_122.6",122,[277,1464,1157,472]]]'>Additionally, Nationwide disagrees with this Court’s interpretation of Section 1738. Disagreeing with this Court’s statutory construction analysis is, of course, very different from alleging that we overlooked or misapprehended precedent, which are proper bases for an application for reargument. The fact remains that this Court engaged in construction of a statute enacted by the General Assembly. In other words, the consequences that result from <em>Sackett </em>are those created by statute.</p>
    <p id="b122-6" data-blocks='[["BL_122.7",122,[276,1962,1155,205]],["BL_123.1",123,[98,316,1157,150]]]'>Upon receipt of Nationwide’s Application for Reargument, we invited the Insurance Commissioner to file an amicus curiae brief identifying bases for reargument.

    <p id="b123-4" data-blocks='[["BL_123.6",123,[97,496,1160,735]]]'>The Insurance Commissioner’s position is that <em>Sackett </em>will have a broad and potentially complicated effect on the insurance industry and the Department’s regulation of it. The Insurance Commissioner conveys concern about the effect of <em>Sackett, </em>and disagrees with the legal analysis upon which a majority of this Court agreed. However, in <em>Sackett </em>this Court was not faced with questions related to lag time before reporting a vehicle purchase to the insurance company, or stacking of coverage in a commercial context.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Arguments about whether the Legislature intended the MVFRL to treat commercial policies differently than non-commercial polices like that at issue in <em>Sackett, </em>whatever merit they may have, were not before this Court, on this record, or subject to resolution in the <em>Sackett </em>case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

Here, Appellee has not presented a basis for granting reargument within the scope of Pa.R.A.P. 2543, precedent established by this or another court, or any authority at all.</p>

Such is the nature of our system. Establishing answers to unresolved questions of law is an inherent part of this Court’s raison d’etre. The consequences that result from <em>Sackett </em>are those created by statute. I remain of the opinion that Nationwide’s recourse following <em>Sackett </em>is properly through the legislative branch, given its policy-based argument that there is a better course for the future of UM/UIM stacking waivers in Pennsylvania. In this case, the losing party is simply dissatisfied with the outcome reached by this Court; however, disagreement does not a faulty analysis make.</p>
    <p id="b124-4" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[293,1019,1152,538]]]'>An application for reargument in this Court is a decidedly different - animal than an appeal challenging a decision of a lower court. Stated otherwise, we do not take appeals from our own decisions. Today, a majority of my colleagues treat these two different mechanisms as though they serve the same function. This obviously invites losing parties to view a reargument application as the final step in every appeal, rather than the exceptional tool by which to bring to the Court’s attention law or facts that were overlooked, i.e. the bases for granting reargument in the past.</p>
