    <p id="b605-7" data-blocks='[["BL_605.8",605,[123,747,1155,528]]]'>We decide whether, under the circumstances of this case, a juvenile probation officer’s warrantless search of a probationer’s bedroom, which resulted in the seizure of a firearm from beneath a mattress, must be supported by a reasonable suspicion that the juvenile possessed contraband or was in violation of the conditions of his supervision. We hold that reasonable suspicion is indeed required in such a case, that it was lacking here, and that the search conducted was therefore improper. We affirm the Superior Court’s decision reversing the adjudication and remanding the matter to the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b605-8" data-blocks='[["BL_605.9",605,[583,1311,239,39]]]'>Background</p>
    <p id="b605-9" data-blocks='[["BL_605.10",605,[123,1377,1155,626]]]'>At the time of these events, appellee J.E. was on juvenile probation. On February 10, 2005, Probation Officer Greg Willig, along with several other probation and police officers, went to J.E.’s residence in Pittsburgh, armed with an arrest warrant for J.E.’s step-brother (Brother), who was also on juvenile probation and had failed to appear for a court hearing. The officers did not go to the residence for any reason involving J.E. Upon arriving at the residence, J.E.’s stepmother (“Stepmother”) answered the door and informed the officers that Brother was not at home, but that J.E. was upstairs in his bedroom. Probation Officer Willig told Stepmother that the officers would still need to search the house for Brother.</p>
    <p id="b605-10" data-blocks='[["BL_605.11",605,[125,2038,1153,309]],["BL_606.1",606,[284,309,1153,148]]]'>Officer Willig, with two other probation officers, went upstairs and found J.E. in his third-floor bedroom, sitting on a bed, watching television. Probation Officer Willig directed J.E. to stand up, and then conducted a pat-down search, which did not result in any seizure. J.E. appeared to be very nervous and was shaking during the pat-down. Officer Willig <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>believed J.E. was hiding something, so he lifted up the mattress of the bed on which J.E. had been sitting and found a gun, which he seized.</p>
    <p id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.5",606,[281,484,1157,849]]]'>Following the filing of weapons charges, J.E. sought suppression of the gun. At a hearing on the motion, the Commonwealth and defense presented the following testimony. Officer Willig testified that he was the probation officer in charge of warrants for the county, and knew that J.E. was on juvenile probation, but that he had had no prior dealing with either J.E. or Brother. He testified that based on his experience, he knew that probationers are required to sign a Conditions of Probation form, which includes consent to a search of the probationer’s person at any time. Officer Willig also testified that he routinely conducted “frisks” of juvenile probationers when they are present during the service of a warrant, to ensure the safety of the officers present. He stated that the officers “were going to search him ... [to] make sure he is following the rules of supervision and conditions of probation and for our safety.” N.T. 4/14/05, 7.</p>
    <p id="b606-6" data-blocks='[["BL_606.6",606,[280,1361,1157,519]]]'>Officer Willig testified that, based on his experience, the fact J.E. was shaking during the pat-down frisk was “a pretty good indication that somebody is trying to hide something.” Officer Willig further testified that he had heard from an “informant” that J.E. may have been involved in a shooting. Officer Willig could not articulate whether this information was received from a known or anonymous informant, and he stated, “I don’t recall the source.” He confirmed that to his knowledge, J.E. was not in violation of his probation at the time of the search.</p>
    <p id="b606-7" data-blocks='[["BL_606.7",606,[280,1916,1153,203]]]'>Probation Officer Jon Marzoch provided the trial court with a signed copy of the Condition of Supervision form executed by J.E., which included the condition that the juvenile must submit to a search by the probation officer as directed.</p>

She testified, “He shakes if he is yelled at.” N.T. 4/14/05, 36. The trial court found Stepmother’s testimony to <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>be unpersuasive, noting that she was unable to provide the court with a name for the medical condition, or any medical records. The court also found that there was no evidence that Officer Willig had any knowledge of J.E.’s purported condition when he made his decision to conduct the search and seizure.</p>
    <p id="b607-4" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[124,607,1156,362]]]'>Ultimately, the trial court denied J.E.’s motion to suppress the gun, adjudicated him delinquent for Possession of a Firearm by a Minor (18 Pa.C.S. § 6110.1a) and Possession of a Firearm Without a License (18 Pa.C.S. § 6106), and found him to be in violation of the terms of his juvenile probation. The court committed J.E. to the Youth Forestry Camp on May 12, 2005 and the matter was listed for review on October 13, 2005.</p>
    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[124,1003,1157,478]]]'>On appeal, a divided panel of the Superior Court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> held the trial court had erred in denying the motion to suppress the gun as the probation officer lacked reasonable suspicion that J.E. had engaged in criminal activity, or was in violation of his probation. Superior Court reversed the trial court’s commitment order and remanded the matter. <em>In the Interest of J.E., </em><a href="/a2d/907/1114-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="907 A.2d 1114" data-case-ids="8937856" data-case-paths="/a2d/907/1114-01">907 A.2d 1114</a> (Pa.Super.2006).

    <p id="b607-6" data-blocks='[["BL_607.7",607,[123,1515,1155,583]]]'>The Commonwealth asserts that the Superior Court erred in determining that the search was not supported by reasonable suspicion. The Commonwealth further argues that the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6304, which empowers probation officers to conduct searches, requires that suppression be denied. Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that the Superior Court erred in holding that a probationer is afforded protection in these circumstances, under either the Federal Constitution, or the Constitution of this Commonwealth. We begin our analysis with the language of the relevant statute, which provides as follows:</p>
