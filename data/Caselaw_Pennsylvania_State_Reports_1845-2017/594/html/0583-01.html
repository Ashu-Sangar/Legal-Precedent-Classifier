But, given Verizon’s huge size and dominant position, there is no reason to accept the assumption that what is good for Verizon is good for its customers or the public in general.

Supporting his conclusion that there was no anticompetitive effect of the merger on the conditions approved by DOJ and the FCC, the ALJ developed that one of the DOJ conditions was a requirement for partial divestiture of wireline connections to certain buildings in Philadelphia. <em>See id.; see also supra </em>note 4. The ALJ also indicated that “record evidence provides that the merger of Verizon and MCI will have little or no adverse impact on the competitive choices available to enterprise customers, other than what DOJ found,” and, because MCI is not competing for mass market customers, “the merger will not eliminate a significant competitor for mass market customers.” <em>See Initial Decision, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20995853" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="2006 WL 995853">2006 WL 995853</a>, at *69.

In this regard, as well, we differ with the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that there is “no evidence” of benefit inuring to the public as a result of the Verizon/MCI merger. As developed above and in the Commission’s opinion, the ALJ’s Initial Decision, and Appellants’ briefs, the record is replete with evidence of public benefit along very similar lines to that which prevailed in the <em>City of York </em>decision. The Commonwealth Court discounted much of that evidence on the grounds that the joint applicants failed to develop in sufficient detail what particular multimedia services were to be produced by the corporate combination and offered no evidence that any of the asserted benefits would not exist in the absence of the merger. <em>See Popowsky, </em>917 A.2d at 396. With regard to the former rationale, it is true that Appellants did not name particular services and/or products that have yet to be realized. However, they did describe their underlying objectives in these regards, as well as the means by which they are to be achieved, in sufficient detail to warrant the credence given by the PUC. Indeed, even from a lay perspective, bearing in mind today’s technological advances affecting all segments of business and personal life, there is much force to the Commission’s conclusion that a combination of Verizon’s and MCI’s assets and strengths has substantial potential to create an integrated infrastructure supporting delivery of innovative, high-speed data and video services via the fiber-optic network, as well as deployment of mobile devices freeing workers from fixed workstations. <em>See Initial Decision, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20995853" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="2006 WL 995853">2006 WL 995853</a>, at *61, *67.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a> For similar reasons, the Common<a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>wealth Court’s indication that the Appellants failed to establish that the merger was a necessary prerequisite to the accrual of the relied-upon benefits is facially lacking in merit.

Indeed, the Commission’s opinion makes it clear that its decision to accept a likelihood of longer-term benefits in lieu of more immediate price concessions is grounded in the same philosophy as the General Assembly’s decision to move from cost-based to price-cap regulation-both decisions appear to incorporate the underlying understanding that, in a competitive environment, market forces will constrain price and encourage valuable innovation. The assumptions underlying such policy considerations are supported in the record in this case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">25</a> and the policy is entirely rational.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_26" id="ref_footnote_1_26">26</a>

This Court has characterized a preponderance of the evidence as tantamount to a “more likely than not” inquiry, <em>see Commonwealth v. $6,425 Seized From Esquilin, </em><a href="/pa/583/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="583 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="687717" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0544-01">583 Pa. 544</a>, 555, <a href="/pa/583/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="880 A.2d 523" data-case-ids="687717,8936770" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0544-01,/a2d/880/0523-01">880 A.2d 523</a>, 529 (2005); thus, the PUC was not required to ensure beyond all doubt that the noted public benefits would accrue. Rather, it was required only to apply the ordinary civil standard of proof to make a factually-based finding, a routine matter for administrative bodies.</p>
      <p id="b683-5" data-blocks='[["BL_683.6",683,[153,1467,1127,903]]]'>We also note that, while there may be no legally binding assurance of public benefit from the Verizon/MCI merger, there is similarly no assurance of synergy savings arising from the transaction, given that unforeseen contingencies such as increased costs or technological obsolescence can affect savings forecasts just as they may the benefits evaluations. Thus, the Commission’s findings concerning prospective merger savings, like the findings of prospective benefit, are also something that has been anticipated and found to be likely to occur as a factual matter on a developed record. Notably, other regulatory bodies regularly, appropriately, and necessarily rely upon probabilities in assessing the future effects of proposed mergers. <em>See, e.g., In re Verizon, </em>20 F.C.C.R. at 18537 ("We find that the public interest benefits are <em>likely </em>to result from the proposed transaction and that, in light of the DOJ consent decree, the merger is not <em>likely </em>to have anticompetitive effects in any relevant markets.” (emphasis added)). Moreover, given the role of regulatory expertise in making such assessments, other jurisdictions have recognized the appropriateness of affording deference to expert administrative tribunals concerning their informed judgments on similar matters. <em>See, e.g., Constellation Energy Commodities Group, Inc. v. FERC, </em><a href="/us-app-dc/372/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="372 U.S. App. D.C. 368" data-case-ids="3457948" data-case-paths="/us-app-dc/372/0368-01">372 U.S.App.D.C. 368</a>, <a href="/us-app-dc/372/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="457 F.3d 14" data-case-ids="3457948,3789237" data-case-paths="/us-app-dc/372/0368-01,/f3d/457/0014-01">457 F.3d 14</a>, 24 (C.A.D.C. 2006) ("[Ajs we have long recognized, it is within the scope of the agency’s expertise to make ... a prediction about the market it regulates, and a reasonable prediction deserves our deference.”).</p>

We also disagree with the Commonwealth Court’s comment indicating that the Commission did not conduct a Pennsylvania-specific evaluation of the competitive effect of the merger. The court’s understanding was apparently grounded on a passage of the PUC’s opinion stating that the ALJ had been persuaded that a Pennsylvania-specific analysis was “not appropriate” in light of the DOJ consent decree. <em>See In re Verizon, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20995853" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="2006 WL 995853">2006 WL 995853</a>, at *16. However, the Commission’s decision otherwise makes it clear that its evaluation was centered on impact within the Commonwealth. In this regard, in the same passage of its opinion, the Commission explained that the DOJ and FCC approvals were “instructive” but “not conclusive on this Commission.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20995853" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="2006 WL 995853">Id.</a> </em>Furthermore, the Commission proceeded with a developed analysis of the merger's likely competitive effect "in the Commonwealth,” which it indicated was “[biased on our review of the Pennsylvania-specific record,” and which was grounded in actual citations to the record. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20995853" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="2006 WL 995853">id.,</a> </em><a href="/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20995853" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="2006 WL 995853">2006 WL 995853</a>, at *41-*43; <em>see also id. </em>at *16; R.R. at 132a-186a (reflecting an extensive passage from the written testimony of William E. Taylor, PhD, captioned "The Transaction Will Not Harm Competition for any Customers in Pennsylvania”). As the Commission and Verizon argue at length, the PUC in fact reviewed extensive and detailed evidence on competition in Pennsylvania, made explicit findings of fact based on that evidence, and concluded that, with the DOJ consent decree and the conditions that the FCC imposed, the merger would not adversely affect competition in Pennsylvania and would benefit all types of consumers.</p>

Along these lines, the ALJ and the Commission found, based on the evidence, that: there were market incentives on Verizon's part to invest more in MCI's network facilities than MCI could invest on its own, <em>see, e.g., Initial Decision, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20995853" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="2006 WL 995853">2006 WL 995853</a>, at *61; the combined company could invest in those facilities at a lower cost of capital than MCI could obtain on its own, <em>id.; </em>and the increased investment would enable the new company to increase network capacity, extend network reach, and add new capabilities to the network, <em><a href="/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20995853" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="2006 WL 995853">id.</a> </em>It was highlighted that Verizon had committed to invest at least two billion dollars nationally in MCI’s network after the merger. Contrary to the OCA's suggestion, it seems highly unlikely that Pennsylvania would be entirely excluded from the benefits flowing from the infrastructure improvements given the integrated nature of the existing and planned networking. Further, the Commission and the ALJ accepted that, together, the companies would have the financial wherewithal and incentives to make the substantial investments needed to expand the capabilities of MCI's network and to support the innovative services that would be developed for, and delivered over, Verizon’s local fiber network. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20995853" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="2006 WL 995853">id.</a></em>
