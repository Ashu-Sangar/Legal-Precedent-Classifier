The Note to Pa.R.C.P. 227.1(c) states: “A motion for post-trial relief may not be filed to matters governed exclusively by the rules of petition practice.” Section 109(b) of the MHPA, referring to proceedings concerning involuntary emergency treatment under Section 303(c), provides that in “all cases in which the hearing is conducted by a mental health review officer, a person subject to treatment shall have the right to petition the court of common pleas for review of the certification.” 50 P.S. § 7109(b). Section 303(g) of the MPHA, “Petition to Common Pleas Court,” provides “In all cases in which the hearing was conducted by a mental health review officer, a person made subject to treatment pursuant to this section shall have the right to petition the court of common pleas for review of the certification.” 50 P.S. § 7303(g). And Section 304(b), “Procedures for Initiating Court-ordered Involuntary Treatment for Persons Already Subject to Involuntary Treatment,” provides “Petition for court-ordered involuntary treatment for persons already subject to treatment under sections 303, 304, and 305 may be made ... to the court of common pleas.” 50 P.S. § 7304(b). Proceedings pursuant to the MHPA are governed by the rules of petition practice. The Note to Pa.R.C.P. 227.1(c) therefore applies to those proceedings, and post-trial motions are not required to preserve issues for appeal. <em>See also Coco Brothers, Inc. v.

For example, an action for support is heard first by a conference officer who issues a conference summary stating the amount of support awarded, if any, and by which party it is owed. Pa.R.C.P. 1910.11(e). The conference summary is sent to the court for the issuance of an interim order. Pa.R.C.P.1910.11(f). If neither party demands a hearing within 10 days, the order becomes final; if a hearing is demanded, a trial <em>de novo </em>is held, and a final order issued. Pa.R.C.P.1910.11(g),(h),(i). “No motion for post-trial relief may be filed to the final order of support.” Pa.R.C.P.1910.11(k).</p>
    <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[106,908,1155,841]]]'>Divorce actions are governed by a similar procedure initiated before a master, who prepares a report that is sent to the court for the issuance of a final order “[i]f no exceptions are filed.” Pa.R.C.P.1920.55-2(d). If exceptions are filed the court hears argument before the entry of a final decree. Pa.R.C.P.1920.55-2(c). “No motion for post-trial relief may be filed to the final decree.” Pa.R.C.P.1920.55-2(e). In support and divorce actions, a law-trained, quasi-judicial officer hears the case and issues an order that is referred to the court for the entry of a final order. Appellant posits that post-trial motions are not permitted in support and divorce actions because the hearing before a law-trained, quasi-judicial officer selves the same purpose as a hearing before a judge in a bench trial, and the review provided in the court of common pleas in each proceeding effectively serves the function of post-trial motions.</p>

The subject of a certification to involuntary commitment may file a petition for review of that certification to the court of common pleas, which is then charged with “a review of the certification and such evidence as the court may receive or require.” 50 P.S. § 7109(b). The review provided in the court of common pleas of the certification of findings by a law-trained, quasi-judicial officer in mental health certifications serves the same purpose as post-trial motions in a proceeding pursuant to the MHPA.</p>
