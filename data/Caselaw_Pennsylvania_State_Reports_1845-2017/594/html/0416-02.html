In 2003, Wilson purchased the subject property aware of the R-2 zoning.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Wilson applied for and was granted a building permit after being informed by a zoning officer of the requirement to have a permit after he had begun renovations to the residence on the property. Despite the appearance that the renovations were for an office only, Wilson assured the building inspector that the building would be a residence with a home occupation, a use permitted in the R-2 Zoning District. Wilson was later issued an Enforcement Notice when it was discovered that after renovations were completed, he was impermissibly operating an office but not <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>residing at the property. Wilson filed an application with the Zoning Hearing Board (ZHB) requesting a variance to use the property as an F3 Professional Office permitting him to operate his accounting business without living there. He did not appeal the Enforcement Notice. After a hearing, the Zoning Hearing Board denied Wilson’s application for a variance, finding that the property could be reasonably used as a residence with a home occupation.</p>

The trial court noted that south of the subject property was a parcel used by Carversville Plumbing, a contracting business operated from the owner’s home, a church which holds religious services and has a day care facility, and a tree farm and nursery. The trial court found that just north of the property is a residence also used as a plumbing contractor, five parcels north is a residence also used as the headquarters of a concrete contractor, followed by a tavern, auto body shop, car dealer, bank, and a large shopping center. Trial Court opinion at 4-6. Across from the subject property, the trial court determined there is a farm with seasonal farm operations, a church, a residence also used as a landscaping business, a doctor’s office, and a residence with the office of an excavation company.
