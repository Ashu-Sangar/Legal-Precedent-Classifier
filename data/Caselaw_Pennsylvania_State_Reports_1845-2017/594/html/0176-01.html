Police officers were conducting undercover surveillance of suspected drug trafficking activity, with a focus on an individual named Lamont Taylor. Officer Martinez observed appellee Robert Ratsamy and another individual, later identified as Rom Sang, approaching Taylor. Appellee lifted his T-shirt to remove a handgun. Appellee placed the gun in his waistband and he <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>and Sang went into a restaurant. Officer Martinez called for back-up. Several officers arrived on the scene and entered the restaurant. In the restaurant, Officer Martinez searched appellee and recovered the handgun with five rounds, a plastic bag containing a rock of crack cocaine weighing 6.02 grams, and $349.00 in United States currency. Sang possessed some currency and a plastic bag containing 199 multi-colored new and unused Ziploc plastic packets.</p>

The trial court also found Officer Martinez’s testimony to be credible. The officer observed appellee in the possession of a handgun. The trial court further found that appellee possessed “a significant amount of crack cocaine.” Coupled with the plastic bags discovered on his compatriot, and the expert’s opinion, the trial court found the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that appellee had the intent to deliver the crack cocaine. Appellee was convicted of possession of a controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance (PWID), and one count each of carrying a firearm: (1) without a license; and (2) on a public street. Appellee was sentenced to not less than three years nor more than six years state incarceration.</p>

In applying the above test, we may not weigh the evidence and substitute our judgment for that of the fact-finder. In addition, we note that the facts and circumstances established by the Commonwealth need not preclude every possibility of innocence. Any doubts regarding a defendant’s guilt may be resolved by the fact-finder unless the evidence is so weak and inconclusive that as a matter of law no probability of fact may be drawn from the combined circumstances. The Commonwealth may sustain its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt by means of wholly circumstantial evidence.

The Majority suggests that we need not address the issue because it was not raised before this Court. The Majority’s conclusion, however, hits at the very heart of the potential fundamental unfairness of the present situation: Defendant has no counsel to raise the issue because this Court granted his attorney’s petition to withdraw, but nevertheless Defendant is charged with failing to raise such issue. Nonetheless, I conclude that a remand is unnecessary in this case because Defendant was provided with notice of the withdrawal of his counsel, and the potential consequences thereof.

The result of this significant event is to restore a criminal conviction against Appellee. I find no compelling, or even reasonable, justification for proceeding in such a manner. As such, I would remand this case for a determination of whether Appellee is entitled to counsel, because our adversarial system requires no less.</p>

    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[103,601,1159,912]]]'>The <em>Liebel </em>decision is not, of course, wholly dispositive of this situation. Indeed, the substantial differences between that decision and the matter <em>sub judice </em>have not been addressed by this Court. First, the issue in <em>Liebel </em>involved the failure to file a PAA in a direct appeal, which is a matter of right, and not the subsequent discretionary proceedings. However, nothing in the <em>Liebel </em>opinion indicates that the statutory right to counsel acknowledged there is not to be extended to filing a brief and arguing the case before the Court. To the contrary, the holding of the case, that a criminal defendant “is entitled to the assistance of counsel <em>through </em>his discretionary appeal to this Court on direct appeal” indicates that counsel’s duties go beyond the mere filing of a PAA. Moreover, Rule 122, and the accompanying comment, <em>see note U, supra, </em>make it clear that appointed counsel must continue with his or her representation until the final judgment, including any action taken by this Court.</p>
    <p id="b265-6" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[105,1540,1157,421]],["BL_266.1",266,[290,318,1158,514]]]'>The second notable difference is that in <em>Liebel </em>counsel was appointed, where, here, counsel was privately retained. Rule 122 clearly imposes its requirements only on appointed counsel. <em>See generally </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 122 (entitled “Appointment of Counsel”). Nonetheless, the <em>Liebel </em>Court read this rule as providing a criminal defendant with a right to counsel through the entire direct appeal process, provided that the defendant meets the requirements for court-appointed counsel. Thus, if <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>Appellee is now financially eligible for court appointed counsel, under <em>Liebel </em>he is entitled to the assistance of counsel in this case. Here, Appellee’s private counsel was permitted to withdraw based on Appellee’s <em>failure to pay counsel for his services. </em>Therefore, Appellee may be without funds and may well meet the requirements to have counsel appointed for him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">6</a> However, he was never given the opportunity to demonstrate this. Rather, this Court proceeds forward in spite of <em>Liebel </em>and decides the case without providing Appellee with an opportunity to obtain counsel.</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[289,857,1155,347]]]'>Lastly, in <em>Liebel, </em>the defendant was the Appellant, Here the defendant is the Appellee. However, neither <em>Liebel </em>nor Rule 122 limits the right to counsel through any proceedings in this Court to the party bringing the appeal. I am not in a position to speculate as to future holdings on this issue, or the others above. This is not the case in which to make those determinations.</p>

Thus, unless this Court limits this right to exclude people in Appellee’s situation, the proper and just course of action would be to remand the case to the trial court to determine if Appellee is, in fact, indigent and falls under the purview of Rule 122. If so, counsel must be appointed.</p>

He was convicted of a crime, which was then vacated by the Superior Court. This Court now reinstates the conviction without advocacy from Appellee. Plainly put, there is no compelling, or even reasonable, justification for doing so without first remanding the case for the appointment of counsel, provided Appellee is determined to be indigent. Of course, remanding for the appointment of counsel and the subsequent preparation of a brief would necessarily delay the resolution of this case. However, expediency in this case pales in comparison to <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>Appellee’s interest.

    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[98,436,1159,737]]]'>There is, however, a compelling reason to justify a remand. This Court, as well as all those that are bound by and rely on our decisions, benefit from dual advocacy. Decisions should be made <em>only </em>after thoughtful and careful consideration of the law and both sides of the argument. Briefing and argument by the skilled and competent attorneys of this Commonwealth are invaluable assets to the functioning of the judiciary. While we sit as the final arbiters in this Commonwealth, it would be arrogant to believe we can, or should, decide cases without advocacy from the parties. Whether the case involves a pure question of law, an application of a set of facts to an established principle, or a question of constitutional magnitude is of no moment. We should not venture into the waters of unilateral decision-making no matter the type of case involved.</p>
    <p id="b267-5" data-blocks='[["BL_267.6",267,[99,1197,1159,571]]]'>There are, of course, situations where a party waives his or her right to present an argument to this Court, a decision that would undoubtedly be rare. This case may well be one of those situations, but we do not yet know. Appellee could choose to proceed <em>pro se </em>or not to file a brief at all. He may demonstrate that he is indigent and that he desires representation. He should be given the opportunity to do so, particularly where the case law, while not yet explicitly stated by this Court, is fairly clear that he has a right to court appointed counsel until final judgment of a case, including in proceedings before this Court.</p>
