Secondly, the Commonwealth contends that the issues raised, in particular the punitive effect of providing no judicial avenue for SVP reassessment, have been answered by the legislature’s provision, in Megan’s Law III, of just such a remedy. <em>Cf. Pittsburgh Palisades Park, LLC, v.

Appellees counter that, because a challenge to the SVP assessment process under <em>Apprendi </em>goes to the constitutionality of the process itself, rather than the status as applied to a given party, their challenge ripened as soon as they were convicted of predicate offenses triggering the mandatory SVP assessment. Appellees further note that this Court addressed the procedurally analogous challenges raised in <em>G. Williams </em>notwithstanding that the offender there had not yet been deemed an SVP. <a href="/a2d/832/0962-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="832 A.2d 962" data-case-ids="9088607" data-case-paths="/a2d/832/0962-01">832 A.2d at 492-93</a> (noting that Williams challenged the provision following the trial court’s order directing the SOAB to assess Williams).</p>

Indeed, Appellee Lee has been designated an SVP, and the Commonwealth’s argument based upon the lack of such an assessment is non-responsive as to his case. <em>See supra </em>n. 22. Given that this assessment precedes and may well influence sentencing, there is simply no question that addressing the issue now, rather than after sentencing or upon release from prison, is appropriate. <em>See G.

There are several flaws in this claim. First, while the reassessment provision, as applied to SVPs, does provide for termination of notification of various individual and institutional members of an SVP’s community of the SVP’s residency in that area,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">23</a> it does not provide an SVP with relief from having his name and virtually every detail of his crimes and of his current residency, appearance, employment, student status, and other information posted on a publicly available website. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9798.1. Moreover, Megan’s Law Ill’s reassessment procedure provides relief from neither the burdensome registration requirements nor the lifetime monthly counseling requirements. Thus, it would require an incomplete accounting of the concerns we noted and left open in <em>G. Williams </em>and the arguments now before us to suggest that this limited remedy moots the much broader claims of punitive sanctions, given the considerable burdens imposed under the requirements from which an SVP can have no relief under Megan’s Law II or III, and the particular stigma that attaches by virtue of having every pertinent personal detail and a full accounting of an SVP’s crimes publicly available on the internet in perpetuity. Accordingly, we address the Commonwealth’s challenge’to the trial courts’ rulings on the merits.</p>

Williams </em>we left it less than clear whether the remand was to encompass a stand-alone vagueness challenge, or just a challenge that the vagueness of the statutory definition of what comprises an SVP, alone or in concert with the lack of judicial avenue for reassessment, rendered the RNC provisions so excessive relative to their remedial objectives as to warrant a finding of punitive effect. To the extent the pure vagueness challenge remained in the wake of <em>G. Williams, </em>this Court has lain it to rest in <em>Commonwealth v.

We nonetheless suggested in <em>G.

Nevertheless, ultimately we conclude that the RNC provisions are not so excessive relative to their objectives to be punitive.

Notably, Megan's Law in its current and prior forms imposes lifetime RNC requirements on defendants who have been individually assessed as SVP's as well as imposing registration and internet notification requirements on non-SVP offenders who have committed multiple Megan's Law predicate offenses carrying ten-year reporting requirements, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1(a)(ten-year predicate offenses), or who have committed single offenses specified for lifetime treatment, including rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, and incest (victim under twelve years old). <em>See <a href="/a2d/832/0962-01" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="832 A.2d 962" data-case-ids="9088607" data-case-paths="/a2d/832/0962-01">id.</a> </em>§ 9795.1(b).

The new, limited judicial reassessment procedure prescribed by Megan's Law III applies by its plain terms to all SVPs, including those whose assessments predated the enactment of that provision. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.5(b) ("An individual required to register under section 9795.1 who is a sexually violent predator may petition the sentencing court for release from the application of section 9798....”). The trial court, in deciding <em>Drain, </em>disagreed, <em>see Drain </em>Tr. Ct. Op. II at 6, but provided no analysis or citation to authority justifying any departure from § 9795.5's unequivocal language regarding to whom the procedure is available. In any event, the limited judicial recourse provided by § 9795.5 offers no relief from the regular and strict registration requirements, the stigmatizing internet provisions, and the mandatory monthly counseling requirement that apply to SVPs for the durations of their lives. Thus, we agree with the trial court's <em>dictum </em>to the effect that assuming § 9795.5 applies to all SVPs, it does not sufficiently ameliorate Appellees' asserted deprivation to an extent rendering their constitutional claims moot.</p>

These arguments necessarily proceed from the premise that the complained-of sanctions are punitive as a matter of law. Were we so to conclude, however, Appellees' Apprendi-based due process arguments would prevail, as the trial courts concluded, and we would find it unnecessary to reach Appellees’ other constitutional arguments. Since we conclude that the RNC provisions that attach to SVPs are not punitive, however, all of these arguments necessarily fail.</p>
