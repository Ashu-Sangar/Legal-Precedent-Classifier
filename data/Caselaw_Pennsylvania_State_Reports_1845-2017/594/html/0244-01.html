Generally, in a defined benefit plan, such as that administered by SERS, retirees receive an annuity calculated (or “defined”) by a formula, and paid according to the same. Under the Commonwealth’s defined benefit plan, all contributions are commingled in the State Employees’ Retirement Fund. SERS then uses the fund and investment returns thereon to pay the Commonwealth’s pension obligations, i.e., each retired state employee’s defined benefit. SERS explains that it invests the fund as a fungible whole to meet the Commonwealth’s obligations. Thus there is no dispute here as to whether the fund at issue is public in nature. It is.</p>

Based on the examiner’s recommendation, and pursuant to the RTKA, the Board ultimately granted Appellees’ request for the information at issue.

The Commonwealth Court affirmed, holding: “[bjecause [Appellants’] compensation information is instrumental in calculating a defined benefit, to which they have a <em>vested contractual right, </em>and that right unquestionably involves the disbursement of Commonwealth funds, the compensation information falls within the definition of public record.” <em><a href="/a2d/880/0757-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="880 A.2d 757" data-case-ids="8939494" data-case-paths="/a2d/880/0757-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/880/0757-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="880 A.2d 757" data-case-ids="8939494" data-case-paths="/a2d/880/0757-01">at 765</a> (emphasis in original).

Because the word “account” can be properly defined in its ordinary sense to denote, <em>inter alia, </em>a list or enumeration of financial transactions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and because SERS participants make specified financial contributions to the retirement fund in exchange for specified financial returns, we do not hesitate to conclude that SERS necessarily maintains records establishing contractual rights with respect to, detailing, and evidencing monetary receipts and disbursements pertaining to every SERS member. There would be no <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>basis upon which to calculate appropriate annuities otherwise. Moreover, as correctly stated by the Commonwealth Court below, Appellants have a vested contractual right, based upon these records, to the defined benefits which they have earned as state employees. <em>Pennsylvania State University, </em><a href="/a2d/880/0757-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="880 A.2d 757" data-case-ids="8939494" data-case-paths="/a2d/880/0757-01">880 A.2d at 765</a>.

In reviewing this issue, a majority of this court stated that “we have recently confirmed that the [Right to Know Act] is designed to require disclosure only of documents prepared by the government agency or at the express direction of the government agency.” <em><a href="/pa/580/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="859 A.2d 1261" data-case-ids="1100670,9166988" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0080-01,/a2d/859/1261-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/580/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="859 A.2d 1261" data-case-ids="1100670,9166988" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0080-01,/a2d/859/1261-01">at 1268</a>. While the dissenting opinion disagreed with this statement, it concluded that the statutory definition of a public record “applies to a wide range of documents that contain information relating to the disbursement of public funds or an action of an agency that fixes the rights or obligations of individuals.” <em><a href="/pa/580/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="859 A.2d 1261" data-case-ids="1100670,9166988" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0080-01,/a2d/859/1261-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/580/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="859 A.2d 1261" data-case-ids="1100670,9166988" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0080-01,/a2d/859/1261-01">at 1270</a> (Saylor, J. dissenting). Under either theory of The Right to Know Act, it is clear that the records in this case are not public records, since the information that is <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>being sought — the salaries of non-retired PSU employees and their service history — is neither a record prepared by SERS or at its express direction nor does the information relate to the disbursement of public funds or fix the rights or obligations of non-retired employees.</p>

    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.6",339,[96,1196,1158,742]]]'>In this case, we are faced with a similar situation. Until the employee retires, the salary and years of service information is not utilized by SERS for any purpose. Rather, it is information that is simply collated and/or assembled by SERS for use at some date in the future when the employee is ready to or has retired. That information may become a public record at the time the retirement benefits are computed and paid by SERS, but until that point, there has been no disbursement of public funds or even the anticipation of disbursement of public funds to the employees under The Right to Know Act. Likewise, there is no “fixing” of employees rights or obligations at this point. Accordingly, I would conclude that the instant matter is controlled by <em>Tribune-Review, </em>and I respectfully dissent.</p>
