      <a id="p2" href="#p2" data-label="2" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*2</a>(1) Did the Lower Court err by subjecting Petitioner, who at age twenty was a state prisoner in an adult state correctional institution, to involuntary civil commitment under Act 21, where the Act only applies to juvenile offenders, who at age twenty are “committed to an institution or other facility pursuant to section 6352 (relating to disposition of delinquent child)?”</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b76-6" data-blocks='[["BL_76.6",76,[337,925,1106,363]]]'>(3) It is fundamentally unfair, and hence violative of state and federal due process protections, to apply 42 Pa. C.S.A. Chapter 64 to juvenile adjudications that occurred before the effective date of the Act because doing so undermined pre-Act 21 assurances, detrimentally relied upon by the then juveniles, as to the limited consequences and effects of such adjudications?</blockquote>
