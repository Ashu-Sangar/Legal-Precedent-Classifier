Specifically, the District sought relief from Section 751(a) of the School Code, which requires that separate contracts be entered for work done on the plumbing, heating and ventilating or lighting systems in school buildings. 24 P.S. § 7-751(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In the <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>materials submitted to the Department, the District indicated that a waiver of the multi-prime approach to construction would save the District significant time and enable the District to complete the projects with an estimated savings of $28.3 million dollars. After reviewing the Application, the Department advised the District in a letter dated January 17, 2003 that the Department had concluded that the District would operate more efficiently and economically if the requested waiver were approved. Accordingly, the Department approved the District’s Application and granted it a waiver (the “Waiver”) of Section 751(a) of the School Code for the construction or renovation projects specified in the Application. In November of 2003, the District advertised for bids on the projects. In its solicitation, the District did not seek separate bids for the plumbing, heating, ventilation, and lighting work needed, and sought instead, single bids that included all four work disciplines. Ultimately, the District entered into a single-prime contract for the work.</p>

      <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>The Commonwealth Court <em>en banc </em>decided the cross applications for summary relief in a published opinion and order. <em>Mechanical Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania, Inc. v.

For the Commonwealth Court, the issue as to whether the Mandate Waiver Program allowed the waiver of Section 751(a) of the School Code called for an analysis of the relationship between the Separations Act, a general statute that applies to all public building construction, and Section 751(a), the more specific statute that applies only to public school building construction. <em><a href="/a2d/860/1145-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="860 A.2d 1145" data-case-ids="9150385" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/1145-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/860/1145-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="860 A.2d 1145" data-case-ids="9150385" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/1145-01">at 1150</a>. In this regard, the court characterized the question it was to answer as whether the separate contracts mandate in the Separations Act continued to apply to the District, even though the Secretary was not precluded from waiving the separate contracts mandate in Section 751(a). <em><a href="/a2d/860/1145-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="860 A.2d 1145" data-case-ids="9150385" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/1145-01">Id.</a> </em>The court reviewed those sections of the Statutory Construction Act that cover inconsistent statutes or the repeal or amendment of one statute by another, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1993, 1971, and concluded that the Separations Act prevailed and that the requirement for separate contracts could not be waived. <em>Mechanical Contractors, </em><a href="/a2d/860/1145-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="860 A.2d 1145" data-case-ids="9150385" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/1145-01">860 A.2d at 1150-53</a>. Two statutory provisions were critical to the court’s conclusion. The first provision was one of the exceptions to waiver in the Program, 24 P.S. § 17-1714-B(i), which provides that a school district may not waive any federal or state law that applies to a public school building and is not included within the School Code’s provisions. <em>See supra </em>n. 3. According to the court, 24 P.S. § 17-1714-B® showed that the General Assembly intended to preclude the waiver of mandates in any state law of general application, like the Separations Act. <em>Id. </em>at 1151. The second provision was 24 P.S. § 17-1715-B(3), a section in the Educational Empowerment Act that instructs that its provisions may not be construed “to supersede or abrogate” Section 751(a) or the Separations Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> According to the court, 24 P.S. § 17-1715-B(3) <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>showed that the General Assembly did not intend for the separate contracts mandate in the Separations Act to be supplanted by the terms of the Mandate Waiver Program, even if single-prime contracts would be more economical for public school construction. <em>Id. </em>at 1152-53.

Presently, the District, the Department, the Secretary and the GBCA Appellants (collectively, the “Appellants”) primarily argue that the Commonwealth Court’s fundamental error was its conclusion that the Separations Act is applicable to public school construction contracts. They assert that over the years, the School Code has changed repeatedly; at some times, it has authorized separate contracts, and at other times, it has not. According to Appellants, this must mean that the Legislature intends lor the School Code to govern the bidding and contracting requirements for public school construction exclusively. Thus, 24 P.S. § 17-1714B(g) of the Mandate Waiver Program is the only place to look for determining whether Section 751(a) is excepted from waivability. Since Section 751(a) is not listed in 24 P.S. § 17-1714B(g) as nonwaivable, it is subject to waiver under 24 P.S. § 17-1714B(a). Further, as to § 17-1715-B(3) of the Education Empowerment Act, Appellants contend that that section merely insures that certain generally applicable laws are not superseded or abrogated outside the context of school construction.</p>

MCA further argues that if Section 751(a) were to be deemed waivable under the Program, the Separations Act would be violated.</p>

Therefore, the Statutory Construction Act of 1972 (“SCA”) controls. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1501 <em>et seq.</em>

      <em> </em>Under the SCA, “[t]he object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). “When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). When, however, the words of the statute are not explicit, the General Assembly’s intent is to be ascertained by considering matters other than statutory language. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c). These matters include the object to be attained by the statute, its contemporaneous legislative history, and the consequences of a particular interpretation. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(4),(6), (7). “Words and phrases shall be construed according to the rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). In construing a statute, a court may presume that the General Assembly intends the entire statute to be certain and effective, and intends to favor the public interest as against any private interest. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1),(5). Moreover, the SCA sets forth rules for a court <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>to follow when provisions in or among statutes are in conflict. 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1933-36.</p>
    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[97,478,1160,1879]]]'>Since Section 751(a) would be non-waivable without further analysis if this Court were to determine that the Section’s waiver would violate the admonition in the Education Empowerment Act that “nothing in [this Act, which includes the Mandate Waiver Program], shall be construed to supersede or abrogate” either Section 751(a) or Section 1 Separations Act, we turn to that provision first. 24 P.S. § 17-1715-B(2),(3). We observe that under common and approved usage, “supersede” means to “set aside, cease to employ”; that “abrogate” means to “repeal, annul or abolish”; and that “waive” means “to refrain from insisting upon or using.” <em>The </em>Oxford American Dictionary and Language Guide 1013, 3, 1138 (1999). Based on the plain meaning of these words, we find that the act of waiving a statutory mandate under the Mandate Waiver Program is simply not tantamount to the act of superseding or abrogating the mandate or the statute in which the mandate is found. The act of waiving a statutory mandate results in a temporary and limited suspension of the mandate’s legal force and effect when specified conditions are met; otherwise, the mandate controls. The act of superseding or abrogating a statutory mandate or statute renders it devoid of any further legal significance and impact in all instances thereafter. Therefore, we do not conclude that Section 17-1715-B, is a direction from the General Assembly that the Mandate Waiver Program must be read as precluding the waiver of the School Code’s separate contracts mandate in Section 751(a). 24 P.S. § 17-1715-B(2),(3). Rather, we conclude that Section 17-1715-B is a statement from the General Assembly meant to emphasize that there is indeed a difference between the waiver of a statutory mandate on the one hand and the abrogation or repeal of a statute on the other, and that even with the Mandate Waiver Program’s enactment, Section 751(a) of the School Code and Section 1 of the Separations Act remain part of the statutory law of Pennsylvania. <em>Id.</em>

The General Assembly’s intent in this regard is ascertainable from the statute’s words. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). That is, the words in the Separations Act are clear and explicit, stating that certain separate specifications and contracts are required for the construction of “any public building.” 71 P.S. § 1618. A public school is “any public building.” Thus, we conclude that the Separations Act applies to public school building construction contracts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Since subsection (a) of the Mandate Waiver Program states that “any provision” of the School Code may be waived, it is evident that Section 751(a) falls within the Program’s general rule of waiver. 24 P.S. § 17-1714-B(a). It is also evident that one of the Program’s exceptions to waiver, in which certain School Code provisions are designated as non-waivable does not apply, as Section 751(a) is not listed among them. 24 P.S. § 17-1714-B(g).</p>

While it is clear that the separate contracts mandate, part of the Separations Act, is a state law, <em>see </em>71 P.S. § 1618, and that the Separations Act is applicable to public school construction, <em>see supra </em>p. 235-37, 934 A.2d at 1269-70, it is not clear whether the Separations Act is within the School Code’s provisions. This is because <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>the Separations Act’s separate contracts mandate is incorporated into the School Code through Section 751(a)’s content, not by specific reference, and the General Assembly has not clarified whether this is sufficient to place the separate contracts mandate found in the Separations Act within the School Code provisions and therefore, beyond the Program’s Section 17-1714-B® exception.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Accordingly, the factors the Statutory Construction Act lists as sources of legislative intent when legislative intent cannot be ascertained from the words of a statute are appropriately consulted for the answer. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c).</p>

First, this construction of Section 17-1714-B® advances the object the Legislature sought to attain in the Program — “to allow school districts to operate in a more effective, efficient or economical manner.” 24 P.S. § 17-1714-B(a). <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(4). Second, it serves to narrow the exception’s application and permit the waiver of mandates more often. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(5). Third, in allowing the waiver of a mandate that is not listed in the Program as a nonwaivable School Code section, it gives effect to all of the Mandate Waiver Program’s provisions. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(1). Finally, it favors the public interest, by contributing to efficient and economical public school construction. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(5).

The Separations Act is a general statute, regulating the construction of all public buildings; the Mandate Waiver Program, found in the Code, is a specific statute, regulating the construction of public schools.

We think it important to note how the argument made by Appellants in these appeals that the Separations Act does not apply to public school construction contracts misses the mark. Appellants confuse the question of whether a particular statute applies to a subject matter with the questions of whether that statute is in conflict with another statute that applies to the same subject matter; whether applicable statutes conflict; whether the conflict between applicable statutes is irreconcilable; and whether one applicable statute will be construed to prevail over the other applicable statute. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1933-36.</p>

Referring specifically to the Commonwealth Court’s opinion in the MCA appeal on this point, we note that in its analysis, the Commonwealth Court quoted the words of Section 17-1714-B(i)'s exception, and concluded that the exception set forth an absolute rule that no general law that applies to public schools, like the Separations Act, may be waived under the Program. <em>Mechanical Contractors, </em><a href="/a2d/860/1145-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="860 A.2d 1145" data-case-ids="9150385" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/1145-01">860 A.2d at 1151</a>. The court’s conclusion that the Program absolutely precluded the waiver of any state law of general application was premised on an erroneous reading of the exception. That is, the court disregarded the words “not within the provisions of [the Code]” that follow the words “[t]he board ... may not waive any ... State law applicable to a public school...." 24 P.S. § 17-1714-B(i).</p>

For example, whereas the majority finds one potentially material aspect of the Mandate Waiver Program to be unambiguous by way of reference to a dictionary, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion at 235-37, 934 A.2d at 1269-70, I find the ambiguity that the majority ultimately recognizes to be more pervasive in the statute.

Absent such direction, I believe that it is appropriate to defer to the administrative interpretation, unless and until there is further direction from the Legislature. To the extent, moreover, that the Separations Act might independently apply notwithstanding any valid waiver of Section 751(a), I would conclude that the latter provision effectively replaces the former one for purposes of public school properties, as any other interpretation would render Section 751(a) of little practical effect. <em>See generally Allegheny County Sportsmen’s League v.
