In that case, the first named insured, Mr. Smith, purchased an automobile insurance policy in 1990 and executed a written waiver form rejecting all UIM coverage. Each renewal notice sent to him by his insurer included notice that the policy provided no UIM coverage. In 1994, the insured increased the limit of liability coverage at the same time he purchased an umbrella policy, however his automobile insurance policy remained in effect, and the policy number did not change.

Therefore, no new Section 1791 “Important Notice” was required. Moreover, the <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>Superior Court explained that the original decision to reject all UIM coverage was not drawn into question by a subsequent change in liability limits. <em><a href="/a2d/849/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="849 A.2d 277" data-case-ids="9239203" data-case-paths="/a2d/849/0277-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/849/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="849 A.2d 277" data-case-ids="9239203" data-case-paths="/a2d/849/0277-01">at 279, 281</a>.

In essence, the <em>Blood </em>court found that the purpose of requiring a written waiver of all UM/UIM coverage is tied to providing notice of available coverage to the insured. By contrast, the Superior Court, again relying on <em>Smith, </em>explained that the requirement of a written reduction in UM/UIM coverage limits is “to avoid confusion and litigation by providing a presumption that in the absence of an explicit written election, the ... coverage limit is equivalent to the liability coverage limit.” <em><a href="/a2d/894/0795-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="894 A.2d 795" data-case-ids="8435029" data-case-paths="/a2d/894/0795-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/894/0795-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="894 A.2d 795" data-case-ids="8435029" data-case-paths="/a2d/894/0795-01">at 798</a>.</p>

Therefore, absent a signed, written election for lesser coverage, the presumed [UM/UIM] coverage limit is the same as the bodily injury liability coverage limit.” <em>Blood, </em><a href="/a2d/894/0795-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="894 A.2d 795" data-case-ids="8435029" data-case-paths="/a2d/894/0795-01">894 A.2d at 798</a>.

Nor were these options marked to indicate a specific level of coverage.” <em><a href="/a2d/894/0795-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="894 A.2d 795" data-case-ids="8435029" data-case-paths="/a2d/894/0795-01">Id.</a> </em>The Superior Court pointed out that Old Guard could have protected itself from this analysis simply by requiring the Bloods to execute a new form indicating the UIM coverage they desired.</p>

The <em>Smith </em>decision, according to Old Guard, should not have been relied upon by the Superior Court for two reasons. First, <em>Smith </em>involved questions related to the outright rejection of all UM/UIM coverage. Thus, Old Guard posits that the <em>Smith </em>holding fails to provide a basis to <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>conclude that an express written election of coverage less than the liability limits should be summarily disregarded where, as here, the liability coverage is subsequently <em>reduced. </em>Second, Old Guard points out that the portion of the <em>Smith </em>holding cited by the Superior Court in this case was in <em>dicta, </em>and should not have been relied upon.</p>
    <p id="b236-4" data-blocks='[["BL_236.5",236,[290,633,1153,1285]]]'>Old Guard reads Section 1734 to require an insured who seeks reduced UM/UIM coverage to make their request in writing but, critically, “[t]he MVFRL does not specify when this request should be made or how it must be made,” and there is no expression in the MVFRL that such requests must be made whenever changes to liability limits are requested. Brief of Old Guard at 10, 12-13. “Rather, Sections 1731 and 1734 impose obligations in this respect only in connection with the issuance of policies, not changes to pre-existing policies.” <em>Id. </em>The form provided to the Bloods was used by Old Guard as both an application and a modification form, which does not violate any provision of the MVFRL. “[T]he selections made reflected only those coverages being changed.” <em>Id. </em>at 21 (citing the deposition testimony of the Bloods’ insurance agent, James Clapper). The Superior Court’s suggestion that the form was confusing is not persuasive in the face of the Bloods’ prior express written election of $35,000 in UM/UIM coverage and the fourteen years of renewal notices and premium payments, which reminded the insureds of the UM/UIM coverage limits in place. Moreover, we note that the selection of $300,000 in liability coverage was not the only change made by the Bloods on the coverage selection form executed in June 2000. Indeed, the Bloods also specifically rejected income loss benefits coverage by putting an “X” in that choice as well. R. 78a.</p>

In support of this conclusion, Old Guard points out that the Bloods enjoyed reduced premiums prior to the subject loss, and that the Superior Court erred in providing the Bloods with coverage for which they never paid. Old Guard insists that the intent of the insureds was obvious and is undisputed; they <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>made the reduction in liability coverage to reduce their insurance costs. Logically, the Bloods could not have desired or expected an increase in their UM/UIM coverage to derive from their undisputed intention to reduce their insurance costs. The Superior Court should have given effect to their change in coverage and not found an increase resulted from it. Similarly, Old Guard suggests that the decision of the Superi- or Court is in conflict with the broad cost containment policy that underlies the MVFRL. Brief of Appellant at 17.</p>

The change form provided the Bloods with the option to select $35,000 in UM/UIM coverage; they did not. Relying on his interpretation of the MVFRL, then, Appellee insists UM/UIM coverage equal to the new liability coverage limits was put into place by operation of statute, and that the remedy is the same as if the insurer had failed to comply with Sections 1731 and 1734 at the time of original coverage; the statutory default of UM/UIM coverage at liability limits is automatic.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Rather, Appellee insists the case presents a matter of statutory construction, and suggests this Court’s review be focused upon the language of the MVFRL and case law interpreting it, and the concomitant duties imposed upon insurers doing business in the Commonwealth. Therefore, the Superior Court properly relied upon the <em>Smith </em>case.
