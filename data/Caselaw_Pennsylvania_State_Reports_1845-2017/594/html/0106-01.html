Appellee first argues that the Commonwealth should not receive a second opportunity to present sentence enhancement evidence when it had a full and fair opportunity to do so at the initial sentencing hearing and failed to satisfy its burden. He relies on <em>Commonwealth v. McMullen, </em><a href="/a2d/745/0683-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="745 A.2d 683" data-case-ids="11480178" data-case-paths="/a2d/745/0683-01">745 A.2d 683</a> (Pa.Super.2000), <em>alloc, denied, </em><a href="/citations/?q=563%20Pa.%20700" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="563 Pa. 700">563 Pa. 700</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=761%20A.2d%20549" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="761 A.2d 549">761 A.2d 549</a> (2000), for the proposition that double jeopardy is violated when an appellate court finds insufficient evidence to sustain the verdict. He maintains that when the <em>Wilson I, </em>court reversed his sentence due to the insufficiency of evidence supporting the enhancement, he was in fact “acquitted” of the enhancement and should be resentenced without reference to the enhancement provision. In support of the proposition that enhancement evidence cannot be presented on remand, Appellee relies on the mandatory minimum sentencing provision of Section 6317 of the Crimes Code, which he argues requires the presentation of enhancement evidence at the <em>initial </em>sentencing hearing. He further relies on the Superior Court’s decisions in <em>Commonwealth v. Kunkle, <a href="/a2d/817/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="817 A.2d 498" data-case-ids="9365812" data-case-paths="/a2d/817/0498-01">supra,</a> </em>and, <em>Commonwealth v.

The Defender Association argues that, as a matter of sound judicial policy, the Commonwealth should not be permitted to make repeated attempts to impose a sentence enhancement because it is a waste of judicial resources, subjects the accused to embarrassment and expense, and causes the accused to live in a state of anxiety. It further contends that the Commonwealth waived its right to present evidence of sentence enhancement by electing not to do so at the first sentencing hearing. Finally, the Defender Association argues that allowing the presentation of enhancement evidence at the resentencing hearing gives the Commonwealth a windfall from the sentencing court’s error at the original sentencing hearing.</p>
