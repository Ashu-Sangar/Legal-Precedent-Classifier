She asked the Commonwealth Court to reject the Commission’s claim that it lacks <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>jurisdiction over Tioga and hold that the Commission’s own regulations as well as its statutory mandate require enforcement of the relevant provisions against Tioga. The Commonwealth Court denied Seeton relief on the basis that the Commission’s interpretations of its own administrative provisions were not inconsistent with the Game and Wildlife Code and therefore are entitled to a court’s deference. Because we find that the Commission’s interpretation of its own regulation is inconsistent with its plain language and irreconcilable with the legislative intent manifest in the Game and Wildlife Code, we reverse.</p>

Seeton contends that “[a]nimals used in canned hunts are often drugged, tied to stakes or lured to feeding stations in order to further assure that the ‘hunter’ will get the guaranteed kill that has been promised by the hunting preserve’s proprietor.” Complaint in Mandamus at 2, ¶ 6.</p>

By responsive letter, the Commission’s Chief Counsel rejected Seeton’s contention that the animals hunted at the Preserve, including wild boar,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> were <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>“protected mammals” pursuant to the Commission’s regulations promulgated under the Game and Wildlife Code. <em>See </em>58 Pa.Code § 133.1.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In particular, the Commission observed that the term “wild mammals” as used in § 133.1 is defined nowhere in the Game and Wildlife Code or the Commission’s regulations. The Commission, resorting to a dictionary definition of the word “wild,” thus opined that “wild mammals” must apply only to “mammals that are currently living in a state of nature,” Commission Letter to Seeton, 4/29/03 (internal quotation marks omitted), which “excludes mammals that are currently living in a state of captivity, either in pens or within enclosures.” <em>Id. </em>Because the animals at the Preserve are kept within enclosures, the Commission concluded that they are not “wild” for purposes of the Game and Wildlife Code and regulations issued thereunder; rather, they are “the personal property of their owners.” <em>Id.</em>

She averred that she had taxpayer standing pursuant to this Court’s decision in <em>In re Application of Biester, </em><a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">487 Pa. 438</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="487 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1759111" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0438-01">409 A.2d 848</a> (1979) (granting taxpayers standing to challenge government action where no one is better situated to challenge that action and it will otherwise evade judicial review).

    <p id="b643-4" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[123,446,1156,685]]]'>In her Complaint, Seeton averred that the Commission is aware of Tioga’s ongoing violations of the Game and Wildlife Code, including the restraint and drugging or luring of prey to facilitate a kill by a hunter who has paid for the privilege. She further asserted that the wild boar hunted at Tioga are “protected mammals” under the Game and Wildlife Code and the Commission’s regulations. Because “protected mammals” may be hunted only pursuant to express provisions of the Game and Wildlife Code or the Commission’s regulations, <em>see </em>58 Pa.Code § 133.1, and because neither the Game and Wildlife Code nor the Commission’s regulations authorize the hunting of boar, Seeton asserted that Tioga is in violation of § 133.1.</p>

It emphasized that its interpretation of the Game Code is entitled to administrative deference. <em>Id. </em>at 2, ¶ 7.

The court found tenable Seeton’s interpretation that wild boar are “protected mammals” subject to the Commission’s protection under 58 Pa.Code § 133.1, but it found equally tenable the Commission’s interpretation that the term “protected mammals,” which includes “wild mammals” under § 133.1, does not apply to wild boar contained in enclosures, because by definition a penned animal cannot be “wild.” Finding both interpretations “reasonable” under the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, the court determined that it was bound to defer to the Commission’s account. <em>See Bethenergy Mines, Inc., v.

      <em>In re Biester </em>spoke principally to the importance of assuring that a government agency’s actions not evade review for want of an aggrieved party under the limited terms of traditional standing.

As noted, <em>supra </em>n. 11, we reject the Commission’s attempt to identify wild boar as “domestic” by reclassifying it without any authority, legal or taxonomical, as a member of the supposed “pig family.” Thus, wild boar necessarily are “wild animals” under the Game and Wildlife Code. If they are “wild animals” pursuant to the Game and Wildlife Code, however, it is difficult to see how they are not also “wild mammals” pursuant to 58 Pa.Code § 133.1.

Thus, while the Commission is correct that the term “wild mammals” is not itself defined by either the Game and Wildlife Code or the Commission’s regulations, it is not wholly undetermined within the statutory scheme. Rather, “wild mammals” plainly are a subset of the term “wildlife.” Thus, whatever is true of “wildlife” must also be true of “wild mammals,” barring an explicit statutory exception. Interestingly, 34 Pa.C.S. § 2163(b) prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>the release within the Commonwealth of “imported game or wildlife <em>or game or wildlife reared in captivity </em>” (emphasis added). This provision undermines the Commission’s claims regarding the meaning of the word “wild” in at least two dimensions. First, insofar as “wildlife” is defined to include “wild animals” and “wild mammals,” as explained above, the notion of “wildlife reared in captivity” (which posits the prospect of “wild animals” and “wild mammals” reared in captivity), is wholly <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>antithetical to the Commission’s attempt to tie the word “wild” to the degree of freedom enjoyed by a given animal. Similarly, it is impossible to “release” “wildlife” (and hence “wild animals” and “wild mammals”), the activity proscribed in the abovementioned section, if the animal’s liberty is a necessary condition to its status as “wild,” since one cannot release an animal from a non-captive state.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

In the same connection, the Commission directs the Court's attention to 34 Pa.C.S. § 2102(c)(Transporlation, sale and disturbance of game or wildlife.), which provides, “The commission shall promulgate regulations concerning the transportation, introduction into the wild, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale or purchase of game or wildlife or the disturbing of game or wildlife in their natural habitat." This provision, however, is more supportive of Seeton’s position inasmuch as it calls upon the Commission to regulate the transportation and importation, <em>inter alia, </em>of "game or wildlife,” matters that may be involved in the provision of non-indigenous boars for canned hunting in the instant case. Presumably, based upon the Commission’s interpretation of the statute, boar transported or imported into the Commonwealth for the purposes of canned hunting are never "wild” based upon the Commission's understanding of that word — because during such <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>transport they never roam free "in a stale of nature” — and hence are never protected, a conclusion patently at odds with the plain language of § 2102(c). Moreover, the fact that the General Assembly modified "wildlife” with the clause “in their natural habitat” suggests that wildlife no1 subject to this particular provision need not be so found to retain its "wild” character, as we presume that the General Assembly intends each word of a statute to be given effect. 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1921, 1922(2).</p>

Presumably, the Commission's claim regarding living in the wild is used strictly to complement the assertion of non-indigenousness, since there can be no dispute that, in certain habitats, boar live “in the wild.” Indeed, wild boar are so named because, unlike their domesticated cousins in the <em>sus </em>genus, they are not readily amenable to domestication as that word is commonly understood.</p>

Section 1991, in identifying equine and bovine animals as larger categories, while specifying sheep, goat, and pig more narrowly, suggests that we should not read it to encompass all members of the relevant <em>Sus </em>genus, <em>of </em>which pigs are but one variety. <em>See </em>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax. cgi?mode=Undef&amp;id=9822&amp;lvl=3&amp;keep= l&amp;srchmode= l&amp;unlock, <em>Iasi reviewed, </em>July 26, 2007 (National Center for Biotechnology Information page identifying various species and subspecies of the genus <em>Sus); see also </em>American Heritage College Dictionary 1567 (4th ed.)(defining a “wild boar” as <em>“Sus scrofa," </em>"the ancestor of the domestic pig”). As evinced by the legislature's selection of the categorical terms "equine” and “bovine” in the same provision, it is entirely capable of using broader terms when it so intends; yet it did not do so with respect to pigs. Consequently, we cannot agree that wild boar are domestic animals under § 1991.</p>

This Court has never expressly adopted this limitation of <em>Chevron </em>deference, but its eminent sensibility, indeed the necessity of qualifying such deference, could not ask for a better illustration than this case, in which, according to the Commission, a feral beast such as a boar is not “wild” once it is enclosed, and a "wild mammal” is not necessarily a "wild animal.” Indeed, we appear never to have explicitly adopted even <em>Chevron’s </em>general rule in the context of state administrative law.
