    <p id="b698-9" data-blocks='[["BL_698.9",698,[284,942,1156,852]]]'>Sometime before midnight on January 17, 1998, Appellant, Andrea Kinney, and Michael Mobley summoned an unlicensed taxicab, or a hack, to take them from North to West Philadelphia, in the vicinity of 60th and Market Streets. Kinney and Mobley separated from Appellant briefly. When they regrouped, Appellant complained that he had been “stolen” or “sucker punched” by a person whom he had previously robbed. Appellant, Kinney, and'Mobley returned to the hack and, at Appellant’s direction, the driver set out in pursuit. When he saw his quarry, twenty-two-year-old Donald Burroughs, Jr., Appellant exited the vehicle and gave chase on foot. Kinney and Mobley followed at some point and heard Appellant fire a shot. Appellant said, “Look up at me,” and fired two more shots, and Mr. Burroughs was fatally wounded in the encounter. Appellant, Kinney, and Mobley left in the hack and subsequently fled to Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
    <p id="b698-10" data-blocks='[["BL_698.10",698,[283,1820,1157,258]]]'>The police investigation soon centered on Appellant, Kinney, and Mobley. Kinney was interviewed by homicide detectives after he returned to Philadelphia, and he provided a statement implicating Appellant. After an arrest warrant was issued, Appellant was detained and returned to Pennsylvania.</p>

Appellant’s counsel advanced an oral motion <em>in limine </em>to pre<a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>elude at least a portion of this line of questioning, on the basis that it was irrelevant, outside the scope of discovery, and constituted impermissible hearsay. The trial court denied the motion, and the Commonwealth presented testimony from the victim’s father, Donald Burroughs, Sr., his sister, Martina Burroughs, and Saltzer Davis, a police officer and long-time friend of the victim’s, which included various hearsay references to the victim’s complaints of having been robbed, assaulted, and bullied by Appellant since childhood. The Commonwealth also adduced testimony from Kinney, Mobley, and the hack driver, who all implicated Appellant as the killer. Several residents testified to having heard the gunshots, with one having seen Appellant returning to the hack after the shooting, and another having overheard the statement, “Look up at me,” between the first shot and the next two. Police officers and detectives described the response to the shooting and the course of their investigation and read Kinney’s and Mobley’s statements into the record. A ballistics expert confirmed that the two bullet wounds to the victim’s body were fired from the same gun, and a medical examiner offered a description of the victim’s wounds, one of which included a piercing of the victim’s heart. Finally, Kinney’s brother testified that, while in jail, Appellant indicated that he would beat him and arrange for Kinney to be stabbed if Kinney continued to “snitch.”</p>

A police officer who investigat<a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>ed the other robbery related that the victim was covered with a coat, held by force, and told that he would be shot in the head if he did not cooperate. Appellant sought to establish two mitigating factors, his age at the time of the offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4), and the catch-all mitigator, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8).</p>

After inquiring as to the nature of the jury’s numerical division, the court declared that insufficient time had been dedicated to the deliberative effort and instructed the jurors to, “[g]o back, have open minds, try to deliberate and see if you can make the agreement unanimous.” The jury returned approximately three hours later with a unanimous verdict for death. According to the foreperson, the jury unanimously found the aggravating factor and no mitigating factors. <em>See </em>N.T., July 2,1999, at 7-8.</p>

According to Appellant, the Commonwealth was able to establish motive via the testimony from Kinney, Mobley, and the hack driver to the effect that Appellant had indicated that Mr. Burroughs had hit him, and that Appellant described Mr. Burroughs as someone he had previously robbed.

In this regard, he observes that the Commonwealth must demonstrate that the killing was willful, deliberate, and pre-meditated. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2503(a). Thus, Appellant argues that it is the defendant’s state of mind, rather than the victim’s, that is relevant in proving that Appellant committed a willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing. Moreover, Appellant explains that he did not present any defense, such as self defense or accident, that would implicate the victim’s state of mind. <em>See Brown, </em><a href="/f2d/490/0758-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="490 F.2d 758" data-case-ids="228596,3679462" data-case-paths="/f2d/490/0758-01,/us-app-dc/160/0190-01">490 F.2d at 767</a> (explaining that state of mind evidence is relevant where an issue of self defense, suicide, or accidental death is raised by the defendant). Instead, Appellant’s defense strategy was to attempt to establish reasonable doubt as to the identity of the shooter. Unlike self defense, this strategy does not involve any issue concerning the victim’s state of mind.

Although the credibility of these witnesses before the jury might have been impacted by their involvement in pursuing the victim, notably, Appellant’s presence in the vicinity of the killing immediately after the shots were fired was corroborated by an independent witness. Moreover, Appellant presented no evidence to counter the Commonwealth’s presentation in these regards. <em>Compare Young, </em>561 Pa. at 87, <a href="/a2d/748/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="748 A.2d 166" data-case-ids="11453899,93396" data-case-paths="/a2d/748/0166-01,/pa/561/0034-01">748 A.2d at </a><a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a><a href="/a2d/748/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="748 A.2d 166" data-case-ids="11453899,93396" data-case-paths="/a2d/748/0166-01,/pa/561/0034-01">194</a> (finding that an error could not be deemed harmless, where the Commonwealth’s central evidence was contradicted, <em>inter alia, </em>by testimony from the defendant). In terms of the degree of prejudicial effect, it is also significant that the improperly admitted hearsay evidence was substantially similar to evidence that was properly admitted in the case. This included testimony from the victim’s sister and Officer Davis that was based on first-hand knowledge,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> as well as Kinney’s, Mobley’s, and the hack driver’s testimony that Appellant indicated that he had previously robbed the victim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Indeed, in his brief, Appellant suggests that the latter line of evidence substantially overlapped with the testimony of the victim’s father, sister, and friend. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 10 (“The Commonwealth had three other witnesses — Andrae Kinney, Michael Mobley and [the hack driver] — who virtually echoed one another in their assertions that Appellant had admitted that he robbed the deceased previously, that the deceased sucker punched him, and that Appellant would track him down and shoot him.

To the extent the <em>Laich </em>footnote would enact such an absolutist proposition, I think it warrants revisiting. First, <em>Laich </em>failed to appreciate that this Court’s Rules of Evidence are largely a codification of ease precedent. The Rules are not legislation. The same practical logic and sense of proportion that led to recognition of Forfeiture by Wrongdoing in instances of witness elimination applies anytime a defendant raises a hearsay objection premised upon the unavailability of a witness he unlawfully killed. The <em>Laich </em>view presumes that the law of evidence is immutable. I would decline to treat <em>Laich </em>as a quasi-legislative rule.</p>

Only the defendant knows for certain the reason or reasons why he murdered the victim. He cannot be made to explain why he committed the murder, and even if he could, he would be unreliable. Thanks to the defendant, the victim, of course, is unavailable to shed light on the matter. <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>The distinction identified by <em>Lciich </em>is, in my view, artificial and non-responsive to the circumstance presented in these cases. By definition, murdering a person renders him unable to testify against the killer in court. I would not make the standard of admissibility further dependent upon Laieh-like speculation concerning a murderer’s motive. I continue to vote to end the absurdity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
