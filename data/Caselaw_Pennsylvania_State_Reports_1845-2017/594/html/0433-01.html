He also filed a timely statement of financial interests pursuant to Section 1105 of the Ethics Act, which requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that a candidate disclose the names and addresses of all direct and indirect sources of income. Cindy Bass, as objector, then filed a petition to strike Paulmier’s nomination petition, alleging that the statement of financial interests contained material defects and/or omissions that would require Paulmier’s name to be removed from the ballot. Specifically, Bass complained that <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>Paulmier had not disclosed the addresses of certain rental properties and the names of those tenants who had paid Paulmier $1,300 or more in the previous year.

He submits that he did not understand or believe that the form required that he list the names of his individual tenants or the addresses of his rental properties. He contends that an attorney, accountant, self-employed shop owner or contractor would only have to list their income and not every client or person who bought a product from them. This is because a self-employed person lists the name of his business as the <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>source of his income, not the name of each customer who paid the self-employed person more than $1,300 per year.</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[286,443,1160,1202]]]'>Paulmier then submits that even if his interpretation of the disclosure requirement was incorrect, his statement of financial interest was subject to amendment. He argues that when the information on the face of the form is technically deficient, but still sufficient to give notice of the source of income, this Court created a right to amend and bring the financial statement into full compliance with the requirements of the Ethics Act in <em>Benninghoff, </em><a href="/pa/578/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="852 A.2d 1182" data-case-ids="1329325,9239204" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0402-01,/a2d/852/1182-01">852 A.2d at 1182</a>. Paulmier contends that he provided the pertinent information about the source of his income as a sole proprietor who managed rental properties, distinguishing this case from the facts that constituted a fatal defect in <em>Anastasio, </em><a href="/a2d/820/0880-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="820 A.2d 880" data-case-ids="9313208" data-case-paths="/a2d/820/0880-01">820 A.2d at 881</a>, and in <em>Littlepage, </em><a href="/pa/589/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="909 A.2d 1235" data-case-ids="2574778,8461650" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0455-01,/a2d/909/1235-01">909 A.2d at 1237</a>, where the candidates listed “none” in block 10 of their financial statements, even though both candidates did receive income. Paulmier further notes that his disclosure on the statement of financial interests form was sufficient to give any reviewer notice of his ownership of rental properties, which would allow the reviewer to consult the public record for further information. Having given proper notice, Paulmier argues that if this Court finds that his first disclosure did not fully comply with the Act, then we should accept his timely amendment in which he disclosed the names and addresses of his individual tenants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

As Paulmier failed to do that, he did not comply with the Ethics Act. Further, his statement is not subject to amendment, because unlike the candidate in <em>Benninghoff, </em>the addresses of Paulmier’s rental properties and the names of his tenants cannot be obtained from the information stated on the face of the financial statement, nor is such information a matter of public record.

Therefore, when a candidate like Paulmier receives over $1,300 dollars in a year from a specific source, he must identify the source, either the business or individual, who made that particular contribution to his income. Notably, in the case of rental income, the statutory definitions are written so broadly that there are two distinct sources to which a candidate like Paulmier might attribute his income. A “source” is any individual who provides income, and as Paulmier has 13 tenants who each pay him more than $1,300 a year in rental fees, each tenant is a statutorily defined source of Paulmier’s income. At the same time, the statute also defines “source” as a business which includes a sole proprietorship or self-employed individual. A sole proprietorship references an “individual” who is an “owner of a business establishment.” The Random House Dictionary. A self-employed individual is one who “earn[s] one’s living directly from one’s own profession or business, rather than as an employee earning salary or commission from another.” <em><a href="/pa/591/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="919 A.2d 922" data-case-ids="3016407,8328925" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0490-01,/a2d/919/0922-01">Id.</a> </em>The rents Paulmier receives <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>come to him as a self-employed business owner of rental properties, not as salary from an employer. Further, by statutory definition, his self-employment is a business which is a source of his income. Therefore, the Ethics Act has defined “source” in a manner that shows that the same contribution to income, in this case a year’s worth of rent, can be attributed to two, distinct, statutorily defined persons, one a business or sole proprietorship, and the other an individual, the renter who pays Paulmier over $1,300 of rent in a year. This same scenario would be true for any other self-employed individual such as a doctor, lawyer, plumber, freelance writer or store owner.</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[280,985,1161,1167]]]'>This raises the question of which source to disclose. Section 1105 demands the disclosure of “any direct or indirect source of income.” As previously stated, “source” is a “person who contributes [income],” and “person” is any “individual or business.” 65 Pa.C.S. § 1105(b)(5) (emphasis added). Therefore, the Legislature’s words, upon incorporating the statutory definition, are a demand for the disclosure of “any direct or indirect contribution of income from an individual or business.” The word “or” is defined as a conjunction “used to connect words, phrases, or clauses representing alternatives.” The Random House Dictionary. In other words, “or” is disjunctive. It means one or the other of two or more alternatives. So it would seem that the Legislature intended that with respect to a specific contribution to income, in this case a year’s worth of rental payments, a candidate must disclose that contribution’s source, and when that same contribution to income has more than one statutorily defined source, the candidate may list either the individual or business that serves as a source of that income.

Specifically, it was my belief that permitting candidates to amend errors of complete omission would undermine the Ethics Act’s goal of full financial disclosure by allowing those who omitted material information the ability to either wait-out the period for challenge in the hope that they would not “get caught”, or, if “caught”, simply supply the information on an amended form, rendering their initial omis<a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>sions harmless error.

Strict interpretation of the fatality rule has resulted in the child’s game of “gotcha” through far too many challenges based upon technical omissions, without regard to whether they were made through oversight, misunderstanding of the instructions or simple inadvertence, as opposed to bad faith. This Court’s upholding of these challenges has resulted in preventing potential candidates from running for office; a result directly in tension with the Election Code’s goals. <em>See e.g. Littlepage, </em><a href="/pa/589/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="589 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="2574778" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0455-01">589 Pa. 455</a>, <a href="/pa/589/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="909 A.2d 1235" data-case-ids="2574778,8461650" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0455-01,/a2d/909/1235-01">909 A.2d 1235</a> (2006) (despite trial court finding that candidate’s omission on his financial disclosure form did not reflect bad faith, candidate was struck from the ballot based upon strict reading of the fatality rule).</p>

From my perspective, however, this Court’s plain-meaning approach to the statutory fatal-defect rule was, and remains, an entirely reasonable application of settled principles of statutory interpretation. The relevant statutory provision prescribes that, “failure to file the statement [of financial interests] in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to any other penalties provided, be a fatal defect to a petition to appear on the ballot.” 65 Pa.C.S. § 1104(b)(3). In case after case over the past four years, this Court has recognized that “the provisions of this chapter,” <em>i.e., </em>the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act (the “Act”), include Section 1105, which sets forth the required content of a statement of financial interests. <em>See </em>65 Pa.C.S. § 1105(b).</p>

However, such interpretation is facially inconsistent with the plain meaning of the fatal defect rule, which, again, applies when a statement is not filed “in accordance with the provisions of this <em>chapter.” </em>65 Pa.C.S. § 1104(b)(3) (emphasis added). Had the Legislature meant to confine its application to timing issues, it would have been a simple matter to say so directly, or to merely require filing “in accordance with the provisions of this section” (as the timing <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>requirements are self-contained within the same section of the Act as the fatal defect provision), rather than “in accordance with the provisions of this chapteras is actually prescribed. 65 Pa.C.S. § 1104(b)(3) (emphasis added).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

Indeed, in the sentence immediately preceding the fatal defect provision, the Legislature demonstrated its ready ability to make direct reference to the paragraphs of Section 1104 governing timing. <em>See </em>65 Pa.C.S. § 1104(b)(3) (“No petition to appear on the ballot for election shall be accepted by the respective State or local election officials unless the petition has appended thereto a statement of financial interests <em>as set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2).” </em>(emphasis added)). To the degree that the majority is focusing on the word “filed” within the fatal defect rule, it is common to use the term to ensure compliance with a broad range of requirements. For example, when Pennsylvania courts indicate that a pleading is to be "filed in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure,” they are not merely indicating that the pleading must be filed on time.</p>
