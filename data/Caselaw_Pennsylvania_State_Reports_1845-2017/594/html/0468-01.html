In Count I of the Petition, PEDP asks that this Court review the constitutionality of a Philadelphia ordinance (“Ordinance”) that changed the zoning designation of property (“Property”) it owns and on which a licensed gaming facility has been located under the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act (“Gaming Act” or “Act”), 4 Pa.C.S. § 1101 <em>et seq. </em>In Count II of the Petition, PEDP asks this Court for a writ of mandamus to compel the City to issue it certain zoning permits.

In July of 2004, the General Assembly enacted the Gaming Act, a statute that provides for slot machine gaming at a set number of licensed facilities within the Commonwealth. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1102. The Act established the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (“Board”), and empowers it to issue slot machine licenses at its discretion. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1202(b)(12). The Act provides for three types of slot machine licenses, designated by category. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1301. Each category permits an entity or person to apply to the Board for a license, and upon issuance, authorizes the placement and operation of slot machines at a licensed facility. <em>Id. </em>Under the Act, two Category 2 licensed facilities are to be located by the Board within a city of the first class. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1304(b).

Chapter 14-400 is intended to encourage the orderly development of major entertainment facilities in Philadelphia, including gaming facilities, through the establishment of “Commercial Entertainment District[s]” (“CEDs”). Under the Chapter, the developer of a lot in a CED submits a plan of development to Philadelphia’s Planning Commission, which is reviewed for compliance with the regulations set forth in Chapter 14-400. The plan is also submitted for approval to City Council. City Council designates a CED by ordinance in appropriate areas of Philadelphia. Upon CED designation, all underlying zoning classifications on a piece of property are superseded. The developer submits a permit application to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission reviews the application for compliance with the approved plan of development. Once the Planning Commission confirms compliance, the Department is authorized to issue the necessary building and zoning permits for the CED.</p>

City Council </em>”), <a href="/pa/593/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="928 A.2d 1255" data-case-ids="3250615,8357864" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0241-01,/a2d/928/1255-01">928 A.2d 1255</a> (2007) — a case in which I was in a dissenting posture.

City Council. </em>In my view, <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>however, it is difficult, if not impossible, to square today’s decision with the majority view in <em>PGCB v. City Council. </em>This creates a jurisprudential conundrum for this author. Ordinarily, notwithstanding my dissent in <em>PGCB v. City Council, </em>principles of <em>stare decisis </em>would oblige me to follow the prevailing law. I could dissent here, and insist upon the logical application and extension of the prior decision. However, I am not particularly inclined to insist upon application of the earlier decision which I believe was erroneous — especially where the Court majority from the prior case fails to so insist. Moreover, it is becoming apparent that the Gaming Act cases, at least in their early stages, are <em>sui generis. </em>Perhaps, then, this case has simply revealed the judicial “fits and starts,” <em>see Riverwalk Casino, LP v. Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, </em><a href="/pa/592/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="592 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="3555907" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0505-01">592 Pa. 505</a>, <a href="/pa/592/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="926 A.2d 926" data-case-ids="3555907,8375605" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0505-01,/a2d/926/0926-01">926 A.2d 926</a>, 953 (2007) (Castille, J., dissenting) that are inevitable in explicating a new review paradigm. I write separately precisely because I view today’s decision as a departure from our recent precedent, and I believe that, in order to avoid confusion for the bench and bar, and to avoid unsettling the expectations of litigants, such departures, particularly from recent decisions, should be acknowledged and explained.</p>

Majority Op. at 480, 937 A.2d at 392. The circumstances described by the Majority, unlike those in <em>PGCB v. City Council, </em>readily fall within the text of Section 1506. The Majority, however, disposes of PEDP’s first claim as unripe for adjudication and its second claim as outside this Court’s jurisdiction, an overall far more restrained jurisprudential approach than was applied in <em>PGCB v. City Council. </em>Hence my concurrence.</p>

City Council </em>was two steps removed from actuality, as opposed to a single promissory step in this case. In <em>PGCB v. City Council, </em>Philadelphia City Council passed an ordinance that would have allowed the electorate to participate in the legislative process by weighing in on a question concerning whether City Council should facilitate state-ordained slot machine gambling. The proposal would not have affected any gaming facility, or the statewide slot machine empire, unless (1) the electorate voted a certain way, and (2) City Council acted upon the measure thereby obstructing the implementation of the Board’s statutory authority. This Court stretched the scope of “substantial and immediate interest” to find standing in the Gaming Board, an administrative agency, to suppress the electoral process and strike the ballot measure, reasoning that the mere passage of the ordinance providing for the ballot question was somehow an impermissible infringement upon the agency’s rulemaking authority. <em>See PGCB v. City Council, </em><a href="/pa/593/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="928 A.2d 1255" data-case-ids="3250615,8357864" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0241-01,/a2d/928/1255-01">928 A.2d at 1265-1266</a>. Additionally, the majority held that the challenge to the ballot question in <em>PGCB v. City Council </em>was ripe for adjudication, <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>before any vote had been cast. <em><a href="/pa/593/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="928 A.2d 1255" data-case-ids="3250615,8357864" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0241-01,/a2d/928/1255-01">Id.</a> </em>In the present case, we are faced with a challenge levied, not by a bureaucratic entity, but by the actual party awarded the casino license. That party has just seen its approved property reverse spot-zoned (or so it says) to prevent it from building the casino it was licensed by the Board to build. The obstructionist ordinance thus actually exists here, where the alleged obstruction had not yet come into existence in <em>PGCB v. City Council. </em>Yet this case is deemed unripe, Majority Op. at 483, 937 A.2d at 394, where the prior one was ripe-and so ripe as to warrant unprecedented interference with the democratic process to boot. The Majority’s discussion on facial versus as-applied challenges does not change the fact that, in the real world, it is difficult to see how the challenge here is unripe if the ripeness holding in <em>PGCB v. City Council </em>is still deemed valid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> I concur in the result on ripeness only because I view today’s decision as an implicit disapproval of <em>PGCB v. City Council. </em>What is unfortunate is that, if this Court was destined to be wrong in one of these cases, the error involved suppression of the people’s bedrock right to express their opinion through the ballot.</p>

Respecting the Majority’s distinction between a facial challenge and an as-applied challenge, see Majority Op. at 481, n. 7, 937 A.2d at 392, n. 7, such is as much a matter of characterization as it is of substance. One could frame today's challenge as a facial challenge also merely by using the reasoning of <em>PGCB v. City </em>Council: given the city’s initial zoning scheme, the Board’s approval, and PEDP’s development plan, the very presence of the new residential zoning classification, as well as the fact that it "spot-zones” PEDP's property, impermissibly infringes upon the rights of PEDP. One could, at the same time, as readily frame the challenge to the ballot question in <em>PGCB v. City Council </em>as an as-applied challenge: <em>i.e., </em>the Board’s authority could only have been impinged if the Philadelphia electorate voted a certain way. Furthermore, not only is it difficult to square the ripeness analysis here with that in <em>PGCB v.
