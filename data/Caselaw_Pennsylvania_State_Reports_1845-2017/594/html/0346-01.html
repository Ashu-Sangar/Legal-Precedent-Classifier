Troutman, Clerk of Courts of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (“Appellant” or “Troutman”) to an administrative order entered in that court directing him to seal certain records in his custody. For the following reasons, we hold that the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County possessed original jurisdiction to entertain Troutman’s exceptions, and the Commonwealth Court had appellate jurisdiction to review an appeal of the dismissal of those exceptions. We also find that Troutman lacked standing to bring such an action. Therefore, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b425-8" data-blocks='[["BL_425.9",425,[103,1440,1158,629]]]'>The facts underlying this appeal are as follows. On August 27, 2003, the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County modified the form “Order for Dismissal and Expungement” used for criminal defendants who have successfully completed the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (“ARD”) program. As modified, the Order for Dismissal and Expungement mandates: “The Clerk of Courts shall seal the entire record and Court Information Management shall seal the electronic records to prohibit public access to them.” Approximately two months later, on November 3, 2003, Administrative Judge of the Court of Common Pleas Scott D. Keller issued an administrative order which stated:</p>

    <p id="b426-6" data-blocks='[["BL_426.6",426,[285,497,1159,466]]]'>Nine days later, Troutman filed “exceptions” in the Court of Common Pleas to the Order, arguing that it violated the Criminal History Record Information Act (“CHRIA”), 18 Pa. C.S. §§ 9101-9183. Specifically, Troutman contended that CHRIA prohibits the expungement of criminal records maintained by the court. Thus, by mandating the expungement of records of those who successfully completed the ARD program, the Order was, in Troutman’s view, inconsistent with and in violation of CHRIA.</p>
    <p id="b426-7" data-blocks='[["BL_426.7",426,[282,996,1159,310]]]'>After a hearing before a three-judge panel, the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County dismissed Troutman’s exceptions. It held that CHRIA does not apply to court records; that the expungement of ARD defendants’ criminal records was lawful; and moreover, that Troutman lacked standing to challenge the Order.</p>
    <p id="b426-8" data-blocks='[["BL_426.8",426,[281,1332,1156,684]]]'>The Commonwealth Court, <em>en banc, </em>affirmed the Court of Common Pleas’ dismissal of Troutman’s exceptions in an opinion authored by President Judge James Gardner Colins. The court first found that Troutman lacked standing to challenge the Order. In support of this conclusion, the court opined that CHRIA confers no authority on clerks of court to enforce its provisions or to exercise any independent discretion. As such, Troutman had no basis on which to lodge a challenge to the Order. The Commonwealth Court also found that it had jurisdiction to consider Troutman’s challenge as the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County’s ruling was a final order subject to appellate review by the Commonwealth Court. 42 Pa.C.S. § 762.</p>

She interpreted the relief sought by Troutman as attempting to restrain the Court of Common Pleas from carrying out its <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>Order. According to the dissent, such a restraint requires a writ of prohibition and only the Supreme Court has the authority of prohibition over a court of common pleas.

According to Troutman, his exceptions to the Order constitute actions or proceedings by a government officer acting in his official capacity. As such, it would have been proper for him to file his exceptions in either the Berks County Court of Common Pleas or the Commonwealth Court. By extension, Troutman argues that as the Court of Common Pleas had original jurisdiction over this matter, it was properly before the Commonwealth Court pursuant to its appellate jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.6",428,[292,1243,1154,681]]]'>Similarly, Appellee Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, represented by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, likewise contends that it had jurisdiction over Trout-man’s exceptions. It explains that under 42 Pa.C.S. § 931, the courts of common pleas have very broad and general jurisdiction. Further, the Court of Common Pleas argues, that a court of common pleas has jurisdiction over ARD defendants, thus it also has jurisdiction to issue and enforce administrative orders governing their records. This includes the jurisdiction to hear challenges to such orders. Finally, the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County believes that the Commonwealth Court properly exercised appellate jurisdiction over the proceedings.</p>

Therefore, this question involves a matter of statutory construction. With respect to matters of statutory construction, we employ the Statutory Construction Act of 1972. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1501 et seq. Under the now well-known tenets of the Statutory Construction Act “[t]he object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly!,]” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). The Act counsels that “[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). When the words of a statute are not explicit, the General Assembly’s intent is to be ascertained by considering matters other than statutory language, like the occasion and necessity for the statute; the circumstances of its enactment; the object it seeks to attain; the mischief to be remedied; former laws; consequences of a particular interpretation; contemporaneous legislative history; and legislative and administrative interpretations. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c). <em>Pa.

Furthermore, it is beyond peradventure that the Court of Common Pleas had jurisdiction to issue the ARD enforcement-related Order.

Indeed, I concur in the panel’s assessment that the Clerk’s legal challenge is “frivolous, scarcely based in the law, and wholly without merit.” Trial Ct. Op., 6/7/04, 1. Moreover, many of the points cited by the Majority in explaining why the Court denies appellant standing serve better to explain why appellant’s merits position fails.</p>

To be more specific, although the majority observes that the clerk’s duties are ministerial in nature, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, <em>Op. </em>at 360 - 61, 936 A.2d at 9, this does not mean that the clerk has no role in construing any enactment, as he plainly must be able to understand his duties as set forth in Section 2757, or as otherwise imposed “by law, home rule charter, order or rule of court, or ordinance.... ” 42 Pa.C.S. § 2757(5). Thus, if Appellant had been directed to take some action that blatantly and indisputably contradicted the lawful requirements of his office, I would likely find that his interest <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>in the matter was substantial. Here, however, there is a more tenuous relationship between his legal obligations and the statute at issue (CHRIA). Indeed, under Section 9104(a)(2) of the Crimes Code, it appears that the scheme embodied in CHRIA Section 9122 — on which Appellant relies, <em>see </em>Brief for Appellant at 18 — does not apply to records maintained by the judiciary in the first instance. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 9104(a)(2) (stating that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, CHRIA does not apply to court records). In short, there is, at a minimum, substantial doubt whether expunction of the records in question is improper. <em>See generally Commonwealth v. Armstrong, </em><a href="/pa/495/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="495 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="1770777" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0506-01">495 Pa. 506</a>, 513 n. 8, <a href="/pa/495/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="495 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="1770777" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0506-01">434 A.2d 1205</a>,1209 n. 8 (1981); Pa.R.Crim.P. 320(A). Under these circumstances, I agree that Appellant’s private interpretation to the contrary is insufficient to give him a substantial interest in refusing to comply with the order.</p>

[b]y the Commonwealth Government, including any officer thereof, acting in his official capacity.” This Court has repeatedly interpreted the term “officer of the Commonwealth” to mean “those who perform state-wide policymaking functions and who are charged with responsibility for independent initiation of administrative policy regarding some sovereign function of state government.” <em>Fawber v.
