The Township Zoning Hearing Officer rejected both applications, finding that the applications required the submission of land development applications pursuant to the SALDO.

The Zoning Hearing Board held three hearings and rendered separate written decisions in the two appeals, finding in both instances that the proposed construction of billboards did not require land development approval and, therefore, the permits had been wrongly denied.</p>

The court opined that the proposed construction lacked the “unity in the ownership or use of the properties” that would defeat a zoning authority’s claim that the proposed use constituted land development. Instead, the court found that “a new use, belonging to and operated by a new and different entity ... will be established on land already owned, occupied and used by another.” Trial Ct. Op. at 11.

    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[110,1357,1156,895]]]'>Before this Court, appellant Clear Channel argues that the lower courts’ finding that land development approval is required results from an artificially narrow and hyper-technical reading of the statutory definition of land development. Under the reasoning in the lower courts, appellant argues, if the owner of the property at issue here had elected to construct signs of identical proportions to those proposed here, a land development plan would not be necessary because there would be no allocation of land between two occupants. Thus, according to appellant, the sole reason for the requirement in this instance is the fact that the sign and property would be owned by separate entities, a fact which has nothing to do with the development effect upon the land. If the lower court decisions stand, appellant asserts, any miscellaneous use structure not owned by the property owner would implicate the cumbersome procedure involved in securing approval for a land development project.</p>
    <p id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[112,2275,1151,96]],["BL_138.1",138,[286,317,1160,1275]]]'>Appellant further contends that a common sense approach to the statutory provisions governing land development recog<a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>nizes the legitimate interests of municipalities in controlling residential and non-residential development where that development involves sanitary sewer, water, storm water management, parking areas, driveways, roadways, curbs and sidewalks, and similar effects. The construction of a billboard does not implicate any of these concerns. Nonetheless, appellant notes, the Township permitting authorities possess broad power to ensure compliance with all applicable code requirements and to address any safety issues involved in the construction of billboards. This power, according to appellant, is vested in both the Zoning Officer and the Department of Licenses and Inspections, given that a proposal for the construction of a billboard must be approved by both. In fact, appellant asserts, the Zoning Officer’s broad powers authorize him to request virtually all information that would be required in a land development plan pursuant to the SALDO in addition to any additional data he may deem appropriate. <em>See </em>Township Zoning Ordinance, § 902.k. The Township Zoning Ordinance, per Section 712, vests similar authority in the Department of Licenses and Inspections. Thus, appellant argues, there are sufficient provisions in place to meet the Township’s legitimate interest and duty to ensure that the construction of large structures such as billboards conform to all applicable standards in the Zoning Ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b138-4" data-blocks='[["BL_138.5",138,[281,1618,1158,744]],["BL_139.1",139,[101,321,1161,678]]]'>Finally, appellant argues that the Commonwealth Court’s decisions in this area are confused and that the court’s decision in this instance is not consistent with those prior decisions. Citing to <em>Marshall Township, supra, </em>and <em>Tu-Way, supra, </em>appellant claims that if the construction of a tower and equipment cabinets on a developed property <em>(Marshall Township) </em>or the construction of three towers together with unmanned accessory buildings (Tu-Way) does not require land development approval, then construction of billboards, which require no accessory buildings, should not. According to appellant, the lower courts placed undue emphasis on the fact that appellant and the property owners entered into lease agreements for the placement of the billboards and, therefore, found <em>White, supra, </em>and <em>Lehigh Asphalt, supra, </em>controlling. <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>Appellant asserts that the <em>White </em>decision, though well-founded, is distinguishable because the telecommunications company there intended to install on a delineated parcel of land a communications tower and three adjoining buildings, all to be surrounded by a cyclone fence topped with barbed wire, along with a]4 mile long, 20-foot wide road to provide access to the leased parcel. Appellant likewise distinguishes <em>Lehigh </em>As<em>phalt, </em>which involved the expansion of a quarry operation, because the Township instructed the applicant to file a land development application, which was subsequently denied. By contrast, here, appellant sought permits for the construction of billboards, which were denied for failure to file a land development application.</p>
    <p id="b139-4" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[100,1025,1158,785]]]'>Appellee Upper Southampton Township responds that the lower courts correctly determined that the construction of a billboard falls within the definition of land development contained in the MPC and the SALDO. The Township contends that the proposed billboards at issue are land developments because they divide or allocate land and space by means of a leasehold. Appellee asserts that the Commonwealth Court appropriately found that the leases conveying a portion of the property to appellant for the construction of the billboards constituted an allocation of a portion of the owner’s property. As evidence of this allocation, the Township points to the provisions in the lease that (1) permit appellant to remove any objects that obstruct the billboard, and to trim any trees and vegetation and (2) grant property rights to appellant in the event of condemnation.</p>
    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.6",139,[99,1844,1159,523]],["BL_140.1",140,[287,325,1155,312]]]'>Appellee argues that <em>Tu-Way, supra, </em>is inapplicable because that case does not involve a change in the interest in land but rather a question of what company’s antenna might be mounted on a tower, while here, the property interests of the owners will change due to the leases they entered into with appellant. Attempting to distinguish both <em>Tu-Way </em>and <em>Marshall Township, </em>appellee claims that both cases concerned attaching or assigning a position on a pole, which did not affect the land in any way. Appellee contends that <em>White, supra, </em>and <em>Lehigh Asphalt, supra, </em>are controlling because both deal <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>with an allocation of land by leasehold. In <em>White, </em>the allocation was of a discrete parcel of land; while in <em>Lehigh Asphalt, </em>the lease granted mineral rights to property that was used for residential purposes. Thus, according to appellee, in both cases the leases allocated land between two or more occupants, which is precisely what the leases do in this instance.</p>

The construction of a billboard simply does not give rise to any of those concerns. To read the statute otherwise would be unreasonable. Further, as appellant notes, the fact that a land development plan is not required for such a contemplated use does not mean that local authorities have no say in enforcing other zoning and licensing laws.

In our view, it would be an absurd or unreasonable reading of the statute to conclude that a use that does not involve such development of the land becomes one merely because the property owners granted appellant the right to erect the billboards through leaseholds, rather than erecting the billboards on their own.
