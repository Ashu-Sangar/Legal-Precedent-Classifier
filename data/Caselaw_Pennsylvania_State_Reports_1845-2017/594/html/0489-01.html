A void judgment arises when the court lacks subject matter <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>jurisdiction, and a judgment from a court that lacks jurisdiction cannot be made valid through the passage of time.

The reasonable time requirement for bringing an action to strike off or open a confessed judgment was based upon the doctrine of laches. <em>See Funds for Bus. Growth, Inc. v. Maraldo, </em><a href="/pa/443/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="443 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="1937060" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0281-01">443 Pa. 281</a>, 287, <a href="/citations/?q=278%20A.2d%20922" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="278 A.2d 922">278 A.2d 922</a>, 925 (1971) (“the doctrine of laches may be applied to the opening of a judgment when the delay is unreasonably long and unexplained”). However, historically void confessed judgments could be stricken off or opened at any time as they were considered a legal nullity because the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. <em>Romberger v.

The policy reasons behind this disparate treatment are clear: it is in the public interest for judgments to be final. However, sound public policy cannot create jurisdiction. Accordingly, where the court lacked jurisdiction, as it does when it enters a void confessed judgment, that court cannot enter a valid judgment, no matter how much time has passed.</p>

While the instant case raises this question in a context where there is serious question as to the status of the confessed judgment, i.e., whether it is void, voidable or valid, a different example makes this clear. If a confessed judgment is mistakenly entered against a person who never had any relationship with the judgment holder, it would be absurd to believe that that judgment, with no basis in law or fact, becomes valid merely because notice was given and thirty days elapsed. Although <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>M &amp; P is correct in asserting that providing finality to judgments is a worthy goal, one that we agree is achieved for valid and voidable judgments through the 1996 amendments to Pa.R.C.P. 2959, we cannot provide finality to a judgment when a court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying dispute. Void judgments are to be treated in the same way that they were treated at common law, i.e., at any time that a void judgment is brought to the attention of the court, it must be stricken. <em>Romberger; Clarion, M. &amp; P.

Because we disagree with this conclusion, and determine that <em>if </em>the confessed judgments are void, then they may be challenged at any time, we remand this case for a determination of the status of the confessed judgment underlying this dispute.</p>

No. 2959(a)(3) does not apply to a petition seeking relief from a judgment by confession that is allegedly void. This conclusion is a matter of rule construction. <em>See </em>Pa. R.C.P. No. 127(a), 101. In my view, it was the intent of this Court in adopting Pa.R.C.P. No. 2959(a)(3) to continue the long-standing distinction under the common law between void<a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>able and void confessed judgments, and to retain the rule that while petitions challenging the former are subject to the doctrine of laches, petitions challenging the latter may be brought at any time. <em>See Romberger v. Romberger, </em><a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20159" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="139 A. 159">139 A. 159</a>, 160 (1927). That is not to say, as the majority indicates, that this Court did not have the authority to extend the time limit in Pa.R.C.P. No. 2959(a)(3) to petitions seeking relief from a confessed judgment that is alleged to be void. I know of no principle that would have prevented this Court from doing so, if that had been our intent.</p>

In this regard, Appellee notes that the second Restatement of Judgments favors modification of the “void judgment” concept and adoption of a methodology emphasizing finality and the totality of the circumstances. <em>See </em>Appellee’s Supplemental Brief at 5.

Appellant requested that the confessed judgments be stricken off on the basis that the amendments to the promissory notes did not restate the cognovit clauses. <em>See </em>Defendant’s Motion to Strike Confessed Judgment at ¶ 33; RR. 20; Majority Opin<a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>ion, <em>op. </em>at 490-93 &amp; nn. 1-2, 937 A.2d at 398-400 &amp; nn. 1-2. This asserted defect plainly does not fall into the jurisdictional category delineated by the majority in order for the confessed judgments to be considered void. <em>See id. </em>at 490, 937 A.2d at 398 (“A void judgment arises when the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction^”). Notably as well, the parties have briefed the issue and do not contend that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Under these circumstances, the trial court’s decision not to strike off the judgments can, in my view, be affirmed outright at this juncture. While the majority declines to address Appellee’s argument to this effect on the premise that the issue is not before the Court, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 494-96, 937 A.2d at 401-02, such reasoning overlooks that an appellate court may affirm a valid judgment or verdict for any reason appearing as of record. <em>See Commonwealth v. Parker, </em><a href="/pa/591/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="591 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="3015474" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0526-01">591 Pa. 526</a>, 534-35, <a href="/pa/591/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="919 A.2d 943" data-case-ids="3015474,8328990" data-case-paths="/pa/591/0526-01,/a2d/919/0943-01">919 A.2d 943</a>, 948 (2007). Therefore, as it is clear from the record that Appellee will prevail on remand (and indeed would be entitled to prevail regardless of whether Rule 2959(a)(3)’s time limitation could be applied to “void” judgments as that term is used by the majority), I would simply affirm the judgment of the trial court and relinquish jurisdiction to that tribunal for any further proceedings that may be necessary in the case.</p>
