Appellee Rudloff filed post-trial motions, which were denied. He then lodged a timely appeal in the Superior Court, raising whether the trial erred in not recognizing that under the Declaration of Trust, Mr. Rudloff as sole trustee, had the power to revoke the Trust and did so, by conveying the Property.</p>
    <p id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.6",288,[286,1036,1158,1048]]]'>In its Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) opinion, the trial court concluded that Appellee Rudloffs contention had no merit. The trial court recognized that a settlor may revoke or amend a revocable trust, provided that the power to revoke is reserved in the trust instrument’s terms, and that the settlor’s intent as to revocation is to be gathered from the language of the trust. (Trial Court opinion at 6), <em>citing In re Trust of Kaufmann, </em><a href="/pa/460/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="460 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="482823" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0024-01">460 Pa. 24</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="460 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="482823" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0024-01">331 A.2d 209</a>, 211 (1975). Applying these principles to the Declaration of Trust, the trial court noted that paragraph 5 used plural words to describe the power of revocation that the Rudloffs reserved and included no words to indicate that either one of the Rudloffs were authorized to revoke the Trust alone, and that paragraph 7 did not state that the surviving and sole trustee was empowered to change the Trust. (Trial Court opinion at 5-6.) Thus, the trial court concluded that the Declaration of Trust clearly vested the power to revoke the Trust in the Rudloffs jointly, that the action taken by Mr. Rudloff as sole trustee on June 14, 2000 was unauthorized, and that the conveyance of the Property by deed to Appellees was void.

The majority repeated the observation made by the Utah Court in <em>Estate of West </em>that the sale of trust property can be accomplished only by a trustee who holds legal title, and reasoned that since Mr. Rudloff retained the powers of a trustee when Mrs. Rudloff died, the Declaration of Trust must be interpreted to mean that Mr. Rudloff was authorized to convey the Property on his own. <em>Scalfaro, </em><a href="/a2d/884/0904-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="884 A.2d 904" data-case-ids="8912879" data-case-paths="/a2d/884/0904-01">884 A.2d at 907-09</a>.

Appellant points to paragraph 5 of the Declaration of Trust and asserts that the plural words therein clearly demonstrate an intent on the settlors’ part that the power of revocation was to be exercised jointly. According to Appellant, paragraph 7 does not change this result because it neither grants nor reserves any powers, but rather, authorizes the surviving trustee to continue administration of the Trust. Appellee Richard Rudloff<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> counters that it never occurred to the Rudloffs that certain of the terms in the Declaration of Trust pertained to their powers as settlors and others related to their rights as trustees. Pointing to paragraph 7, Appellee argues that the Rudloffs must have meant that the survivor of them would have full and unlimited power over the Trust upon the death of the other, and intended for one or both of them to enjoy the power to revoke the Trust at any time and by any means, including by conveyance of the Property.</p>

As we observed, <em>see supra </em>pp. 214-15, 937 A.2d at 1257, the Superior Court reasoned that because a trustee holds legal title and may dispose of the corpus of a trust, the Declaration of Trust necessarily meant that Mr. Rudloff, as sole trustee, could sell the Property on his own. The Superior Court's focus on the rights of a trustee was, however, in error. This appeal concerns the power to revoke that was reserved in the Declaration of Trust and how that power was to be exercised under that instrument.</p>

I view the central question in this appeal as whether the Rudloffs believed that the phrase “during our <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>lifetime,” as well as other plural forms contained within this express reservation of a power to revoke, authorized revocation within the period of time representing the intersection of their individual lifetimes (in which case the power of revocation would not terminate upon the death of one spouse) or the broader period of time representing the union of their individual lifetimes (in which case the power of revocation would persist until the death of the survivor).</p>
    <p id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[106,749,1155,1165]]]'>There are a number of suggestions within the declaration of trust that favor the latter interpretation. Significantly, the declaration of trust also employs the same and similar plural forms in other contexts in which it is reasonably clear that the intent was to refer to either or both of the settlors. For example, in paragraph one, the instrument provides for the appointment of a successor trustee upon physical or mental incapacity of the settlor/trustees “during our lifetime,” and payment “to us” of income or principal “as may appear necessary or desirable for our comfort or welfare,” with the trust property being transferred to the beneficiaries “[ujpon the death of the survivor of us.” In paragraph four, the trust instrument reserves to the settlor/trustees the power and right “during our lifetime” to mortgage the premises and to collect rents and other income. Both of these paragraphs, in the context of the overall document, are reasonably read to convey a design to reserve the full benefit of the trust property to the surviving settlor, despite the use of the plural forms, as in the phrase “during our lifetime.” This suggests that the use of identical phraseology in paragraph five, with reference to the power of revocation, also was intended to encompass either or both of the settlors.</p>

As Appellee also notes, these sorts of form-book documents are frequently utilized by lay persons in an effort (albeit ineffectual) <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>to avoid inheritance taxation, and it seems counterintuitive that such persons would wish to divest their survivor of the full use of significant assets which might be essential to their care.</p>

Paragraph seven, however, is the trustee succession provision of the instrument. As Appellee stresses in his brief, trustees may terminate a trust, but only settlors have the power of revocation. Thus, I cannot agree with the majority that a provision explicitly addressed solely to trustee succession should also address itself to the power of revocation. Instead, paragraph five is explicitly the provision of the declaration of trust addressing the settlors’ power of revocation, and I believe that the outcome of this case should be premised upon the resolution of the material ambiguity in that provision. <em>Cf. </em>Christian L.

In this regard, Appellant testified that her parents created the trust strictly to thwart any possibility that any of their children would be divested of his or her share of the trust property, since, according to Appellant, Mrs. Rudloff had been unfairly deprived of her own inheritance upon her mother’s death. <em>See </em>N.T., March 1, 2004, at 6. While this evidence was facially self-serving, the task of determining Appellant’s credibility was initially for the common pleas court as fact finder. Additionally, although the testimony appears to have been hearsay, it was admitted into evidence without objection. Thus, the common pleas court should have assessed both the credibility and weight of the testimony in determining the Rudloffs’ intentions concerning the potential for revocation of the trust by a surviving spouse. The court, however, circumvented this task by finding that the terms of the trust declaration were explicit in vesting the power to revoke only in the Rudloffs jointly. Since I differ with the common pleas court’s (and the majority’s) conclusion in this regard, I would return the matter to that court to complete the appropriate fact finding.</p>

For the same reason, I also differ with the majority's suggested application of the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>to paragraph seven of the declaration of trust. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 217 n. 5, 934 A.2d at 1258 n. 5. This canon of construction permits the exclusion of terms from an instrument by implication where other items of the same general character are expressed in the document, such that it would be reasonable to infer that the makers rejected the unmentioned terms. Again, however, the item addressed in paragraph seven (succession of trustees) is simply not of the same general character as that which the majority would exclude by implication (revocability by the settlors). Indeed, and again, the latter is actually addressed in another provision of the declaration of trust, namely, paragraph five, albeit in an ambiguous fashion. Therefore, it does not seem reasonable to infer that the makers would have addressed revocability within the inapposite content of paragraph seven. Rather, had the makers apprehended the ambiguity, it seems far more likely that they would have clarified their intent within the relevant provision (paragraph five). I also have difficulty with implementing such a tenuous application of the <em>expressio unius </em>canon in a situation in which the instrument under review appears to be a generic, stationary-store document frequently purchased by lay persons with the single-minded purpose of attempting to avoid inheritance taxation. It does not appear to me to be reasonable to infer that persons in such circumstances intended to reject the prospect of a continuing power of revocation in their survivors merely because they acceded to a generic trustee succession provision.</p>
