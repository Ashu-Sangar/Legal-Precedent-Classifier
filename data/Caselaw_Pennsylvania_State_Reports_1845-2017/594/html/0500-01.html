The Pennsylvania State Police (“PSP”) determined that appellee was ineligible for such license due to his prior conviction for simple assault, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2701, concerning an incident of domestic violence. Appellee filed a challenge to the denial, alleging that his simple assault conviction was not a crime of domestic violence. At the challenge hearing, the PSP presented a police report detailing the incident of simple assault. The Office of the Attorney General agreed with the PSP that the police report supported its denial of appellee’s application for a firearm. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed upon its determination that the evidence gleaned from the police report to conclude that appellee committed an act of domestic violence was inadmissible and, without that evidence, the PSP <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>did not prove appellee’s disentitlement to a firearms carrying license.

The PSP performed a criminal history search of appellee’s record using the Pennsylvania Instant Check System (“PICS”), which revealed his 1990 simple assault conviction. The PSP, therefore, denied the application. On July 14, 2003, appellee filed a PICS challenge with the PSP, which confirmed the denial by letter informing appellee that, pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 922">18 U.S.C. § 922</a>(g)(9) of the Federal Gun Control Act, any individual who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is precluded from obtaining a firearm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The PSP wrote that appellee’s 1990 conviction for simple assault qualified as a state misdemeanor offense involving domestic violence.

During the hearing, the PSP introduced appellee’s criminal record into evidence, which revealed that appellee was arrested for simple assault/domestic violence on December 10, 1989. Appellee’s record contained a “Final <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>Disposition Report” which indicated that he was charged with “2701 simple assault (domestic violence)” and that he pled guilty to “simple assault” on April 9, 1990. Final Disposition Report at 1. Appellee’s record also included a police report, produced at trial by John Schneider, a witness employed by the PSP who received the report from the Pittsburgh Police Department. The report stated that appellee had “hit the victim, his live in girlfriend, knocking her to the floor, and that she was unconscious.” Police Report of 12/10/89. The police report also listed the same address for appellee and the victim.</p>

Later in the hearing, appellee’s counsel renewed his objection to the police report, arguing that it contained internal hearsay. The AALJ again overruled the objection, stating that the report was prepared contemporaneously with the incident and that it was not dispositive of the central question in the case, namely, whether appellee committed a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.</p>

The AALJ reasoned that the law of firearms eligibility required an application of both federal and state statutes to determine whether appellee committed a crime of domestic violence. The AALJ noted that while <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 921">18 U.S.C. § 921</a> (a)(33)(A)(ii) of the Federal Gun Control Act provides a federal classification for a domestic relationship, the Commonwealth has established a broader classification under 23 Pa. C.S. § 6102. Since Section § 6102 characterizes a crime of domestic violence as a crime occurring between former sexual or intimate partners and appellee testified to having a sexual <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>relationship with the victim prior to the assault, the AALJ concluded that appellee had committed a crime of domestic violence. Accordingly, the AALJ affirmed the denial of appellee’s license to carry a firearm.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[289,549,1154,1650]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed in a 2-1 published panel opinion. <em>D'Alessandro v. Pa. State Police, </em><a href="/a2d/878/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="878 A.2d 133" data-case-ids="8939910" data-case-paths="/a2d/878/0133-01">878 A.2d 133</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2005). Senior Judge Jim Flaherty, joined by Judge Bernard L. McGinley, first rejected the AALJ’s application of the definition of a domestic relationship listed in Section § 6102, ruling that the proper definition to be utilized in this case is found under Section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) of the Federal Gun Control Act. Under the relevant federal law, the panel majority stated that the PSP must prove that appellee and the victim cohabitated with each other or that the victim was similarly situated to appellee as a spouse. Addressing the evidence presented by the PSP on this issue, the majority noted that, although the police report of the assault was hearsay, it was properly authenticated pursuant to Section 6103(a) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6103(a), which governs the admissibility of official records. The majority elaborated that, under 42 Pa.C.S. § 6104(b), to be admissible, statements in such records must be recorded pursuant to an official duty and be trustworthy. According to the majority, only statements in the police report relevant to the assault could be deemed trustworthy, namely, statements pertaining to appellee injuring the victim and the addresses listed for both individuals. The majority deemed any reference in the report to the victim being appellee’s “live in girlfriend” suspect, apparently as a matter of law, questioning whether such information would be established by an investigating officer. The majority was not persuaded by the fact that appellee and the victim were listed as having the same address, opining that such information does not establish that they had a sexual relationship or even that they cohabitated. The majority then determined that:</p>

Because it is not clear that it was an official duty of the police officer investigating the assault to make the factual determination of whether or not [appellee] and the victim cohabitated, we must conclude that the facts in the Police Report are not admissible under 42 Pa.C.S. § 6104(b) for the purpose of attempting to establish whether or not [appellee] and the victim cohabitated.</blockquote>

Turning to sufficiency review, the majority diminished the record by discounting the report’s reference to the victim being appellee’s “live in girlfriend.” Since the PSP failed to introduce any evidence other than the police report to establish that appellee cohabitated with the victim, the panel held that the PSP failed to establish that appellee had committed a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as defined under Section 921(a)(33)(A). Therefore, the majority held that the PSP failed to establish that appellee is barred from obtaining a license to carry a firearm under Section 922(g)(9) of the Federal Gun Control Act. Judge Bonnie Brigance Leadbetter (now, President Judge) dissented from the panel majority without filing an opinion.</p>

Specifically, the PSP argues that appellee’s testimony that he had a sexual relationship with the victim, coupled with the information contained in the police report that the victim lived at the same address as appellee and was his “live in girlfriend,” established that appellee cohabitated with the victim. The PSP contends that the statement in the police report that the victim was appellee’s “live in girlfriend” most likely came from appellee himself, who confessed to the assault in the investigating police officer’s presence. Appellee’s confession, the PSP asserts, is admissible as both an admission of guilt and a statement against interests, indicating that the statement was recorded by an officer pursuant to an official duty <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>and that it is trustworthy. The PSP notes that the addresses of appellee and his victim were relevant to authorities who may have needed the information for further investigation or in anticipation of a criminal proceeding, which would ensure that the police officer carefully recorded the correct information. Moreover, the PSP argues that neither appellee nor the victim had a motive to lie about his or her residence, nor did the reporting officer have reason to misrepresent the facts. Thus, it is logical to conclude that the parties were eohabitating when they provided the same address. Finally, the PSP notes that, under <em>2 </em>Pa.C.S. § 505, the technical rules of evidence do not apply to administrative agency hearings.</p>

According to appellee, the competent evidence presented at the hearing established that he and the victim lived at different addresses during the few months that they dated. Although the victim’s address was stated to be the same as his in the police report, appellee argues that the recording police officer must have made an incorrect assumption when completing the report. Appellee asserts that the statement in the police report that the victim was his “live in girlfriend” is inadmissible under 42 Pa.C.S. § 6104(b) because the PSP did not affirmatively establish who, if anyone, provided that piece of information. Appellee notes that the PSP did not attempt to introduce any other trustworthy evidence showing his alleged cohabitation with the victim. Appellee argues that the Commonwealth Court majority employed the same analysis that the PSP now asks this Court to utilize, but the PSP simply disagrees with the result below. Appellee concedes that the Commonwealth Court may not have cited to 2 Pa.C.S. § 505, but it correctly followed its mandate to determine whether the “live in girlfriend” statement in the police report was of probative value, finding that the statement lacked probative value since its source was unknown. Finally, appellee argues that the AALJ erred in applying the legal standard for a domestic relationship set <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>forth in 23 Pa.C.S. § 6102 because only federal law is relevant to the instant case.</p>

The case is presented as one involving evidentiary sufficiency, but, as our summary of the Commonwealth Court’s analysis reveals, that sufficiency review ultimately was controlled by a determination on the admissibility of evidence in the police report.

While this matter is ultimately resolved under a statute, not under the Rules of Evidence, the applicable statute obviously addresses an evidentiary matter. Therefore, we find the historical level of deference provided to administrative agencies’ evidentiary determinations regarding the admission of hearsay sufficiently analogous to guide us in applying the appropriate level of review in this case. “ ‘Hearsay’ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” Pa.R.E. 801(c). Hearsay evidence is normally inadmissible at trial unless an exception provided by the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, this Court’s jurisprudence, or statute is applicable. Pa.R.E. 802. Complicating this general rule in the administrative law context, however, is Section 505 of the Administrative Agency Law: “Commonwealth agencies shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence at agency hearings, and all relevant evidence of reasonably probative value may be received. Reasonable examination and cross-examination shall be permitted.” 2 Pa.C.S. § 505. Therefore, hearsay evidence may generally be received and considered during an administrative proceeding.

It has been the practice of Pennsylvania courts to afford heightened evidentiary protection of “inherent and indefeasible rights” in administrative proceedings.

The parties’ debate here centers on the trustworthiness of the “live in girlfriend” statement in the police report concerning appellee’s simple assault. The Commonwealth Court panel majority declared the “live in girlfriend” statement untrustworthy and inadmissible under Section 6104, apparently as a matter of law, because there was no indication that such information would have been “recorded pursuant to an official duty.” The majority ultimately determined that, without the statement, the PSP had failed to establish that appellee and the victim shared a relationship defined in Section 921(a)(33)(a)(ii) of the Federal Gun Control Act. <em>D’Alessandro, </em><a href="/a2d/878/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="878 A.2d 133" data-case-ids="8939910" data-case-paths="/a2d/878/0133-01">878 A.2d at 141-42</a>.

The Commonwealth Court majority curiously discounted the fact that the same address was recorded for both the victim and appellee in the police report, as well as appellee’s own testimony that he had a sexual relationship with the victim. It is true, as the panel majority stated, that proof that appellee and the victim lived at the same address alone is insufficient to prove a relationship fitting within Section 921(a)(33)(A)(ii). Yet, the majority does not explain why the addresses listed in the police report, considered in conjunction with appellee’s admission of having a sexual relationship with the victim, would be insufficient to support a finding that appellee cohabitated with the victim as someone similar to a spouse.

Section 6104(b) of the Judicial Code instructs courts only to declare inadmissible those records created under circumstances or sources that “indicate” a lack of trustworthiness, codifying the historical presumption that official records will normally be trustworthy. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6104(b) (emphasis added). The police report in the case <em>sub judice </em>contained no obvious errors, nor was there any indication that the information that the victim lived with appellee originated from an unreliable source. Simply because the source of the information is unknown does not necessarily render the statement unreliable, particularly in light of the fact here that it is logical to assume that it was confirmed by appellee or the victim, or observed by the investigating police officer upon viewing personal items in the home. Appellee and the victim had no apparent contemporaneous reason to lie about whether they were living together as boyfriend and girlfriend. Also, contrary to the Common<a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>wealth Court majority, it is not at all unreasonable to assume that the investigating police officer would need to probe the relationship of the parties, and their addresses, in order to collect information for charging decisions, for providing notice, etc. Of course, it is possible that the police officer made an assumption about appellee’s relationship with the victim and it is possible he made assumptions about the parties’ addresses.

In my view, this notation sufficiently reflects the reporting officer’s attestation that Appellee told the officer that the victim was his live-in girlfriend. Thus, although I believe that Appellee is correct that the police report contains double hearsay, I conclude that the essential information concerning the victim’s residence with him was admissible into evidence, in light of the applicability of an exception to the rule against hearsay pertaining as to each hearsay aspect.</p>

I agree with the Commonwealth Court’s observation that in this case, the court is not confronted with a question involving the applicability of the rules of evidence, but a question of the applicability of a statute defining public records. <em>JO'Alessandro, </em><a href="/a2d/878/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="878 A.2d 133" data-case-ids="8939910" data-case-paths="/a2d/878/0133-01">878 A.2d 133</a>, 140 n. 2 (Pa.Cmwlth. <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>2005). Accordingly, it is clear that Sections 6103 and 6104 apply to this case.</p>
