Petitioners, by isolating the “social effect” language from the rest of Section 1102, attempt to portray the Legislature as having given scant direction to the Board to execute or administer its responsibilities. This blinkered reading of Section 1102 produces a false picture. The statute lists nearly a dozen different policies and objectives that the Board should consider, one of which is the social effect provision; this does not constitute legislation that confers <em>carte blanche </em>legislative power on an administrative agency to declare basic policy questions. To the contrary, it shows a significant channeling of discretion. Furthermore, there is nothing in the anti-delegation clause that would require an exhaustive definition of each of these eleven purposes and objectives. The Legislature is not constitutionally required to micromanage the administrative agencies it creates.</p>

In <em>PAGE, </em>it was not simply that an isolated phrase or subsection of the zoning provision was ill-defined; instead, the entire zoning provision was particularly amorphous. Furthermore, <em>PAGE </em>in no fashion opened the door to anti-delegation clause attacks on the Gaming Act in particular. In fact, we clearly limited <em>PAGE. </em>As stated <em>supra, </em>the <em>PAGE </em>Court considered the Board’s argument that provisions such as Section 1102 provided sufficient guidance to the Board’s Section 1506 decision making process.

Subsequent to <em>PAGE, </em>the Legislature amended Section 1506. <em>See </em>Act 2006-135, amendment effective November 1, 2006. In their brief to this Court, Petitioners seem to argue that we should now invalidate the amended Section 1506. Apparently, Petitioners believe that the Legislature failed to comply with our <em>PAGE </em>directives when it amended Section 1506 and would have us declare the second version of that statute in violation of Article II, § 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Petitioners raised no constitutional challenge to Section 1506 in their Application; accordingly, we will not address this putative issue.</p>

I also agree that various challenges raised by Petitioners are outside the proper scope of the present proceeding invoking this Court’s jurisdiction under Section 1904 of the Gaming Act, 4 Pa.C.S. § 1904, which concerns constitutional challenges to provisions of that act. On the non-delegation question, however, my reasoning is as follows.</p>
    <p id="b283-9" data-blocks='[["BL_283.11",283,[95,1398,1158,961]],["BL_284.1",284,[295,309,1151,151]]]'>I regard the social effects of land development as a subset of the concerns of traditional zoning regulation. <em>See e.g., </em>53 P.S. § 10105 (reflecting the General Assembly’s purpose, in enacting a comprehensive Municipalities Planning Code governing, <em>inter alia, </em>comprehensive planning and zoning matters, to “protect and promote safety, health and morals”). Thus, I believe that Section 1102(10)’s “social effects” provision, <em>see </em>4 Pa.C.S. § 1102(10), functioned in tandem with the initial legislative scheme investing in the Gaming Control Board the power to supplant local zoning and land use regulations which would affect the location of casinos. However, in light of the decision in <em>Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion Fund v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/583/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="583 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="687766" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0275-01">583 Pa. 275</a>, <a href="/pa/583/0274-02" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="877 A.2d 383" data-case-ids="687750,687765,687766,8955098,8955131,8955235" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0274-02,/pa/583/0274-01,/pa/583/0275-01,/a2d/877/0383-01,/a2d/877/0383-02,/a2d/877/0383-03">877 A.2d 383</a> (2005) <em>(“PAGE”), </em>which deemed this delegation unconstitutional as conferred, <em>see id. </em>at 335, <a href="/pa/583/0274-02" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="877 A.2d 383" data-case-ids="687750,687765,687766,8955098,8955131,8955235" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0274-02,/pa/583/0274-01,/pa/583/0275-01,/a2d/877/0383-01,/a2d/877/0383-02,/a2d/877/0383-03">877 A.2d at 419</a>, the statute may no longer be read as overriding existing local regulation. In my view, a delegation of discretion to select casino locations subject to local zoning and land use regulation is far more <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>reserved than delegation of power to select locations in spite of local regulation. Thus, I believe that the delegation issue assumes lesser significance in the post <em>-PAGE </em>landscape.</p>
