The officer also noticed in the apple mash a large indentation consistent with a bear having lain there, a clearly identifiable bear paw print, and leaves with blood droplets. Officer Pierce called Officer Wasserman and informed him of the bait pile. Pursuant to Officer Wasserman’s instructions, Officer Pierce seized the bloody leaves as evidence. Continuing his investigation, Officer Pierce discovered a second pile of apple mash as well as a corn feeder approximately one hundred fifty yards from appellant’s cabin. Finally, Officer Pierce returned to his vehicle and drove down a dirt road about four hundred yards into the woods.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">5</a> After parking his truck, the officer got out and found what he recognized as bear entrails.

Upon pulling into appellant’s driveway, the officers <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>observed a dead black bear carcass hanging from a piece of construction equipment.

A forensic DNA analysis subsequently performed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service established that all the blood and tissue recovered by the officers in the course of their investigation came from the bear whose carcass was seized at appellant’s residence. Thereafter, appellant was charged with two summary violations of the Game Code: Unlawful Taking or Possession of Game or Wildlife, 34 Pa.C.S. § 2307;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6</a> and Unlawful Devices and Methods, 34 Pa.C.S. § 2308, <em>see supra. </em>After being found guilty of both offenses before a district judge, appellant appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Wyoming County.</p>

Vanston, appellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized by Officers Pierce and Wasserman, challenging the legality of their entry onto and search of his property under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. On March 31, 2004, the trial court held a suppression hearing, which the court consolidated with appellant’s trial <em>de novo, </em>and denied the motion. Officers Pierce and Wasserman testified for the Commonwealth, describing in detail the course of the investigation they conducted on November 25 and 26, 2002. Appellant’s case-in-chief consisted primarily of the testimony <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>of his neighbor to the effect that apple trees were located on land near appellant’s property.

Consequently, the court rejected appellant’s argument that Article I, Section 8 prohibited the officers’ warrantless search of the fields where the bait piles were found. “To rule otherwise,” the court reasoned, “would emasculate the enforcement of the Game Code on any privately owned realty, as one would only have to post ‘no trespassing’ signs to keep out the game wardens.” <em>Id. </em>The court stated that such a result would be absurd and a result that the constitutional framers surely did not intend.

In a published opinion authored by the Honorable Renée Cohn Jubelirer, the court held that, under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the property upon which the bait piles were found. The court began and ended its analysis with appellant’s argument that the “No Trespassing” signs that he posted created a reasonable expectation of privacy in the property. Thus, the court noted that a person does not commit trespass if he is “licensed or privileged to ... enter[ ][the] place as to which notice against trespass is given.” <em><a href="/a2d/864/1279-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="864 A.2d 1279" data-case-ids="9043684" data-case-paths="/a2d/864/1279-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/864/1279-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="864 A.2d 1279" data-case-ids="9043684" data-case-paths="/a2d/864/1279-01">at 1284</a> (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. § 3503(b)(l)(ii) (defining the offense of criminal trespass) (emphasis omitted)). Turning to the Game Code, the court observed that Section 901(a)(2) specifically authorizes a WCO to “go upon any land or water outside of buildings, posted or otherwise, in the performance of the officer’s duty.” <em><a href="/a2d/864/1279-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="864 A.2d 1279" data-case-ids="9043684" data-case-paths="/a2d/864/1279-01">Id.</a> </em>(quoting 34 Pa.C.S. <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>§ 901(a)(2)). Therefore, • the court concluded, “[appellant’s posting of the signs cannot form the basis of a reasonable expectation of privacy[ ] [because] it would be unreasonable for him to expect that game officers, who are privileged to enter the land, would not do so to assure compliance with the Game Law.” <em><a href="/a2d/864/1279-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="864 A.2d 1279" data-case-ids="9043684" data-case-paths="/a2d/864/1279-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/864/1279-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="864 A.2d 1279" data-case-ids="9043684" data-case-paths="/a2d/864/1279-01">at 1285</a>.

As appellant notes, the text of the New York constitutional provision is substantially similar to that of Article I, Section 8 of our Constitution. <em>See </em>N.Y. Const, art. I, § 12 (protecting “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures”).

Further, it is notable that, with respect to Article I, Section 8 privacy, <em>Brion, </em>the only post <em>-Edmunds </em>case, merely repeated the familiar standard, <em>i.e.: </em>"To determine whether one's activities fall within the right of privacy, we must examine: first, whether [the defendant] has exhibited an expectation of privacy: and second, whether that expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.” <em>Brion, </em><a href="/pa/539/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="652 A.2d 287" data-case-ids="474153,7866155" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0256-01,/a2d/652/0287-01">652 A.2d at 288-89</a> (quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

I would hold that Section 901(a)(2) is unconstitutional to the extent that it authorizes entry onto posted private property without any level of suspicion of illegal activity.

Accordingly, I would hold that a citizen may claim privacy in an open field under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution when indicia would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the area is private. I would therefore find Section 901(a)(2) unconstitutional to the extent that it authorizes entry onto posted private property without any level of suspicion of illegal activity.</p>

Justice Thurgood Marshall filed a strong dissenting opinion in <em>Oliver, </em>which was joined by Justices William Brennan and John Paul Stevens. The Dissent initially disagreed with the literal interpretation of the text of the Fourth Amendment and the conclusion that real property is not included in the list of protected spaces and possessions. <em>Id. </em>at 186, <a href="/us/466/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="240" data-cite="466 U.S. 170" data-case-ids="6195904" data-case-paths="/us/466/0170-01">104 S.Ct. 1735</a>. It reasoned that the Majority conceded that the curtilage of the home is protected by the Constitution without such term appearing in the text of the Amendment. Further, the Dissent noted that neither a public telephone booth nor a conversation conducted therein can fairly be described as a person, house, paper, or effect and yet the Court had granted Fourth Amendment protection over such activity in <em>Katz v.
