The letter further noted that 24 P.S. § 17-1732A of the Public School Code did not indicate that the Right-to-Know Act applies to charter schools.</p>

In his Petition, Zager asserted that charter schools are in fact subject to the Right-to-Know Act, that the documents he requested fell within the Act’s definition of public records and therefore the school was required to make them available. In response, the school asserted that the documents requested were not public records as defined by the Right-to-Know Act, and that the school was not an “agency” as defined by the Act, and therefore not subject to the Act. The school made additional arguments that even if it was subject to the Right-to-Know Act, the documents requested by Zager would reveal trade secrets and business practices which the Act protects from disclosure.</p>

In making its determination, the trial court noted that Chester Community Charter School is an independent public school which provides an essential government function, namely primary or secondary education, and as such qualifies as an organization that is subject to the Right-to-Know Act. The trial court additionally found no merit to the school’s assertion that the Charter School Law exempts charter schools from the disclosure requirements of the Right-to-Know Act. Finally, the court concluded that the documents requested by Zager did in fact constitute public records, and accordingly directed the school to provide Zager with copies of the requested records. Following a Petition for Reconsideration filed by the school, the trial court filed a supplemental opinion reiterating that charter schools are subject to the requirements of the Right-to-Know Act, and that the records requested by Zager were subject to public disclosure.</p>

The Commonwealth Court affirmed, reasoning that the school qualified as an “agency” performing an essential government function for purposes of the Right-to-Know Act and therefore it was subject to the Act’s disclosure requirements. The court additionally concluded that the school’s argument that the documents requested by Zager were not public records was raised for the first time before the Court of Common Pleas. Because the school did not include this ground for denial in its initial response to Zager’s request on May 19, 2004, the court concluded that the school had waived the issue of whether the documents qualified as public records and declined to address its merits. Chester Community Charter School appeals the order of the Commonwealth Court affirming the trial court’s determination.</p>

    <p id="b246-6" data-blocks='[["BL_246.7",246,[276,1071,1163,1285]]]'>Charter schools are not specifically listed within the definition of “agency” as set forth in section 66.1 of the Right-to-Know Act. However, in addition to the entities that are explicitly enumerated, section 66.1 provides a catch-all provision which subjects to the Act’s requirements organizations that are similar to those listed and which perform or have for their purpose, the performance of an essential governmental function. Chester Community Charter School asserts, however, that the catch-all provision refers only to those organizations that are similar to state or municipal authorities since the language of section 66.1 lists “state or municipal authorities” immediately preceding the catch-all provision. Contending that charter schools are not similar to state or municipal authorities, Chester Community Charter School argues that it is therefore not subject to the Right-to-Know Act. The school additionally relies on our decision in <em>Mooney v. Bd. of Trustees of Temple Univ., </em><a href="/pa/448/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="448 Pa. 424" data-case-ids="1944716" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0424-01">448 Pa. 424</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20395" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="292 A.2d 395">292 A.2d 395</a> (1972), which held that a university failed to qualify as an agency pursuant to the Right-to-Know Act because it lacked similarity to a state or municipal authority. Chester Community Charter School asserts, therefore, that section 66.1 applies solely to those agencies that are similar to state or municipal authorities, and that charter schools lack sufficient similarity to fall within the scope of the Right — to-Know Act.</p>

Specifically, the school relies on 24 P.S. § 17-1721-A and 24 P.S. § 17-1716-A(c) of the Charter School Law in support of its argument. The school maintains that section 17-1721-A, pertaining to the organization of the Charter School Appeal Board, is the only provision in the Charter School Law that explicitly mandates compliance with the Right-to-Know Act. In comparison, section 17-1716-A(c) of the Charter School Law governing charter school Boards of Trustees, mandates compliance only with the Sunshine Act. The school asserts that these two sections of the Charter School Law must be read in pari materia. Reading the sections together, the school contends, demonstrates the Legislature’s intent to free charter schools from the burden of responding to every conceivable request for documents pursuant to the Right-to-Know Act, by limiting compliance with the Act to the school’s Appeal Board only.</p>

While the Charter School Law does not specifically require charter schools to comply with the Right-to-Know Act, the Right-to-Know Act includes charter schools, providers of public education, as organizations bound by its requirements.</p>
