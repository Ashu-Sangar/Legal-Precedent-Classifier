Whether allowance of appeal should be granted to address the issue of whether the courts may enforce an arbitrator\u2019s award that negates a decision of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (\u201cPLRB\u201d) and allows an unfair labor practice and a violation of the Public Employee Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.101 et seq., as found by the PLRB, to continue?\n2. Whether allowance of appeal should be granted to address the issue of whether the \u201cessence test\u201d applies when an arbitrator errs as a matter of law because he lacks subject matter jurisdiction?",
