        "text": "OPINION IN SUPPORT OF DENIAL OF APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR RECUSAL\nJustice CASTILLE.\nAppellant Leslie Charles X. Beasley, through his counsel, Billy H. \u00d1olas, Esquire, of the Defender Association of Philadelphia, Capital Habeas Unit, has filed a motion for my recusal in this capital matter, which is an appeal from the denial of appellant\u2019s petition for collateral relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9541 et seq. For the reasons set forth below, I will deny the Motion.\nThis case arises from a murder appellant committed in Philadelphia over twenty-seven years ago, in April of 1980. Appellant was tried and convicted and, on July 16, 1981, the jury returned a sentencing verdict of death. The aggravating circumstance found by the jury was appellant\u2019s significant history of prior violent felonies, which consisted of his two prior murder convictions, including the murder of a police officer. The instant appeal is from the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s second post-conviction petition; the denial of his first collateral attack (filed under the former Post Conviction Hearing Act (\u201cPCHA\u201d)) became final sixteen years ago.\nAfter stating what he purports to be the background and procedural history of the case \u2014 in fact, the recitation includes repeated non-record assertions and slanted argumentation\u2014 Mr. \u00d1olas alleges four separate bases for recusal. First, Mr. \u00d1olas says, Canon 3(C)(1)(b) of the Pennsylvania Code of Judicial Conduct (the \u201cCode\u201d) \u201crequires\u201d my recusal because I was the elected District Attorney of Philadelphia County during a part of the time when appellant litigated his first collateral attack, under the PCHA, which by Mr. \u00d1olas\u2019 reasoning made me a lawyer who \u201cserved as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.\u201d Second, Mr. \u00d1olas says, Canon 3(C)(1)(a) of the Code \u201crequires\u201d my recusal because, in my Opinion denying a similar motion for recusal filed by Mr. \u00d1olas in the unrelated capital PCRA appeal in Commonwealth v. Rainey, 590 Pa. 256, 912 A.2d 755 (2006) (Recusal Opinion of Castille, J.), I allegedly \u201cprofessed\u201d \u201cpersonal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts\u201d respecting one of appellant\u2019s current claims. Third, Mr. \u00d1olas says, Canon 3(C)(1)(a) \u201crequires\u201d my recusal because that same Recusal Opinion in Rainey supposedly suggests that 1 \u201charbor a \u2018personal bias or prejudice\u2019 \u201d against Mr. \u00d1olas. Finally, Mr. \u00d1olas bootstraps from his first three arguments and claims that my recusal is required by the due process clause and the Eighth Amendment.\nMr. Nolas\u2019s first claim, seeking recusal premised upon my official position as the elected District Attorney of Philadelphia County, has been addressed in my prior opinions concerning recusal, most recently in Rainey. See also Commonwealth v. Jones, 541 Pa. 351, 663 A.2d 142 (1995) (Recusal Opinion of Castille, J.). To that discussion, I would merely add that appellant was tried, convicted, and had his death sentence affirmed on direct appeal before I was elected District Attorney. With respect to appellant\u2019s PCHA petition, initiated some twenty-two years ago, to the best of my knowledge and recollection, 1 was not personally involved in those collateral proceedings. I have no special knowledge of any facts regarding those of appellant\u2019s collateral proceedings occurring during my tenure as District Attorney, much less any facts that would bear upon appellant\u2019s trial and direct appeal, which occurred before my tenure in office. Indeed, my only familiarity with this case is that which I have gleaned from the legal pleadings filed with this Court and the opinions published in appellant\u2019s prior appeals. Moreover, Mr. \u00d1olas has pointed to nothing in the record that demonstrates otherwise. And, finally, Mr. \u00d1olas has not explained how it is that the prior PCHA proceeding \u2014 as opposed to, for example, appellant\u2019s trial and direct appeal and the PCRA proceeding below \u2014 constitutes \u201cthe matter in controversy\u201d on this appeal.\nMr. Nolas\u2019s second claim is that my Recusal Opinion in Rainey somehow proves that I have personal knowledge of evidentiary facts having to do with the jury selection claim appellant seeks to pursue on his serial collateral attack in this case. In the \u201cbackground and procedural history\u201d section of his motion, Mr. \u00d1olas avers to non-record facts in support of this \u201cclaim.\u201d In addition, Mr. \u00d1olas repeats some of the same false statements and mischaracterizations that were contained in his Rainey recusal motion. Even ignoring these ethical lapses by Mr. \u00d1olas, this particular ground for recusal is frivolous.\nThe jury selection in appellant\u2019s case occurred in 1981, long before I was elected District Attorney, and indeed, long before Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), the primary case appellant\u2019s PCRA appeal brief relies upon, was decided. Moreover, Mr. Nolas\u2019s Recusal Motion inexplicably neglects to mention that appellant\u2019s \u201cBat-son \u201d claim was defaulted (he did not object at trial or on his pre-Batson direct appeal) and that he necessarily poses the claim in his brief as one sounding in layered ineffective assistance of counsel. Nothing in my Recusal Opinion in Rainey referencing that there was no policy of discrimination during \u201cmy watch\u201d \u2014 an opinion rendered in response to the earlier misrepresentations forwarded by Mr. \u00d1olas \u2014 implicates \u201cpersonal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts\u201d involving a jury selection procedure with which I had no personal involvement, conducted years before my election as District Attorney, and even years before Batson.\nMr. Nolas\u2019s third claim again is frivolous as stated. Mr. \u00d1olas claims that my opinion in response to his misrepresentations in his Rainey recusal motion shows that I should recuse myself in this case because I supposedly have a \u201cpersonal bias or prejudice concerning a party.\u201d Mr. Nolas\u2019s argument, however, states that my Recusal Opinion in Rainey suggests that I may harbor \u201ca \u2018personal bias or prejudice\u2019 against [Mr. \u00d1olas].\u201d That, of course, is not the same thing: Mr. \u00d1olas is a lawyer in this case, not a party. The Canon Mr. \u00d1olas cites does not apply.\nIn addition to being frivolous under the Canon he cites, Mr. Nolas\u2019s argument is frivolous under the cited cases. In Reilly v. SEPTA, 507 Pa. 204, 489 A.2d 1291, 1295 (1985) (alternative holding), this Court stated that, \u201canimosity, standing alone, between a lawyer and a judge is irrelevant\u201d to a recusal claim. To the extent that Mr. \u00d1olas relies on different case law, his argument fares no better. As proof of my alleged personal bias against him, Mr. \u00d1olas cites the \u201ctone\u201d of my Recusal Opinion in Rainey, and quotes portions of that opinion which noted his ethical lapses (including factual misrepresentations) in the Motion in that case. Mr. \u00d1olas then creatively rewrites a quotation within a quotation from this Court\u2019s opinion in Commonwealth v. White, 589 Pa. 642, 910 A.2d 648, 658 (2006). White involved the recusal of a trial judge, not the recusal of one of the seven Justices of the highest court in Pennsylvania hearing an appeal as of right in a capital case. The Commonwealth\u2019s recusal request in White also was not premised upon material misrepresentations, as was Mr. Nolas\u2019s recusal request in Rainey. Moreover, the recusal motion in White was premised upon the jurist\u2019s alleged bias or prejudice respecting facts of the case and in favor of the defendant, not alleged bias or prejudice respecting the moving party\u2019s defense attorney arising from prior unsupported accusations the lawyer made against a judge. In addition to failing to acknowledge these obvious, controlling distinctions, Mr. \u00d1olas rewrites the double quotation from White in a sleight-of-hand manner to substitute my name for that of the trial judge, apparently to make it appear that those portions of his recusal request in Rainey which I identified as false or unsupported were deemed, by some authority, to be \u201creasonably meritorious.\u201d See Appellant\u2019s Motion for Recusal at 8. But Mr. Nolas\u2019s scandalous misrepresentations in Rainey were not reasonably meritorious. Finally, calling an attorney\u2019s unethical representations unethical, and calling an attorney\u2019s misrepresentation a misrepresentation does not betray animosity, bias, or prejudice. It betrays accurate assessment. My response in Rainey was justified by Mr. Nolas\u2019s conduct.\nMore fundamentally, Mr. Nolas\u2019s attempt to convert my response to his factual misrepresentations in Rainey into a basis for seeking my recusal in other cases cannot be permitted to succeed. The notion that a litigant \u2014 or even worse, a litigant\u2019s lawyer \u2014 can secure a forum more to his personal liking by throwing mud at a jurist, and then demanding the jurist\u2019s recusal for attempting to remove the mud on grounds that the jurist may not like the lawyer, is beyond absurd. My Recusal Opinion in Rainey plainly and explicitly concerned itself not with Mr. Rainey\u2019s cause, but with Mr. Nolas\u2019s arguments. Such is the same in my opinion in this case. I have no difficulty in separating Mr. \u00d1olas\u2019 conduct from his client\u2019s cause. If Mr. \u00d1olas and the Defender Association truly believe that Mr. Nolas\u2019s participation in their client\u2019s appeal could compromise appellant\u2019s cause, then they have an easy self-help remedy. That they have not utilized it evidences the strategic nature of the instant Motion.\nIt is worth noting that this Court is charged with oversight of the practice of law in Pennsylvania. As a member of the Court with that role, of course I am distressed, if unsurprised, to see Mr. \u00d1olas unapologetic and unchastened by my Recusal Opinion in Rainey. Lawyers should not betray contempt for ethical standards, or contempt for any court. Jurists obviously notice the relative honesty, reliability, and quality of the arguments made by the lawyers who appear before them, particularly lawyers who brief or argue matters with some frequency. Consequently, jurists may come to form opinions, good or bad, about certain counsel whose work is familiar to them. Only a naive lawyer would believe that questionable ethical practices, and the dogged pursuit of a poor reputation, is the best way to advance his clients\u2019 causes. But bad lawyering does not generally cause a jurist to confuse a lawyer with his client, much less would it cause a jurist to let the lawyer\u2019s lapses unfairly affect the client\u2019s cause. Certainly, this jurist would not.\nFinally, Mr. Nolas\u2019s fourth argument obviously fails because it bootstraps from his first three, which are meritless.\nThe judges of the highest court in a jurisdiction are less fungible than the individual lawyers who appear before them. Were I to recuse myself from this case, there are no backup Justices waiting in the wings to fill my seat. Mr. Nolas\u2019s client, having lost below, would need four of six votes to garner relief, and his chances at success would be reduced. Under their own theory, Mr. \u00d1olas and the Defender Association apparently believe that his participation in the case as a lawyer warrants that reduction in his client\u2019s appellate chances.\nBased on the foregoing considerations, I find that the motion requesting my recusal should be, and it hereby is, denied, per the attached order.\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 9th day of November, 2007, upon review of Appellant\u2019s Motion for Recusal and the Commonwealth\u2019s Reply in Opposition to the Motion, the Motion for Recusal is DENIED. Appellant\u2019s Application for Leave to File Supplement to Motion for Recusal of Mr. Justice Castille is also DENIED.\n. The full Court in Rainey later denied reconsideration of my recusal order in a decision in which I did not participate. See Commonwealth v. Rainey, 590 Pa. 6, 911 A.2d 505 (2006).\n. Because this ground for recusal is frivolous, Mr. Nolas's alternative request for an evidentiary hearing, forwarded only in his \"prayer for relief\u201d (and unsupported by citation to any authority) likewise fails.",
