The WCJ determined that the testimony of the employees of Schwan\u2019s Home Service, Inc., was credible to the extent they testified that the frequency of occurrences of work-related incidents experienced by Petitioner was normal for their specific industry; the Commonwealth Court is not free to disturb this credibility determination based on competent evidence. See Daniels v. WCAB (Tristate Transp.), 574 Pa. 61, 828 A.2d 1043, 1052 (2003) (holding that the WCJ is the ultimate finder of fact and the exclusive arbiter of credibility and evidentiary weight). See also RAG (Cyprus) Emerald Resources, L.P. v. WCAB (Hopton), 590 Pa. 413, 912 A.2d 1278 (2007) (holding that the aggravation of a pre-existing psychic injury by a psychic stimulus is compensable pursuant to workers\u2019 compensation laws only where credible evidence demonstrates that such injury stems from an abnormal working condition). Additionally, Employer\u2019s Petition for Supersedeas is denied as moot.\nJustice SAYLOR filed a Concurring Statement.",

I join the result reached by the majority, solely because I view the WCJ\u2019s statement that Claimant\u2019s medical experts were not persuasive and the ensuing explanation for such statement as constituting a credibility determination that is binding on appeal. But see Canavan v. WCAB (B & D Mining Co.), 769 A.2d 1250 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001) (holding that the WCJ\u2019s use of the term \u201cnot persuasive\u201d when discussing testimony from a medical expert may be subject to different interpretations and remanding for clarification of whether the evidence was rejected on credibility or competency grounds).",
