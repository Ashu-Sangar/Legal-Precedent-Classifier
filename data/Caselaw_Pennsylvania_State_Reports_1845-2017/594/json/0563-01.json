        "text": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nAppellant Johnna Seeton filed in the Commonwealth Court a Complaint in Mandamus alleging that the Pennsylvania Game Commission (Commission) improperly concluded that it lacked authority to interfere with what she alleged were the Tioga Boar Hunt Preserve\u2019s (Tioga) ongoing violations of the Pennsylvania Game and Wildlife Code, 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 101, et seq. (Game and Wildlife Code). She asked the Commonwealth Court to reject the Commission\u2019s claim that it lacks jurisdiction over Tioga and hold that the Commission\u2019s own regulations as well as its statutory mandate require enforcement of the relevant provisions against Tioga. The Commonwealth Court denied Seeton relief on the basis that the Commission\u2019s interpretations of its own administrative provisions were not inconsistent with the Game and Wildlife Code and therefore are entitled to a court\u2019s deference. Because we find that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is inconsistent with its plain language and irreconcilable with the legislative intent manifest in the Game and Wildlife Code, we reverse.\nAccording to the Commission, Tioga \u201cis in the business of selling \u2018canned hunts\u2019 in which customers pay a fee to shoot and kill an animal in an enclosed area which limits the ability of the animal to escape and the amount of pursuit in which the customer must engage.\u201d Brief for Commission at 7. Seeton contends that \u201c[a]nimals used in canned hunts are often drugged, tied to stakes or lured to feeding stations in order to further assure that the \u2018hunter\u2019 will get the guaranteed kill that has been promised by the hunting preserve\u2019s proprietor.\u201d Complaint in Mandamus at 2, \u00b6 6.\nThis controversy began when Seeton, a resident of Dauphin County, initiated a correspondence with the Pennsylvania Game Commission seeking to compel enforcement against the Preserve, which Seeton averred serially violated provisions of the Game and Wildlife Code. By responsive letter, the Commission\u2019s Chief Counsel rejected Seeton\u2019s contention that the animals hunted at the Preserve, including wild boar, were \u201cprotected mammals\u201d pursuant to the Commission\u2019s regulations promulgated under the Game and Wildlife Code. See 58 Pa.Code \u00a7 133.1. In particular, the Commission observed that the term \u201cwild mammals\u201d as used in \u00a7 133.1 is defined nowhere in the Game and Wildlife Code or the Commission\u2019s regulations. The Commission, resorting to a dictionary definition of the word \u201cwild,\u201d thus opined that \u201cwild mammals\u201d must apply only to \u201cmammals that are currently living in a state of nature,\u201d Commission Letter to Seeton, 4/29/03 (internal quotation marks omitted), which \u201cexcludes mammals that are currently living in a state of captivity, either in pens or within enclosures.\u201d Id. Because the animals at the Preserve are kept within enclosures, the Commission concluded that they are not \u201cwild\u201d for purposes of the Game and Wildlife Code and regulations issued thereunder; rather, they are \u201cthe personal property of their owners.\u201d Id.\nOn October 14, 2004, Seeton filed a Complaint in Mandamus in the Commonwealth Court in its original jurisdiction. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a)(1) (providing original jurisdiction in the Commonwealth Court of civil actions against the Commonwealth). She averred that she had taxpayer standing pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in In re Application of Biester, 487 Pa. 438, 409 A.2d 848 (1979) (granting taxpayers standing to challenge government action where no one is better situated to challenge that action and it will otherwise evade judicial review). The Commission, she argued, is an arm of Pennsylvania\u2019s executive branch and receives public funding from the sale of timber on game lands owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Thus, per In re Biester, where the Commission\u2019s action will otherwise go unchallenged, it is subject to challenge by Seeton in her capacity as a Pennsylvania taxpayer.\nIn her Complaint, Seeton averred that the Commission is aware of Tioga\u2019s ongoing violations of the Game and Wildlife Code, including the restraint and drugging or luring of prey to facilitate a kill by a hunter who has paid for the privilege. She further asserted that the wild boar hunted at Tioga are \u201cprotected mammals\u201d under the Game and Wildlife Code and the Commission\u2019s regulations. Because \u201cprotected mammals\u201d may be hunted only pursuant to express provisions of the Game and Wildlife Code or the Commission\u2019s regulations, see 58 Pa.Code \u00a7 133.1, and because neither the Game and Wildlife Code nor the Commission\u2019s regulations authorize the hunting of boar, Seeton asserted that Tioga is in violation of \u00a7 133.1.\nThe Commission filed Preliminary Objections to Seeton\u2019s Complaint in Mandamus. First, the Commission challenged Seeton\u2019s standing to bring the complaint in the first instance. The Commission contended that Seeton had no interest in the litigation exceeding that of any other member of the public.\nIn the alternative, the Commission defended the claim on the merits in much the same terms as it had in its prior correspondence with Seeton. Specifically, it argued that \u201ccanned hunts\u201d on private property fall outside the Commission\u2019s \u201crealm of regulation\u201d because no animal can be \u201cwild\u201d that is \u201ccontained on private property within fenced enclosures.\u201d Preliminary Objections at 2, \u00b6 6. It emphasized that its interpretation of the Game Code is entitled to administrative deference. Id. at 2, \u00b6 7. It further averred that mandamus is an inappropriate mechanism, as it characterized See-ton\u2019s claim, \u201cto compel the [Commission] to interpret the Game [and Wildlife Code]\u201d as Seeton would prefer. Id. at 2, \u00b6 9.\nThe Commonwealth Court began its ruling by rejecting the Commission\u2019s argument that Seeton lacked standing. The court acknowledged the undisputed point that Seeton lacked traditional standing, which requires a showing of a substantial individual interest in the matter, see William, Penn Parking Garage, Inc., v. City of Pittsburgh, 464 Pa. 168, 346 A.2d 269 (1975), but ruled that Seeton had demonstrated standing pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in In re Biester, 487 Pa. 438, 409 A.2d 848 (1979). Specifically, the court noted that neither Tioga nor its clients have any incentive to challenge the Commission\u2019s alleged non-enforcement of the Wildlife and Game Code, because they benefit from that non-enforcement. Thus, the court determined that Seeton had standing because the challenge might otherwise evade judicial review.\nThe Commonwealth Court, however, rejected Seeton\u2019s challenge on the merits. The court found tenable Seeton\u2019s interpretation that wild boar are \u201cprotected mammals\u201d subject to the Commission\u2019s protection under 58 Pa.Code \u00a7 133.1, but it found equally tenable the Commission\u2019s interpretation that the term \u201cprotected mammals,\u201d which includes \u201cwild mammals\u201d under \u00a7 133.1, does not apply to wild boar contained in enclosures, because by definition a penned animal cannot be \u201cwild.\u201d Finding both interpretations \u201creasonable\u201d under the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, the court determined that it was bound to defer to the Commission\u2019s account. See Bethenergy Mines, Inc., v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection, 676 A.2d 711 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996). Accordingly, it denied Seeton relief.\nBefore this Court, the Commission renews its challenge to Seeton\u2019s standing to bring this claim, which we take up as a preliminary question going to this matter\u2019s justiciability. In In re Biester, this Court, applying its decision in William Penn Parking Garage, observed that traditional standing requires petitioner to demonstrate a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in the outcome of the suit surpassing the common interest of all citizens in procuring obedience to the law. In re Biester, 409 A.2d at 851. We recognized, however, that \u201c[c]ertain cases exist which grant standing to taxpayers where their interest arguably does not meet the [above] requirements of Wm. Penn.\u201d Id. at 852. \u201c[I]n those cases ..., the granting of standing where the degree of causal connection between the action complained of and the injury alleged is small, can be explained by the policy behind granting taxpayers standing.\u201d Id. The \u201cfundamental reason for granting standing\u201d in such cases \u201cis simply that otherwise a large body of governmental activity would be unchallenged in the courts.\u201d Id. (quoting Faden v. Phila. Housing Auth., 424 Pa. 273, 227 A.2d 619, 621-22 (1967)). Thus, taxpayer standing may be granted when it \u201censure[s] ... judicial review which would otherwise not occur,\u201d a circumstance that arises where \u201cthose directly and immediately affected by the complained of expenditures are beneficially affected as opposed to adversely affected.\u201d Id.\nIn Seeton\u2019s initial action before the Commonwealth Court, she alleged that, absent her challenge, \u201cthe refusal of the Game Commission to take action against Tioga will otherwise go unchallenged,\u201d id. at 4, \u00b6 18; that she \u201chas no alternative channels for redress other than [the Commonwealth] Court,\u201d id. at 4, \u00b6 21; and that, \u201c[o]n information and belief, there are no other persons better situated than Petitioner to assert the claim raised herein.\u201d Id. at 4, \u00b6 23. Thus, she contended, she had standing pursuant to In re Biester.\nIn response, the Commission failed entirely to address Seeton\u2019s contentions regarding standing under the analysis prescribed by In re Biester, relying instead on its conclusory suggestion that Seeton had no peculiar interest in the matter. Thus, it failed to respond to Seeton\u2019s assertions by identifying who would be better situated to challenge the Commission\u2019s inaction or what alternative channel would be open to such a challenge, matters critical to the In re Biester inquiry.\nIn re Biester spoke principally to the importance of assuring that a government agency\u2019s actions not evade review for want of an aggrieved party under the limited terms of traditional standing. As noted, standing under In re Biester aims to \u201censure .\u2022.. judicial review which would otherwise not occur,\u201d when \u201cthose directly and immediately affected by the complained of expenditures are beneficially affected as opposed to adversely affected.\u201d 409 A.2d at 852. There appears to be no one better situated than Seeton to challenge the non-enforcement asserted here. Moreover, we perceive no alternative means to invoke judicial review of the important question before us. Thus, we find no error in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s determination that Seeton had standing to bring the instant claim.\nNext, we are faced with a second preliminary matter: the Commission\u2019s argument that mandamus is an inappropriate remedy in this context and that Seeton\u2019s claim must fail for that infirmity. The Commission correctly notes that mandamus does not permit a court to direct a government agency to exercise in a particular fashion a matter entrusted to that agency\u2019s discretion. Rather, mandamus is a common-law mechanism by which a court may compel a government body to perform a mandatory act where the moving party has a clear right, the government body has a corresponding duty, and the moving party demonstrates that no other remedy at law is adequate to secure relief. Phila. Newspapers, Inc., v. Jerome, 478 Pa. 484, 387 A.2d 425, 430 n. 11 (1978). The Commission characterizes Seeton\u2019s prayer as \u201cseeking] to have [the court] impose a different interpretation of the Game and Wildlife Code than that of the Game Commission.\u201d Brief for Commission at 18.\nSeeton responds that mandamus is the proper remedy where, as here, a government agency \u201chas failed to perform [a mandatory] statutory duty.\u201d Brief for Seeton at 14. Seeton contends that the Commission\u2019s discretion is not at issue in this case, and that she does not seek to compel the Commission to act in any particular manner. Rather, she seeks to establish only that the Commission is required under the Game and Wildlife Code to bring Tioga into compliance with that Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder in a suitable fashion entrusted to its discretion. See Phila. Newspapers, Inc., 387 A.2d at 430 n. 11 (\u201cA court issuing a writ of mandamus may direct the exercise of discretion, but not performance of a particular discretionary act.\u201d).\nWe agree with Seeton that, assuming the validity of her allegations (as we must in the context of reviewing the Commonwealth Court\u2019s grant of preliminary objections), and assuming she prevails in establishing that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is inconsistent with that body\u2019s statutory mandate, mandamus is an appropriate remedy. Seeton\u2019s original prayer for relief, in full, provides:\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner Johnna Seeton demands entry of judgment against Respondent Pennsylvania Game Commission directing the enforcement against Tioga Boar Hunt Preserve of 55 Pa.Code \u00a7 133.1, ordering Tioga to cease and desist from causing or permitting the killing of protected mammals on its premises or otherwise directing the Commission to bring Tioga into compliance with the Game Law, and for costs and such further relief as this Court deems proper.\nComplaint in Mandamus at 4-5 (emphasis added). Her demand that the Commission be ordered \u201cto bring Tioga into compliance with the Game Law,\u201d were it to be granted without directing any particular action in furtherance of that goal, would not impose upon the Commission\u2019s discretion. The Commission does not have the power to redefine its authority at will; the courts are an appropriate destination, and mandamus an appropriate remedy, to direct the Commission to comply with its statutory mandate to the extent it misapprehends it. See Taylor v. Abernathy, 422 Pa. 629, 222 A.2d 863, 868 (1966)(observing that, \u201cwhile mandamus may not compel a body vested with discretionary power to exercise that power in a certain manner or to arrive at a certain decision, mandamus will lie to compel a body so empowered to exercise its discretion within the prescribed limits,\u201d and so ordering (emphasis added)). Thus, we disagree with the Commission\u2019s contention that this case is about the substitution of Seeton\u2019s judgment for that of the Commission. We hold that mandamus is an appropriate remedy under these circumstances, and proceed to address the substantive issue at the heart of this case.\nThe instant dispute essentially focuses on the Commission\u2019s regulation concerning defining \u201cprotected mammals\u201d and outlining the degree to'which they are to be protected.\nWild mammals not defined in the act as furbearers or game animals shall be classified as protected mammals to be taken only under the act and this part. See Chapter 21, Subchapters B and C of the act (relating to destruction for agricultural protection; and destruction of game or wildlife in self-defense) and \u00a7 141.3 (relating to protection removed under certain circumstances).\n58 Pa.Code 133.1. The parties agree that the wild boar here in question are neither furbearers nor game animals. Thus, this dispute turns on whether \u201cwild mammals\u201d include wild boar; if so, they must be protected mammals under the Commission\u2019s own regulation. Cf Town of Sullivan v. Strauss, 171 A.D.2d 980, 567 N.Y.S.2d 921, 922 (1991) (describing, inter alia, Russian boar as \u201cexotic animals generally considered wild and undomesticated\u201d).\nSeeton argues that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is unsustainable under the language of that provision and the Game and Wildlife Code, and that the Commission, in fact, is bound to enforce its regulations against Tioga notwithstanding that the alleged violations harm only privately owned and fenced-in wild boar rather than free-roaming quarry. Seeton maintains that wild boar are \u201cwild mammals\u201d under the Game and Wildlife Code and thus \u201cprotected mammals\u201d under \u00a7 133.1, regardless of whether they are enclosed. The Game and Wildlife Code, Seeton emphasizes, empowers and directs the Commission \u201cto protect, propagate, manage, and preserve the game or wildlife of this Commonwealth and to enforce, by proper actions and proceedings, the laws of this Commonwealth relating thereto.\u201d 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 322(a). Pointing as well to the discretion conferred upon the Commission to regulate hunting, id. \u00a7\u00a7 322(c)(l)-(7), classify wild birds and animals, id. \u00a7 322(c)(8), manage and develop game lands, id. \u00a7 322(c)(10); and to promulgate necessary and appropriate regulations concerning hunting and fur-taking in the Commonwealth, id. \u00a7 2102(a), Seeton argues that \u201cthe Code makes clear that the Game Commission has jurisdiction over all \u2018wildlife\u2019 in the Commonwealth.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 8. \u201cWildlife,\u201d Seeton observes, is defined by the Game Code as \u201cwild birds, wild mammals, and facsimiles thereof, regardless of classification, whether protected or unprotected, including any part, product, egg or offspring thereof.\u201d 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102 (defining terms)(emphasis added). See-ton avers that wild boar therefore are \u201cwild mammals\u201d subject to the Commission\u2019s unqualified protection, notwithstanding the Commission\u2019s claim to the contrary.\nThe Commission acknowledges that \u00a7 133.1 binds it to police the \u201ctaking\u201d of \u201cwild mammals,\u201d but takes the position that boar are not \u201cwild mammals\u201d for purposes of that regulation. Particularly, the Commission maintains that, because the term \u201cwild mammals\u201d is not defined by the Game Code or the Commission\u2019s regulations, it should be understood according to its common usage. \u201cWild,\u201d the Commission asserts, connotes \u201cmammals living in a state of nature,\u201d which the Commission maintains cannot include privately owned animals living in enclosures. Brief for Commission at 12. In support of this interpretation, the Commission cites sections of the Game Code that it believes support its reading of the relevant terms. At 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2161(a) (\u201cDeclaration of policy\u201d), for example, the General Assembly refers to the Commission\u2019s \u201cproprietary ownership, jurisdiction and control of game or wildlife living free in nature,\u201d which the same provision identifies as \u201ca renewable natural resource of this Commonwealth.\u201d\nThe linchpin of the Commission\u2019s argument, however, is not the superiority of its interpretations over alternative readings, per se. Rather, the Commission argues that it is entitled to prevail for precisely the reason relied upon by the Commonwealth Court: that the Commission\u2019s interpretations of its enabling statute and its regulations are at least as defensible as Seeton\u2019s, and therefore must be vindicated in light of the \u201cstrong deference\u201d the courts typically show administrative interpretations such as those forwarded by the Commission in this case. See Winslow-Quattlebaum v. Maryland Ins. Group, 561 Pa. 629, 752 A.2d 878, 881 (2000) (\u201cIt is well settled that when the courts of this Commonwealth are faced with interpreting statutory language, they afford great deference to the interpretation rendered by the administrative agency overseeing the implementation of such legislation.\u201d). Subject to this deference, the Commission contends, its reading of \u201cwild mammals\u201d to apply only to mammals that are in fact free to roam must be sustained to the detriment of Seeton\u2019s cause of action, as the Commonwealth Court held. The Commission concludes that \u201cit would not be reasonable for the Game Commission to contemplate that the General Assembly intended that its jurisdiction over \u2018protected mammals\u2019 would extend to animals which are not indigenous to Pennsylvania and naturally do not live in the wild.\u201d Brief for Commission at 15.\nWhile an agency\u2019s interpretation of an ambiguous statute it is charged with enforcing is entitled to deference, courts\u2019 deference never comes into play when the statute is clear. See Phila. Suburban Corp., 635 A.2d at 118 (quoting Girard Sch. Dist. v. Pittenger, 481 Pa. 91, 392 A.2d 261, 263 (1978) (\u201cWhile courts traditionally accord the interpretation of the agency charged with administration of the act some deference, the meaning of a statute is essentially a question of law for the court....\u201d)). Notably, the United States Supreme Court, in its extensive precedent concerning judicial deference to administrative interpretations of ambiguous enabling statutes, see, e.g., Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), has recognized the dangers of deferring to interpretations developed in anticipation of litigation. See Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988) (declining to defer to agency interpretations forwarded for the first time in connection with litigation).\nThe Game and Wildlife Code defines \u201cwild animals\u201d as \u201call mammals\u201d that are not designated \u201cdomestic\u201d pursuant to 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1991. As noted, supra n. 11, we reject the Commission\u2019s attempt to identify wild boar as \u201cdomestic\u201d by reclassifying it without any authority, legal or taxonomical, as a member of the supposed \u201cpig family.\u201d Thus, wild boar necessarily are \u201cwild animals\u201d under the Game and Wildlife Code. If they are \u201cwild animals\u201d pursuant to the Game and Wildlife Code, however, it is difficult to see how they are not also \u201cwild mammals\u201d pursuant to 58 Pa.Code \u00a7 133.1. Wild boar are undisputedly mammals, of course, and their classification as \u201cwild\u201d plainly is consistent with the General Assembly\u2019s use of that term in the definitional section of the Game and Wildlife Code, pursuant to which the Commission exists and has authority to promulgate regulations.\nThis understanding of the Game and Wildlife Code finds further support in the larger statutory scheme, as well. \u201cWildlife,\u201d as we have noted, is defined by the Game and Wildlife Code as, inter alia, \u201cwild birds\u201d and \u201cwild mammals.\u201d 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102. Thus, while the Commission is correct that the term \u201cwild mammals\u201d is not itself defined by either the Game and Wildlife Code or the Commission\u2019s regulations, it is not wholly undetermined within the statutory scheme. Rather, \u201cwild mammals\u201d plainly are a subset of the term \u201cwildlife.\u201d Thus, whatever is true of \u201cwildlife\u201d must also be true of \u201cwild mammals,\u201d barring an explicit statutory exception. Interestingly, 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2163(b) prohibits, inter alia, the release within the Commonwealth of \u201cimported game or wildlife or game or wildlife reared in captivity \u201d (emphasis added). This provision undermines the Commission\u2019s claims regarding the meaning of the word \u201cwild\u201d in at least two dimensions. First, insofar as \u201cwildlife\u201d is defined to include \u201cwild animals\u201d and \u201cwild mammals,\u201d as explained above, the notion of \u201cwildlife reared in captivity\u201d (which posits the prospect of \u201cwild animals\u201d and \u201cwild mammals\u201d reared in captivity), is wholly antithetical to the Commission\u2019s attempt to tie the word \u201cwild\u201d to the degree of freedom enjoyed by a given animal. Similarly, it is impossible to \u201crelease\u201d \u201cwildlife\u201d (and hence \u201cwild animals\u201d and \u201cwild mammals\u201d), the activity proscribed in the abovementioned section, if the animal\u2019s liberty is a necessary condition to its status as \u201cwild,\u201d since one cannot release an animal from a non-captive state.\nNotably, the Commission does not dispute Appellant\u2019s assertion that Tioga drugs or otherwise disables wild boar to facilitate easier kills, nor does it argue that, were it bound to enforce the law against Tioga, the alleged conduct would be permissible. The Game and Wildlife Code makes it illegal to hunt through use of poison or chemical of any kind. 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2308(9). Thus, the Commission effectively argues that the hunting of captive animals on fenced, private property may be undertaken by means such as drugs or restraint that violate, at a minimum, the spirit of the Game and Wildlife Code. This is an untenably narrow interpretation of its statutory mandate. Cf, inter alia, 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 103(a) (vesting the Commission with \u201cownership, jurisdiction over and control of game or -wildlife ... to be controlled, regulated and disposed of in accordance with this title\u201d); 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2102(a) (directing the Commission \u201cto promulgate regulations as it deems necessary and appropriate to protect[ ], preserv[e] and manage[] game or wildlife and game or wildlife habitat\u201d); 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2163-64 (charging the Commission with regulating the unlawful importation of game, wildlife, and protected birds).\nInterestingly, the Commission does not in all instances espouse such a restrained view of its authority. In Commonwealth v. Gosselin, 861 A.2d 996 (Pa.Super.2004), appellants rescued and effectively domesticated an injured squirrel, Nut-kin, while residing in South Carolina, where to do so was legal. Later, however, appellants moved to Pennsylvania, where they had some dealings with the Commission. Specifically, a Wildlife Officer, while investigating an unrelated tip lodged by appellants, observed Nutkin in the house, explained that appellants were barred by Pennsylvania law from housing a squirrel, and cited them for a violation when they refused to surrender custody of Nutkin to the officer. In resolving the case, the Commission agreed that Nutkin was a \u201cwild animal\u201d under the Game and Wildlife Code.\nGosselin does not command our holding in this case. Rather, it suggests the difficulty the Commission would encounter were it permitted to restrict \u201cwild\u201d to refer only to animals not in fact penned or otherwise restrained on private property. If the Game and Wildlife Code is to cohere, \u201cwild\u201d must refer to a category of animals based upon inherent qualities, not transient circumstances, a fact the Commission surely recognized when it insisted upon its authority to cite the appellants in Gosselin for failing to turn over Nutkin to the Wildlife Officer when he demanded it.\nWe hold that the Commonwealth Court erred in deferring to the Pennsylvania Game Commission\u2019s interpretations of the Pennsylvania Game and Wildlife Code and regulations promulgated thereunder because those interpretations are patently at odds with the enabling Game and Wildlife Code. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order granting the Commission\u2019s preliminary objections on the merits is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings as required.\nFormer Justices NIGRO and NEWMAN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justice CASTILLE and SAYLOR join the opinion.\n. This case was reassigned to this author.\n. In Seeton's Complaint in Mandamus, in addition to wild boar, she averred that Tioga also offers canned hunts of such animals as deer, elk, Corsican ram, and buffalo. Complaint in Mandamus at 2, \u00b6 7. At \u00b6 8, however, her focus turns to wild boar alone, a move reflected in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision in this case. See Cmwlth. Ct. Slip Op. at 3 (outlining Seeton's allegations \"that some of the animals hunted at [Tioga], specifically the various types of wild boar, are defined \u2018protected mammals\u2019 \u201d). Before this Court, Seeton limits her argument to wild boar, and the analysis that follows tracks that limitation. That said, in light of our holding that the Commission's claim that merely fencing in any sort of animal precludes its classification as a \u201cwild animal\u201d subject to the Commission\u2019s protection, we expect that the Commission will consider whether any of the various species hunted at Tioga qualify as \"wild animals\u201d are not subject to.its protection.\n. Section 133.1, promulgated by the Commission, provides:\nWild mammals not defined in the act as furbearers or game animals shall be classified as protected mammals to be taken only under the act and this part. See Chapter 21, Subchapters B and C of the act (relating to destruction for agricultural protection; and destruction of game or wildlife in self-defense) and \u00a7 141.3 (relating to protection removed under certain circumstances).\n58 Pa.Code \u00a7 133.1.\n. As noted, the Commonwealth Court denied the Commission\u2019s preliminary objections on the question of standing. With respect to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s grant or denial of preliminary objections, as well as the other questions of law taken up, infra, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review plenary. Luke v. Cataldi, 932 A.2d 45, 49, n. 3 (Pa.2007). Like the Commonwealth Court, however, in considering preliminary objections \u201cwe must accept the facts alleged in Appellants' complaint and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom as true.\u201d Id.\n. Regarding the Commission\u2019s character as a government agency subject to such a challenge, Seeton averred that certain state game lands \"were acquired and developed using public funds derived from legislation known as 'Project 70\u2019 in or about 1963,\u201d Complaint in Mandamus at 2, \u00b6 4, and that the Commission is a government agency that receives a material percentage of its annual budget from the sale of timber on state game lands owned by the Commonwealth pursuant to 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 706.\nThe Commission's own website supports Seeton's claims, indicating that, per 1962 voter referendum, $120 million in public funds were allocated to recreation and conservation programs, with $10 million allocated to the Commission \u201cto buy hunting and fishing areas threatened by imminent development.\u201d Pennsylvania Game Commission, State Wildlife Management Agency: 1960-1969, available at http://www. pgc.state.pa.us/pgc/cwp/view.asp?a=458&q= 154059&pp= 12&n= 1 (last reviewed Oct. 22, 2007). The same source also corroborates Seeton's assertion that a separate 1967 initiative, \"Project 500,\u201d authorized a $125 million bond issue to benefit, inter alia, the Game Commission. Id.\n. The Commission did reply substantively to Seeton\u2019s arguments regarding its public character, maintaining that she failed to demonstrate \"any correlation between the [Commission's] sale of timber on State Game Lands or the purchase of State Game Lands in the 1960\u2019s and the issue of enforcing the Game and Wildlife Code against private individuals on private land.\u201d Preliminary Objections at 1, \u00b6 4. As is elucidated infi-a, however, this is non-responsive to the circumstances that create standing under In re Biester, and the Commission does not go so far as to dispute its fundamentally public character.\n. Notably, this regulation appears in Pennsylvania Administrative Code Chapter 133, entitled \u201cWildlife Classification,\u201d suggesting that \u201cwild mammals\u201d are, necessarily, \"wildlife\u201d pursuant to the definition of that term provided by the Game and Wildlife Code, an identification to which we will return, infra.\n. Subject to modification by Commission regulation, \u00a7 102 defines \"furbearers\u201d as \u201cthe badger, the fisher, the mink, the muskrat, the opossum, the otter, the pine marten, the striped and spotted skunk, the beaver, the raccoon, all weasels, the red and gray fox and the bobcat,\u201d and defines \"game animals\u201d as \u201cthe elk, the whitetail deer, the bear, the cottontail rabbit, the snowshoe hare, the red, gray and fox squirrel and the groundhog or woodchuck.\u201d The Commission does not argue that it has, by regulation, modified these definitions in any material regard.\n. Section 322(b) grants the Commission \"the power and duty to take all actions necessary for the administration and enforcement of this title.\u201d\n. In the same connection, the Commission directs the Court's attention to 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2102(c)(Transporlation, sale and disturbance of game or wildlife.), which provides, \u201cThe commission shall promulgate regulations concerning the transportation, introduction into the wild, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale or purchase of game or wildlife or the disturbing of game or wildlife in their natural habitat.\" This provision, however, is more supportive of Seeton\u2019s position inasmuch as it calls upon the Commission to regulate the transportation and importation, inter alia, of \"game or wildlife,\u201d matters that may be involved in the provision of non-indigenous boars for canned hunting in the instant case. Presumably, based upon the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the statute, boar transported or imported into the Commonwealth for the purposes of canned hunting are never \"wild\u201d based upon the Commission's understanding of that word \u2014 because during such transport they never roam free \"in a stale of nature\u201d \u2014 and hence are never protected, a conclusion patently at odds with the plain language of \u00a7 2102(c). Moreover, the fact that the General Assembly modified \"wildlife\u201d with the clause \u201cin their natural habitat\u201d suggests that wildlife no1 subject to this particular provision need not be so found to retain its \"wild\u201d character, as we presume that the General Assembly intends each word of a statute to be given effect. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1921, 1922(2).\n. Presumably, the Commission's claim regarding living in the wild is used strictly to complement the assertion of non-indigenousness, since there can be no dispute that, in certain habitats, boar live \u201cin the wild.\u201d Indeed, wild boar are so named because, unlike their domesticated cousins in the sus genus, they are not readily amenable to domestication as that word is commonly understood.\nOn a related note, at one point during this litigation the Commission argued that a boar is a \"pig\u201d for purposes of 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1991 (Definitions) (defining \"domestic animal\u201d as \u201cAny equine animal, bovine animal, sheep, goat and pig\u201d). Section 1991, in identifying equine and bovine animals as larger categories, while specifying sheep, goat, and pig more narrowly, suggests that we should not read it to encompass all members of the relevant Sus genus, of which pigs are but one variety. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax. cgi?mode=Undef&id=9822&lvl=3&keep= l&srchmode= l&unlock, Iasi reviewed, July 26, 2007 (National Center for Biotechnology Information page identifying various species and subspecies of the genus Sus); see also American Heritage College Dictionary 1567 (4th ed.)(defining a \u201cwild boar\u201d as \u201cSus scrofa,\" \"the ancestor of the domestic pig\u201d). As evinced by the legislature's selection of the categorical terms \"equine\u201d and \u201cbovine\u201d in the same provision, it is entirely capable of using broader terms when it so intends; yet it did not do so with respect to pigs. Consequently, we cannot agree that wild boar are domestic animals under \u00a7 1991.\n. This Court has never expressly adopted this limitation of Chevron deference, but its eminent sensibility, indeed the necessity of qualifying such deference, could not ask for a better illustration than this case, in which, according to the Commission, a feral beast such as a boar is not \u201cwild\u201d once it is enclosed, and a \"wild mammal\u201d is not necessarily a \"wild animal.\u201d Indeed, we appear never to have explicitly adopted even Chevron\u2019s general rule in the context of state administrative law. The Chevron approach to such cases at the federal level, however, is indistinguishable from our own approach to agency interpretations of Commonwealth statutes. Compare Chevron, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694, with Phila. Suburban Corp., 535 Pa. 298, 635 A.2d 116. Moreover, in Philadelphia Suburban Corp., we quoted and relied upon United States v. Cartwright, 411 U.S. 546, 93 S.Ct. 1713, 36 L.Ed.2d 528 (1973), a Chevron predecessor stating similar principles, in interpreting state taxation provisions.\n. Similarly, 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2930(e) governs commerce in the hides of \"game or wildlife ... raised ... on premises under authority of a propagating permit,\u201d which once again makes clear that the General Assembly did not intend \"wild\u201d necessarily to imply a state of liberty. Further citations along these lines are passim. See, e.g., 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2962-64 (regulating, but not prohibiting, possession or trade in \"exotic wildlife\u201d by individuals or \"menageries\u201d).\n. We do not intend, to be clear, to invade the Commission's discretion to proceed as it deems fit, having been advised of its jurisdiction to do so in this matter.",

See Wm. Penn Parking Garage, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 464 Pa. 168, 346 A.2d 269, 280 (1975). The majority, applying the standing exception in In re Application of Biester, 487 Pa. 438, 409 A.2d 848 (1979), determined appellant has taxpayer standing. Majority Op., at 570-73, 937 A.2d at 1032-34. I disagree with the majority\u2019s application of Biester because appellant does not demand a cessation of spending tax dollars, but rather seeks to compel appellee to spend tax dollars. Our jurisprudence does not contain case law that allows a plaintiff relying on taxpayer standing to force a governmental agency to spend money.\nThe majority errs by granting mandamus. Mandamus is an extraordinary writ that will only he to compel official performance of a ministerial act or mandatory duty where there is a clear legal right in the plaintiff, a corresponding duty in the defendant, and want of any other appropriate and adequate remedy. Jackson v. Vaughn, 565 Pa. 601, 777 A.2d 436, 438 (2001) (citation omitted). Therefore, mandamus will not lie to compel discretionary acts. Bronson v. Board of Probation and Parole, 491 Pa. 549, 421 A.2d 1021, 1023 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1050, 101 S.Ct. 1771, 68 L.Ed.2d 247 (1981). Here, appellees enforcement of the Pennsylvania Game and Wildlife Code (Game Code) is a discretionary and not a ministerial act; therefore, the majority errs by granting mandamus.\nThe majority does not afford due deference to appellee\u2019s determination that boars are not protected wild animals under the Game Code. An administrative interpretation receives controlling weight unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the agency\u2019s regulation. Department of Public Welfare v. Forbes Health System, 492 Pa. 77, 422 A.2d 480, 482 (1980). Appellant argues the term wild animals is defined as all non-domestic mammals; therefore, wild animals and wild mammals are the same. Although the Game Code defines wild animals as all non-domestic mammals, it does not formally define the term wild mammal or the term wild. The boars at Tioga Boar Hunt Preserve (Preserve) are living in a state of captivity; thus, they are not living in a state of nature. The Game Codes policy declaration regarding actions for damages to game or wildlife provides:\nThe Commonwealth has sufficient interest in game or wildlife living in a free state to give it standing, through its authorized agents, to recover compensatory and punitive damages in a civil action against any person who Mils any game or wildlife or who damages any game or wildlife habitat. The proprietary ownership, jurisdiction and control of game or wildlife living free in nature is vested in the Commonwealth by virtue of the continued expenditure of its funds and its efforts to protect, propagate, manage and preserve the game or wildlife population as a renewable natural resource of this Commonwealth.\n34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2161(a) (emphasis added). Considering the legislative expression of Pennsylvania\u2019s inherent interest in preserving wildlife living free in nature, the Commissions interpretation that the Preserves boars are not wild animals is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the Game Code.",
