        "text": "Justice BAER,\nconcurring.\nToday the Court affirms by per curiam order the Commonwealth Court\u2019s construction regarding the legislature\u2019s enactment of 77 P.S. \u00a7 651(b), allowing a claimant\u2019s healthcare provider to \u201cparticipate\u201d in the examination conducted by an employer\u2019s physician. In so doing, we affirm the court\u2019s holding that the legislature intended to afford the opposing expert a first-hand view of the examination process, through attendance and observation, but did not intend to permit such expert to engage in any active conduct which might disturb the examining physician. I write to express my opinion that nothing in our affirmance of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion, limiting a healthcare provider to attending and observing an employer\u2019s physician\u2019s examination, should be seen as precluding such a provider from engaging in other passive, non-disruptive activity during the exam. Specifically, I believe that a workers\u2019 compensation judge retains the discretion to grant a claimant\u2019s reasonable request to take notes and/or audio or videotape the examination, so long as such activity will not interfere with an employer\u2019s physician\u2019s ability to conduct an examination.\nJustice BALDWIN joins this concurring statement.\n. This section provides, in relevant part:\nIn the case of a physical examination, the employe shall be entitled to have a health care provider of his own selection, to be paid by him, participate in such examination requested by his employer or ordered by the workers\u2019 compensation judge.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 651(b).",
