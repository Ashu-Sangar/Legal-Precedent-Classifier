His account having been confirmed, he has no interest as such administrator in any decree of distribution the court may make of the fund. He is not so far the representative of creditors as to authorize him to interfere in the distribution. His full duty therein will be discharged by paying over the fund in pursuance of the decree of the court. He therefore has no standing which will permit him to change or delay the execution of the decree distributing the fund.\nThe appeal is therefore quashed.",

Sharswood, C. J., absent.\nAppeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court of PMladepMa county: Of January Term 1879, No. 33. \u25a0\nAppeal of William J. Gallagher, administrator of the estate of George Woods, deceased, from the decree of the court awarding the balance of the estate in the hands of said administrator, to the widow of said decedent.\nThe court, on May 25th 1878, confirmed absolutely the account of said administrator. On June 15th the adjudication of the account was opened by the court, and on July 13th a rule was granted on all the heirs, &c., to show cause why an order should not be made upon the administrator to pay over the balance in his hands to the widow of decedent. This rule was made returnable on September 21st 1878, and \u00f3n that day, after due proof of advertisement, an order in conformity with the rule was made on the administrator. From this order he took this appeal, alleging that the court erred in making the order while the adjudication was still open. The order opening the adjudication was rescinded after the appeal was taken.\nH. O. Titus and B. L. Temple, for appellant.\nThe Act of 6th April 1833, sect. 1, Purd. 809, provides for the distribution of intestates\u2019 estates who leave husband or wife, but no known heirs or other kindred. It directs that \u201cafter final settlement of the administration account of such intestate,\u201d upon petition, a rule to show cause shall be granted and published, and if any alleged heir shall appear, whose claim is contested, then the court may direct an issue or may take such order therein as they shall think proper.\nIn this case the said rule was 'granted and decree made prematurely, and before final settlement of the administration account; for the order of June 15th 1878, opening the adjudication,rwas in force during these proceedings, and still in force at the time of this appeal. It is, therefore, submitted that this record and orderiwould not protect this appellant in paying over the estate to the widow.\nFurther, at time of said decree the claim of the alleged heir was pending and undetermined.\nCharles Davis, for appellee.\nThe appellant, being an administrator, is not interested in the distribution of the fund, and is not entitled to an appeal: Mellon\u2019s Appeal, 8 Casey 121; Stineman\u2019s Appeal, 10 Id. 394; Craig\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 330 ; McAllister\u2019s Appeal, 9 P.
