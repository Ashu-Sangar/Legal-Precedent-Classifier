    "head_matter": "Lazarus, Adm\u2019r, versus Fuller, Ex\u2019r.\n1. The rule that an endorsement on a note of a payment of interest, proven to have been made within six years from the date of the note and time of suit brought, will prevent the operation of the Statute of Limitations, does not apply to a joint and several note.\n2. Clark v. Burn, 4 Norris 502, followed.\nMarch 5th 1879.\nBefore Sharswood, C. J., Mercur, Gordon, Woodward, Trunkey and Sterrett, JJ. Paxson, J., absent.\nAssumpsit by William Lazarus, administrator of George Schuyler, deceased, against Orange M. Fuller, executor of J. W. Fuller, deceased, on the following promissory note :\n\u201c$500. -Catasauqua, April 8th 1870.\nOne year after date we, or either of us, promise to pay to George Schuyler, or order, five hundred dollars, with interest, without defalcation, for value received. David A. .Tombler.\nf 26 ct. Internal ) \u2022 J W. FUDDER.\u201d x wxiiujik.\n(Revenue Stamp./ x wxiiujik.\nOn the back of said mote are the following endorsements:,\n\u201cApril 1st 1871, paid interest one year, $30.\nApril 3d 1872, paid interest one year, $30.\nApril 1st 1873, paid interest one year, $30.\n\u2022April 1st 1874, paid interest one year, $30.\nApril 1st 1875, paid interest one year, $30.\nInterest paid on the within note to April 1st 1876.\nInterest paid on the within note to April 1st 1877.\u201d\nAt the trial, before Albright, P. J., the plaintiff proved the signature of J. W. Fuller, and then proposed to prove \u201cthat the endorsements of interest paid on the back of the note are in the handwriting of George Schuyler, deceased, and that they were made at the time they bear date, commencing from April 1st 1871, down to April 1st 1875, inclusive, the note being dated April 8th 1870, payable one year after date.\u201d\nObjected to as incompetent and irrelevant, and because the offer does not propose to show that the payments were -made by the defendant\u2019s testator in his lifetime, and because the note as to James W. Fuller, his legal representative, is barred by the Statute of Limitations.\nObjection sustained.\nThe plaintiff then offered the note in evidence.\nObjected to as incompetent and irrelevant, and because the debt is barred -by the Statute of Limitations, and there is no evidence \u25a0offered to take the case out of the statute so far as the defendant is concerned.\nObjection sustained.\n\u2022 The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then stated that the only evidence upon which the plaintiff relied to take the note out of the statute was the evidence already proposed as to the endorsements of payments of interest on the back of the note, and he therefore rested.\nThe defendant then moved for a nonsuit, which the court granted.\nThe rejection of his offers of testimony and the entry of the non-suit were assigned for error by the plaintiff, who took this writ.\nJohn Rupp, James B. Beshler and A. B. Longaker, for plaintiff in error.\nAll the assignments of error in this case raise but\none question, and may be considered together. The note on which this suit is brought is the joint and several note of J. W. Fuller and David A. Tombler.- On the face of the note there is nothing to show that the one was the surety of the other, nor is there any proof in the cause that such was the fact. \u25a0 The presumption, then, is that both Fuller and Tombler were principal debtors and jointly owed the note: Bear v. Patterson, 3 W. & S. 233.\nAn endorsement on a note of a payment on account, in the handwriting of the holder, proven to have been made within six years from the date of the note-and time of suit brought, is evidence which will prevent the operation of the Statute of Limitations: Addams v. Seitzinger, 1 W. & S. 243; Crem\u00e9r\u2019s Estate, 5 Id. 332; Burr v. Burr, 2 Casey 284.\nA payment on \u2022 account of an existing debt is an unequivocal acknowledgment, and will take it out of the statute: Barclay\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 69. -Endorsements of credits on a note made by a promisor before the statute has closed upon the right to maintain suit, is an evidence of corresponding payments to remove the bar of the statute : Shaffer v. Shaffer, 5 Wright 51.\nThe above authorities show conclusively that if the note had been signed by Fuller alone, the testimony offered was sufficient to take it out of the statute. Where, then, is the difference when the note is signed by two jointly ? The presumption is that both were principal debtors and both jointly owed the note.\nColeman v. Fobes, 10 Harris 156, is not in conflict with the position we assume in this case. The case of Clark v. Burn et al., 4 Norris 502, was affirmed by a divided court, and we respectfully ask the court to reconsider the decision rendered in that case.\nJEdward Harvey and MeQlure $ Hamer sly, for defendant in error.\nWe rely upon Clark v. Burn et al., supra."
