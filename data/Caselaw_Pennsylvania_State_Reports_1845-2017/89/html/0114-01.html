F. was his physician and confidential friend. W. agreed in writing with A. to-secure for A. an interest in certain stock, which interest <em>W. </em>alleged he controlled, <em>W. </em>to receive a portion of the proceeds to result from the appreciation of the stock. The stock appreciated largely in value, and <em>W. </em>received a share of the proceeds, but the court below rescinded the contract and ordered him to return the share of the proceeds he had received, on the ground that his representations as to his control of the interest transferred <em>to </em>A. were false. The day after the execution of the contract between <em>W. </em>and A., the latter and F. executed a second contract, wherein A. covenanted to transfer to F. a certain share of his interest in said stock, the consideration recited therein being one dollar, and that F. had, through his negotiations with W., secured the interest which A. had obtained under his contract with <em>W. </em>The portion of the proceeds received by F. was about $50,000. After his decease the executors of A. filed a bill in equity, charging a conspiracy between W. and <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>F. to defraud their testator, and praying that the deed between A. and F. be declared void, and that an account should be taken of the profits received by F., and the same returned to plaintiffs. <em>Held </em>(affirming the court below), that F. could show that the transfer of the stock to him was a gift, and not for the consideration recited in the contract, and that the allegations of fraud contained in the bill, having been specifically denied by the answer of defendant, the burden was on the plaintiffs to show that a gift was not intended by the testator.</p>

A deed of gift of real estate from an aged and infirm person to his intimate friend and medical attendant, was set aside for fraud, one of the circumstances in proof of fraud being that the deed stated, contrary to the proof, a money consideration. It was admitted, upon the hearing of that case, that although the deed recited a consideration of 10001. that no money was paid by the grantee for the property, but that the grantor had furnished 10001. of his own money to support a colorable payment by the grantee. In that case, however, the fact appeared that Gibson had been under insane delusions; this, in the opinion of the vice-chancellor, shifted the burden of proof, and required the defendant to establish first, that when Gibson executed the deed he was of sound mind; secondly, that he was at that time competent to transact such business; and thirdly, that he well understood the whole business, and needed no other advice respecting it than such as he had.</p>

Although it was shown that Mr. Audenreid had greatly failed in bodily health, and a number of witnesses testified that his mind was considerably impaired, the value of this testimony is greatly shaken by the fact, that these witnesses did not hesitate to advise and consult him upon business matters, but transacted important business with and for him during all the time covered by their testimony. This is true of his partner, Mr. Potts, who, in October 1872, renewed his agreement of partnership with Mr. Audenreid; and it is equally true of Mr. Matthews and Mr. Geary, who were his business agents. The great preponderance of the testimony on this point establishes the fact that his mental faculties were in no appreciable degree impaired. We think this is clearly made out by the testimony of his sister, Mrs. Miller, who was his constant attendant; by that of Mr. Krumbhaar, the secretary of the construction company; by Mr. Purves, who transacted important legal business with him in May 1878; by Mr. Gest, who was his legal adviser, whose testimony covers the time extending from April 1872 to June 1875; by Dr. Ludlow, his consulting physician; and by his spiritual adviser, the Rev.

All this the answer asserts was explained to Mr. Audenreid, and that it was after explanation that he approved of and signed the contract.

The reasonable explanation of the generosity of Mr. Audenreid, and his desire to benefit Dr. Eorbes, is, that he felt himself under great obligation to him for important professional services which the doctor had rendered to him, and who also stood in the relation to him of a personal friend. This is to be considered in connection with the fact, that Mr. Audenreid was a gentleman of very large wealth, to whom a gift large in amount as this is would bring no sensible diminution of fortune, and it is also to be borne in mind that he expected to pay it out of the profits which he anticipated he would realize upon his investment in the stock of the construction company.

William Suddards a sealed note for $6000 for “ value received and for his services;” the services wrere of a spiritual character, visits made at the request of Mrs. Greenfield to persons who were objects of her care and solicitude.
