A policy of fire insurance was upon a stock of “general merchandise of all kinds usually kept in a country retail store.” The policy provided against loss by fire to the property specified, “ except as hereinafter provided.” Immediately following this clause was a condition that the company should not be liable unless by special consent in writing endorsed on the policy for any loss where “ turpentine or benzine” were deposited, stored, kept or used, on the premises. Turpentine and benzine were both kept for sale, but no consent had been given therefor. <em>Held, </em>that this was a violation of the condition and avoided the policy.</p>

The prohibitory clause was in the printed portion. The court below instructed the jury that the latter was repugnant to the former and could not be interpreted so as to prevent a recovery if they found that “ turpentine and benzine” were part of all kinds of merchandise usually kept in a country store. <em>Held, </em>to be error.</p>

The policy issued by the Birmingham Ins. Co. contains substantially the same provisions as to benzine, gunpowder, &amp;c., as contained in the policy of the defendant in this case, and the policy was held to be void, it having been shown that Kroegher kept a barrel of petroleum at a time for sale. But the reasoning in that case will not apply to this, for in this case the insurance is expressly, in the written part of the policy, on the stock of general merchandise of all kinds usually kept in a country store, and hence we refuse to charge, as a matter of law, that the defendant is not liable if you find the plaintiffs, or either of them, kept or used these prohibited articles in the store, but submit to you to find whether they were such kinds of merchandise as are usually kept in a country store. If they were, the defendant is liable; at least the fact they or either of them were deposited, stored, kept or used in the store, would not avoid the policy.” * * *</p>

In the last case the insurance was ‘on merchandise such as is usually kept in country stores,’ and the question was submitted to the jury to find whether china, hardware, glassware, &amp;c., were such merchandise as are usually kept in country stores, although it was provided in the policy that it would be void if the assured kept such articles, because they were more hazardous and subjected the insured to higher rates of premium. This principle, it seems to us, decides this case so far as relates to this clause in the policy. It gives to it full force and effect, and also to .the provision that the assured had the right to keep such merchandise as is usually kept in country stores.” * * *</p>

And yet some of the articles known to belong to this classification are unusually hazardous and generally prohibited, and are insured only at special rates. It is a necessity for the protection of insurance companies that they should except out of this general classification inflammable oils and their products. By the exception in this policy, it should read, “ We will insure all such merchandise as is usually kept in country retail stores, except benzine, turpentine, &amp;c.” We admit that if the written part could not take effect at all without nullifying the printed clause, the latter must yield, as if the insurance had been upon “ his stock of benzine and turpentine,” then the printed clause prohibiting the use or storage of those articles must yield, otherwise the contract is of no effect. But here is an insurance upon merchandise, under a general classification ; no particulars mentioned; and the condition is only an exception of certain particularly specified articles coming under that classification, which are prohibited, unless special consent in writing is given. There is no repugnancy, and the whole contract is intelligible. The case is “ on all fours” with Birmingham Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Kroegber, 2 Norris 64, and is sustained by Steinbach <em>v. </em>The Relief Eire Ins. Co., <a href="/us/80/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Wall. 183" data-case-ids="1134228" data-case-paths="/us/80/0183-01">13 Wall. 183</a>. The cases relied upon by the court below, and cited here by the defendant in error, are distinguishable in this, that the articles there prohibited were necessary to the business insured, and not exceptions out of a general classification of a few prohibited articles, which might or might not be carried as stock without detriment to the trade.</p>

The plaintiff in error concedes this well-settled principle as to trade descriptions, but justifies it on the ground of the necessity to support the trade. The same principle rules our case. If the writing insures by describing a trade, the general words in writing include all articles used in that trade, and no exceptions in print will prevail, because repugnant.

Besides this, the policy was originally taken in the name of Lewis S. Lenheim, aud was transferred to the plaintiffs, subject to the conditions therein contained; the usual complaint, therefore, of small print and want of notice does not apply in this case. The contract of the parties, then, is very easy of comprehension. The company agreed to insure for Lenheim &amp; Co., this stock of general merchandise of all kinds usually kept in a country store, excepting certain articles therein specified, among others turpentine and benzine, of which it is said, if these are kept the policy shall be void. The policy was accepted under and subject to these conditions, and it is now produced in order to charge the company. May the defendant plead these conditions or may it not ? There is n.o proof of fraud, by it <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>or its agents, whereby it might be estopped, and the conditions are part and parcel of the consideration of the policy. In consequence of them the plaintiffs obtained their insurance at rates less than they otherwise could have done. The excepted articles are extremely dangerous; there is good reason why they should be so 'excepted, and there is, therefore, nothing unreasonable in the condition that the policy should be forfeited upon the wilful violation of that condition.</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[259,748,1165,258]]]'>But the court below says, “By the written portion of the policy, the insurance was on the general stock of merchandise of all kinds usually kept in a country store.

    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.6",502,[261,1007,1168,559]]]'>Herein, however, is the error in supposing there is any repugnancy between the written and printed parts of the policy. There is certainly no repugnancy in agreeing to insure a general stock of merchandise subject to the condition that gunpowder, petroleum, turpentine and benzine shall not form part of such stock; Surely there is nothing so unusual in reservations and conditions in contracts as to make them the subjects of unusual construction or of extraordinary consideration. Surely, without repugnancy, one may contract for' the sale of a plantation of one hundred acres of land reserving thereout ten acres. Or suppose the contract in controversy to be for the sale of this general stock of merchandise, excepting the articles above mentioned, could any one doubt but that the exception was good ?</p>
    <p id="b502-6" data-blocks='[["BL_502.7",502,[263,1566,1170,516]]]'>This case is as nearly like that of the Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Kroegher, 2 Norris 64, as two cases can be. There, as here, the insurance was upon a general stock of merchandise, but we held that the violation of a condition, which provided that petroleum should not be kept, avoided the policy. In that case all the authorities, now cited by the plaintiffs below, were adduced, and there is nothing now proposed of such a character as to require us to go over the ground anew. We have only to add, that if the plaintiffs’ own evidence was true, they had on hand, at the time of the fire, turpentine enough to avoid the policy. The benzine might, on the principle <em>de minimis, </em>be disregarded, since eight or ten small vials of it was a quantity so trifling as not to be worth attention.</p>
