    <p class="summary" id="b90-13" data-blocks='[["BL_90.15",90,[254,1612,1166,461]]]'>“ A. and B. agree, in consideration of a premium paid by B., that if a certain ship is lost at sea, A. shall pay B. the value of the ship. If B. has no interest in the ship, it is a wagering contract, but if B. has an interest, and will be loser if the ship is wrecked, it is a contract of indemnity and not a wager. So, if two men agree that if coffee rises in price, one of them shall pay a sum of money to the other, it is a wager, if they have no other interest in the coffee than that growing out of the contingency about which they stipulate. But it does not follow that every contract which produces such a result is a wager; the question is one of intention, as deduced from the facts and circumstances.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b90-14" data-blocks='[["BL_90.16",90,[254,2084,1164,343]],["BL_91.1",91,[223,418,1175,868]]]'>“. Let us suppose that A. agrees with B. to buy a thousand bushels of wheat, at $2 per bushel, to be delivered and paid for at the end of thirty days. If wheat rises in value, A. will be a gainer, and if it goes lower he will lose; but inasmuch as the apparent object of the contract is an actual purchase of the wheat, it is not a gaming contract. Nor could such a contract be justly regarded as a wager, although when the time for the delivery of the wheat arrived, it was agreed that B. should, instead of forwarding the wheat <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>to A., pay him the damages to which he would be legally entitled for a refusal to deliver; that is to say, the difference between the stipulated price and the actual value of the wheat at the time fixed for the fulfilment of the contract. Such a settlement of the difference would not, if there was nothing more, be a sufficient ground for inferring that the contract was a gambling contract, or contrary to law. But the case would be materially different if the evidence, taken as a whole, showed that A. and B. did not really intend to buy and sell; that there was no intention on the one hand to deliver, or on the other to receive, the wheat, and that their real purpose was to make a wager in the form of a contract of sale. Hence, if A. and B. were to deal with each other in the way supposed, during a series of months or years, and it appeared in evidence that B. did not, in any single instance, forward the wheat, or have it in readiness for delivery, and that when the time arrived for the fulfilment of these successive contracts, they were always settled by the payment of a sum of money answering to the rise and fall in price, the question would then be one of fact for.the jury, whether the .parties really intended to buy and sell, or to make a wager on the price of grain. v</p>

If the jury find that the transaction was a gambling one on Gabell’s part, and known to be such by Fareira, and that the services and advances Avhich constitute the cause of action were made and rendered in carrying it into effect, their verdict should be for the defendant; and it does not necessarily vary the legal aspect of the case, that some, or the greater number of the persons with whom Fareira dealt, on Gabell’s account, wrere actual buyers and sellers, and did not intend to gamble; although, if such be the fact, it may be taken into view by the jury in determining the true nature of the contract as between Gabell and Fareira.</p>

This may, perhaps, be true as between such a borrower and lender, but I am clearly of opinion that one who should undertake to make a bet or wager for another, and advance the money staked would <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>have no right of action against his principal in the event of loss; and I can see no difference between such a case and that of an agent who renders services and expends money in conducting any other gambling operation.”</p>
