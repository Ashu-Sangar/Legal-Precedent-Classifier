On the back of the bond was a stipulation, that if from any cause, the quantity of land and fencing through the property, required by the location of the road as at present located, should be changed or lessened, that a stated deduction should be made from the face of the bond. In debt upon the bond, the company offered to prove that the land actually taken for their road was materially lessened from the quantity named in a draft annexed to the bond. This evidence was rejected by the court below. <em>Held, </em>that it should have been admitted for the purpose of showing defalcation both as to quantity of land and amount of fencing.</p>

From this point it was intended to run the track along the said P. &amp; R. Railroad to Reading, without again crossing the Schuylkill. This intention was thwarted by the P. &amp; R. Railroad Company, who resisted the engineers of the Wilmington <em>&amp; </em>Reading Railroad Company and prevented them from making a survey and locating the route along their railroad. The W. &amp; R. Railroad thereupon, to wit, on the 3d of October 1871, instituted proceedings in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks county to compel the P. &amp; R. road to desist from interference with the intended location of their road along the left bank of the Schuylkill from High’s land to the city of Reading. The equity proceedings were pending before a master when the bond in question was executed by the defendants. The report of the master in favor of the P. &amp; R.

If the parties had contemplated a lessening of the quantity of land by a change of location they would have used apt words to express that intention. The defendants seek to escape the payment of a large part of the damages by setting up an agreement between them and the Berks County Railroad Company, under which their road was only to be completed to an intermediate point on plaintiff’s land. Can they be relieved from the payment of their bond by showing such secret arrangement ? This would leave the plaintiff without a remedy, for the half of the road for the Berks County Railroad Company is built, and that company is insolvent.</p>

Against this portion there is no provision for defalcation. Nearly one-third of the bond is payable absolutely, though the company should finally occupy little or none of the land then appropriated for their road.</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[268,616,1171,508]]]'>The parties agreed that “ if from any cause the quantity of land and amount of fencing,” required by the location, should be changed or lessened, that a deduction should be made from the face of the bond, at the rate of $300 per acre, and $1.25 per ten feet of fence. It is scarcely possible to express more distinctly, than does the language of their agreement, that they contemplated a future change of location and diminishing the quantity of land. Ingenuity may suggest a doubt, but cannot obscure the natural import of the words. In absence of proof of surroundings at the making of the contract, the large portion of the bond, payable in any event, and the circuitous route, as then located through the farm, call for adherence to the manifest sense of the words in the contract.</p>

When this offer was made, the only evidence before the court was the bond, with the contract endorsed thereon, and the draft thereto annexed. The offer was direct and simple, for the purpose of showing defalcation “both as to quantity of land and amount of fencing,” and ought to have been admitted. That it might be successfully answered and overcome by rebutting evidence, the court did not know, and could not, so as to influence its action, from any matter injected into an objection. Its exclusion was to declare that the agreement meant nothing.</p>

However, it may not be amiss, in view of what was so earnestly pressed, to remark that the defendant will not be held guilty of a conspiracy, or fraudulent arrangement, with the Berks County Railroad Company, to cheat the plaintiff, without proof. Nor, in absence of evidence thereof, will it be presumed “that the Berks County Railroad was occupying the location of the Wilmington and Reading Railroad under some private arrangement between the two companies.” There is no apparent ground for the expressed fears that High has no remedy for damages done by the location of the Berks County Railroad, because of its insolvency.
