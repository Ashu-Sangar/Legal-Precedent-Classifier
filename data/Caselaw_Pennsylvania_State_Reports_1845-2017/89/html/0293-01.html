The personal property being insufficient to pay the debts, the assignee petitioned the Court of Common Pleas for an order to sell the real estate, discharged of liens, under the provisions of the Act of February 17th 1876, which order was made November 17th 1876. Sales were made in pursuance thereof, and the fund arising therefrom was referred to an auditor for distribution. The fund was claimed by O. A. Gernert on a revived judgment, and by the appellant upon two mortgages. It was contended, on behalf of the appellant, that the judgment of revival was not regular, inasmuch as it did not appear that there was any assessment of damages entered in the agreement to revive or upon the judgment index. The docket entries were as follows:</p>

There were no liens between the judgment of Gernert and the mortgages of the association. The fund being insufficient- to satisfy both claimants, the auditor awarded it to the judgment. The association excepted, but the court (Meyers, P. J., of the Third Judicial District), dismissed the exception and confirmed the report in an opinion, inter alia, saying: “The object and purpose of the judgment-dockets are simply notice. It would seem that an entry of revival by am. sci. fa. on the judgment-docket is notice to subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers, whether the amount is liquidated and noted on the docket or not.- ' The only inference that legitimately can be drawn from such an entry of revival without the amount stated (so far as third parties are concerned), based on <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>a written agreement of the defendant, that the judgment, referring to the number and term thereof, shall be revived and continued for another period of five years, is that it is a revival for the entire amount with interest. Between the judgment-creditor and debtor himself, no such inference is necessary as the latter would be at liberty to show at any time that’ the amount of the debt had been reduced. But as against third persons who <em>may </em>become purchasers or encumbrancers such inference seems to be plain and reasonable.”</p>
