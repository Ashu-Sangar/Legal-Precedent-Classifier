There were a number of judgment-liens upon the property sold, the first of which was one of the Wyoming Building and Loan Association for $1000. The second judgment was one in favor of Mrs. Silverbach for $600, and the eighth, tenth and eleventh were in favor of Blood, Barron &amp; Co. and Early &amp; Lane, respectively. The first judgment was given by Schlesinger to the association, on September 29th 1870, to secure the payment of a loan of $1000, made to him by the association, and for the payment of which he at the same time assigned as collateral security, five shares of stock which he held in said association. On the 12th day of March 1877, these five shares of stock were sold as the property of Schlesinger, on a writ of fieri facias to April Term 1877, issued upon a judgment of James S. Barron &amp; Co. to January Term 1877, and two other similar writs to April Term 1877, in favor of judgment-creditors of Schlesinger. The stock was purchased by the attorney who represented the three writs of execution upon which the sale was effected for the sum of $20. The purchase w'as made with the view to give his clients the benefit of the same. The return of sale was made in due form of law by the sheriff, and was entered of record in the ordinary way.</p>

Subsequently this claim on behalf of Schlesinger was repeated in writing, and was based upon the assertion that the sheriff’s sale of the stock on the fieri facias conferred no title upon the purchaser, because Schlesinger had previously assigned it as collateral security. The auditor’s authority to try the validity of the sale in this collateral proceeding was denied. But the counsel representing the purchasers of the stock at the audit, apprehensive that the auditor would suspend the distribution and ask the court to determine the validity of the sale, issued attachment-executions against the stock upon the three judgments on which the fi. fa. had issued and the stock had been sold.

The scope of the act is in terms limited to cases ‘ of stock owned by any individual or individuals,’ &amp;c., ‘ in his or their own names.’ And it is not the exclusive remedy — attachment execution lien also: Weaver <em>v. </em>The Huntingdon Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20314" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Wright 314">14 Wright 314</a>. The stock • in the case under discussion was assigned to the association, as collateral, it is true, but none the less assigned. The assignment would seem to have been duly entered on the transfer book of the association. Indeed, the assignment itself was offered “as a true copy of the original as contained in the transfer book of the association.” The certificate itself was kept in the name of the boiv rower who was entitled to its possession, and no memorandum of the assignment was made on the face of the certificate. But this is immaterial, and would be even as against a purchaser of the certificate of value and without notice: Bank of Commerce Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 59. On the whole facts the auditor is of opinion that the stock did not pass under the sale upon the fieri facias. Whilst in a certain sense the borrower, Schlesinger, owned the stock in his own name, yet this is not the sense intended by the act. In all cases where the stock is subject to a charge or lien, and much more so where the stock has been assigned as collateral, it is essential, in the words of the present chief justice in Weaver <em>v. </em>The Railroad, <em><a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20314" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 Wright 314">supra,</a> </em>to the interest of all parties and to save litigation, ‘ that the proceedings by attachment should be resorted to, and the precise <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>extent and character of the claim of the corporation ascertained before final execution.’ The machinery provided by the second section of the Act of 1819 is wholly insufficient to effect justice in a case like the present, and it is only by a strained construction of the section itself that it can be made to appear applicable at all. The industry of the counsel representing the Silverbach and other judgments has furnished an authority in our own court directly in point.</p>

The auditor finds a judgment in favor of the building association in the sum of $1000. It is the first lien and prima facie entitled to the fund. But the debtor sets 'up the defence of payment, a defence clearly cognizable by an auditor: Borland’s Appeal, 16 P.F. Smith 470. It is immaterial to the building association from which of the two sources, the stock or the judgment, the payment is made to them, if, in point of fact, they realize their debt. And the only objecting creditors, unless the building association can be considered as such, are those who by reason of the position of their several judgments cannot by any possibility take the fund; the whole contention on their behalf being that the fund should be applied to the judgment of the building association so as to free the stock for their benefit. It is urged in support of this position that the association, having two funds to look to, should, in accordance with the equitable rule as to marshalling assets, be compelled to go upon that fund upon which these creditors have only postponed liens, and, in this distribution, liens that as such cannot be reached.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b415-7" data-blocks='[["BL_415.7",415,[192,1394,1172,906]]]'>“ This argument assumes as its premise the existence of liens upon the stock. Suppose for a moment that no such liens exist. "What is there to limit the right of the debtor to have payments on his stock applied to the judgment ? If the association had brought suit he could have treated the payments on stock as payments on the debt. In this case the sale having been made upon another judgment, the debtor does what is practically the same thing, viz., appropriates the payments to the judgment. This is no more ‘ interference with the course of distribution’ than is every attempt to let in a junior by establishing the payment of a senior judgment. The building association must of course be paid in full whatever is owing to it; and the other judgment-creditors cannot complain, for the effect of the election is to increase, not to decrease, the fund for distribution. Nor is this in any sense a case for the invocation of the doctrine as to marshalling assets. The three judgment-creditors, apart from their position as <em>attaching </em>creditors, have no equity above the other lien-holders who are not reached by the fund. And, moreover, the right to use the stock payments in liquidation of the judgment, does not extend to strangers. ‘They,’ says Agnew, Justice, ‘ can require nothing which the parties do not:’ Spring Garden Asso. <em>v. </em>Tradesman’s Loan Asso., <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20493" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="10 Wright 493">10 Wright, 493</a>.</p>

The Act of June 16th 1836, Purd. Dig. 635, pi. 12, provides that the sale of stock upon execution shall be subject to all lawful claims thereupon of such body corporate. The right of the association as against the stock could not be any more affected or prejudiced by a sale of the same on fieri facias in the one instance than in the other. The manifest object of the act was to protect the rights of the person who was the real but not apparent owner of the stock, and preclude the possibility of having it swept away by execution process for the payment of the apparent owner’s debts.</p>
