In a codicil the testator desires his niece to be treated and regarded as if she really was his child, <em>“ </em>receiving during her lifetime such income from my estate as if she really was my child,” and in a second codicil directed that she should take “ out of the income” of his estate all that “ she requires to render her more than comfortable in her housekeeping during her lifetime.” It was contended that by his use of the word “ proceeds” the testator intended that the widow might take both principal and income of his estate if, in her discretion, she deemed it necessary to enable her to live “ as she may think best to promote their happiness and comfort during her lifetime.” Held, that it was impossible to refer the word “ proceeds” to anything but the income; that the testator considered himself throughout the will and codicils as dealing only with the income of the estate, the corpus or principal being vested in the trustees for his ultimate purpose, the charity.</p>

The pi’ecedent payments are thus distinctly referred to the income, and the surplus, still of the income, is to be applied to the purposes of the trust. The capital of the proceeds, given to the trustees absolutely, is not disturbed by any of these appropriations. It is, however, conclusive as to the claim founded upon the use of the word in question, that the power of sale conferred upon the trustees is <em>discretionary, </em>and that until it shall be exercised, there can be no proceeds, whatever meaning may be attributed to the word. The claim, therefore, if valid, would be premature, but it cannot be sustained on other grounds. * * *</p>

J.), in an opinion, inter alia, said: “ In seeking for the intention of the testator, the cardinal principle must be remembered, that it is to be gathered from the entire will, not from detached clauses, sentences, or words, but the whole must be taken together. This is too familiar to need any citation for its support. Upon a careful consideration of the instrument it will first be noticed that testator vests his entire estate, excepting only his ‘ household furniture, books and ornaments,’ in three trustees, and imposes upon them such duties as pertain to an active trust, with ‘ full power to sell any of my property and re-invest the proceeds whenever in their judgment the interest of the trust will be promoted thereby.’ Testator next subjects his estate in the hands of the trustees to the following payments, or, in other words,, declares the following uses and trusts, and first in natural order of the settlement of the estate, to pay the legacies to his household servants, then, out of the income, to pay the annuities to the sisters and nephew of testator, and then so much as his widow may deem necessary for the maintenance of <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>herself and niece, even if her requirements absorb the whole remaining income, leaving none to be applied to the charitable purposes contemplated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b42-6" data-blocks='[["BL_42.6",42,[255,531,1177,1205]]]'>“ It was strenuously contended, on behalf of the widow, that she was entitled to the principal and income of the estate, if, in her discretion, the same were necessary to enable herself and niece to live in such style as she ‘ may think best to promote their happiness and comfort during her lifetime,’ the argument being based upon the use by testator of the word ‘ proceeds ’ in the item of the will directing the payment to his wife. Carried to its logical sequence, this view, if correct, would not only destroy the charity for the orphans of railway employees, but also the annuities to the sisters and nephew of the testator. This certainly was never in the mind of testator, and the auditor was correct in holding that the word ‘proceeds’ was employed by him as synonymous with ‘income.’ This is evident from the language used in other portions of the will. In its first clause testator says the ‘income from which,’ <em>i. e., </em>from his real and personal estate, ‘ should be devoted to the purposes hereinafter mentioned.’ Then follows the purposes to which the income is to be applied, and finally the trustees are ‘ to appropriate the remainder of the net income to the maintenance of the charity.’ And in addition it is to be observed that the only absolute bequest to testator’s wife is of his ‘ household furniture, books and ornaments.’ We therefore conclude it is clear that testator vested his estate, real and personal, in the trustees, in trust, to pay, first, out of the income, the legacies; second, the annuities, and the entire remaining income, if required, to his widow, for the support of herself and niece; third, after the death of the widow to pay to testator’s niece an annuity of $2000 for life; fourth, and to apply the remaining income, if any, to the support of the charity. * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b42-7" data-blocks='[["BL_42.7",42,[256,1738,1170,388]]]'>“ Now, construing together the will and codicils, and harmonizing those provisions which appear to be contradictory and inconsistent, we think the intention of the testator is clear, that the trustees are entitled to the corpus of the estate, in trust, to pay so much of the income remaining after the payment of the legacies and annuities, as the widow during her life may consider necessary for the maintenance and support of herself and niece, and the remaining income, if any, to apply to the purposes of the charity contemplated by testator.</p>

We admit that. ? It is quite plain that the testator intended to give his widow an unlimited discretion to dispose of his residuary estate, and what she did not dispose of he intended should go elsewhere. Possibly he could make such a disposition. Mrs. Thomson’s estate would be a power, which, if unexercised, would leave the bequest over valid. But she does use her power. She claims the whole property. A claim of a legatee’s rights in court is equivalent to a requisition upon trustees for the full amount to which the legatee may he held to be entitled : Irwin <em>v. </em>Earrer, 19 Yes. 86.</p>

Edgar Thomson. It was written by himself without the benefit of legal counsel. It must have such a reasonable construction as to effectuate his whole intention — if that can be done consistently with the rules and policy of the law.’ When near his death, Mr. Thomson added two codicils to his will, which throw strong light upon his meaning. It is conceded that <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>the word “proceeds” is a word of equivocal import. Its construction depends very much upon the context and the subject-matter to which it is applied. If a testator should direct his property to be sold, and the proceeds to be disposed of or distributed in a certain manner, no one could doubt that the whole corpus or principal was intended. But should he order it to be rented or invested, then proceeds would necessarily be limited to the net income, especially if the interest given was for life only. Here, the first provision made by the testator, was a gift and bequest of all his estate, real and personal, to trustees, “the income from which shall be devoted to the purposes ” thereinafter mentioned, with power “to sell any of his property and re-invest the proceeds whenever in the judgment of the trustees the interest of the trust will be promoted.” When, therefore, immediately there follows, the direction that so much of the proceeds of the said property shall be paid to Mrs. Thomson as she may deem “ necessary for the maintenance of herself and his niece, they living in such style as she may think best to promote their happiness and comfort during her lifetime,” it is impossible to refer the word “proceeds” to anything but the income which he had just before devoted to the purposes of his will. After some annuities, he then declares that the trustees shall appropriate the remainder of the net income of his estate, after the payments specified, to a charitable purpose. Mrs. Thomson was to have whatever part of the income she might deem necessary. It was to be ¿ntirely in her discretion to say how much. If any remained, after providing for his special annuities and legacies, it was to go to the ultimate charitable purpose. If his niece should survive his wife, however, there was to be paid to her during life, an annuity of two thousand dollars. This was his plan of disposition of his estate when he made his will.</p>
    <p id="b46-5" data-blocks='[["BL_46.5",46,[212,1678,1167,644]]]'>As he drew near his last end, he became anxious lest he had not made a sufficient provision for his niece. Accordingly, in his first codicil he desires her to be treated and regarded as if she were really his child, “ receiving during her lifetime such income from my estate, as if she were really my child.” Without pausing to inquire what her interest may be under this and the second codicil, which directs that she shall take “out of the income” of his estate all'that “she requires to render her more than comfortable in her housekeeping during her lifetime,” it is enough to say that both these codicils are a strong confirmation of the construction placed upon the will by the court below. It is very clear that the testator considered himself throughout the will and codicils, as dealing only with the income of his estate, the corpus or principal being vested in the trustees for the ultimate purpose, the charity which he had, no doubt, near his heart.</p>
