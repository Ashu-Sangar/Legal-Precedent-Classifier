She first emigrated to the United States and came to this city. After some time she returned to her native land and there was married. In the year 1868, decedent and her husband arrived in this city, with about $200 in money in their possession, with which they began housekeeping in an humble manner, occupying but two rooms in a small dwelling-house. They were industrious and frugal. Decedent went out from her home to work as a dress-maker, and her husband labored at home at his trade as a tailor. They thus lived and labored for about two years. Their savings were deposited by decedent for safe-keeping at the “ Academy of Notre Dame” with the sisters in charge. At the end of this period of time, decedent and her husband had saved and accumulated sufficient money to enable her to purchase the establishment of a French mantua-maker, on Locust street above Twelfth, to which they both removed. Decedent and her husband had cards printed and circulated bearing their joint names; but she managed the dress-making business, while he continued to work for various parties and firms as a tailor and cutter, and when at home assisted his wife by keeping her books of account and making out bills to her customers. About three years prior to decedent’s death, her husband began the habit of indulging to excess <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>in the use of intoxicating liquor. He, although working at his trade, would very frequently return home in an intoxicated condition. He would be seen upon the public streets in this condition, both by day and night; was often brought to his home by a police officer, and upon one occasion was taken to the police-station and fined for drunkenness. At other times he was sober, worked at his trade regularly, gave his wages to his wife, and assisted her in the business carried on by her. Their domestic relations were harmonious, but marred by claimant’s habits of frequent intoxication. Husband and wife attended church, together. She was kind and affectionate towards him and nursed him in sickness. Decedent managed the domestic affairs of her household, provided for its wants, paid the rent, servant’s wages, &amp;c., and during the latter part of her life, at least, if not from the beginning of her married life, she had the control and management of everything connected with the livelihood of herself and husband.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b52-6" data-blocks='[["BL_52.6",52,[263,1092,1160,1072]]]'>In August 1873, she provided him with the funds- necessary for a visit to France, in order to see his relatives, and to bring with him a niece, to learn the trade of a mantua-maker. Decedent after-wards expressed her intention of joining her husband abroad, but never carried out that intention. When he sailed, she with a number of friends accompanied him to the steamer, to witness his departure, and during his absence corresponded with him by letter. He went abroad in August 1873, and during his absence found employment in France. As stated, decedent died in March 1871, after a short illness. Her husband was without the means to immediately return home, but as soon as he was able he came to this city, went to his residence, but was refused admission by his sister-in-law (his wife’s sister), who was in possession of the premises. He after-wards obtained an entrance with the aid of a constable, and, accompanied by his counsel, had an interview with his sister-in-law and the executor of his wife’s will, the present accountant. The husband took no further legal proceedings, so far as appeared from the evidence, but allowed the executor to remain in charge of the assets and property claimed by the latter as the separate property of his testatrix. The executor, however, had full notice of the claim of ownership by the husband; and notwithstanding this fact he entered upon the administration of the estate, incurred expenses, paid collateral inheritance tax and bills presented by parties claiming to be creditors of the decedent. The husband claimed the balance of the fund after the payment of the expenses of the administration.</p>

His indulgence in drink was occasional, not continuous. This case is clearly distinguishable from Black <em>v. </em>Tricker. There the husband repeatedly and for a long period of time, ill-treated and neglected his family, and refused to provide for their support, and the property was acquired after <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>the period of drunkenness and refusal to provide.

He is the only party aggrieved by the surcharge of the collateral inheritance tax, and that exception is not before us.
