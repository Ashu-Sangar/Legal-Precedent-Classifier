      <em>“ </em>I have no doubt of the right of a candidate returned as having received an equal number of votes with another candidate voted for at the same time, or- of others acting in his interest, to contest the election in the same manner and to the same extent as when the opposing candidate is returned as having received a plurality of votes and the' contestant is apparently in the minority. Where there is' a tie vote returned, either party ought to have the right to contest the election. This contingency is not expressly provided for by the Act of Assembly on the subject, but the case is clearly within the spirit of the act, and I have no doubt of the right of either party to proceed under it. If this were not so, then it might happen that the two highest candidates returned as having received an equal number of votes would both be in a worse position than if 'one of them was apparently in-the minority, for both <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>alike would be without remedy for the purpose of showing irregularities in the election, and that the one or the other of them received a plurality of the ballots and was entitled to the office. The act is broad enough to meet the case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="Azs" data-blocks='[["BL_322.6",322,[287,565,1169,289]]]'>“ The contest is to be begun and carried on in the same manner and is to be followed by the same judgment as when one candidate is apparently in the majority and the other in the minority. The object is to determine who has received the highest number of votes legally cast. The court is to investigate, the election, to correct alleged errors when they are shown to exist, and to determine the true result.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b322-7" data-blocks='[["BL_322.7",322,[288,864,1168,560]]]'>“ Upon the presentation of the petition, a day is to be fixed for hearing, notice is to be given to the person whose right of office is contested, and a rule served upon him to appear and answer the complaint. By the Act of 18-39, notice was to be given to the £ person returned.’ The Act of 1874 directs it shall be given to the ‘person whose right of office shall be contested.’ I regard these provisions as the same. The distinction between them is verbal merely. The evident design is to provide for notice to the opposing candidate who may claim the office by virtue of the election in question. The proceeding is by no means ex parte; the hearing is to be after full notice; the declared will of the voters in the choice of the officer is to be ascertained if possible and their verdict at the polls is to be respected and enforced.</p>

The contest is between the candidates voted for; they only can claim the right of office under the election to be investigated. To my mind, it follows clearly and necessarily that the notice in this case should have been given to Mr. Folwell, the opposing candidate, and not to Mr. Barrett, the present prothonotary. Mr. Barrett, it is true, may be indirectly interested, as he will hold the office until his successor shall be duly qualified, but he has no direct interest whatever in the contest, and is in no wise a party to it. Whether it result in favor of the one or the other of the candidates is a matter of no more consequence to him than to any other citizen of the county.</p>

The burden of maintaining a contest that is in no sense his cannot be thrown upon him, nor can he be set up as a respondent to avoid the necessity of notice to the real party in interest. The notice in this case being given to Mr Barrett only, is therefore defective. The rule upon him was improvidently granted; the attention of the court was not called to the fact that he was named in the petition as respondent and the rule asked for upon him. It was granted <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>upon and notice directed to be given to the ‘ opposite party,’ who was assumed to be Mr. Folwell, without examining the concluding part of the petition to see who was named.
