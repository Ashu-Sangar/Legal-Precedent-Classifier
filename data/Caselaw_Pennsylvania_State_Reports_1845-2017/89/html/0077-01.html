The endorsement was proved by Dr. Thomas Hay. The defendant testified that the note in suit was one of a series of notes which he had given for the joint accommodation of plaintiff and Stout; that about August 5th 1876, defendant had given an accommodation note of the-same amount as the one in suit, to the order of plaintiff; that shortly thereafter Stout came to defendant with said note, saying that Hay had said that if Stout would get a note from defendant, drawn to Stout’s order, plaintiff would endorse it, and that Stout and he would endeavor to get it discounted in a bank, in which Hay was director; that defendant then gave the note in suit; that defendant was not indebted to plaintiff, and that Stout was indebted to defendant. In rebuttal Dr. Thomas Hay testified that defendant had admitted his liability on the note in suit after its maturity. Thereupon the defendant was recalled and offered to explain and contradict this alleged admission, but the court rejected the offer.</p>

    <p id="b78-9" data-blocks='[["BL_78.14",78,[218,1063,1177,857]]]'>After the defence closed, the plaintiff called Dr. Thomas Hay, who testified to the defendant’s admissions of indebtedness on the note in suit. That this testimony was pertinent and material is conceded. The defendant offered to rebut it by his own testimony, which was denied. We have examined the bill of exceptions, and fail to find anything to justify overruling the offer. "At an earlier stage in the trial, it certainly was not competent for the defendant ■ to prove that he had not made those admissions to Dr. Hay, even if he could have anticipated what was to come; and the plaintiff, in cross-examining him, did not inquire concerning them. The matter proved by Dr. Hay was not only new when presented, but could not, in the first instance, have been adduced or drawn out by the defendant. Hence, to refuse the rebutting evidence was to allow the damaging proof of the defendant’s admissions of indebtedness to the plaintiff to go to the jury without contradiction or explanation. Had it been competent for the defendant to prove, in chief, what he offered in rebuttal, the court might have refused a re-examination of the witness. As to matters that require explanation, or as to new matter introduced by the opposing interest, a party has a right, in rebuttal, to re-examine his witnesses: Whart. Ev., §572.</p>
